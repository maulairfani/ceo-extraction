Their efforts have helped ensure we continue to perform well as we build A Better Tomorrow TM by reducing the health impact of the business, and, in so doing, creating value for all stakeholders.\n\nMy appointment as Chairman was a great honour. I have enormous respect for the responsibilities that come with the role and I will do my utmost to provide thoughtful leadership to the Board and support for Jack Bowles and his team as we advance BAT's transformation.\n\nThe strong position BAT occupies is a mark of the work done by my predecessor as Chairman, Richard Burrows. During his tenure, Richard did an outstanding job of guiding the Group through challenging times. I want to thank him, on behalf of the Board, for his dedication.\n\nHaving served as a Non-Executive Director prior to my appointment as Chairman, I am fortunate to have worked with many colleagues on the Board for some time. I believe we have a wide-ranging combination of diversity, expertise, experience and knowledge that will help steer BAT through a landscape that is both uncertain and full of opportunities.\n\n- *  As verified by Vertis based on product Life Cycle Assessment data provided by an independent third party, taking into account the Group's purchase of carbon credits through reforestation projects.\n\nBAT has been on its sustainability journey for more than 20 years. Sustainability and ESG are a core part of our long-term business strategy and are ingrained in our identity as a responsible, purpose-led business.\n\n## Enhancing Organisational Culture and Capabilities\n\nThe Board is very encouraged by the progress we have made this year in terms of talent and culture. We have continued to embed our ethos and have strengthened skills in numerous key areas, notably digital capabilities and the supply chain of our New Category products.\n\nOur people have continued to demonstrate resilience and effectiveness in very testing conditions. Their commitment to our transformation has brought tangible improvements to execution across the Group.\n\nJack and his leadership team have developed a very coherent and compelling cultural agenda founded on purpose and responsibility. This has helped unite and inspire colleagues. Our purpose to build A Better Tomorrow TM encapsulates why we exist and what we aspire to accomplish as an organisation.\n\n## Strong ESG Foundations\n\nBAT has been on its sustainability journey for more than 20 years. Sustainability and ESG are a core part of our long-term business strategy and are ingrained in our identity as a responsible, purpose-led business.\n\nWe continue to invest significant resources and energy in our sustainability agenda. BAT has set ambitious targets, including reaching 50 million consumers of its non-combustible products by 2030, and becoming carbon neutral in its operations for Scope 1 and 2 by 2030 and net zero across its wider value chain for Scope 1, 2 and 3 by 2050.\n\nThe performance of our New Category products has propelled the number of non-combustible product consumers to 18.3 million, ensuring we are well on track to meet our 2030 target of 50 million consumers.\n\nOur commitment to delivering carbon neutrality was highlighted earlier this year when Vuse became the first global carbon neutral vape brand * .\n\n## Dividends and Share Buyback\n\nThe Board has declared a dividend of 217.8p per ordinary share, payable in four equal instalments of 54.45p per ordinary share, to shareholders registered on the UK main register or the South Africa branch register and to American Depository Shares (ADS) holders, each on the applicable record dates. The dividends receivable by ADS holders in US dollars will be calculated based on the exchange rate on the applicable payment dates. Further information on dividends can be found on pages 79 and 354.\n\nThe Board has also announced a \u00a32 billion share repurchase programme for 2022, as part of our commitment to enhance shareholder returns.\n\n## Board Composition\n\nKrishnan 'Kandy' Anand will join the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director and member of the Nominations and Remuneration Committees from 14 February 2022. Dr Marion Helmes will step down as a Non-Executive Director from the conclusion of the 2022 Annual General Meeting and will not stand for re-election.\n\n## Looking Forward\n\n2021 was a pivotal year for BAT. Our performance was strong, we are building capabilities, actively managing our portfolio and transforming our culture. We expect 2022 to be a year of further strategic progress and we remain confident that we will meet our mediumterm targets as we continue to build A Better Tomorrow TM .\n\nLuc Jobin\n\nChairman",

We remain fully committed to supporting all our stakeholders throughout the pandemic and have responded rapidly to the evolving situation, taking action to protect their interests.\n\n## Keeping the Group Operating in a Time of Crisis\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the lives of many people around the world, with temporary restrictions and lockdowns across many countries leading to changes in consumer behaviour and in our operating environments.\n\nThe Group continues to navigate the challenges associated with the pandemic with effective crisis management and risk management processes in place, and remains a financially resilient business.\n\nOur Board has maintained close oversight of the Group's response to the impact of COVID-19 throughout this period.\n\nThe Group remains financially robust, @ with the 65% dividend pay-out ratio of long-term earnings maintained. This demonstrates the confidence in the Group's ability to continue to navigate COVID-19 with the associated macro- and socio-economic challenges and uncertainty this international crisis brings. @\n\n## Looking After our People\n\nThroughout the pandemic, we have prioritised the health and wellbeing of our people. We have not furloughed any staff or utilised any government schemes (or subsidies) as a result of the pandemic, other than in respect of the deferral of tax instalment payments, largely in the U.S. in 2020.\n\nWe continue to strictly adhere to guidance from governments and public health authorities, as well as our own health and safety risk assessments, to ensure that our workplaces are COVID-19 secure.\n\nOur digital transformation has enabled us to continue to utilise remote home working when needed, ensuring all employees and customers stay connected, while continuing to invest in the development of new capabilities through virtual training programmes.\n\nIn many parts of the world, including our global headquarters in the UK, we have introduced a hybrid working model as appropriate and as the local regulations allow. We have implemented COVID-19-secure workplace measures for employees who have returned to their workplace. These include regular cleaning and sanitising, temperature checkpoints and COVID-19 testing.\n\nFor all employees, we are also making sure they are aware of the extensive wellbeing support available to them, including:\n\n- - Online medical consultations;\n- - Counselling services; and\n- - Mental health support.\n\n## Vaccine Development\n\nIn December of 2020 an initial New Drug Application for our COVID candidate vaccine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and we progressed into a Phase 1 study. This study has now been fully recruited and remains ongoing. We expect data to be available during Q1 of 2022 and will determine next steps based on these data, but also the rapidly evolving COVID-19 and treatment landscape.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing clinical studies, further pre-clinical work was also completed which reinforced the potential of the plantbased platform. The team successfully produced 19 different monoclonal antibodies that met pharmaceutical requirements in about 10 days, demonstrating the flexibility, consistency and speed of the plant-based system to produce clinical-quality antibodies.\n\nTo accelerate the research, development and production of novel treatments, BAT launched KBio Holdings Limited (KBio) in January 2022. The company has been created to leverage the existing and extensive plant-based technology capabilities of BAT and Kentucky BioProcessing Inc (KBP), the existing BATowned U.S. plant biologics organisation.\n\n## Testing and Logistical Support\n\nThe forms of direct support we have deployed to address the global impact of COVID-19 have continued to evolve. We have:\n\n- - Provided personal protective equipment and other essential items to communities in which we operate;\n- - Loaned testing equipment to the UK Government;\n- - Provided access to 3D printers to help produce protective face shields; and\n- - Donated to many funds around the world focusing on supporting local COVID-19 responses.\n\n## Supporting our Suppliers and Communities\n\nProtecting the communities where we operate is an important pillar of our response to the pandemic.\n\nWe have harnessed our strengths in science, engineering and logistics to support national responses to COVID-19.\n\nWe have distributed thousands of\n\nitems of PPE, sanitation kits, food and other essential items to our contracted farmers and their communities. We have also leveraged our existing farmer communication channels, including mobile apps, web portals, local media spots, videos and fact sheets, to rapidly deploy essential COVID-19 information, often to remote rural communities.\n\nSome tobacco growing communities may be particularly vulnerable to both the virus and the economic implications of a global pandemic. We are taking great care that we don't increase the immediate vulnerability of these communities and are committed to supporting them during the inevitable economic recovery that will follow.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At constant rates of exchange, the Group revenue increased 6.9%.\n\nCurrency headwinds also impacted profit from operations, increasing by 2.7% to \u00a310,234 million with diluted earnings per share up 6.0%.\n\nExcluding adjusting items and the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted profit from operations, at constant rates of exchange, grew by 5.2% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 6.6%.\n\nReported operating margin grew by 120 bps to 39.8%. On an adjusted basis, it fell by 70 bps at current rates.\n\nWe have continued to demonstrate the ongoing strength of the Group in turning operating performance into cash @ with operating cash conversion of 104% (partly due to the structural excise changes in Australia), ahead of our target of at least 90%, being a key contributor in delivering our deleveraging ambitions @ .\n\n- ^  Based upon Category Contribution - defined as profit from the sale of brands after directly attributable costs (including marketing expenses) and before the allocation of overheads\n\n## Delivering a Step Change in New Categories\n\nFundamental to building A Better Tomorrow TM is the acceleration of our transformation and investing to provide our consumers with enjoyable, less risky *\u2020 products.\n\nWe encourage those consumers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch completely to scientificallysubstantiated, reduced-risk alternatives *\u2020 .\n\nEach of our New Category brands grew revenue by more than 30%, with total New Categories revenue up 42.4% to \u00a32,054 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted revenue from New Categories, at constant rates of exchange, grew 50.9%.\n\nThe performance of our reduced-risk *\u2020 portfolio of New Category products, encompassing our strong global brands, Vuse, glo and Velo, places us on track to reach the targets we set ourselves of:\n\n- - \u00a35 billion of revenue and profitability in our New Categories by 2025; and\n- - 50 million consumers of non-combustible products by 2030.\n\n## Driving Value from Combustibles\n\nThe continued performance of our combustibles business will generate the funds necessary to invest in New Categories and transform the business.\n\nGroup cigarette value share increased by 10 bps compared with 2020, driven by the continued positive performance of the strategic cigarette brands in the U.S. (up 80 bps).\n\nGroup cigarette volume share fell 10 bps. Pricing continued to be strong, with combustibles price/mix of 4.3%.\n\nGroup cigarette volume was largely in line with 2020, down just 0.1% to 637 bn sticks, (with the industry estimated to be broadly in line with 2020), driven by our performance in emerging markets and partly due to trade inventory movements in the U.S. (mainly linked to the timing of price increases and uncertainty about a potential excise increase) which are expected to unwind in early 2022.\n\nOur strategy has a clear focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) priorities, including addressing climate change and excellence in environmental management, delivering a positive social impact and ensuring robust corporate governance.\n\nWe performed strongly across our key indicators during the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nEach of our New Category brands grew revenue by more than 30%, with total New Categories revenue up 42.4% to \u00a32,054 million.\n\nGroup cigarette value share increased by 10 bps compared with 2020, driven by the continued positive performance of the strategic cigarette brands in the U.S. (up 80 bps).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- @ Denotes phrase, paragraph or similar that does not form part of BAT's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

This has allowed us to continue to reward shareholders with higher dividends and announce a \u00a32 billion share repurchase programme. We believe we are well placed to maximise our future potential.\n\n## Group Transformation Underpinned by Financial Delivery\n\n2021 was a pivotal year in our transformational journey. We have delivered a step change in New Categories, reconfigured our business capabilities for the future, delivered value through combustibles and deleveraged the balance sheet. We believe these achievements position us well for the future, and have allowed us to deliver growth in our key financial indicators (excluding translational foreign exchange impacts) in the year.\n\n## Pricing and New Categories Drive Revenue Growth\n\nRevenue declined 0.4% to \u00a325,684 million compared to 2020 (while 2020 was marginally lower than 2019, down 0.4% to \u00a325,776 million).\n\nRevenue from New Categories was up 42.4% in 2021 and 14.9% in 2020, while combustibles pricing remained strong (particularly in the U.S.), with Group price/mix of 4.3% in 2021 compared to 7% in 2020. Price/mix was lower largely due to negative geographic mix as markets began to recover from the impact of COVID-19, the impact of structural excise changes and a competitive environment in Australasia (estimated at \u00a3260 million) and the disposal of the Group's operations in Iran. These were partly offset by the benefit of trade inventory movements in the U.S. (the impact of which is estimated to be \u00a3200 million and expected to unwind in 2022). A translational currency headwind, due to the relative strength of sterling, negatively impacted both periods, by approximately 7.3% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2020.\n\nOn a constant currency basis, revenue was up 6.9% in 2021 and 3.3% in 2020, with 2020 also negatively impacted by COVID-19 (approximately 2.5%) due to the disruption and restrictions affecting certain markets (including South Africa and in Global Travel Retail).\n\n## Growth in Profit from Operations While Investing in New Categories\n\nProfit from operations increased by 2.7% to \u00a310,234 million, with 2020 up 10.5% to \u00a39,962 million. Revenue growth, a reduction in losses from New Categories and operational efficiencies achieved under the Group's restructuring programme (Project Quantum) were partly outweighed by the translational foreign exchange headwinds and a transactional foreign exchange headwind of 1.7%. 2021 included a number of one-off items, including in respect of the disposal of the Group's subsidiary in Iran (\u00a3358 million related to foreign exchange losses and asset write-off costs), an impairment charge of \u00a354 million in Peru and a combined credit in the U.S. of \u00a394 million (related to the partial buy-out of the pension fund and the finalisation of the dissenting shareholders litigation). However, these were lower than those recognised in 2020 in respect of goodwill impairment (\u00a3209 million largely related to Malaysia) and charges in the U.S. (\u00a3400 million) largely related to the state settlement agreements in respect of brands sold to a third party in a prior period.\n\nOur operating margin was 120 bps higher at 39.8% in 2021 (2020: up 380 bps to 38.6%).\n\nOn an adjusted constant currency basis, profit from operations grew by 5.2% (2020: up 4.8%). This was driven by higher revenue and efficiencies delivered in both 2021 and 2020 as part of Project Quantum @ (which increased its delivery expectations from \u00a31 billion to \u00a31.5 billion) @ and lower losses from New Categories. Adjusted operating margin (at current rates) fell 70 bps to 43.4% (2020: up 100 bps to 44.1%), partly due to the proportionate growth in New Categories revenue (with the Group continuing to invest in those categories), higher revenue in lower margin markets and a transactional foreign exchange headwind of 1.7%.",

This has allowed the Group to continue to reward shareholders with growth in dividends and announce a \u00a32 billion share repurchase programme all while investing in A Better Tomorrow TM .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. A credit rating may be subject to withdrawal or revision at any time. Each rating should be evaluated separately of any other rating.\n- @ Denotes phrase, paragraph or similar that does not form part of BAT's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\n## Future Funding De-Risked Through Proactive Action\n\nOur liquidity profile remains strong, with average debt maturity close to 10 years and maximum debt maturities in any one calendar year of around \u00a34 billion.\n\nIn September 2021, the Group issued perpetual hybrid bonds totalling \u20ac2 billion. These euro-denominated securities contribute to a more efficient alignment of the Group's earnings currency. They also contribute to the diversification of the Group's sources of funding and further strengthens its capital structure. The issuance provides the additional benefit of supporting the deleveraging journey with the addition of a small benefit to the credit metrics. @ Our medium-term rating target remains BBB+/Baa1, with a current rating of BBB+/Baa2 @ *.\n\nNet finance costs in 2021 were \u00a31,486 million, a decrease of 14.8% on 2020 (\u00a31,745 million, itself an increase of 8.9%). The reduction in 2021 was partly driven by a foreign exchange tailwind. However, 2020 included net charges of \u00a3142 million in respect of the early redemption and tender offer in that year as the Group reduced future refinancing risk by raising \u00a38.9 billion in the US dollar, euro and sterling markets, using the proceeds to repurchase and redeem \u00a33.1 billion of bonds. This de-risked the future repayment profile by securing lower interest rates and future liquidity in uncertain times. On an adjusted, constant rate basis, net finance costs declined 4.5% in 2021 (2020: up 5.9%).\n\nAs part of the Group's de-risking of future funding, during 2020 gross interest cover ceased to be a covenant in the Group's debt facilities.\n\n## EPS Growth Underpins Dividend Increase\n\nOn a reported basis, basic EPS was up 6.0% at 296.9p (2020: up 12.1% at 280.0p) with diluted EPS up 6.0% to 295.6p (2020: up 12.0% to 278.9p), largely due to the net reduction in adjusting charges in 2021 and lower net finance costs, which more than offset the impact of foreign exchange on the Group's operations.\n\nExcluding the adjusting items (discussed on pages 76 and 77) and the effect of foreign exchange on the Group's results, adjusted diluted earnings per share, at constant rates, increased by 6.6% to 353.5p, with 2020 ahead of 2019 by 5.5%.\n\n## Cash Generation Drives Debt Deleveraging\n\nWe continue to focus on a balanced approach of deleveraging, while investing for the future and providing a return via dividends to shareholders.\n\nThe Group's cash conversion ratio, based upon net cash generated from operations, was 95% (2020: 98%) @ and the operating cash conversion ratio was 104% (2020: 103%) @ . The Group realised \u00a39.7 billion (2020: \u00a39.8 billion) of net cash generated from operating activities, @ or \u00a32.5 billion (2020: \u00a32.6 billion) of free cash flow after dividends - which is a measure the Group uses to assess total cash generated by the Group with which to repay borrowings. @\n\nConsequently, in 2021, total borrowings (including lease liabilities) have reduced from \u00a343,968 million in 2020 to \u00a339,658 million in 2021, due to the net repayment of borrowings in the year (including refinancing via issuance of perpetual hybrid bonds) and a currency tailwind of \u00a3409 million (2020: tailwind of \u00a3219 million). @ We continued to deleverage our balance sheet with adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio improved from 3.3 times to 3.0 times. @\n\n## Active Capital Allocation Framework\n\nOur deleverage and cash flow generation provide the flexibility to adopt a more active capital allocation framework to deliver longterm value for shareholders.\n\nThis will include:\n\n- - continuing to grow the dividend;\n- - maintaining our target leverage corridor @ of 2-3x adjusted net debt / adjusted EBITDA @ ;\n- - potential bolt-on M&A opportunities; and\n- - share buybacks to enhance shareholder returns.\n\nThe Board will prioritise capital allocation opportunities each year in-line with this new longer-term active capital allocation framework, while continuing to take into account macro and fiscal influences, and potential regulatory and litigation outcomes.\n\nAs a first step, we have announced a dividend increase of 1.0% to 217.8p (with a dividend pay-out ratio of 66.2%) and a \u00a32 billion share repurchase programme for 2022.\n\n## Tadeu Marroco\n\nFinance and Transformation Director",

Reducing the health impact of our business, by encouraging those smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke to switch completely to scientifically-substantiated, reduced-risk alternatives *\u2020 , is the greatest contribution we can make to society. This means growing our New Categories business as fast as possible and developing opportunities Beyond Nicotine to consolidate our position as a high growth, multi-category consumer products company.\n\nRevenue growth in the global nicotine industry is accelerating through the development of New Categories, which offer reduced-risk alternatives to combustible products. *\u2020\n\nTo capitalise on this growth, our established consumer-centric, multicategory strategy is activated on a global scale, leveraging our insights on consumer satisfaction, innovation needs and taste. We are building strong global brands, specifically positioned in each target consumer segment. In addition, we are taking a disciplined approach to our Beyond Nicotine strategy to further drive our transformation and long-term business sustainability.\n\nWe have set ourselves ambitious targets to reach 50 million consumers of our non-combustible products by 2030, with revenue reaching \u00a35 billion (and profitability) from New Categories by 2025. These ambitions will be met through the delivery of our three clear strategic priorities:\n\n- - to drive a step change in New Categories, to accelerate growth supported by increased investment;\n- -  to generate value through Combustibles, to provide the capabilities and funding; and\n- - to simplify the Group, to create a stronger, faster, more agile organisation.\n- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking.

Key to this is encouraging adult smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke, to switch completely to scientifically-substantiated, reducedrisk alternatives *\u2020 .\n\nFor harm reduction to be effective, alternatives are needed that deliver comparable satisfaction in nicotine delivery, use, and sensorial aspects. To enable consumer choice, we have three New Category alternatives available - vapour products, tobacco heating products and modern oral products - backed by worldclass science.\n\n## Assessing the Reduced-Risk Potential of our Products * \u2020\n\nTo achieve tobacco harm reduction, reduced-risk assessments need to be supported by robust science. That's why we created our leading scientific research programme - and openly share its findings.\n\nMost non-combustible products remain relatively new to the market. This means they lack the epidemiological data required to establish harm reduction potential over decades of use. It's necessary to take a weight-of-evidence approach, based on the emissions, exposure and risk levels of each product. Our rigorous, peer-reviewed, scientific assessment framework follows nine steps.\n\n## World-Class Science for A Better Tomorrow TM\n\nFor more than 60 years, research and development has been a critical part of our business. The table to the right highlights how we aim to create A Better Tomorrow TM through worldclass science. We invest in R&D to deliver innovations that satisfy or anticipate consumer preferences.

Our markets are shaped by long-term consumer, economic, cultural and social trends, as well as the regulatory environment. Generational differences and shifts in taste are continuing to emerge, as health and wellness become ever-more important. We continue to respond to this changing environment by advancing our strategy and long-term priorities.\n\n## Megatrend: Product Innovation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consumer Expectations\n\nIt is widely accepted that most of the harm associated with tobacco is caused by inhaling the smoke produced by its combustion - not by nicotine.\n\nAround the world, adult consumers are increasingly driven by health considerations, looking for products and experiences more tailored to their lifestyle.\n\nAs part of this, they are seeking new options that pleasurably provide nicotine but with reduced risk *\u2020 including new and potentially unfamiliar delivery formats such as patches and pouches.\n\n## Scientific Evidence\n\nThere is wide agreement among many policymakers and bodies within the public health community on the need for a wide and robust science, to which we are keen to contribute, to inform policy and educate consumers about reduced-risk products. *\u2020\n\nConsumers must have access to clear, factual information so they are aware of all of their options and to help build trust in reduced-risk products. *\u2020 Rigorous science can establish whether products are safer or less risky compared with smoking cigarettes.\n\n## Regulatory and Policy Regimes\n\nScience increasingly points to the likely individual and public health benefit of reduced-risk products as an alternative to smoking. *\u2020\n\nFor these products to realise their potential, they must be supported by effective regulatory and policy regimes that enable responsibly-managed growth and promote informed consumer choice.\n\nMegatrend:\n\n## Climate Change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Impacts on Biodiversity\n\nThere is increasing awareness of the interconnectivity between climate change and biodiversity. The threats posed by climate change, including longer periods of drought and more extreme heat, are directly linked to a second challenge: biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation.\n\nHowever, biodiversity, through its support of ecosystem services, also makes an important contribution to both climate-change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nAs a business, we recognise that we have both an impact and a dependence on biodiversity, through our business operations and use of ecosystem services, such as forest products, soil and water. We have a long-standing commitment to protecting biodiversity, including the prevention of deforestation and fragmentation of habitats.\n\n## Agriculture\n\nCrops such as tobacco need suitable soil, water, sunlight and heat to grow. In some areas, climate change may benefit the types of crops that are typically planted there or allow farmers to shift to crops that are currently grown in warmer areas. Conversely, more extreme temperatures and weather events, especially floods and droughts, can harm crops and reduce yields.\n\nSubstantial investments in adaptation of farming practices and the adoption of new methods will be required to offset yield losses. Examples might include crop rotation to match water availability, adjusting sowing dates to rainfall and temperature patterns and using crop varieties suited to changed conditions.\n\n## Megatrend: Technological Progress\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Internet of Things\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) - an ecosystem of smart devices that work together and are connected 24/7- is changing the way people consume news, make connections and shop. By 2025, over 40 billion devices are expected to be connected to the IoT.\n\nE-commerce platforms, available on the move, have led the established social platforms to adapt their business models to leverage social commerce, enabling retailers to extend their reach and build brand awareness and loyalty.\n\n## Post-pandemic Realities\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated the shift towards a more digital world and led to changes in the way we live. These changes include online shopping behaviours and shift in the way people work that are likely to have lasting effects.\n\nConvenience of choice and delivery and the savings that easy comparison can offer have boosted online shopping since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nWhile physical stores have gradually reopened, this trend will continue as the benefits of e-commerce to buyers and sellers become even more widespread and are adopted by new businesses and product types. Companies which invest in their online business are likely to emerge as market leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, many businesses around the world are having to deal with the 'hybrid' in-person/remote work model that has the potential to become the new normal in many workplaces.",

        "page_content": "## Overview\n\nToday, the tobacco and nicotine market serves a growing base of more than one billion adult consumers. Generational differences and shifts in taste are continuing to emerge, as health and wellness become ever-more important. We anticipate growth in new categories of products, including - and beyond tobacco and nicotine. Consumers expect these to provide stimulation and pleasure, in ways previously associated with combustible products. We believe such growth will offset the predicted decline in cigarette consumption.\n\n## Global Combustible Market\n\nThe most recent sales data for the legal global tobacco market (2020) indicate it was worth approximately US$850 billion.\n\nThe largest global tobacco category remains combustible cigarettes. With over 2,790 billion cigarettes consumed annually (excl. China), it is valued at US$484 billion in 2020. Over 19% of the world's adult population (incl. China) still chooses to smoke and will likely continue to do so unless offered suitable alternatives.\n\nHowever, excluding China, the global cigarette market experienced a 4.2% volume decline in 2020 vs 2019. This is largely due to increased regulation and changing societal attitudes to smoking.\n\n## The illicit market\n\nA further reason for the decline of legal tobacco volumes is the continued rise in illicit product consumption. While global (excl. China) illicit cigarette penetration declined from 11.9% in 2019 to 11.7% in 2020 as border closures and mobility restrictions resulting from the pandemic hindered consumer access to black market products, analysts expect illicit volume growth to return in several markets as travel measures ease, pressures on disposable income grow and governments raise excise.\n\nPrice differentials between markets, regulatory changes and broader macroeconomic pressures have the potential to further exacerbate the problem.\n\nIt is generally accepted that there is a direct correlation between steep or ad hoc increases in taxes and illicit sales. The current sanctions in many countries often fail to deter criminals in search of profit.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 92 to 97 to read more about our Principal Group Risks\n\nFor further discussion regarding the regulation of our business, please see pages 340 to 344\n\n## Global combustible regulation\n\nAs one of the world's most regulated and taxed industries, tobacco contributes billions of dollars to government treasuries annually.\n\nManufacturers are subject to wide-ranging regulation, varying considerably from market to market.\n\nOver the years, legislators have largely focused on the introduction of plain packaging, product-specific regulations, graphic health warnings on packs, tougher restrictions on smoking in enclosed public places and bans on shops displaying tobacco products at the point of sale.\n\nThey have also begun considering and adopting regulations aimed at menthol flavourings.\n\nEnvironmental concerns resulting from litter associated with cigarette consumption have led to an increased number of policy initiatives, with the EU leading the way with its Single-Use Plastic legislation.\n\n## Impact of COVID-19\n\nBeyond disruption to supply chains, the short-term impact of COVID-19 on the tobacco industry is likely to be relatively limited.\n\nThe impact on volumes is expected to be felt unequally across geographies, with resilience seen in more developed markets while developing markets experience potentially greater numbers of consumers turning to the illicit market. A case in point is the U.S., where, although the general trend is a gradual decline in annual volumes, the Federal Trade Commission, in its annual Cigarette Report, said that manufacturers sold 203.7 billion cigarettes in 2020, up from 202.9 billion in 2019 - an increase of 0.4%.\n\nProduction of the principal raw material - tobacco leaf - remains broadly diversified across a number of continents. The industry has proven adept at dealing with supply-side shocks.\n\n## Global New Categories Market\n\nOver recent years, innovation in the tobacco and nicotine marketplace has developed new nicotine products that do not involve the combustion of tobacco leaf and the inhalation of smoke. These growing smokefree categories include vapour products, tobacco heating products (THP) and modern oral nicotine pouches.\n\nThe success of these New Categories in offering viable alternatives to displace the use of cigarettes is based on many factors. One is their ability to offer consumers satisfaction in circumstances where using combustible tobacco is no longer permitted or socially acceptable.\n\nAnother is their ability to offer a less risky but fulfilling alternative to cigarettes.\n\nThere is also a growing focus on leading a healthier, personalised lifestyle among the new generation of adult consumers. This, in addition to technological innovation, is expected to further accelerate the growth of new categories, as these products better meet evolving preferences and demands.\n\nEvidence of this shift can be seen in global revenues from vapour and THPs, with both currently standing at around US$21 billion, an increase from 2019 of US$0.8 billion and US$5.8 billion, respectively.\n\nTraditional oral products show steady, incremental growth. Meanwhile, growing sales of Modern Oral nicotine pouches registered an accelerated volume expansion especially in established oral tobacco markets such as the U.S. and Scandinavia. With a global value of US$1.2 billion in 2020, the category is projected to expand to over US$6 billion by 2025.\n\n## New Categories Regulations\n\nAt a global level, the THP and vapour markets are still emerging. Regulation is growing alongside the growth in the categories, but perception and attitudes towards these products have been mixed and regulation is often not designed around their characteristics and potential for risk reduction. * \u2020\n\nWhereas some regulators, including those in the UK and New Zealand, aim to encourage their use as less risky alternatives to cigarettes, while being mindful of the risks of youth usage, other governments view them with greater scepticism, with some imposing bans\n\n## Beyond Nicotine\n\nThe emerging and rapidly growing market for well-being and 'new active' products is expected to continue to grow as the consumer trend towards bespoke lifestyles evolves. One such market, cannabidiol (CBD), is expected to gain wider use, as evidenced by its recent growth in market size and certain governments, such as that of Germany, considering the legalisation of its recreational use.\n\n- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking.

Quantum is our ongoing simplification programme that is fuelling New Category investment and delivery against our financial guidance.\n\nThe first phase of Quantum delivered a large-scale organisational change and the journey continued in 2020 and 2021. This has enabled us to remain agile in a fast-paced and ever-changing environment.\n\nThe effects of the global pandemic have demonstrated the importance of retaining simplification at the heart of our agenda.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to realise benefits from Quantum, generating more than \u00a3595 million of savings in the year. These benefits came through various simplification initiatives:\n\n- - In our UK Headquarters, we have implemented a new organisational design. This has been key to ensuring decision-making where the knowledge sits and seizing the opportunities from synergies and integration.\n- - In our markets, we have assessed and streamlined our footprint through an Operating Model review. This optimisation of our footprint is expected to deliver more than \u00a3100 million of annualised savings, enabling a sharper focus on New Categories.\n- - Our initiatives addressing both our Centre and End Markets are underpinned by our BAT Digital Business Services* (DBS) transformation and enabled by Technology & Digital simplification.\n- - In 2021, our DBS organisation has built new capabilities in consumer, customer, and Business Intelligence areas. Simultaneously, within our existing capabilities, DBS delivered optimisations to drive excellence and efficiency.\n\nWe are continuing our Technology & Digital transformation with a focus on automation and data-driven optimisation. In the past year, we have saved more than 100,000 hours in total, ensuring undisrupted delivery of our commitments. Technology & Digital will continue to underpin our simplification journey.\n\nWe have delivered our \u00a31 billion savings commitment from Quantum 12 months earlier than planned. @ As a result, we have increased our target to \u00a31.5 billion gross savings over three years (2020-2022). We are therefore well on track to deliver the target \u00a31.5 billion saving commitment from Quantum by 2022. @\n\nAll the elements which underpin our simplification agenda will sharpen the focus on core capabilities critical for delivering our A Better Tomorrow\u2122 strategy while enabling us to fuel the growth in New Categories to become a stronger, simpler and faster organisation.\n\n- @  Denotes phrase, paragraph or similar that does not form part of BAT's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n- *  Prior to 2021, Digital Business Services was called Global Shared Services.",

This resulted in a global portfolio of 57 programmes all delivered 100% virtually, while providing online learning tools to all managers and global graduates enabling anytime anywhere access to learning and development support from both internal and external experts. We have also implemented a transformational leadership assessment across all management helping our people to develop qualities required that are bigger, broader, more complex and challenging. We have recruited more than 1,300 new people in 2021 to further accelerate our transformation.\n\nOur dedicated focus on Diversity & Inclusion also led to an industry-first National Equality Standard (NES) and Global Equality Standard (GES) certification. This is a reflection of our focus on our D&I strategy and of our inclusive culture and practices.\n\n## Shaping Sustainability continues to put sustainability front and centre of everything we do\n\nIn 2021, Vuse became the first global carbon neutral vape brand*, demonstrating our commitment to carbon neutrality and to reducing our impact on the environment. Vuse Solo became the first vaping product to receive marketing granted orders from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which confirms that the marketing of Vuse Solo products is appropriate for the protection of the public health and is evidence of our robust, world-class science.\n\nWe are building awareness and confidence in the science that underpins our New Category products, engaging with external stakeholders (including regulators) to ensure these new products can help build A Better Tomorrow TM . In 2021, we also accelerated our targets, including to have 100% of operations sites be zero waste to landfill by 2025; and to be net zero across our value chain by 2050. We are proud that our ESG efforts continue to be recognised externally.\n\n## Technology & Digital is creating new channels to connect with our consumers and enabling the simplification of our organisation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThrough digital marketing initiatives, our e-commerce footprint is developing quickly, with consumer subscription programmes growing in priority New Category markets, enabling us to provide a more personalised experience for our consumers.

This is supported by a wealth of global reviews, studies and reports.\n\nIn the UK, for example, Public Health England ** issued a series of expert reviews of the latest evidence, concluding: 'based on current knowledge, vaping is at least 95% less harmful than smoking'. According to the UK's Office for National Statistics, vaping now stands at 6.3% of the population, and smoking levels have dropped to 14.1%, from 23% in 2012, which means the UK has one of the lowest smoking incidences in Europe.\n\nIn 2021, we published a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence for vaping products, their potential health effects, and their role in tobacco harm reduction. This is a summary of more than 300 peer-reviewed scientific papers and other evidence published by around 50 institutions over the past decade.\n\nAccording to adult population modelling studies cited in the review, a significant reduction in premature deaths could be achieved if current smokers switched exclusively to vaping rather than continuing to smoke cigarettes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking.\n\nPublic Health England ** 2015\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30\n\nNumber of markets where the Group's vapour products are sold\n\n## Vapour Top 5 markets\n\nU.S., UK, France, Germany and Canada.\n\n- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking.

We are very proud that Vuse has been independently certified by Vertis as the first global carbon neutral ^ vapour brand. We have removed all unnecessary single use plastics from our Vuse packaging and implemented Device Take Back schemes in all our vapour markets - examples of our many projects aimed at making Vuse one of the most sustainable and trusted vaping brand worldwide with a clear consumer-led purpose.\n\n## Regulation and PMTA\n\nThe future of tobacco harm reduction has always depended on robust science, and ensuring that this is accessible to audiences outside the scientific community is critical. This need is growing stronger than ever - with a number of cases of acute lung diseases (referred to as EVALI) reported among vapers in the U.S. in 2019, consumers want to be clear on the risk profile of these products. In addition, consumer perceptions of nicotine are evolving with many consumers over-estimating the risks associated with nicotine generally.\n\nThis also demonstrates the importance of having, and enforcing, a robust and effective regulatory framework that ensures high product standards and prevents access and appeal to youth - things we have long advocated. Robust science has to be at the centre of any regulatory development and engagement.\n\nWe are fully committed to working in a regulated market, where adult consumers can be confident that marketed tobacco products are appropriate for the protection of the public health and underpinned by science. This approach is underscored by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) process.\n\nPMTAs are based on a summary of all research findings to demonstrate that the marketing of a product meets the FDA's criteria as 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'.\n\nIn October 2021, Vuse Solo received the first of its kind FDA marketing authorisation for vapour products in Original flavour. This confirmed that the marketing of Vuse Solo products is appropriate for the protection of the public health, the culmination of years of scientific study and research. The Vuse Alto PMTA, which was submitted nearly a year after Vuse Solo, shares the same foundational science. We are confident in the quality of our applications.\n\nWe support efforts by the FDA to both address the increasing availability of flavoured synthetic nicotine products and enhance enforcement actions against flavoured disposable vapour products. The FDA is under increased scrutiny from Congress to act against these types of products, including clarifying the regulatory framework within which such products should be regulated and enforced, which we believe is likely to lead to substantive action by the FDA.\n\n## Performance Summary\n\nVapour continued its strong momentum driven by Vuse. Total volume of consumables was up 56% to 535 million units, having grown 52% (to 344 million units) in 2020. Combined with consumable pricing across all T5 markets, this drove revenue up 52% to \u00a3927 million, or 59% at constant rates of exchange, with 2020 up 52% to \u00a3611 million (or an increase of 53% at 2019 rates of exchange).\n\nIn 2021, Vuse achieved global vapour value share leadership (in July 2021) with a full year value share of 33.5% (up 780 bps vs 2020). Vuse is now at or approaching value share leadership in all T5 markets. We consolidated our volume share leadership of devices in all T5 markets, driven by industry leading consumer acquisition up 1.8 million to 8.4 million consumers.\n\nIn the U.S., we are approaching vapour value leadership, driven by Vuse Alto, with total vapour value share for the year up 760 bps to 32.5%, maintaining the momentum of 2020 which was up from 16.6% in 2019. Vuse consumables volume grew 67% in 2021, having grown 70% (to 174 million units) in 2020, outperforming the total vapour industry in both years (up 21% in 2021 and down 13% in 2020). In 2020, the industry in the U.S. was impacted by the EVALI crisis in 2019 and implementation of flavour regulations in early 2020. We retained leadership (by volume) of closed system devices, with growth of 500 bps to 57.4% compared to 2020.\n\nWe performed well in 2021 and 2020 in the other top vapour markets, and extended our leadership positions, with all T5 Vype migrations to Vuse completed during the year. Specifically:\n\n- - in the UK, total vapour value share of the category was 31%, compared to 36% in 2020. Vuse performed well, with value share up 210 bps to 16.9% driven by both ePen 3 and ePod;\n- - in France, vapour value share reached 45.7% in 2021, an increase of 14.2 ppts (versus 2020), driven by ePen 3 and ePod;\n- - in Canada, having gained value share leadership in 2020, we continued to grow, with total vapour value share up 34.3 ppts to 80.4% in 2021, driven by ePod; and\n- - in Germany, our value share of total vapour was 59.9%, up 10.1 ppts (2020: 49.9%), driven by ePen 3 and ePod.\n\nIn January 2021, we pilot-launched our first CBD vaping product (Vuse CBD Zone) as a city test in Manchester, England, providing valuable insights into the product and consumer behaviour.\n\nWe continued the expansion of e-commerce @ (up 37% on 2020) @ , with Vuse ranked No.1 overall for branded consumer search and web traffic across all our T5 markets. Despite the impact of regulatory changes in the U.S., the number of consumers utilising our subscription programme globally increased to around 25,000, up 43% compared to 2020.\n\n## Proportion of vapour revenue by region in 2021 (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\n|       |   \u00a3m |   2020  \u00a3m |\n|-------|------|------------|\n| U.S.  |  561 |        383 |\n| AmSSA |  141 |         65 |\n| ENA   |  207 |        148 |\n| APME  |   18 |         15 |\n| Total |  927 |        611 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The six-month results were published in a peer-reviewed journal in 2021. The data from the study provides the first real-world evidence that people switching from cigarettes to exclusive use of glo can significantly reduce their exposure to certain toxicants and indicators of potential harm related to several smoking-related diseases, compared with continuing to smoke.\n\n## Designed with Purpose\n\nOur new glo pro, Hyper, and Hyper+ models feature induction heating, enabling devices to reach their operating temperatures of around 240-280/zero.supC faster. This makes them more efficient and enjoyable for consumers to use.\n\nThe system also requires fewer components susceptible to temperature degradation, enabling the use of a wider range of temperatures, which are still substantially lower than temperatures needed for combustion. This helps to unlock a broader range of sensory experiences.\n\nThis more-powerful heating system produces a much faster and more precise device, offering consumers more flexibility, while still tightly controlling temperature and avoiding combustion.\n\n## Performance Summary\n\nDriven by the continued success of glo Hyper in Japan and across ENA, total consumable volume grew 79% to 19.1 billion sticks in 2021. In 2020, consumables grew by 19% to 10.7 billion sticks, having been impacted by the withdrawal of Sens in that period. Excluding Sens, THP consumable volume would have increased 29% in 2020, demonstrating an acceleration in 2021 as average daily consumption increased across our key markets.\n\nIn 2021, glo achieved record THP category volume share in the T9 markets, up 480 bps in 2021 to 18.1%, with growth in all T9 markets.\n\nThis performance was underpinned by glo Hyper, which was launched in April 2020 initially in Japan (and accounts for 72% of the glo portfolio), with subsequent launches in other markets (notably in ENA) from the second half of 2020 and continuing in 2021. glo Hyper is the first-to-world THP launched with induction heating which provides a step change in consumer satisfaction with 30% more tobacco, faster heating and a boost button. The success of glo Hyper was achieved despite the impact of COVID-19 restrictions as the launches and ongoing marketing campaigns were successfully switched to digital platforms.\n\nRevenue increased 34.4% to \u00a3853 million (2020: down 12.9% to \u00a3634 million) largely driven by the higher volume, with growth increasing sequentially between the first and second half of 2021. The decrease in 2020 was largely due to the decision to withdraw glo Sens from the market (being a reduction to revenue of \u00a350 million) and the impact of excise harmonisation in Japan. Excluding the impact of the relative movements in sterling, at constant rates of exchange impacting both years, revenue grew 46% in 2021, compared to a decrease of 12.7% in 2020.\n\nIn APME, where the most mature THP markets are, our consumable volume grew 27%, with device volume up 36% as we continued to invest in consumer acquisition. Revenue was up 2.8% or 13.0% at constant exchange, with acceleration in the second half of 2021 driven by consumable pricing and as we lap the impact of the Sens withdrawal in the prior year comparator, partly offset by excise increases in Japan in October. In Japan, glo's category volume share of THP reached 21.2%, an increase of 180 bps on 2020 (2020: 19.4%).\n\nIn ENA, which has seen strong industry volume growth of 41% in 2021, we grew around five times faster than the market, with glo volume up 195%, with consecutive quarterly growth in our key markets. Accordingly, revenue increased 150% or 167% at constant currency, having grown 143% (or 159% at constant rates of exchange) in 2020. Notably in Russia, glo's volume share (of THP) was up 1,070 bps at 19.3%, while in Ukraine our volume share of THP was 20.9% (an increase of 990 bps) on 2020. Furthermore, in Italy, glo reached 12.8% THP category volume share, up 870 bps, with Hyper driving 100% of the growth, and in Romania glo reached 22.1% category volume share, up 530 bps on 2020.\n\nCOVID-19 continued to impact our consumer engagement plans in 2020 and 2021, yet we still made good progress in Kazakhstan, Poland, Egypt, the Czech Republic and across other smaller ENA launch markets, and Hyper is now in 22 of glo's 25 markets, with further market rollouts planned in 2022.\n\n## Proportion of THP revenue by region in 2021 (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\n|       | \u00a3m   | \u00a3m   |\n|-------|------|------|\n| U.S.  | 1    | 1    |\n| AmSSA | -    | -    |\n| ENA   | 341  | 136  |\n| APME  | 511  | 497  |\n| Total | 853  | 634  |\n\n2020",

Each was tested for 26 compounds, some of which are known harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs). For our products, 22 of the 26 compounds tested were below measurable limits. For NRTs, 20-22 compounds were below measurable limits, whereas snus was found to have 11 compounds below measurable limits.\n\nOn the basis of our evidence and informed by the wealth of independent evidence regarding snus, switching completely to Modern Oral products can be expected to reduce the risk of smoking-related disease when compared to continued smoking. That is why we are investing so much in refining and improving these innovative products. This is part of our commitment to providing adult consumers with a wide range of enjoyable and less risky *\u2020 alternatives to cigarettes.\n\n## Our Products\n\nOur Modern Oral products are white in colour and contain high-purity nicotine, water and other high-quality food-grade ingredients, including eucalyptus and pine tree fibres, flavouring and sweeteners.\n\nOriginating in Scandinavia, Velo is now a leading global brand of nicotine pouches. These typically appeal to a broader audience than traditional oral tobacco, and because of their affordability and lack of batteries, they can be particularly popular in low-to-middle income countries. For example, our subsidiary in Indonesia has delivered encouraging results from its expansion activities in Jakarta. Following a promising performance in June 2020, the test has been expanded to 5,000 consumers, which is being closely monitored to gain consumer insights.\n\nWe are also delivering a step-change in Modern Oral manufacturing. Truly living our ethos, our Modern Oral factory in P\u00e9cs, Hungary, put together a bold plan to implement food industry standards for Modern Oral manufacturing. This has enabled us to ensure the availability of products that comply with regulations in different countries.\n\nWith a cross-functional team across quality, production, engineering and EHS teams delivering technical changes and process improvements, P\u00e9cs became the first site in BAT's history to obtain the ISO 22000 certification for food safety standard.\n\n## Performance Summary\n\nHaving consolidated our leadership position in Modern Oral outside the U.S. and expanded the U.S. portfolio with the Dryft acquisition in 2020, 2021 has been a year of further growth in volume and value.\n\nOur growth accelerated globally in 2021, with volume up 71% to 3.3 billion pouches (2020: up 62% to 1.9 billion pouches).\n\nRevenue increased 39% to \u00a3274 million (2020: up 57% to \u00a3198 million). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this was an increase of 41% in 2021 and 57% in 2020, on a constant rates basis.\n\nVolume share of the Modern Oral category in our T5 markets was 34.7%, in line with 2020.\n\nThis was largely driven by the U.S., where our volume share of Modern Oral increased by 410 bps as volume grew 272% to 602 million pouches (2020: up 45% to 162 million pouches). This growth was due to the acquisition of the nicotine pouch products of Dryft Sciences, LLC (Dryft) in October 2020. These products are now present in over 110,000 stores nationally, driving volume share expansion to 11.7%, up 410 bps on 2020 in a highly competitive market. Due to discounting to drive consumer trial, which is recognised as a deduction to revenue under IFRS, revenue declined 82% to \u00a32 million, having grown 14% to \u00a310 million in 2020.\n\nWhile we are excited about the long-term potential of the Modern Oral market in the U.S., it currently represents less than 2% of the nicotine industry by revenue (in the U.S.) and 51% and 38% of global Modern Oral volume and value share, respectively.\n\nThe majority of Velo consumers (in the U.S.) adopted the brand as their first in Modern Oral, sourced evenly from Combustible, snus, Traditional Oral and Vapour consumers. Our insights suggest that a high percentage of Modern Oral users are already poly-users of other categories.\n\nIn ENA, we are volume share leaders of the Modern Oral category in 15 of the 17 markets where we are active. Revenue increased by 44% (2020: up 59%) or 46% (2020: up 59%) at constant rates of exchange. We continue to drive innovation in the category, with the success of our Sachet, Black range and Velo Mini launches, as well as new flavours generated alongside consumers in our LAB co-creation hubs in Sweden.\n\n## Furthermore:\n\n- - In Sweden, where Modern Oral has grown to represent 13.5% of the total oral category, our volume share of the Modern Oral category reached 59.6%, an increase of 580 bps on 2020**;\n- - In Norway, where Modern Oral now represents 28.7% of the total oral category, our volume share of the Modern Oral category grew to 63.9%, up 180 bps on 2020, having declined 270 bps in 2020 from 64.8% in 2019; and\n- - In Denmark, where Modern Oral now represents 90.5% of the total oral category, our volume share of Modern Oral category fell 130 bps to 92.6%.\n\nOur pilot launches in emerging markets (including Pakistan and Indonesia) continue to deliver valuable insights, as we roll-out in key urban markets. We believe that Modern Oral is an exciting longer-term opportunity to commercialise reduced risk products* \u2020 by offering affordable New Category alternatives to adult nicotine consumers.\n\nIn Kenya, we continue to engage with the relevant authorities on the regulatory and fiscal framework to support a commercially sustainable re-entry into the Modern Oral category.\n\nIn Germany, sales of Modern Oral have been suspended pending engagement with the authorities regarding the classification of tobacco-free nicotine pouches.\n\nProportion of Modern Oral revenue by region in 2021 (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|       | 2021  \u00a3m   |   2020  \u00a3m |\n|-------|------------|------------|\n| U.S.  | 2          |         10 |\n| AmSSA | -          |          1 |\n| ENA   | 266        |        185 |\n| APME  | 6          |          2 |\n| Total | 274        |        198 |",

These products are less finely ground than another traditional oral product referred to as Swedish-style snus. Both of these traditional oral products are available in loose form, as well as in pre-packed pouches.\n\n## Our Products\n\nWe also sell a range of traditional oral products, including Swedish-style snus and American moist snuff, available in loose tobacco form or as pre-packed pouches. We have long sold snus in Sweden and Norway through our Fiedler & Lundgren business, whose brands include Granit and Mocca; and in the US we market snus under the Camel brand. Our American moist snuff products include our flagship Grizzly brand, as well as the premium moist snuff brand Kodiak.\n\nThe Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP) applications for Camel Snus were discussed by the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) of the FDA in September 2018. After extensive additional work with the FDA, we expect that the applications will remain under review until the second half of 2022.\n\n## Performance Summary\n\nIn 2021, volume was lower (down 3.9%) on the prior year (at 8.0 billion stick equivalents), with 2020 0.9% lower than 2019.\n\nTotal revenue declined 3.6% to \u00a31,118 million (2020: up 7.2% to \u00a31,160 million), as pricing in both 2021 and 2020 was more than offset in 2021 by a translational foreign exchange headwind of 6.6% due to the relative strength of sterling in the year. On a constant rates basis, revenue grew 3.0% in 2021 and 7.7% in 2020.\n\nIn the U.S., which accounts for approximately 96% of the Group's revenue from Traditional Oral, volume declined 5.1% in 2021 (2020: down 1.3%). Value share of moist was up 10 bps, while volume share was down 50 bps, compared to 2020. This followed a decline in value share in 2020 of 25 bps. The improvement in 2021 was driven by Grizzly through the use of RGM capabilities which stabilised the performance from the second half of 2020 and delivered value growth in 2021.\n\nOutside the U.S., being 4% of Group revenue from the category, volume was 6.1% higher in 2021, driven by Sweden where the Group's volume share (as a proportion of total oral) increased 50 bps (2020: down 80 bps). This was driven by growth in Lundgrens in both periods offset, in 2020, by declines in the remainder of the portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProportion of traditional oral revenue by region in 2021 (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\n|       | \u00a3m    | \u00a3m    |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| U.S.  | 1,077 | 1,126 |\n| AmSSA | -     | -     |\n| ENA   | 41    | 34    |\n| APME  | -     | -     |\n| Total | 1,118 | 1,160 |\n\n2020",

This combined with higher cigarette value share (in Japan, Bangladesh, Germany, Turkey, Taiwan, Pakistan, the Czech Republic, Colombia and Malaysia) to more than offset lower value share in Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Poland, France and Italy.\n\nGroup cigarette volume share was down 10 bps in 2021 (2020: up 40 bps). The decrease in 2021 was driven by the U.S. (as we focused on value generation), South Africa, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, New Zealand and Russia more than offsetting growth in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Turkey and Japan. In 2020, this was an increase of 40 bps as growth in Bangladesh, Mexico, Vietnam, Russia and Turkey was partly offset by lower volume share in Indonesia and Saudi Arabia.\n\n## Volume Performance\n\nIn 2021, Group cigarette volume was in line with 2020, at 637 billion sticks (2020: down 4.6% to 638 billion), with the total cigarette market also estimated to be largely in line with 2020, having declined between 5.05.5% against 2019.\n\nIn 2021, cigarette volume grew in South Africa (which recovered from the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown and sales ban in 2020), Pakistan (due to lower illicit trade), Bangladesh (due to the strength of the local portfolio) and Vietnam (as the market recovered from COVID-19). However, these were more than offset by the disposal of the Group's operations in Iran partway through the year, while volume was lower in both Indonesia (as the Group focussed on value delivery with pricing ahead of the industry) and the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., Group cigarette volume was down 5.0% to 69.5 billion, having increased 0.5% to 73.1 billion in 2020. The movement in 2021 was partly benefiting from trade inventory movements (mainly linked to the timing of price increases and uncertainty about a potential excise increase) which are expected to unwind in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, Group cigarette volume was also negatively impacted by the COVID-19 production and other supply chain restrictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProportion of combustibles revenue by region in 2021 (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|       | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|-------|------------|------------|\n| U.S.  | 10,015     | 9,926      |\n| AmSSA | 3,435      | 3,535      |\n| ENA   | 5,024      | 5,356      |\n| APME  | 3,555      | 3,935      |\n| Total | 22,029     | 22,752     |",

        "page_content": "This affected sales in several markets including Canada and Mexico. While not a significant part of the Group, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 impacted our Global Travel Retail (GTR) business (which did not recover in 2021), negatively impacting Group cigarette and THP volume by an estimated 1.0% (in 2020 compared to 2019). Furthermore, volume declined in Indonesia (due to the impact of tax increases and minimum retail price compliance) and in Pakistan, where illicit trade grew significantly following excise-led price increases in prior years. These were partly offset by growth in Brazil (where enhanced border security and restricted population mobility due to COVID-19 led to an increase in duty paid volume), in Turkey (driven by Kent and the local portfolio), and in Bangladesh (driven by the continued strength of the local portfolio).\n\nDeveloped markets were generally relatively resilient, with little evidence of accelerated downtrading despite the pressures of COVID-19.\n\n## Strategic Brand Performance\n\nThe performance was underpinned by the strategic cigarette brands, with value share 20 bps higher in 2021 (2020: up 40 bps):\n\n- - Dunhill's overall value share was down 10 bps (2020: down 10 bps) as growth in Romania, Pakistan, Taiwan and Brazil was more than offset by declines in Indonesia, South Korea, Australia and Saudi Arabia. Volume was 8.9% lower (2020: down 17%), largely due to the impact of the tax increases and minimum retail price compliance in Indonesia;\n- - Kent's value share was stable (2020: stable) as growth in Turkey, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine was offset by lower value share in Japan, Romania and Brazil. Volume was down 2.6% (2020: up 2.0%) as growth in Turkey was more than offset by lower volume in Japan and the Middle East (due to the sale of the business in Iran partway through the year);\n- - Lucky Strike's value share grew 30 bps (2020: up 10 bps), as growth in the U.S. (following launch in December 2020), AMSSA (particularly Brazil, Colombia and Chile), Japan, Russia and Germany more than offset lower value share in Indonesia, France and Spain. Volume grew 19.6% (2020: down 2.0%) driven by Russia, the U.S., Brazil, Algeria and Japan, partially offset by the impact of the tax increases and minimum retail price compliance in Indonesia;\n- - Rothmans' value share was 10 bps lower (2020: up 10 bps) as growth in Brazil, the Czech Republic and Malaysia was offset by lower value share in Russia, Australia,\n\nNew Zealand, Poland, South Korea, South Africa, Ukraine and the UK. Volume was 3.0% lower (2020: up 6.1%) as growth in Brazil and Cuba was more than offset by lower volume in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan; and\n\n- - Pall Mall's value share was 20 bps lower (2020: stable) as growth in Mexico and Germany was more than offset by lower value share in the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada, Chile, Romania and New Zealand. Volume was up 2.2% (2020: down 6.0%) largely driven by Pakistan.\n\nThe Group's US domestic strategic combustible portfolio performed well:\n\n- - Newport value share increased 70 bps (2020: up 50 bps), while volume declined 3.3% (2020: up 2.3%);\n- - Natural American Spirit performed well with value share up 20 bps (2020: up 20 bps). Volume was marginally lower than 2020 (down 0.8%), having increased 6.0% in 2020 vs 2019; and\n- - Camel's value share declined 30 bps in the US (2020: stable) with volume 9.0% down (2020: up 1.2%), driven by competitive pricing pressures.\n\nVolume of other tobacco products (OTP) declined 9.2% to 18.3 billion sticks equivalent (2020: 1.7% decline), being 3% of the Group portfolio (2020: 3%).\n\n## Revenue\n\nIn 2021, revenue from combustibles was down 3.2% at \u00a322,029 million (2020: \u00a322,752 million, down 1.1%). 2021 benefited from an estimated \u00a3200 million benefit from the U.S. trade inventory movement discussed earlier. This was more than offset by the estimated \u00a3260 million impact of structural excise change and competitive pricing in Australasia and the impact of the sale of the Group's operations in Iran (as described on page 196). While pricing in both years was strong, this led to 2021 price/mix at 4.3% being lower than 2020 (7.3%).\n\nA translational foreign exchange headwind of 7.2% led to the decline in revenue in 2021 from combustibles.\n\nRevenue in 2020 was also negatively impacted by the COVID-19 volume disruption and a translational foreign exchange headwind of 3.7%. COVID-19 continued to affect the Group as travel restrictions impacted GTR in 2021 and 2020.\n\nAfter adjusting for the short-term impact of excise on bought-in goods (impacting 2019) and the currency headwinds, adjusted revenue from combustibles at constant rates of exchange was up 4.0% to \u00a323,669 million. In 2020, this was an increase of 2.8%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChange in cigarette volume share in key markets ( bps)\n\n## -10 bps\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDefinition: Annual change in cigarette volume share - being the number of cigarettes bought by consumers of the Group's brands in key markets as a proportion of the total cigarettes bought by consumers in those markets (see page 302).\n\nChange in cigarette value share in key markets ( bps)\n\n## +10 bps\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDefinition: Annual change in cigarette value share - being the value of cigarettes bought by consumers of the Group's brands in key markets as a proportion of the total value of cigarettes bought by consumers in those markets (see page 302).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n42\n\nNumber of cigarette factories in 40 countries",

That's why we are changing: creating new products, backed by science and industry-leading standards, that provide adult smokers with less risky alternatives *\u2020 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The Key Enablers for Harm Reduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consumer choice\n\nSmokers are most likely to switch and replace smoking with less risky alternatives *\u2020 when they find one that meets their own preferences.\n\nThat's why we are transforming to a multi-category portfolio of non-combustible products, tailored to meet the preferences of adult consumers. This includes Vapour Products, Tobacco Heating Products and Modern Oral Products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Standards and regulation\n\nWide availability of less risky *\u2020 products depends on having the right regulatory and market conditions, as well as high standards and responsible industry practices.\n\nWe hold ourselves to high standards and hope these will become an industry benchmark and the basis for future regulation. So we share our approach, information and expertise with industry groups, standards bodies and regulators.\n\n## World-class science\n\nWorld-class science is crucial to providing a robust evidence-base to substantiate the role of New Category products in tobacco harm reduction.\n\nWe apply our peer-reviewed scientific framework to assess the emissions, exposure and risk of our products. And we openly share our science and publish our research in peerreviewed journals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking. These products are not risk free and are addictive.\n- \u2020 Our products as sold in the U.S., including Vuse, Velo, Grizzly, Kodiak and Camel Snus, are subject to FDA regulation and no reduced-risk claims will be made as to these products without agency clearance.\n\n## Why harm reduction matters\n\nWe know combustible products pose serious health risks. The only way to avoid those risks is to not start - or to quit smoking. Yet more than 1.1 billion people today continue to consume tobacco and nicotine products globally. 'Tobacco harm reduction' is a well-recognised public health strategy that aims to minimise the harm caused by combustible cigarettes by encouraging adult smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke, to switch completely to scientifically substantiated, reduced-risk alternatives *\u2020 .\n\nSome 100 million adult smokers worldwide have already switched to reduced risk tobacco and nicotine products. We encourage those who would otherwise continue to smoke, to switch. This means enabling consumer choice through making available a range of alternatives to smoking that deliver comparable satisfaction in nicotine delivery, use and sensorial aspects.\n\nFor example, some studies suggest that vapour products are more successful than nicotine replacement therapy in providing a satisfactory alternative to cigarettes, 1,2 despite not being smoking cessation products nor marketed as such.\n\nThese products need to be supported by world-class science and industryleading standards.\n\nResponsible, science-backed and wellthought-through regulation is also crucial for enabling adult consumers to access and enjoy reduced-risk products *\u2020 with confidence, while governments and health bodies can be assured that these products are manufactured to high safety and quality standards.\n\n- 1.

Collaborations with external partners and our corporate venturing initiative are also helping us to stay ahead of the curve.\n\nFor example, in 2020, we established our Open Innovation team, as part of our New Categories R&D function. Working in partnership with Btomorrow Ventures, the Group's corporate venture capital unit, the team is focused on identifying partners (including start-ups) that have innovative technologies and materials that hold promise for our product pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind out more about our New Category products on pages 35 to 40\n\n## How we think New Category products should be regulated\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1.

Engagement, dialogue and communication\n\nto ensure regulators and consumers can make well-informed decisions.\n\n## 5. Responsible marketing freedoms\n\nthat facilitate the acceleration of movement of consumers from combustible to non-combustible products.\n\n## World-class science\n\nFor more than 60 years, research and development has been a critical part of our business. We invest almost \u00a3350 million a year in R&D to deliver innovations that satisfy or anticipate consumer preferences.\n\nThe main focus of our R&D investment is on developing and scientifically substantiating New Category products to assess their reduced-risk profile *\u2020 .\n\nWe use a wide range of analytical techniques, specialised laboratory technology and expertise to test our products and ensure they meet high quality standards. This is supplemented by collaborations with global external researchers who bring independent and specialist expertise that augment and enhance our internal capabilities.\n\nWe follow strict best practice standards for all our scientific research. And, regardless of the results, we submit to high-quality, peer-reviewed journals owned by leading publishers, with well-respected standards for how they run the peer-review process.\n\nWe work to make our science accessible and understandable to a wider audience. We refreshed our dedicated bat-science. com website in 2021, and published a new Science and Innovation Report. We also introduced new quarterly science updates to provide the latest information in this rapidly evolving area in a concise way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind details of our world-class science on pages 35, 37 and 39\n\n## Standards and regulation\n\nRegulation of New Category products continues to evolve. Globally, there are regulators passing progressive laws that allow and encourage adult smokers to switch to New Category products, and some regulators who view them more cautiously. As the science and evidence to substantiate these products grows, we expect to see more countries passing progressive regulations, further accelerating New Category growth.\n\nWe believe a stakeholder-inclusive, wholeof-society dialogue that includes regulators, policymakers, consumers and the industry is key to developing effective policies that can accelerate tobacco harm reduction as fast as possible. Any regulation around New Category products should be founded in science, not opinion.\n\nWe hold ourselves to high standards and hope these will become an industry benchmark and are used as the basis for future regulation. That's why we share our approach, information and expertise with industry groups, governmental technical advisory committees, standards bodies and other key stakeholders.\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## New Category regulation in the U.S.\n\nWe welcomed the opportunity to participate in the U.S. FDA's Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) process for New Category products. PMTAs are based on a summary of all research findings to demonstrate that the products meet the FDA's criteria as 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'.\n\nThe FDA evaluates PMTAs against a rigorous, science-driven standard to determine that marketing of the products is 'appropriate for the protection of the public health'. In October 2021, we were pleased to receive the first ever such authorisation for our Vuse Solo product in Original flavour.\n\nThe Velo PMTAs currently are under review by the FDA. In many areas, these share foundational science and so we remain confident in the quality of these products and our applications.",

Already, we're making significant progress with a reduction of 42.7% in Scope 1 and 2 CO 2 e emissions against our 2017 baseline.\n\nWe also recognise the importance of looking beyond the operations we directly control - so we have set a target for net zero carbon emissions across our value chain by 2050.\n\n## Biodiversity and afforestation\n\nWe work with our contracted farmers to protect biodiversity and forest resources and support communitybased afforestation programmes around the world.\n\nBy 2025: Net zero deforestation of managed forests in our supply chain; and net positive impact on forests in our tobacco supply chain.\n\nTo deliver these stretching targets, we have an integrated climate strategy covering both our own business operations and our wider value chain. This includes utilising multiple opportunities, from on-site renewable energy generation and purchasing renewable electricity, to transitioning our distribution fleet to electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nIn addition, in 2021, we incorporated internal carbon pricing into business plans to ensure the impact on environmental performance and targets is formally considered and quantified. This has supported the prioritisation of sustainability projects such as on-site renewable energy generation.\n\nBy the end of 2021, 32 of our operations sites were purchasing 100% renewable electricity and 19 were generating renewable energy on-site, such as with solar panels.

From using less plastic and recycling more, to being smarter in how our products are designed.\n\nBy 2025: 100% plastic packaging to be capable of being reusable, recyclable or compostable; and 100% of our operations sites to be zero waste to landfill.\n\non-site generation solar coming online in Pakistan, Indonesia, Germany, and South Korea. In places like South Africa, solar plays an important role in the overall site's electricity decarbonisation. In 2021 the site generated green electricity equivalent to avoiding 1,840 tCO 2 . Factories in Brazil and Chile, and Switzerland's manufacturing and commercial sites also passed independent carbon neutral certification in 2021 against PAS 2060 - an internationally recognised certification on carbon neutrality.\n\nIn our tobacco supply chain, we support over 75,000 contracted farmers globally, helping them to reduce emissions through innovative technologies and 'carbon-smart' farming practices throughout the growing cycle. We also continue to actively work with our largest 30 direct product materials suppliers that represent 15% of CO 2 e emissions for this part of our supply chain. In 2021, they participated in a detailed, oneto-one assessment of their current ESG practices and performance, with a strong focus on carbon emissions, as well as waste, water and biodiversity.\n\nOur products are intrinsically linked to our sustainability ambitions. By building sustainable brands with purpose, we are bringing our consumers on our journey with us. So, in 2021, we were proud to announce that Vuse was certified as the first global carbon neutral vape brand. 1\n\n## Eliminating Waste\n\nOur Circular Economy Position Statement sets out our key principles across our operations and product categories. In 2021, we developed new Circular Economy Guidelines and training to provide our people with a common understanding and details of how to apply these principles across different business areas, products and geographies.\n\nWe have conducted studies to map our waste footprint intensity across our value chain and have established cross-functional sustainability workstreams for all our product categories.\n\nWe are focused on eliminating unnecessary single-use plastic across all packaging and, by the end of 2021, had achieved a 13% reduction in total weight.\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "Examples of initiatives undertaken include: removing silicone caps from e-liquid pods, replacing plastic trays with a pulpbased alternative and removing plastic film overwrap.\n\nWe're also aiming for 100% of plastic packaging to be capable of being reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025 - by the end of 2021, this was achieved for 75% of our packaging.\n\nTo help drive responsible disposal, we have take-back schemes for consumers to return our vapour and THP devices in all markets where they are available.\n\nIn 2021, we also supported 12 consumer education and awareness-raising initiatives to prevent cigarette butt littering in five countries. And we are actively looking for new, innovative ways to tackle the issue. For example, we are partnering with an innovate start-up to test a new solution to processing factory waste and cigarette butts from the streets to extract the cellulose acetate.\n\nIn our operations, we're driving a zero waste to landfill mindset with an ambitious target for 100% of sites to achieve this by 2025. Despite challenges in some locations that have limited recycling and waste management facilities, 35% of our sites had reached zero waste to landfill by the end of 2021, and a further 7% are close to achieving this and are recycling at least 95% of total waste generated.\n\nOur Integrated Work Systems (IWS) are crucial in helping to achieve this through optimising our overall performance, minimising machine unplanned downtime, reducing waste, optimising energy and water usage and saving personnel time and effort. Significant benefits have been obtained in the last year ranging from a 5 to 15% reduction in waste to a smaller carbon footprint, 4 ppt efficiency improvement, lower energy consumption and utility costs, and the saving of 1,000s of working hours.\n\n## Sustainable Water Stewardship\n\nWhile our manufacturing facilities are not particularly water intensive compared to other industries, with the changing climate, water scarcity is a growing concern.\n\nOur sites implement a range of initiatives to eliminate water losses and improve water efficiency. As a result, we have been making steady progress decreasing water use, with a 27.6% reduction achieved from our 2017 baseline year. At the same time, we've also increased the amount of water we recycle to 16.7% (compared to 15.3% in 2020).\n\nTo accelerate progress and deliver further water stewardship opportunities, we are members of the Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS). AWS is a global collaboration of businesses, NGOs and\n\nthe public sector that are contributing to the sustainability of local waterresources through adoption of the global AWS Standard.\n\nWe have committed to 100% of our manufacturing sites being certified against the AWS standard by 2025. In 2021, 11 sites achieved AWS certification and a further 23 sites are expected to complete the certification process during 2022.\n\n## Water stewardship in tobacco growing\n\nWater management is vital to sustainable farming, especially given that agriculture accounts for an average of 70% of freshwater withdrawals globally. Rainwater is commonly sufficient for watering many tobacco crops - due to the variety of locations in which we source our tobacco, only 31% require irrigation.\n\nOur leaf operations in these areas are actively looking at ways to work with our contracted farmers to reduce water usage, with different techniques applied depending on the local circumstances and growing conditions.\n\nOur global leaf agronomy centre in Brazil is playing a vital role in researching, developing and customising cutting-edge innovations to drive water efficiency in tobacco growing. For example, innovative 'floating' systems for growing tobacco seedlings, based on hydroponics, use about 85% less water per hectare. These have been successfully introduced to some 17,000 contracted farmers in six countries, with trials underway in six more countries.\n\nWe have also developed innovate drip irrigation technology, that increases waterusage efficiency by up to 90% - so far, this is being used by our contracted farmers in six countries.\n\n## Biodiversity and Afforestation\n\nOur Biodiversity Statement sets out the principles we follow to manage our biodiversity footprint across our operations.\n\nIn 2021, we announced a new commitment for net zero deforestation of managed forests across our tobacco and paper- and pulp-based product supply chains by 2025. This means that for every tree that is chopped down, we will aim for another to be planted by ourselves or others in our supply chain. In our tobacco supply chain, we take this further by aiming to have a net positive impact on forests by 2025. This means that not only will a tree be planted for each one used, but we will strive to have a net positive impact planting more trees than are removed.\n\nTo achieve these ambitious targets, our leaf operations and third-party suppliers continue to work with tobacco farmers in our supply chain to provide training\n\nin forest and biodiversity management, distribute tree saplings for a sustainable source of fuel for curing and help farmers to switch to locally available alternative fuels.\n\nIn 2021, monitoring of our contracted farmers wood fuel use for tobacco curing showed that 99.9% is from sustainable sources.\n\nIn addition, we support afforestation, biodiversity and environmental conservation programmes around the world as part of our wider community-based initiatives. In 2021, this included 18 projects in 13 countries, including long-standing afforestation programmes in Bangladesh, Brazil, Kenya, Pakistan and Vietnam that have collectively distributed an estimated 380 million trees over the last 40 years.\n\nIn our paper- and pulp-based product supply chain, we are committed to working with suppliers that can demonstrate that the material is sourced sustainably, with certification from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) or the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). So far, this is the case for 89% of the paper and pulp volumes we purchase - we aim to reach 100% by 2025 as part of our net zero deforestation target.\n\nIn addition, we signed up in 2021 as a signatory to Business for Nature's Call to Action, a global coalition uniting influential organisations and forward-thinking businesses to amplify calls for collective action to reverse nature loss in this decade.\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## Digital farmer sustainability management\n\nWe are leveraging the power of technology to enhance and accelerate our connectivity with our contracted farmers and farming communities. Our Farmer Sustainability Management (FSM) system is a digital platform that supports the work of our field technicians by enabling a consistent approach to farm monitoring and overall sustainability management.\n\nOur field technicians visit our contracted farmers approximately once a month during the growing season, acting as a direct link between the farmers and BAT. Details of each farm visit are recorded in FSM, including any issues identified and details of prompt actions taken to remediate them.\n\nIn 2021, the majority of issues recorded in FSM (96.5%) related to the safe handling, use and storage of agrochemicals.",

By enhancing farmer livelihoods, respecting human rights and ensuring a safe, diverse and inclusive working environment, we can help ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and build a fairer tomorrow for society.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Farmer livelihoods\n\nRural poverty is recognised as a root cause for issues such as child labour. We support our contracted farmers to enhance livelihoods and food security. And our community programmes help to build long-term resilience for rural communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and safety\n\nWe are committed to providing a safe working environment for all our employees and contractors, and to enabling access to personal protective equipment (PPE) for our contracted tobacco farmers\n\nEach year: Aim for zero accidents Group-wide\n\n## Farmer Livelihoods\n\nIf farmers have sustainable living incomes, farming is more attractive to the next generation. It also reduces the risks of exploitation, as well as child and forced labour, and helps encourage improved adherence to safety and environmental standards. That's why enhancing farmer livelihoods is such an important priority area of our Sustainability Agenda and is central to our tobacco supply chain strategy.\n\nOur Extension Services of expert field technicians support our 75,000+ contracted farmers throughout the growing cycle, helping to develop their skills, promote better yields and build their resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind our key ESG goals, targets and metrics in our ESG Roadmap on page 47.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human rights\n\nOur business and supply chain touch several industries with important human rights impacts. Our approach is aligned to the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and focuses on strong policies, due diligence and remediation.\n\nBy 2025: Aim for zero child labour and zero forced labour in our tobacco supply chain\n\n## People and culture\n\nWe focus on building an inclusive and supportive culture that attracts, engages and retains diverse and talented people, develops the next generation of leaders and creates a fulfilling, rewarding and responsible work environment.\n\nBy 2025: Increase the proportion of women in management roles to 45%\n\nThis includes providing new tobacco varieties that produce higher quality leaf and increase yields by up to 20%, as well as mechanised solutions and technology to help farmers scale up production and reduce manual labour.\n\nWe have been measuring farmers' yields, profit margins and revenues from tobacco as part of our Thrive assessments since 2015. In 2021, we took a step-change in building upon, and strengthening, this approach, undertaking further assessments of the living income generation in our farmer base.\n\n## Community investment\n\nIn many parts of the world, we partner with NGOs and other stakeholders on projects to support the local communities where we operate. These programmes focus on a range of issues, such as women's empowerment, financial inclusion, access to healthcare, clean water and sanitation and supporting national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOur community investment policy in our SoBC is supported by our Community Investment Framework, which sets out how Group companies should develop, deliver and monitor community investment programmes. In 2021, the Framework was revised to align our community investment strategy with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Across the Group, \u00a319 million was reported for community investment programmes in 2021, including \u00a312.6 million in cash spend and a further \u00a36.4 million estimated for in-kind donations. This includes \u00a30.96 million given for charitable purposes by UK Group companies.\n\n## Human Rights\n\nOur integrated human rights strategy is aligned to the UNGPs and includes policies, due diligence, grievance channels and remediation procedures for our own business operations and supply chain.\n\nOur Human Rights policy forms part of our Standards of Business Conduct and is reflected in our Supplier Code of Conduct. This is complemented by our operational standard on child labour prevention, which provides detailed guidance and procedures for our leaf operations in tackling the risk of child labour in our tobacco supply chain.\n\n## Tobacco supply chain\n\nThe most significant challenges for human rights are in our tobacco supply chain and this has been a priority area for us for many years.\n\nHuman rights issues in agriculture can be complex, and we know that the situation on the ground can be nuanced and that remediation requires cooperation and dialogue, rather than confrontation. This is why our approach emphasises working with families and communities to find sustainable solutions while respecting local context and the challenges of operating small, family-run farms.",

        "page_content": "This is where our direct contracts with farmers enables us to have a real impact. Our field technicians visit our contracted farmers approximately once a month during the growing season. As well as providing agronomy and livelihoods support, this is an important way of monitoring the farms.\n\nIn 2021, a total of 1,790 incidents of child labour were identified on 0.7% of our contracted farms and those supplying our strategic third-party suppliers. The majority related to under-18s working on tasks such as preparing bales, watering and weeding, and harvesting and stitching tobacco. Of these, 100% were reported as resolved, where a remediation plan that considers the individual circumstances is implemented with the farmer. Wherever possible, this plan involves local community or school support. In a small number of cases, where there is persistent non-compliance, the farmer's contract is not renewed for the next growing season.\n\nWe maintain a relentless focus on addressing the root causes. Our leaf operations and strategic third-party suppliers deliver human rights training and communication programmes for farmers and community members. More than 350,000 people were reported to be engaged via this training in 2021.\n\nWe support a range of local communitybased programmes in collaboration with local stakeholders. These include child labour prevention programmes in Brazil, Kenya and Mexico. We also continue as active members of the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco Growing (ECLT) Foundation which, since 2011, has supported over one million children, farmers and families.\n\nIn addition, human rights impact assessments, aligned to the UNGPs, have been conducted in six of our tobacco sourcing countries, covering nine suppliers India and Indonesia in 2019, Mozambique in 2020, and Macedonia, Turkey and Zimbabwe in 2021. Collectively, these assessments have engaged over 2,200 rights-holders and are a best practice approach to identifying, assessing and responding to actual and potential human rights impacts, including the root causes and how they manifest.\n\n## Product materials supply chain\n\nBeyond tobacco, we source product materials like paper and filters for cigarettes and, for our New Category products, we have a growing supply chain in consumer electronics and e-liquids. Labour factors are considered right at the outset, before we even start working with a new supplier. This includes mandatory scoring criteria as part of the supplier selection process.\n\nOnce selected, suppliers must then undergo an independent labour audit performed by our partner Intertek. The audit assesses workplace conditions, and we expect suppliers to achieve a minimum score of 70% to qualify. We maintain a rigorous focus on human rights in the supply chain and conduct an annual risk assessment on 100% of our existing materials suppliers. Using independent human rights indices developed by Verisk Maplecroft, we assess suppliers' inherent risk exposure based on their country location and the goods or services they provide. Suppliers identified as high risk are then prioritised for audits.\n\nIn 2021, 142 audits were conducted by Intertek on our suppliers in 38 countries. Over the last three years, 22% of our product materials suppliers have undergone at least one independent labour audit, and we're committed to achieving 100% by 2025.\n\n## Human rights risk assessments\n\nThe policies, procedures and controls adopted by Group companies help to substantially mitigate human rights risks in our businesses. We recognise that circumstances in some countries present a higher risk for human rights issues, such as where regulation or enforcement is weak, or there are high levels of corruption, criminality or unrest.\n\nWe have a defined process in place to identify and carefully monitor BAT operations in high-risk countries. This process includes an annual risk assessment of all countries with Group company employees present, using Verisk Maplecroft's human rights indices (including its Modern Slavery Index). Our operating companies in each high-risk country identified must complete a human rights assessment, confirming compliance with Group policies, standards and controls and providing details of measures in place to enhance human rights management.\n\nThe process is reviewed by the Audit Committee at each stage, including action plans for any areas for improvement identified. In 2021, our operations in 26 countries were identified as high risk from a human rights perspective and completed the risk assessment.\n\n## Health and Safety\n\nWe are always working to protect the health, safety and wellbeing of people - through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond - as well as striving for zero accidents Group-wide. We have a mature and well-established approach, based on risk management and assessment, employee training and awareness, and tailored initiatives for specific issues and higher-risk areas.\n\nFor example, in Trade Marketing & Distribution, the highest risks relate to road traffic accidents, particularly in countries with poor road infrastructure and driving behaviour, or attacks and assaults from armed robberies where our goods have a high street value. So, we have comprehensive driver safety and security programmes in place, including regular training and awareness campaigns, telematic systems in all our vehicles and clear security protocols.\n\nOverall, total accidents across the Group reduced by 19% - from 155 accidents in 2020, down to 126 in 2021. Sadly, however, there were 3 fatalities in 2021 to one employee and two contractors in Brazil, Mexico and Bangladesh (compared to three contractors in 2020). In addition, 4 members of the public lost their lives in road traffic accidents involving BAT vehicles in Bangladesh, Honduras, Poland and Zambia. Our drivers were found not to be at fault in three cases, while an employee in Zambia was charged with dangerous driving and is facing disciplinary action.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind out about our Group risk factors related to workplace health and safety on page 96.\n\n## People and Culture\n\nAttracting and retaining an increasingly diverse workforce and providing a welcoming, inclusive working environment are key drivers in BAT's transformation journey to build A Better Tomorrow\u2122.\n\nWe are creating value for our employees by having a diverse range of excellent people, engaged teams and being a great place to work.\n\nWe have extensive health and wellbeing support available to our employees, including medical and counselling services, and health insurance. We also offer regular webinars and information on a range of topics, including mindfulness, stress management and financial wellbeing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this support has played an even more important role in keeping our people connected and supporting one another during such difficult times.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind out details of our approach to people and culture on pages 68-73.",

Our Group-wide Delivery with Integrity programme helps everyone at BAT understand and play their role in maintaining our standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulation and policy engagement\n\nEffective regulation needs dialogue between governments and industry, and we have a legitimate role to play in policy-related debate that affects our business. By sharing our expertise, engaging transparently and with high regard for accuracy and integrity, we can make a valuable contribution to policy development relating to our industry.\n\n## Business Ethics\n\nOur Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC) express the high standards we are committed to upholding. Our SoBC comprise our policies referenced on page 48, including anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC), political contributions, anti-money laundering and tax evasion, and is available in 14 languages. SoBC awareness and understanding are promoted through regular training and communications.

The updated versions of our SoBC and Supplier Code of Conduct were approved by the Board in 2021 and took effect from January 2022. This was supported by their adoption by our Group companies and roll-out to Group company employees worldwide.\n\nOur Group entities complete an annual assessment of audit controls to assess and confirm they have complied with SoBC controls and compliance procedures. SoBC compliance is monitored through the year by our Corporate Audit Committee and Regional Audit and CSR Committees, and quarterly by the Audit Committee.\n\n## Delivery with Integrity\n\nOur Delivery with Integrity global compliance programme promotes an ethical culture and communicates expected behaviours as set out in our SoBC.\n\nOver the past five years, we have strengthened our procedures and guidelines across areas including ABAC, anti-money laundering and tax evasion, competition law, sanctions and data privacy. With these strong foundations in place, we are now focusing on automation and data analytics to identify and mitigate such risks as they arise, improving the lifecycle risk management of the third parties BAT engages with.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our Group risk factors related to corporate behaviour and compliance with sanctions regimes and competition laws on pages 317 to 339.\n\nWhile policies and procedures are key to a consistent approach to compliance, we know that engagement and awareness are crucial to sustaining a culture of integrity across the Group. That's why we have focused on ensuring everyone at BAT understands their role from day one in the organisation and that this is sustained throughout the year.\n\nOur SoBC app provides easy access to SoBC policies, procedures and guidance, as well as our global 'Speak Up' channels, which are multilingual. From 2022, the app now incorporates our Supplier Code of Conduct in 15 languages to help increase accessibility for suppliers. To date, the app has been downloaded more than 27,500 times. In 2021, we launched our new SoBC e-induction training and automated conflicts of interest disclosure requirement for all new management-level employees. We also launched new training targeted at relevant employees on areas such as sanctions, competing fairly and ethically and data privacy.\n\nIn 2021, we held two global integrity events at the start and middle of the year. The first week-long campaign focused on the role of line managers in leading by example as SoBC role models. It also included our new campaign - 'Speak-Listen-Act' - focused on raising awareness of our Speak Up channels and for them to be seen as a trusted tool by our people. Later in the year, our global 24-hour 'integrity pledge' event focused on reaffirming our commitment to ethical behaviour, with employees making personal pledges across the Group.",

        "page_content": "We ended the year with our global SoBC compliance campaign. Our Group company employees completed a formal SoBC sign-off during which they completed training and assessment, affirmed their commitment to the SoBC and declared any new or existing personal conflicts of interest. In 2021, this was successfully completed by 100% of our Group company employees.\n\nOver 24,000 did this through our online SoBC portal and remaining Group company employees were given various options to complete the process, including via our SoBC app. The app has proved important in helping everyone to participate in training and sign-off safely, given COVID-19 continued to hinder usual face-to-face gatherings in many of our markets.\n\n## Speak Up and SoBC compliance\n\nOur SoBC and Supplier Code of Conduct make it clear that our employees, partners and suppliers should speak up if they have a concern about actual or suspected wrongdoing, including in relation to accounting or auditing matters. We will always listen to these concerns and do not tolerate victimisation or reprisals of any kind against anyone raising a concern; such conduct is itself a breach of the SoBC and is a serious disciplinary matter. Our speak up channels include an independently managed Speak Up online portal and telephone hotlines, available 24 hours a day. Speak Up channels can be used in confidence, and anonymously where preferred, and are available in multiple local languages.\n\nNot all contacts made via our SoBC Portal involve alleged SoBC breaches; some relate to questions regarding the SoBC or other matters. In 2021, there were 581 SoBC contacts (2020: 554), of which 304 SoBC contacts were assessed as alleged SoBC breaches and reported to the Audit Committee (2020: 321), including 145 contacts where the person raising the case chose to remain anonymous.\n\nOur SoBC Assurance Procedure defines how all reports of alleged SoBC breaches should be investigated and remediated fairly and objectively. And our Business Integrity Panel promotes a consistent approach to investigation and remediation of all alleged breaches of the SoBC. For the detailed investigations conducted into all of the reported cases in 2021:\n\n- - No wrongdoing was found in 154 cases (2020: 158);\n- - The investigation continued at year-end for 51 cases (2020: 47); and\n- - 99 cases were established as breaches and appropriate action taken (2020: 116).\n\nWe take strong action for all cases established as breaches, which will vary from case to case depending on the circumstances. In 2021, established SoBC breaches resulted in 46 people leaving the Group and 72 written warnings. In addition, where any weakness in internal controls is identified, appropriate measures are taken to strengthen them. Our SoBC, and information on the total number of breaches reported under it, are available at bat.com/sobc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease refer to the Governance Report for more information about Board and Audit Committee oversight and monitoring of SoBC compliance.\n\n## Responsible Marketing\n\nOur International Marketing Principles (IMP) govern our approach to marketing our products across the Group. Our IMP are applied consistently everywhere we operate, even when they are stricter than applicable local laws. All marketing materials are subject to review by our Legal & External Affairs (LEX) function. Our Supplier Code of Conduct also includes a requirement for our suppliers, agents and third parties to comply with the IMP.\n\nTo support our strict requirement to only direct marketing at adult consumers, our markets are expected to adhere to our global Youth Access Prevention (YAP) Guidelines. These apply to all markets where our products are sold, including where distributed through third parties. IMP and YAP compliance is monitored by our Regional Audit and CSR Committees and by the Audit Committee annually. All of our markets reported alignment with our YAP Guidelines in 2021. We report further on compliance in our 2021 ESG Report at www.bat.com/esgreport .\n\nAs we accelerate our transformation, driving growth in New Categories, building strong brands of the future and digitising our business, our new e-commerce and social media channels are playing an ever more prominent role in our marketing strategy.\n\nDigitisation around the world has been rapidly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in this changing environment, we continue to embed new digital channels and ensure our people and partners have the right tools and capabilities to support IMP and YAP compliance. Our digital marketing toolkit includes in-depth guidance on topics such as content standards, social media and search engines, and ensuring robust online age verification procedures. And our digital marketing hub supports our markets by providing guidance on how to achieve longterm consumer satisfaction and product awareness in a responsible way.\n\nIn 2021, we reinforced this work with new toolkits and guidance, such as for applying our YAP Guidelines and age verification standards on our own and third-party e-commerce sites. We also launched a new training programme, called iCommit, covering measures for digital channels with a mix of theory and practical training, based on real-life scenarios.\n\n## Regulation and Engagement\n\nOur SoBC includes our Lobbying and Engagement Policy and Political Contributions Policy, adopted by all Group companies and applicable to all Group company employees. These policies require all our engagement activities with external stakeholders to be conducted with transparency, openness and integrity.\n\nWe are committed to conducting all our engagement activities with external stakeholders with transparency, openness and integrity. For global regulatory priorities, the views we advocate are the same as those we publish on our website, and we have long supported the OECD's Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying. We also respect the call for transparent and accountable interaction between governments and the tobacco industry established in Article 5.3 of the World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). We are open about what we think and always try to offer constructive solutions that will best meet the objectives of regulation, while minimising any negative unintended consequences.\n\nRegulatory engagement by our businesses is monitored throughout the year by our Regional Audit and CSR Committees. The Management Board's Regulation Committee, chaired by the Legal and External Affairs Director, meets three times a year and is responsible for reviewing key regulatory and excise trends, Group priority focus areas, and the execution of global plans regarding regulation and monitoring progress. Our Board is kept updated on regulatory engagement activities during the year. Details of any political contributions are reported twice each year to the Audit Committee. The Group does not make contributions to UK or EU political organisations or incur UK or EU political expenditure. Details of political contributions outside these jurisdictions are set out on page 127.\n\nFind details of our other governance priorities, including data privacy and cyber security, in our 2021 ESG Report at www.bat.com/esgreport .\n\n***  Waivers from YAP Guidelines are granted where there is a government ban on point-of-sale materials or YAP retailer engagement cannot be ensured due to practical or cultural limitations.",

Our reporting against other frameworks, including the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework, can be found at www.bat.com/esgreport .\n\nSince 2019, we have worked with an external consultancy with expertise in TCFD reporting and climate scenario modelling to deliver an iterative process to identify, measure, manage, assure and report on climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nWe have taken a phased approach, integrating TCFD into our Group risk management process. This included generation of a climate related gap analysis to highlight and understand key areas for improvement. We selected appropriate climate scenarios and performed initial high-level, scenariobased modelling of material risks and business impacts, to prioritise the climate-related risks and opportunities for BAT.\n\nIn 2021, we undertook detailed financial modelling to further understand the timing and materiality of these key risks and opportunities. This process included:\n\n- - Selection of risks and opportunities for deep dive modelling based on relative strategic importance, and availability of value adding methodologies and data. This process was supported by two external consultancies. We will broaden and deepen this analysis in future years as data and methodologies improve.\n- - Engagement with colleagues across the Group, which was crucial to gather data and test assumptions. Multiple workshops and interviews were held with teams across the organisation, including our Management Board, and our Risk Management, Finance, Treasury, New Categories, Legal, Government Affairs, Investor Relations, Supply Chain and Leaf teams.\n\nAn overview of our approach to identifying, assessing and managing climate risk is provided on page 59.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board oversight\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible for the sustainable, long-term success of the Company and the Group's strategic direction, purpose, values and governance. This includes responsibility for the Group's strategy and ensuring that resources are in place to meet the objectives and to manage risks, including internal controls.\n\nThe Board has approved all Group environmental targets, including our carbon emissions targets, and receives an update on progress and performance twice a year from the Director, Operations. In 2021, the Board also received a deep-dive ESG briefing covering our climate strategy, progress against our climate-related goals and targets, and approach to reporting in alignment with the TCFD framework.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal controls systems, including those relating to climate change. The Audit Committee also receives reports from the Group's Regional Audit and CSR committees and Corporate Audit Committee, which monitor the effectiveness of business risk management and internal controls across the regions and the central functions.\n\nOur Management Board, chaired by our Chief Executive, is responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Group's strategy and policies set by the Board, and for creating the framework for the day-to-day operation of the Group's subsidiaries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of key climate-related matters considered by the Board in 2021 can be found on page 105 and 120\n\n## Management's role\n\nThe assessment and management of climate-related risks is embedded across relevant business areas at Group, regional and local levels, with appropriate management oversight at each level, as shown on the chart on page 59.\n\nThis approach provides a flexible channel for the structured flow of information, monitoring and oversight of climate-related risks and environmental matters at the level and format best suited to the context.\n\nAll relevant employees, from the Management Board to managers at Group, regional and local level, have individual performance objectives that are linked to remuneration, including delivery against ESG- and climate-related priorities and metrics, that form part of their responsibilities.\n\nThe Management Board receive regular updates on material risks and strategic plans, including those relating to climate change, along with associated risk mitigation plans. This includes regular monitoring by the Group Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Finance and Transformation Director.\n\nThe Chief Marketing Officer has overall responsibility for the delivery of the Group Sustainability Agenda, supported by the Business Communications and Sustainability (BC&S) team, including the Head of ESG and sustainability subjectmatter experts.\n\nThe Shaping Sustainability Programme Board oversees the cross-functional delivery of the 'Shaping Sustainability' of our QUEST transformation programme. Members of the programme board include the Chief Marketing Officer, the Director, Operations and the Group Head of BC&S. This is underpinned by a drive team, including the Head of ESG and Head of Operations Development and Sustainability.\n\nThe Director, Operations has overall responsibility for delivery of the Group's climate strategy and environmental targets, supported by the Group Head of Operations Development and Sustainability, and the Operations Sustainability team, including the central Sustainability team and regional sustainability managers.\n\nReporting units that contribute to 98% of Group Scope 1 & 2 CO 2 e emissions (incorporating all factories and green leaf threshing plants) report quarterly, those contributing to around 2% of Group Scope 1 & 2 CO 2 e emissions report semiannually and annual reporting is completed by units reporting less than 0.3% of emissions. Monitoring and reporting of consolidated Group performance and metrics is completed quarterly by the Group Operations Sustainability team. Each directly-reporting business unit of the Group (DRBU) has an Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Steering Committee, with overall responsibility to deliver environmental targets at site level held by the General Manager or site manager. EHS is also a standing agenda item for management meetings and governance committees at area, regional and global levels.",

Our Sustainability Agenda, with climate change as a key priority under the environmental pillar, is set out on page 46.\n\nTaking an active approach to tackling climate change isn't new at BAT. As a business that depends on natural resources, we have been focusing on addressing our environmental impacts and preparing our business for the risks ahead for over 20 years. Yet with the impacts of climate change rapidly increasing, we are making a step-change in our ambition and accelerating the pace of progress.\n\nIn 2021, we signed up to the UNbacked Race to Zero global campaign. This campaign aims to halve global carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. BAT has previously committed to Science Based Targets, aligned to a 2 o C pathway; subject to approval from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), we intend to align our targets to a 1.5 o C pathway in 2022.\n\nTo meet our ambitions for carbon neutrality across our operations by 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 e emissions) and across our value chain by 2050, we have an integrated climate strategy, highlighted below, covering our own operations and our wider value chain. This focuses on reducing our impact on the environment, addressing climate-related risks and opportunities, and building climate resilience for the future.\n\nKey attributes of our climate strategy include:\n\n- - the performance of climate scenario analysis to inform our understanding of risks and opportunities;\n- - the performance of life cycle assessments of our products and the incorporation of end of life treatment to reduce their environmental impact. Reducing the use of embodied carbon and single use plastic, and increasing recyclability to reduce the level of waste generated;\n- - enhancing the resilience of our internal supply chain and wider value chain to maintain access to critical raw materials, and insulating our business from the impact of supply constraint-driven inflationary pressures;\n\n- -  the environmental impact of our direct operations, including the reduction of CO 2 e generated by our sites and fleet through energy saving initiatives and increased use of renewable energy (both purchased and self-generated), as well as reducing the waste generated and maximising the share of waste directed to recycling;\n- - ensuring effective and efficient use of natural resources throughout our value chain, including where possible greater use of green energy and reduction of water usage and waste generation. This supports the allocation of these critical natural resources to food generation and other activities, and reduces our susceptibility to energy cost premiums and future carbon taxes; and\n- - continued investment in R&D activity to underpin product innovations , technical deployment of agronomy best practices, low carbon curing technologies and farming techniques based on science.\n\nFinancial planning is key to the execution of our strategy. Through our embedded governance, we consider the impact of climate change on future anticipated operating costs (including the cost of regulation), access to capital and potential growth opportunities to facilitate resource allocation and to ensure that decision making is robust.\n\nIn 2021, internal carbon pricing (ICP) was incorporated into our financial appraisal to facilitate delivery against our glidepaths. These actions position us to be successful now and into the future as climate challenges arise.\n\nTo further enhance our strategy to mitigate the impacts of climate change, we performed an assessment of risks and opportunities using two climate evolution scenarios and over three time horizons. The approach taken to this assessment, outcomes, and mitigations are set out below on pages 62 to 64.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We identified three climate-related opportunity areas and eight climate-related threats, which span transitional and physical risks in nature. The results of the scenario analysis performed is shown on page 64.\n\nMaterial risks are those that could have a significant effect on our operations, strategy and financial planning if they are not managed appropriately. In contrast, material opportunities may improve our financial performance over time in the event they can be realised.\n\nThrough our ESG strategy we aim to effectively manage the impact of our business on the planet over time.\n\nWe have also undertaken a deep-dive modelling and financial impact analysis on six risks and opportunities, drawing on internal and external data sources, such as carbon pricing projections, potential future surcharges on single-use plastics in our products, Group financial data, energy consumption and costs by BAT site, business growth projections and consumer trends. This allowed us to refine our initial qualitative assessment and quantify the expected financial impact based on assumptions of future developments. We will continue to revisit these assumptions to reflect new and emerging developments.\n\nSpecifically, in relation to future access to tobacco and nicotine, a detailed assessment of future growing conditions was undertaken across our 10 largest tobacco source countries, utilising a UN IPCC model for climate change. Regional temperature behaviour, precipitation and soil water levels (surplus or deficit) were assessed, enabling us to estimate the likely impact on crop yields, and the cost of, or access to, tobacco in the future.\n\nTotal Emissions (thousand tonnes tCO2e)",

change trajectories indicate it is unlikely that the Group would face reduced production capacity as a consequence of consistent supply constraints. We believe the impacts on yield can be effectively mitigated through agronomy action plans to avoid yield driven cost of production increases.\n\nIn 2021, we also built on our decades of experience in agriculture to develop a new carbon-smart farming programme. This takes a strategic approach focused on reducing emissions from tobacco farming and leveraging the positive effect agriculture could have in removing carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nScenario analysis highlighted the increased cost of compliance with emerging regulation, cost of green energy and carbon taxation arising from Government policies seeking to deliver a Sustainable Transition (Scenario 1). Potential adverse impacts from higher costs and reduced access to both insurance and capital markets were identified.\n\nGiven the nature of transition risks, we anticipate the magnitude of these risks will be lower, and impact delayed, under Climate Inaction (Scenario 2) as little or no change to current regulation is projected. We will continue to update both our scenario analysis and business plans to ensure our business remains resilient and best able to mitigate the impact of climate policies as they emerge.",

This takes a strategic approach focused on both reducing emissions from tobacco farming and, crucially, leveraging the positive effect agriculture could have in removing carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nThe latter can be achieved by planting trees, as well as through methods like cover crops and conservation tillage that may keep the soil covered and undisturbed, to reduce the possibility of carbon escaping.\n\nAs well as storing carbon, these methods may also increase waterretention capacity, improving drainage and making the soil richer and more fertile. This results in increased yields and better-quality crops for farmers helping to boost their profits.\n\nMany of our contracted farmers already use these best practices. The challenge has been to find effective ways to measure impact and quantify the amount of carbon they remove, compared to how much they emit.\n\nSo, in 2021, we conducted a detailed analysis to estimate removals resulting from carbon-smart farming best practice, against international methodologies, such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol.\n\nWe are now working in partnership with a specialist consultancy to validate this approach and to monitor, report and verify the results. This will enable us to develop a system that can be easily applied by small farmers. The systems will form the basis of our carbon-smart farming programme, empowering our contracted farmers to incorporate carbon-smart farming into their business model.\n\nIt will also provide us with verified data to measure progress against our 2050 ambition and to validate the impact of different carbon-smart strategies. In 2021, 35 of our contracted farmers in Brazil signed-up as the first pilot group for the programme. We will expand the pilot to farmers in Bangladesh, Mexico and Pakistan in 2022. Learnings from the pilots will help in further developing and scalingup the programme as part of our wider climate strategy.\n\nTo me it is an honour to be one of the first farmers participating in this programme. I'm excited to learn new conservation practices to deploy on my farm. And I think getting to see real data showing the tangible impact this will have in both reducing and removing carbon emissions will be a game-changer and provide new opportunities for income generation.\n\nLaercio Celestino Adami BAT contracted tobacco farmer,\n\nBrazil",

This increases our exposure to the physical risks of climate change due to the increased risk of asset production disruption, damage or loss. In contrast to transition risks, physical risks are most severe under Climate Inaction (Scenario 2) given this scenario sees a world where warming exceeds a 3\u00b0C threshold, increasing the frequency and severity of climate-related events and likely financial impact on our business. In response, more extensive mitigation may be required including investments in working capital to increase our supply chain resilience.\n\nWhile a sustainable transition (Scenario 1) is not anticipated to fully shield our operations from such climatic events, we assessed these may be less frequent and more controllable through tailored adjustments to our existing risk management policies.\n\nWhile there are challenges ahead, we believe that the Group is well placed to address them. Supported by our global reach, supply chain flexibility, diverse product portfolio, leading brands and capital strength, we believe that we have the resilience and agility to transition and create new growth opportunities.\n\nThe insights gained from the modelling performed further strengthen the importance and relevance of our climate strategy and net zero carbon emissions target to mitigate these risks. We will continue to review each material climaterelated risk and opportunity and build upon our existing mitigation strategies to enhance the resilience of our business to climate change.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nOur Risk Management Framework and procedures are clearly defined and wellestablished across the Group.\n\nRisk registers, based on a standardised methodology, are used at Group, functional, and DRBU level to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate the risks (both financial and non-financial).\n\nRisks, including climate-related risks, are assessed and prioritised at three levels by reference to their impact (high/medium/ low) and likelihood (probable/possible/ unlikely), as defined in our Group Risk Management Manual. Mitigation plans are required to be in place to manage the risks identified, and progress against those plans is monitored. Decisions on how to manage the risk are based on a variety of considerations including risk score, our ability to influence or control the risk, and cost and effectiveness of mitigation. The risk registers are reviewed on a biannual basis.\n\nAt the Group level, specific responsibility for managing each identified risk is allocated to a member of the Management Board. The Group risk register is reviewed biannually by the Group Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Finance and Transformation Director. In addition, the Group risk register is reviewed annually by the Board and biannually by the Audit Committee.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to integrate and embed climate-related risks into our Group risk management procedures. This followed an update to our Group risk register in 2020 to incorporate transitional risks of climate change as a Group risk.\n\nEach of our DRBUs and functions is required to identify and assess risks and opportunities, including climate-related physical risks, which are captured on risk registers and assessed against the materiality thresholds defined in our Risk Management Framework. Additionally, the transitional risks of climate change have been assessed centrally and are captured on our Group risk register in accordance with our Risk Management Framework.\n\nTransitional risks of climate change takes into account factors including net zero commitments, stakeholder interests and emerging and current climaterelated regulations.\n\nIn recognition of ESG being fundamental to all that we do in the organisation and the global risks of climate change, in 2021 our risks were updated to incorporate ESG factors across all relevant risks across the Group.\n\nIn 2022, we plan to further enhance our assessment of the transitional and physical climate risks and opportunities through conducting further analysis.\n\nIt is envisaged that the transitional climate risk will remain as a separate risk, and the physical climate risks and opportunities will be reflected further as necessary, in individual DRBU and functional risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee our Group risk factor for climate change on page 321 and details of our risk management and internal control procedures on pages 124.",

        "page_content": "## Metrics and Targets\n\nWe have been reporting against energy and carbon emissions metrics since 2001 and set out our first long-term targets in our 2007 Annual Report to reduce Scopes 1 and 2 CO 2 e emissions intensity by 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2050 against our 2000 baseline. By the end of 2017, we had achieved a 42.7% reduction from that baseline.\n\nIn 2019, we set new long-term CO 2 e targets, and gained the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) formal approval for these.\n\nSince then, we have developed our commitment to addressing climate change, including accelerating our existing environmental targets to 2025 and committing to be carbon neutral across our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) by 2030 and net zero across our value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2050. In addition, we have incorporated internal carbon pricing into business plans to ensure the impact on environmental performance and targets are formally considered and quantified. This has supported the prioritisation of sustainability projects such as on-site renewable energy generation.\n\nThese actions are complemented by a range of other environmental targets and metrics, covering areas such as renewable energy, eliminating waste, water stewardship and biodiversity and afforestation.\n\nOur goals, targets and metrics are summarised in our ESG Roadmap on page 47, including performance in 2019, 2020 and 2021 in relation to carbon emissions, renewable energy, waste, water, and biodiversity to demonstrate trends and how we are consistently delivering improvements to our environmental performance.\n\nIn 2021, we signed up to the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign. * Race to Zero is the largest ever alliance aiming to halve global emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The campaign represents over 4,000 businesses estimated to cover nearly 25% of global CO 2 emissions and more than 50% of GDP.\n\nLimiting the rise in average global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels requires major and widespread action and companies have an important role to play. ** We are realigning our existing CO 2 e emission targets with this trajectory and set a new target for net-zero carbon emissions across our value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by no later than 2050.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWe recognise that the impact of climate change is uncertain and will be affected by multiple factors including severity of climate variation and extent of government regulation.\n\nThrough the adoption of the TCFD recommendations we have sought to analyse, as best as possible, the impact of potential outcomes considering two climate scenarios over the short, medium, and long term time horizons, however our assessments will need to continually evolve to respond to new information and insights.\n\nIn light of this evolving landscape, our work will continue in 2022 to further strengthen our approach including the consideration of the following focus areas:\n\n- - further embedding climate-related considerations into our business and strategic decision making, financial planning, as well as governance and risk management frameworks;\n- - continuing to identify opportunities to further strengthen our activities to manage and mitigate climate-related risks and build climate-change resilience;\n- - continuing to work with our suppliers to enhance data relating to our Scope 3 emissions;\n- - continuing to monitor ESG measures and drive performance across our comprehensive suite of objectives across all areas of ESG;\n- - continuing to identify, assess, manage, and disclose climate-related risks and opportunities;\n- - reviewing our metrics and targets to ensure they remain aligned with our strategy and risk management processes, and best practice guidelines;\n- - enhancing our assessment of the transitional and physical climate risks and opportunities through further analysis; and\n- - tailoring future disclosures, taking into account key government, investor, and other stakeholder frameworks and guidance.\n- *  Via the Science Based Targets Business Ambition for 1.5C Campaign.",

The new brand has been brought to life through our social media channels and on our revamped website careers.bat.com . The updated site leverages the latest technologies to personalise a candidate's experience, with round-the-clock support in 14 languages. In 2021, 44% of our external recruits brought new capabilities into the organisation to accelerate our business transformation.\n\nOur unwavering commitment and investment into the development of leadership and functional 'must win' capabilities has resulted in an average of 17.9 training hours delivered per full-time equivalent (FTE), with an average of \u00a3311 invested per FTE in 2021. This included 239 training programmes delivered across our leadership, functional and digital portfolios.\n\nAll functional 'must win' capabilities have foundational learning programmes in place, creating a level playing field of knowledge and skills, with 31% of programmes developing advanced level capabilities. In the leadership space, over 6,600 employees attended our core leadership programmes, including four international cohorts of our Women in Leadership programme and two cohorts of our Global Graduate Academy.\n\nTo enable quantity, while ensuring quality of all our programmes, we have shifted all our programmes to 100% virtual format.\n\nThis has been a game changer, making it more accessible for more people across the Group. Our digital learning platform, The GRID, is the gateway to our learning portfolio - accessible to 100% of our management population, providing digital learning anytime, anywhere. In addition, over 13,000 managers have completed our leadership potential assessment - Leadermeter, which enables early identification of talent for accelerated development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can read about our Group risk factor related to talent on page 320\n\n## Inclusive Culture\n\nWe are focused on creating a supportive and inclusive culture where all our people can flourish.\n\nOur SoBC Respect in the Workplace Policy makes clear our commitment to providing equal opportunities to, and fair treatment of, all our employees and to creating an inclusive workforce by promoting employment equality. The policy was updated in 2021 to include enhanced provisions relating to not practising any form of unlawful discrimination, providing fair wages and benefits and supporting employees' work-life balance. Our revised SoBC takes effect from January 2022.\n\nWe are official signatories to the UK Race at Work Charter for supporting equality and race in the workplace. We are also certified as a level 1 Disability Confident Committed employer under the UK Government's accreditation scheme. This demonstrates our commitment to providing equal opportunities for disabled employees, training and development for them, and reasonable adjustments and support in the workplace and in recruitment processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee retention\n\nIn 2021, total voluntary turnover of management-grade employees was 1,236, representing 8.6% of our Group's total management population.\n\nVoluntary turnover rate for all employees across our Group in 2021 was 9.1%.\n\n## Diversity\n\nRepresentation of women on senior leadership teams was 24% in 2019, 27% in 2020 and 27% in 2021.\n\n## Senior managers: Companies Act 2006\n\nFor the purposes of disclosure under Section 414C(8) of the Companies Act 2006, the Group had 181 male and 42 female senior managers as at 31 December 2021.

As we transform our business, we need fresh, diverse skills, perspectives and mindsets to challenge the status quo and drive innovation. Our diversity and inclusion (D&I) strategy is built on the following three pillars and underpinned by an inclusive culture.\n\nPillar 1 Driving ownership\n\nand accountability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnsuring ownership of, and accountability for, our D&I strategy across all business areas and leadership teams is key to driving progress and achieving our 2025 ambitions.\n\nOur Director for Talent, Culture and Inclusion has overall responsibility for all employee and human resources matters, while our Management Board oversees the development and management of talent within the Group's regions and functions.\n\nOur D&I governance structure ensures clear accountability for our business leaders and leadership teams for achieving our 2025 ambitions. This includes a D&I dashboard and quarterly reviews by our Management Board to ensure close monitoring of progress and plans. Diversity also remains fully embedded in our talent review processes and meetings across all levels of the Group.\n\nOur 'Diversity Champions' continue to be key in driving D&I initiatives throughout the organisation. Our 'Mastering Inclusion' training helps to further empower our people and increase their awareness. In 2021, more than 8,300 employees completed the training. We also launched a new D&I toolkit for all our managers in 2021, as well as LGBT+ and Race and Ethnicity Allyship Guides.\n\nPillar 2 Building diverse talent pipelines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe focus on building diverse talent pipelines at all levels of the organisation through recruiting, developing and retaining the best diverse talent.\n\nIn 2021, the proportion of women in management roles was 39% and 27% on senior leadership teams - we are committed to increase these by 2025 to 45% and 40%, respectively. To achieve this, we are focused on recruiting, developing and retaining the best female talent.\n\nIn 2021, 47% of our external management-level recruits were women. Women also comprised 51% of our new graduate intake in 2021, helping to build a sustainable pipeline of future female leaders. We also provide a range of training, mentoring, coaching and sponsorship programmes to support women's development.\n\nAs well as striving for gender balance, we focus on diversity of nationalities and ethnicities. Our target is for at least a 50% spread of distinct nationalities in all our regional and functional leadership teams. We have 141 different nationalities, from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds, in management roles across the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead about our Global Graduate Programme at www.bat-careers.com/graduates\n\nPillar 3 Creating enablers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo realise our diversity ambitions, we know we must have enablers in place that provide a supportive environment for people to thrive and realise their full potential.\n\nWe provide women and diverse groups with an opportunity to connect, engage and share experiences, such as through our Women in BAT UK and our B-United LGBT+ communities. And our Parents@BAT programme continues to provide a range of benefits to support new parents working in all BAT businesses worldwide. In 2021, the return rate from parental leave was 95% for women and 99% for men.\n\nWe work to continually raise awareness of diversity issues through campaigns and events that showcase best practice and provide platforms for role models to amplify their profiles across the Group. For example, each year, we celebrate events such as National Inclusion Week, International Women's Day and International Day of Women and Girls in Science.\n\nFollowing a successful pilot in the UK in 2020, we launched our IGNITE programme in eight more countries in 2021. IGNITE focuses on supporting experienced professionals returning to the workplace after a career break.",

The Group has a range of well-established engagement channels worldwide covering the Group's global workforce 1 , including:\n\n- - market and site visits by our Directors and Management Board members to meet local employees;\n- - town halls and listening sessions;\n- - meetings with works councils, trade unions and the European Employee Council;\n- - global, functional and regional webcasts, and webcasts and podcasts with the Chief Executive and Management Board members;\n- - our global 'Your Voice' employee survey every two years, most recently in 2021;\n- - our annual global leaders meeting with the top 120 senior leaders across the Group; and\n- - global, independently-managed and multilingual Speak Up channels, discussed further on page 57.\n\nThese engagement channels are implemented as appropriate for the composition of local workforce populations, at market, regional or functional levels. With COVID-19 continuing to affect our ways of working throughout the year, workforce engagement forums in 2021 continued to be conducted primarily through virtual formats, leveraging the success of Group digital transformation initiatives.\n\nGiven the scale, spread and diversity of the Group's workforce, the Board considers it effective to use these established engagement channels, augmented by Group-wide reporting structures to capture feedback from engagement at market, regional and functional levels.\n\nEmployee feedback from workforce engagement channels is collected across the Group and analysed to define priority themes. Consolidated feedback and themes from engagement are reviewed by our Board each year, as part of our Workforce Voice in the Boardroom programme.\n\nThis focuses on ensuring the Board understands the views of our workforce, and reviews details of the key themes identified and how we have responded. Feedback from the Board, with associated action planning, is cascaded back across our workforce and the Board is kept updated on progress against identified actions during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind out about how our Board engages with our global workforce on page 108\n\nThe overarching themes identified from engagement in 2021 related to transformation, innovation and staying connected (particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic). We have responded to this feedback with a range of initiatives, including enhanced communications activities to increase our connectivity and provide greater visibility of the Group's work around transformation and innovation.\n\nFor example, we held a virtual TIME: Technology Inspiring a Modern Enterprise Automation summit in 2021, demonstrating how our digital transformation can empower our people. Broadcast live and available to all Group company employees, the four-day summit saw speakers from the business and tech world join BAT senior leaders to discuss how automation is changing our lives.\n\nWe also held a global competition for employees to develop creative and engaging videos about the Group's strategic purpose. This provided an opportunity for employees to share what makes them proud to work for BAT and what it means to be part of the Group's transformation. In addition, we published a new Science & Innovation Report in 2021 and introduced quarterly science updates, providing our employees with details of the latest developments in tobacco harm reduction science and innovation in a concise and engaging way.\n\n## Your Voice\n\nIn our 2021 Your Voice global employee survey, we were pleased to surpass our 2019 response rate with 93% of all employees globally choosing to respond (7% higher than our global FMCG comparator group).\n\nOur 2021 Your Voice results outperform our FMCG comparator group in most categories, with strong results in diversity and inclusion, people management, corporate responsibility and empowerment. Our 2021 results were 1% higher than our FMCG comparator group for our Employee Engagement Index and 4% higher than our FMCG comparator group for our High Performance Index. These results reflect a connected, committed, energised and high performing organisation.\n\nWe use these results as the basis for further shaping the priorities of the organisation.",

        "page_content": "## Our Employment Principles\n\nOur Employment Principles set out a common approach for our Group companies' policies and procedures, recognising that each Group company must take account of local labour law and practice, and the local political, economic and cultural context.\n\nIn developing our Employment Principles, we have sought the views of a cross-section of internal and external stakeholders, and have consulted with employee representatives and (where relevant) with our works councils. All Group companies have adopted our Employment Principles and, through our internal audit processes, are required to demonstrate how these are embedded into the workplace.\n\nIn addition to our Employment Principles, our Board Diversity Policy applies specifically to our Board and Management Board, discussed at page 119.\n\n## Responsible restructuring\n\nOur Employment Principles make clear that, where restructuring is necessary, we are committed to doing so in a responsible manner. Where such situations do occur, our companies adopt responsible local approaches and procedures to address each instance, such as severance pay and outplacement support to help displaced employees find alternative employment.\n\nIn 2021, we continued Project Quantum to restructure our business globally by redesigning management layers and eliminating duplications, while simultaneously reinvesting in new capabilities and roles to ensure delivery of our strategy.\n\n## Rewarding People\n\nOur SoBC makes clear our commitment to providing fair, clear and competitive wages and benefits. In line with good equal pay practices, we have clearly defined pay scales for all roles across the Group worldwide. This approach ensures pay, bonuses and benefits are consistently applied and not influenced by factors such as gender or ethnicity.\n\nReward is a key pillar in ensuring that we have the right people to drive the business forward. Reward is necessarily local and we strongly support this through global frameworks to ensure leading edge policies, processes and technology are available to all markets.\n\nBase pay rewards core competence relative to skills, experience and contribution to the Group, while annual bonuses, long-term incentives, recognition schemes and ad hoc incentives provide the right mix to ensure that sustained high performance is recognised and rewarded.\n\nOur annual bonus and long-term incentive plans are aligned throughout the organisation, with eligible employees participating in plans with the same performance metrics as the Executive Directors, supporting line of sight throughout the organisation. We also offer our UK employees the chance to share in our success via our Sharesave Scheme, Partnership Share Scheme and Share Reward Scheme, and operate several similar schemes for employees in our Group companies. Our approach to rewarding Group company employees is discussed further at page 163.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind details of our Directors' Remuneration Policy on pages 152-165\n\n## Equal pay for equal work\n\nWe have been reporting data relating to UK gender pay gaps since 2017 in accordance with UK statutory requirements. For 2021, we have extended the scope of our voluntary reporting to include, for the first time, gender pay gap data for an additional eight markets, representing approximately 40% of our Group company employees. We have also published ethnicity pay gap data for UK employees for 2021.\n\nWe recognise that we have a gender pay gap in the UK, which refers to the percentage difference between the average pay for men and women and is not to be confused with equal pay for equal work. This situation is particular to the UK, which is home to our global headquarters, where at present we have more men than women in senior leadership roles.\n\nGender pay data from our international markets provides a broader assessment of our business and demonstrates that pay gaps are negligible or are in favour of women. In addition, we worked with a specialist consultancy in 2021 to conduct a Pay Equity Review on the data across nine countries, including the UK. The consolidated results show men and women are paid within 1% of one another for doing the same work or work of equal value across those countries. This confirms that our global efforts to provide fair compensation based on legitimate drivers of pay are working. In early 2022, we gained independent accreditation for our Pay Equity Review from Fair Pay Workplace, a non-profit organisation. Certification demonstrates a further commitment to Pay Equity, moving from self-disclosure to demonstrable actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind out more, including our statutory UK gender pay gap data, in our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report, available at www.bat.com/genderpayreport\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Our policies and principles              | Summary of areas covered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Stakeholder groups    | Stakeholder groups    |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Employment Principles *                  | Employment practices, including commitments to diversity, reasonable  working hours, family-friendly policies, employee wellbeing, talent,  performance, equal opportunities, and fair, clear and competitive  remuneration and benefits and responsible restructuring.                | Our People            |                       |\n| Health and Safety Policy  *              | Health, safety and welfare of all employees, other members of our  workforce and third-party personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                | Our People  Suppliers | Customers             |\n| Standards of Business  Conduct (SoBC)  * | Topics including respect in the workplace: promoting equality and  diversity; preventing harassment and bullying; fair wages and benefits;  and supporting work-life balance; as well as human rights, health, safety,  welfare and compliance with our Group Data Privacy Procedures. | Our People            |                       |\n| Group Data  Privacy Procedure            | The manner in which BAT processes personal data about all individuals,  including consumers, employees, contractors and employees  of suppliers.                                                                                                                                       | Our People  Consumers | Suppliers   Customers |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  These policies and principles are endorsed by our Board, are adopted by all Group companies and support the effective identification, management and mitigation of risks and issues for our business in these and other areas.

On an adjusted, constant currency basis, profit from operations grew 5.2%, despite a further incremental increase in New Category investment;\n- -Diluted EPS up 6.0%. Adjusted diluted EPS up 6.6% at constant rates of exchange;\n- -Deleveraging continued @ to 3.0x @ , driven by strong cash generation;\n- -Dividend per share up 1.0% at 217.8p; and\n- -Share repurchase programme of \u00a32 billion announced for 2022.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn the reporting of financial information, the Group uses certain measures that are not defined by IFRS, the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) under which the Group reports. The Group believes that these additional measures, which are used internally, are useful to users of the financial information in helping them understand the underlying business performance.\n\nThe principal non-GAAP measures which the Group uses are adjusted revenue, adjusted revenue from New Categories, adjusted profit from operations,\n\nadjusted diluted earnings per share, @ operating cash flow conversion ratio, and free cash flow (before and after) dividends @ . Adjusting items are significant items in revenue, profit from operations, net finance costs, taxation and the Group's share of the post-tax results of associates and joint ventures which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Group's underlying financial performance. As an additional measure to indicate the results of the Group before the impact of exchange rates on the Group's results, the movement in adjusted revenue, revenue from New Categories, adjusted profit from operations, adjusted net finance costs and adjusted diluted earnings per share are all also shown at constant rates of exchange.\n\nThese non-GAAP measures are explained, defined and reconciled from the most comparable GAAP metric on pages 304 to 313 and note 2 in the Notes on the Accounts. As reported in 2020, from 2021 adjusted revenue from the Strategic Portfolio ceased to be a KPI.\n\n## Revenue\n\nIn 2021, revenue was \u00a325,684 million (down 0.4%), with 2020 also marginally lower (down 0.4%) than 2019 at \u00a325,776 million. New Categories performed well in both years with revenue up 42.4% in 2021 and 14.9% in 2020. Strong pricing in combustibles drove price/mix of 4.3% in 2021 (2020: 7%), with 2021 lower than 2020 due to negative geographic mix as markets began to recover from COVID-19, an estimated \u00a3260 million impact in Australasia (due to a structural change in excise and competitive pricing environment) and the negative impact of the sale of the Group's operations in Iran, partially offset by an estimated \u00a3200 million benefit from trade inventory movements in the U.S. mainly linked to the timing of price increases and uncertainty about a potential excise increase. Cigarette volume was largely in line with 2020 at 637 billion sticks (2020: 4.6% decline to 638 billion sticks).\n\nCOVID-19 was a headwind in 2020 of approximately 2.5%, largely due to restrictions in South Africa and a number of other markets across the Group, including the Group's Global Travel Retail (GTR) business. During 2021, GTR continued to be impacted by the ongoing global travel restrictions.\n\nTranslational foreign exchange impacted both years, being a headwind of 7.3% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2020, due to the relative strength of sterling, which more than offset the operational performance and led to the decline in both years. Excluding the impact of currency (and excise on bought-in goods which affected 2019), adjusted revenue at constant rates of exchange increased 6.9% (2020: up 3.3%).\n\n## Reconciliation of revenue to adjusted revenue at constant rates\n\n|                                    | 2021   | 2021                | 2020 2019   | 2020 2019           | 2020 2019   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|\n|                                    | \u00a3m     | Change %  (vs 2020) | \u00a3m          | Change %  (vs 2019) | \u00a3m          |\n| Revenue                            | 25,684 | -0.4%               | 25,776      | -0.4%               | 25,877      |\n| Adjusting items                    | -      | -                   | -           | -                   | (50)        |\n| Adjusted revenue                   | 25,684 | -0.4%               | 25,776      | -0.2%               | 25,827      |\n| Impact of exchange                 | 1,877  |                     | 894         |                     |             |\n| Adjusted revenue at constant rates | 27,561 | +6.9%               | 26,670      | +3.3%               | 25,827      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDefinition: Change in revenue before the impact of adjusting items and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.",

During 2021, Project Quantum (the Group's restructuring and efficiency programme) delivered savings of \u00a3595 million in 2021, following \u00a3660 million in 2020.\n\n## Raw materials and other consumables\n\ncosts decreased 0.9% to \u00a34,542 million in 2021, following a decline of 0.3% to \u00a34,583 million in 2020. In 2021, our raw material costs were negatively impacted by a transactional foreign exchange headwind of 1.7%, offset by savings and translational tailwind (on costs). The decrease in 2020 was mainly due to the end of the contract manufacturing agreement which, due to excise recognition on bought-in products under that arrangement, led to an increase (in prior years) in revenue and in raw materials and other consumables costs.\n\nEmployee benefit costs declined 1.0% to \u00a32,717 million (2020: down 14.8% to \u00a32,744 million). The reduction was partly due to translational foreign exchange, offsetting wage inflation and to operational efficiencies achieved through Quantum.\n\nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment costs decreased by \u00a3374 million to \u00a31,076 million in 2021 compared to a decrease of \u00a362 million to \u00a31,450 million in 2020. This includes the amortisation and impairment charges of \u00a3306 million (2020: \u00a3339 million) largely related to the trademarks and similar intangibles capitalised following recent acquisitions. Also included were goodwill impairment charges of \u00a354 million in Peru and \u00a33 million following the exit from Myanmar (both in 2021) and \u00a3197 million (in 2020) in respect of Malaysia, recognised due to the ongoing operational challenges in those markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nDefinition: Profit for the year before the impact of net finance costs/income, share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures and taxation on ordinary activities.\n\n## Other operating expenses declined\n\nby \u00a3199 million to \u00a37,468 million (2020: decrease of \u00a3184 million to \u00a37,667 million). The Group continued to incrementally increase the investment behind New Categories, with an increase in 2021 (compared to 2020) of \u00a3377 million, itself an increase on 2019 of \u00a3346 million, in part funded by the efficiencies delivered by Quantum.\n\nAdjusting items included within profit from operations totalled \u00a3916 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a31,403 million). These related to:\n\n- - trademark amortisation and impairment (2021: \u00a3306 million; 2020: \u00a3339 million);\n- - other litigation costs of \u00a380 million (2020: \u00a3487 million) which in 2021 was in respect of other litigation costs of \u00a354 million (2020: \u00a387 million) including Engle progeny and the net charge from settlements in Turkey and South Korea (\u00a326 million). 2020 also included a \u00a3400 million charge largely in respect of developments in cases regarding payment obligations under the state settlement agreements with Florida, Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi for brands previously sold to a third party;\n- - restructuring and integration costs of \u00a3150 million (2020: \u00a3408 million) partly related to Quantum which will simplify the business and create a more efficient and agile organisation to support the growth of New Categories;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDefinition: Change in profit from operations before the impact of adjusting items and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\n- - a credit, in 2021, of \u00a359 million as an accrual related to the Reynolds American dissenting shareholders was released on successful conclusion of that complaint;\n- - a credit, in 2021, of \u00a335 million following the partial buy-out of the pension fund in the U.S.; and\n- - charges in respect of the sale of the Group's operations in Iran (\u00a3358 million) in 2021, largely in respect of the write-off of certain assets and the reclassification, from reserves to the income statement, of foreign exchange.\n\nThe Group also recognised charges in respect of the impairment of goodwill of \u00a357 million in 2021 (related to Peru and Myanmar) and \u00a3209 million in 2020 (mainly in respect of Malaysia and Twisp) which was partly offset by a credit, in 2020, of \u00a340 million (related to the 2019 charge associated with the excise dispute in Russia).\n\n2020 also included an estimated \u00a3145 million in additional supply chain costs to maintain supply as a number of markets experienced temporary disruption due to COVID-19, with no material additional costs incurred in 2021.\n\n## Expenditure on research and development\n\nwas \u00a3304 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a3307 million) with a focus on products that could potentially reduce the risk associated with smoking conventional cigarettes.\n\n## Analysis of profit from operations, net finance costs and results from associates and joint ventures\n\n|                               | 2021        | 2021                | 2021         | 2021                    | 2021              | 2020        | 2020                | 2020         |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|\n|                               | Reported \u00a3m | Adjusting  items \u00a3m | Adjusted  \u00a3m | Impact  of exchange  \u00a3m | Adjusted at CC \u00a3m | Reported \u00a3m | Adjusting  items \u00a3m | Adjusted  \u00a3m |\n| Profit from operations        |             |                     |              |                         |                   |             |                     |              |\n| U.S.                          | 5,566       | 321                 | 5,887        | 456                     | 6,343             | 4,975       | 809                 | 5,784        |\n| APME                          | 1,287       | 430                 | 1,717        | 116                     | 1,833             | 1,472       | 381                 | 1,853        |\n| AmSSA                         | 1,496       | 94                  | 1,590        | 98                      | 1,688             | 1,553       | 65                  | 1,618        |\n| ENA                           | 1,885       | 71                  | 1,956        | 132                     | 2,088             | 1,962       | 148                 | 2,110        |\n| Total regions                 | 10,234      | 916                 | 11,150       | 802                     | 11,952            | 9,962       | 1,403               | 11,365       |\n| Net finance (costs)/income    | (1,486)     | 55                  | (1,431)      | (89)                    | (1,520)           | (1,745)     | 153                 | (1,592)      |\n| Associates and joint ventures | 415         | 12                  | 427          | 29                      | 456               | 455         | (13)                | 442          |\n| Profit before tax             | 9,163       | 983                 | 10,146       | 742                     | 10,888            | 8,672       | 1,543               | 10,215       |",

Adjusted profit from operations fell 1.9% to \u00a311,150 million, driven by the foreign exchange headwind. On a constant currency basis this would have been an increase of 5.2%. In 2020, adjusted profit from operations grew 2.1% to \u00a311,365 million, being an increase of 4.8% on a constant currency basis.\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nOperating margin in 2021 increased by 120 bps to 39.8% largely driven by lower charges in respect of items such as trademark amortisation, goodwill impairment, litigation and Quantum in 2021 compared to 2020, despite the impact of Iran described earlier. In 2020, operating margin was 38.6%, an increase of 380 bps as 2019 was impacted by a number of items (including Quebec and Russia) that did not repeat. These are described in note 6 in the Notes on the Accounts.\n\nIn 2021, adjusted operating margin declined 70 bps to 43.4%, compared to a growth of 100 bps in 2020 (to 44.1%). This was driven by the proportionate growth in New Categories revenue (with the Group continuing to invest in those categories), higher revenue in lower margin markets and a transactional foreign exchange headwind of 1.7%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDefinition: Adjusted profit from operations as a percentage of adjusted revenue.\n\n## Net Finance Costs\n\nIn 2021, net finance costs were \u00a31,486 million, a decrease of \u00a3259 million on 2020 which, at \u00a31,745 million, were \u00a3143 million higher than 2019.\n\nThe movement in 2021 was partly due to the impact of the charges incurred in 2020 (in relation to the redemptions and tender offer to repurchase certain bonds undertaken to de-risk the Group's future financing programme which did not repeat) and a translational foreign exchange tailwind due to the strength of sterling. Also in 2021, the Group issued perpetual hybrid bonds totalling \u20ac2 billion, recognised, in line with IAS 32 Financial Instruments , as equity. Interest on such instruments are recognised in reserves rather than as a charge to the income statement in net finance costs. In 2021, in line with IAS 33 Earnings Per Share , \u00a312 million has been recognised as a deduction to EPS similar to non-controlling interest. The increase in 2020 was also driven by a change in mix of borrowings towards the US dollar during the year (as the Group issued bonds totalling US$8.7 billion, \u20ac1.7 billion and \u00a30.5 billion).\n\nBefore adjusting items in respect of interest on a settlement in Turkey in 2021 (\u00a311 million), the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order (FIIGLO), as discussed on page 201 (\u00a320 million;\n\n2020: \u00a321 million) and, in 2020, net costs of \u00a3142 million in respect of the bond redemption combined with a net credit of \u00a310 million (largely in respect of interest in relation to the Russia excise dispute) and the translation impact of foreign exchange (in both years), adjusted net finance costs were 4.5% lower in 2021 and 5.9% higher in 2020. The Group's average cost of debt in 2021 was 3.5%, compared to 3.6% in 2020.\n\n## Associates and Joint Ventures\n\nAssociates largely comprised the Group's shareholding in its Indian associate, ITC. The Group's share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures, included at the pre-tax level under IFRS, decreased from \u00a3455 million to \u00a3415 million in 2021. This follows a decline in 2020 of 8.6% (from \u00a3498 million in 2019), as ITC continued to experience difficult trading conditions, including business disruption due to the impact of COVID-19.\n\nIncluded in the results for 2021 and 2020 are adjusting items, which included a gain of \u00a36 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a317 million), arising on the deemed disposal of part of the Group's shareholding in ITC (due to issuances of ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme).\n\nIn 2021, this was more than offset by other charges, including an \u00a318 million charge in 2021 as the Group recognised an impairment in Yemen.\n\nIn 2020, the Group recognised a \u00a34 million charge being the Group's share of charges recognised by ITC in respect of the cost of leaf tobacco stocks destroyed in a thirdparty warehouse fire.\n\nExcluding such adjusting items and the impact of translational foreign exchange, the Group's share of associates and joint ventures on an adjusted, constant currency basis increased 3.3% in 2021, to \u00a3456 million. In 2020, this was a decrease of 1.2% on 2019.\n\n## Analysis of profit from operations, net finance costs and results from associates and joint ventures\n\n|                               | 2020        | 2020                | 2020        | 2020                    | 2020              | 2019        | 2019                | 2019        |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|\n|                               | Reported \u00a3m | Adjusting  items \u00a3m | Adjusted \u00a3m | Impact  of exchange  \u00a3m | Adjusted at CC \u00a3m | Reported \u00a3m | Adjusting  items \u00a3m | Adjusted \u00a3m |\n| Profit from operations        |             |                     |             |                         |                   |             |                     |             |\n| U.S.                          | 4,975       | 809                 | 5,784       | 32                      | 5,816             | 4,410       | 626                 | 5,036       |\n| APME                          | 1,472       | 381                 | 1,853       | 56                      | 1,909             | 1,753       | 306                 | 2,059       |\n| AmSSA                         | 1,553       | 65                  | 1,618       | 178                     | 1,796             | 1,204       | 638                 | 1,842       |\n| ENA                           | 1,962       | 148                 | 2,110       | 30                      | 2,140             | 1,649       | 544                 | 2,193       |\n| Total regions                 | 9,962       | 1,403               | 11,365      | 296                     | 11,661            | 9,016       | 2,114               | 11,130      |\n| Net finance (costs)/income    | (1,745)     | 153                 | (1,592)     | (20)                    | (1,612)           | (1,602)     | 80                  | (1,522)     |\n| Associates and joint ventures | 455         | (13)                | 442         | 26                      | 468               | 498         | (25)                | 473         |\n| Profit before tax             | 8,672       | 1,543               | 10,215      | 302                     | 10,517            | 7, 912      | 2,169               | 10,081      |",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\n## Financial Performance Summary Continued\n\n## Tax\n\nIn 2021, the tax charge in the income statement was \u00a32,189 million, compared to \u00a32,108 million in 2020 and \u00a32,063 million in 2019.\n\nThe effective tax rates in the income statement are therefore a charge of 23.9% in 2021, 24.3% in 2020 and 26.1% in 2019. These are also affected by the inclusion of adjusting items described earlier and the associates and joint ventures' posttax profit in the Group's pre-tax results. Excluding these items, the underlying tax rate for subsidiaries was 24.7% in 2021, 24.9% in 2020 and 26.0% in 2019. The decrease in underlying tax rate in 2021 largely reflects the prior and current year tax reclaims in Brazil together with mix of profits.\n\nSee the section Non-GAAP measures on page 309 for the computation of underlying tax rates for the periods presented.\n\n## Tax strategy\n\nThe Group's global tax strategy is reviewed regularly by the Board. The operation of the strategy is managed by the Finance and Transformation Director and Group Head of Tax with the Group's tax position reported to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. The Board considers tax risks that may arise as a result of our business operations. In summary, the strategy includes:\n\n- - complying with all applicable laws and regulations in countries in which we operate;\n- - being open and transparent with tax authorities and operating to build mature professional relationships;\n- - supporting the business strategy of the Group by undertaking efficient management of our tax affairs in line with the Group's commercial activity;\n- - transacting on an arm's-length basis for exchanges of goods and services between companies within the Group; and\n- - engaging in pro-active discussions with tax authorities on occasions of differing legal interpretation.\n\nWhere resolution is not possible, tax disputes may proceed to litigation. The Group seeks to establish strong technical tax positions.\n\nWhere legislative uncertainty exists, resulting in differing interpretations, the Group seeks to establish that its position would be more likely than not to prevail. Transactions between Group subsidiaries are conducted on arm's-length terms in accordance with appropriate transfer pricing rules and OECD principles.\n\nThe tax strategy outlined above is applicable to all Group companies, including the UK Group companies. Reference to tax authorities includes HMRC.\n\nThe publication of this strategy is considered to constitute compliance with the duty under paragraph 16(2) Schedule 19 Part 2 of the UK Finance Act 2016.\n\nThe taxation on ordinary activities was a charge of \u00a32.2 billion in 2021, \u00a32.1 billion in 2020 and \u00a32.1 billion in 2019. Corporation Tax paid (due to the timing of Corporation Tax instalment payments which straddle different financial years) was \u00a32.3 billion in 2021, \u00a32.1 billion in 2020 and \u00a32.2 billion in 2019.\n\nOur tax footprint extends beyond Corporation Tax, including significant payment of employment taxes and other indirect taxes including customs and import duties. The Group also collects taxes on behalf of governments (including tobacco excise, employee taxes, VAT and other sales taxes). The total tax paid in 2021 of \u00a340.5 billion (2020: \u00a341.1 billion, 2019: \u00a341.4 billion) therefore consists of both taxes borne and taxes collected as shown in the table provided.\n\nIn addition to the major taxes, there are a host of other taxes the Group bears and collects such as transport taxes, energy and environmental taxes, and banking and insurance taxes.\n\nThe movements in deferred tax, taken through other comprehensive income, mainly relate to the change in the valuation of retirement benefits in the year, as disclosed in note 16 in the Notes on the Accounts.\n\n## Deferred tax asset/(liability)\n\n|                                                       | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   | 2019  \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Opening balance                                       | (15,780)   | (16,626)   | (17,432)   |\n| Difference on exchange                                | (148)      | 506        | 680        |\n| Changes in tax rates                                  | 158        | 133        | 47         |\n| Other credits/(charges) to the income statement       | 29         | 184        | (55)       |\n| Other (charges)/credits to other comprehensive income | (110)      | 23         | 138        |\n| Other movements                                       | -          | -          | (4)        |\n| Closing balance                                       | (15,851)   | (15,780)   | (16,626)   |\n\nMajor taxes paid 2021 (\u00a3bn)\n\n## \u00a340.5bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Major taxes paid\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n|                                            |   \u00a3bn |   \u00a3bn |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Tobacco excise  (collected)                |  31.6 |  32.2 |\n| Net VAT and other sales  taxes (collected) |   5.6 |   5.8 |\n| Corporation Tax   (borne)                  |   2.3 |   2.1 |\n| Customs and import  duties (borne)         |   0.3 |   0.3 |\n| Taxes paid by  employees (collected)       |   0.5 |   0.5 |\n| Employment taxes  (borne)                  |   0.2 |   0.2 |\n|                                            |  40.5 |  41.1 |",

        "page_content": "## Earnings Per Share\n\nProfit for the year was \u00a36,974 million, a 6.2% increase compared to \u00a36,564 million in 2020 (itself an increase of 12.2% on 2019). While the Group was impacted by foreign exchange headwinds, a good operational performance in both years was enhanced by efficiencies realised through Quantum and from a lower effective tax rate. Both 2021 and 2020 were impacted by a number of charges as described earlier with the improvement in profit for the year in 2020 (compared to 2019) also due to charges in relation to Quebec and Russia in 2019.\n\nConsequently, and after accounting for the movement in non-controlling interests in the year, basic earnings per share were 6.0% higher at 296.9p (2020: 280.0p; 2019: 249.7p). After accounting for the dilutive effect of employee share schemes, diluted earnings per share were 295.6p, 6.0% higher than 2020 (2020: 278.9p; 2019: 249.0p).\n\nEarnings per share are impacted by the adjusting items discussed earlier. Adjusted diluted EPS, as calculated in note 11 in the Notes on the Accounts, was down against the prior year by 0.8% at 329.0p, with 2020 ahead of 2019 by 2.4% at 331.7p. Adjusted diluted EPS at constant rates would have been 6.6% ahead of 2020 at 353.5p, with 2020 up 5.5% against 2019.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Group pays its dividends to shareholders over four quarterly interim dividends. Quarterly dividends provide shareholders with a more regular flow of dividend income and allow the Company to spread its substantial dividend payments more evenly over the year, aligning better with the cash flow generation of the Group and so enable the Company to fund the payments more efficiently. The Board seeks to reward shareholders with an increase in dividend, by reference to 65% of adjusted diluted EPS over the mid to long term.\n\nThe Board has declared an interim dividend of 217.8p per ordinary share of 25p, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 54.45p per ordinary share in May 2022, August 2022, November 2022 and February 2023. This represents an increase of 1.0% on 2020 (2020: 215.6p per share, up 2.5%) and a payout ratio, on 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share, of 66.2% (2020: 65.0%).\n\nThe quarterly dividends will be paid to shareholders registered on either the UK main register or the South Africa branch register and to ADS holders, each on the applicable record dates.\n\nUnder IFRS, the dividend is recognised in the year that it is approved by shareholders or, if declared as an interim dividend by Directors, in the period that it is paid.\n\nThe cash flow, prepared in accordance with IFRS, reflects the total cash paid in the period. Further details of the total amounts of dividends paid in 2021 and 2020 (with 2019 comparatives) are given in note 22 in the Notes on the Accounts.\n\nDividends are declared and payable in sterling except for those shareholders on the branch register in South Africa, where dividends are payable in rand. The equivalent dividends receivable by holders of ADSs in US dollars are calculated based on the exchange rate on the applicable payment date.\n\n## +6.6%\n\n-0.8%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nDefinition: Profit attributable to owners of BAT p.l.c. over weighted average number of shares outstanding, including the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nIFRS-GAAP\n\nNon-GAAP\n\nKPI\n\n\u00b7\n\nChange in adjusted diluted EPS (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDefinition: Change in diluted earnings per share before the impact of adjusting items.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nIFRS-GAAP\n\nNon-GAAP\n\nKPI\n\n\u00b7\n\nChange in adjusted diluted EPS at constant rates (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDefinition: Change in diluted earnings per share before the impact of adjusting items and the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nFurther details of the quarterly dividends and key dates are set out under 'Shareholder information' on pages 354 and 355.\n\nThe discussion of 2019 results that are not necessary to an understanding of the Group's financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations is excluded from this Financial Review in accordance with applicable US Securities laws. Discussion of such 2019 metrics is contained in the Group's Annual Report on Form 20-F 2020, which is available at bat.com/annualreport and has been filed with the SEC. Information contained in pages 34 to 42, pages 65 to the first column on page 72 and from the heading 'Retirement benefit schemes' on page 72 to page 73 of the Annual Report on Form 20-F 2020 are accordingly incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 20-F 2021 only to the extent such information pertains to the Group's financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended 31 December 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\n## Treasury and Cash Flow\n\n## Treasury, Liquidity and Capital Structure\n\nThe Treasury Function is responsible for raising finance for the Group and managing the Group's cash resources and the financial risks arising from underlying operations. Clear parameters have been established, including levels of authority, on the type and use of financial instruments to manage the financial risks facing the Group. Such instruments are only used if they relate to an underlying exposure; speculative transactions are expressly forbidden under the Group's treasury policy. All these activities are carried out under defined policies, procedures and limits, reviewed and approved by the Board, delegating oversight to the Finance and Transformation Director and Treasury Function. See note 26 in the Notes on the Accounts for further detail.\n\nIt is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of sources. The Group targets an average centrally managed debt maturity of at least five years of which no more than 20% matures in a single rolling year. As at 31 December 2021, the average centrally managed debt maturity was 10.1 years (2020: 9.9 years) with the highest proportion maturing in a single rolling 12-month period was 18.6% (2020: 16.4%).\n\nIn order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt. The Group sets targets (within overall guidelines) for the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on a net basis (at least 50% fixed on a net basis in the short to medium term). At 31 December 2021, the relevant ratio of floating to fixed rate borrowings was 10:90 (2020: 7:93). As part of the management of liquidity, funding and interest rate risk, the Group regularly evaluates market conditions and may enter into transactions, from time to time, to repurchase outstanding debt, pursuant to open market purchases, tender offers or other means.\n\nThe Group continues to maintain investment-grade credit ratings*, with ratings from Moody's/S&P at Baa2 (stable outlook)/BBB+ (stable outlook), @ respectively, with a medium-term rating target of Baa1/BBB+. @ The strength of the ratings has underpinned debt issuance and the Group is confident of its ability to successfully access the debt capital markets.\n\n- *  A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. A credit rating may be subject to withdrawal or revision at any time. Each rating should be evaluated separately of any other rating.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group's floating rate borrowings have no exposure in relation to IBOR reform as its floating rate bond of US$750 million is due to mature in August 2022 before the USD LIBOR ceases.\n\nAdditionally, the Group has hedging instruments that are indexed to sterling LIBOR interest rates. The Group signed up to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallback Protocol as published by the International Swaps and Derivative Association Inc., ensuring that appropriate fallback rates will apply in relation to derivatives that are impacted by LIBOR cessation and therefore certainty on the basis of the further cash flows. The hedge relationship on these derivatives will continue with the resulting ineffectiveness likely to be immaterial.\n\n## Available facilities\n\nThe Group maintains a \u00a325 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme, and US (US$4 billion) and European (\u00a33 billion) commercial paper programmes to accommodate the liquidity needs of the Group. At 31 December 2021, there was \u00a3269 million commercial paper outstanding (2020: nil outstanding). Cashflows relating to commercial paper that have maturity periods of three months or less are presented on a net basis in the Group's cashflow statement.\n\nThe Group's main bank facility is a syndicated \u00a35.85 billion committed revolving credit facility. This facility was undrawn at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: undrawn). In 2021, the Group exercised the first of the one-year extension options on both tranches of the revolving credit facility, with the second one-year extension subsequently exercised in February 2022. Effective March 2022, therefore, the \u00a32.85 billion 364-day tranche will be extended to March 2023 at the reduced amount of \u00a32.7 billion and \u00a32.5 billion of the five-year tranche will be extended from March 2026 to March 2027 (with \u00a33.0 billion of this tranche remaining available until March 2025 and \u00a32.85 billion remaining available from March 2025 to March 2026).\n\nDuring 2021, the Group extended short-term bilateral facilities totalling \u00a32.5 billion until March or April 2022, some with extension options to extend for further periods. As at 31 December 2021, \u00a3500 million was drawn on a short-term basis. Of such short-term bilateral facilities, in December 2021, the Group amended and extended a total of \u00a3500 million until December 2022 and subsequent to year end, the Group amended and extended a further \u00a3500 million until January 2023 and effective April 2022, an additional \u00a3350 million was agreed to be extended until October 2022 and \u00a3500 million until\n\nApril 2023. Cashflows relating to bilateral facilities that have maturity periods of three months or less are presented on a net basis in the Group's cashflow statement.\n\nIn July 2019, the Group filed a shelf registration statement on Form F-3 with the SEC pursuant to which B.A.T Capital Corporation and B.A.T. International Finance p.l.c. may issue debt securities guaranteed by certain members of the Group from time to time. This forms part of the Group's strategy to ensure flexible and agile access to capital markets and the registration statement is initially valid for three years.\n\n## Use of facilities\n\nThese facilities ensure that the Group has access to funding to supplement the cash available or generated by the business in the period to meet the operational (including working capital) and general corporate requirements including, but not limited to, the timing of payments in relation to:\n\n- - dividends (2021: \u00a34.9 billion; 2020: \u00a34.8 billion);\n- - capital expenditure (2021: \u00a30.6 billion; 2020: \u00a30.6 billion);\n- - MSA in the U.S. (2021: \u00a32.7 billion; 2020: \u00a32.2 billion);\n- - refinancing obligations;\n- - share repurchase programme, as announced for 2022 (\u00a32 billion); and\n- - other corporate activity such as litigation or acquisitions as relevant.\n\nManagement believes that the Group has sufficient working capital for present requirements, taking into account the amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities and levels of cash and cash equivalents, and the ongoing ability to generate cash.\n\n## Issuance, drawdowns and repayment in the period\n\nIn 2021, the Group repaid:\n\n- - \u20ac650 million, \u00a3500 million, \u20ac1.1 billion, CHF 400 million and \u20ac500 million bonds at maturity; and\n- - the \u00a31,929 million term loan that had a maturity date in January 2022.\n\nAlso in 2021, the Group issued perpetual\n\nhybrid bonds totalling \u20ac2 billion. The issuance allowed the Group to raise incremental euro-denominated securities, which contributed to a more efficient alignment of the Group's earnings currency. It also contributes to the diversification of the Group's sources of funding and further strengthens its capital structure. The issuance provided the additional benefit of supporting the deleveraging journey with the addition of a small benefit to the credit metrics.",

Also in 2020 as part of the de-risking programme, the Group repurchased and redeemed \u00a33.1 billion of debt maturing in 2021 and 2022, reducing the 'tower' of debt due for repayment in 2022.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\n## Net cash generated from operating activities\n\nNet cash generated from operating activities decreased by 0.7% to \u00a39,717 million in 2021, compared to an increase of \u00a3790 million to \u00a39,786 million in 2020. 2021 was negatively impacted by a translational foreign exchange headwind and the timing of MSA payments in the U.S. and higher tax payments (mainly in Canada and the U.S.). These were largely offset by favourable movement in inventories (as stock builds in Australia in 2020 did not repeat), and lower payments in respect of litigation (2021: \u00a3248 million; 2020: \u00a3464 million). 2020 included the payment of the settlement agreed in 2019 in respect of the excise dispute in Russia (\u00a3205 million), U.S. litigation (including \u00a3169 million in respect of the Florida judgment described earlier). 2020 was also impacted by working capital movements driven by COVID-19 of \u00a3131 million.\n\n## Net cash used in investing activities\n\nIn 2021, net cash used in investing activities increased to \u00a31,140 million (2020: \u00a3783 million), largely due to a net outflow of \u00a3228 million from short-term investment products, including treasury bills (2020: \u00a3159 million net outflow), the disposal of the Group's operations in Iran (\u00a398 million) and the purchase of the equity stake in Organigram. Purchases of property, plant and equipment were largely in line with 2020, at \u00a3527 million (2020: \u00a3511 million).\n\nIn 2021, the Group invested \u00a3664 million, in gross capital expenditure, an increase of 2.5% on the prior year (2020: \u00a3648 million). This includes purchases of property, plant and equipment and certain intangibles, and the investment in the Group's global operational infrastructure (including, but not limited to, the manufacturing network, trade marketing software and IT systems and the expansion of our New Categories portfolio). The Group expects gross capital expenditure in 2022 of \u00a3750 million.\n\n## Net cash used in financing activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities was an outflow of \u00a38,749 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a37,897 million outflow), with the outflow in each year largely driven by:\n\n- - dividend payments (2021: \u00a34,904 million, up 3.4%; 2020: \u00a34,745 million, up 3.2%, with the growth in both years driven by the higher dividend per share); and\n- - the net repayment of borrowings (2021: \u00a33,865 million; 2020: \u00a3807 million) partly offset by the issuance of the hybrid bonds (\u00a31,685 million in 2021).\n\nIn 2021, interest paid declined 14.9% to \u00a31,479 million (2020: \u00a31,737 million), with the movements largely driven by charges in relation to the refinancing programme in 2020 that did not repeat.\n\n## Summary cash flow\n\n|                                                      | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m     | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|\n| Cash generated from operations                       | 11,678    | 11,567      | 10,948    |\n| Dividends received from associates                   | 353       | 351         | 252       |\n| Tax paid                                             | (2,314)   | (2,132)     | (2,204)   |\n| Net cash generated from operating activities         | 9,717     | 9,786       | 8,996     |\n| Net cash used in investing activities                | (1,140)   | (783)       | (639)     |\n| Net cash used in financing activities                | (8,749)   | ( 7, 8 97 ) | (8,593)   |\n| Differences on exchange                              | (253)     | (253)       | (57)      |\n| (Decrease)/increase in net cash and cash equivalents | (425)     | 853         | (293)     |\n\nIn 2021, the Group repaid borrowings of \u00a34.8 billion and issued \u00a31.0 billion of new borrowings, while the Group issued perpetual hybrid bonds totalling \u20ac2 billion (\u00a31.7 billion). The Group repaid borrowings of \u00a310.6 billion in 2020, including \u00a33.1 billion as part of the Group's liquidity management strategy to de-risk future financing, largely offset by new borrowings of \u00a39.8 billion. Please refer to note 26 in the Notes on the Accounts for further details.\n\n## Free cash flow (before and after dividends paid to shareholders) @\n\nFree cash flow (before dividends paid to shareholders), as defined on page 311, was \u00a37,447 million, up 2.1% on the prior year (2020: up 11.9% to \u00a37,295 million; 2019: \u00a36,519 million). The increase in 2021 was largely due to the lower outflows related to adjusting items (2021: \u00a3501 million; 2020: \u00a3732 million), lower interest paid in the year (down \u00a3258 million to \u00a31,479 million, due to the impact of the refinancing programme undertaken in 2020), which more than offset the movement in net cash generated from operations described above. Net capital expenditure was marginally higher (2021: \u00a3632 million; 2020: \u00a3605 million). After payment of dividends to shareholders, free cash flow was \u00a32,543 million (2020: \u00a32,550 million; 2019: \u00a31,921 million). @\n\n## Cash flow conversion\n\nThe conversion of profit from operations to net cash generated from operating activities may indicate the Group's ability to generate cash from the profits earned. Based upon net cash generated from operating activities, the Group's conversion rate was 95% compared to 98% in 2020, which was largely in line with 2019.\n\n@ Operating cash flow conversion ratio (based upon adjusted profit from operations) was in line with 2020 at 104% (2020: 103%), itself an increase on 2019 (97%). The performance in 2021 was partly due to the positive impact of the Australia stock build in 2020 not repeating. See page 310 for further information on this measure. @\n\n## Restricted cash\n\nCash and cash equivalents include restricted amounts of \u00a31,024 million (2020: \u00a3878 million) due to subsidiaries in CCAA protection (as described in note 32 in the Notes on the Accounts), as well as \u00a3305 million (2020: \u00a3455 million) principally due to exchange control restrictions, including amounts of \u00a392 million (2020: \u00a3141 million) where the underlying restrictions are expected to be short-term in nature.\n\n- @ Denotes phrase, paragraph or similar that does not form part of BAT's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other\n\n## Borrowings and Net Debt\n\nTotal borrowings (which includes lease liabilities) declined to \u00a339,658 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a343,968 million) largely due to the refinancing undertaken in 2021 (with the \u20ac2 billion perpetual hybrid bonds issued in the year recognised as equity) and the net repayment of borrowings in the year (partly due to the cash flow generated by the business in the period). The value of borrowings is also impacted by the relative movement of sterling against other currencies, particularly the US dollar and the euro. In 2021, this was a tailwind of \u00a3409 million compared to a tailwind of \u00a3219 million in 2020.\n\nTotal borrowings includes \u00a3754 million (31 December 2020: \u00a3790 million) in respect of the purchase price adjustments related to the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc.\n\nAs discussed on page 80, the Group remains confident about its ability to access the debt capital markets successfully and reviews its options on a continuing basis.\n\nNet debt is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as total borrowings (including related derivatives and lease liabilities) less cash and cash equivalents and current investments held at fair value.\n\nNet debt, at 31 December 2021, was \u00a336,302 million (2020: \u00a340,241 million; 2019: \u00a342,574 million), with the movement in net debt largely due to the net repayment of borrowings (partly enabled by the issuance of perpetual hybrid bonds) and a foreign exchange headwind of \u00a3124 million, primarily due to the movement of the US dollar against sterling (2020: \u00a369 million tailwind).\n\n@ The movement in net debt also includes the free cash flow before dividends earned in the year (2021: \u00a37,447 million; 2020: \u00a37,295 million) as described on page 81. This is partly offset by dividends paid to owners of the parent of \u00a34,904 million (2020: \u00a34,745 million). @\n\n## Adjusted Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA @\n\nThe Group uses adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, as defined on page 312, to assess its level of adjusted net debt in comparison to the earnings generated by the Group. This is deemed by management to reflect the Group's ability to service and repay borrowings.\n\nIn 2021, the ratio of adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 3.0 times, representing an improvement from 3.3 times at the end of 2020, itself an improvement from 3.5 times at the end of 2019.\n\nThe Group's adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is subject to the fluctuations in the foreign exchange market by virtue of the Group's foreign currency denominated earnings and the exposure of the debt portfolio to, predominantly, the US dollar. In 2021, due to the relative movement in sterling, the sterling value of adjusted net debt increased by \u00a3477 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange on the Group's reported results, adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined 0.5 times in 2021 (2020: down 0.3 times).\n\nRefer to page 312 for a full reconciliation from borrowings to adjusted net debt, profit for the year to adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, at both current and constant rates of exchange. @\n\n## Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) @\n\nThe Group's ROCE, calculated in accordance with our reported numbers, was 8.4% (2020: 8.2%) with the movement in 2021 largely due to the higher profit from operations.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, as defined on page 313, including dividends from associates and joint ventures (as a proxy to a return in the period, given the inclusion of the investment in associates and joint ventures in the Group's calculation of capital employed),\n\n## Reconciliation of total borrowings to adjusted net debt @\n\n|                                                                 | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total borrowings (including lease liabilities)                  | 39,658    | 43,968    | 45,366    |\n| Derivatives in respect of net debt: - assets                    | (273)     | (518)     | (527)     |\n| - liabilities                                                   | 182       | 172       | 384       |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                       | (2,809)   | (3,139)   | (2,526)   |\n| Current investments held at fair value                          | (456)     | (242)     | (123)     |\n| Net debt                                                        | 36,302    | 40,241    | 42,574    |\n| Purchase price adjustment (PPA) to Reynolds American Inc.  debt | (754)     | (790)     | (848)     |\n| Adjusted net debt                                               | 35,548    | 39,451    | 41,726    |\n\nadjusted ROCE grew from 9.0% in 2019 to 9.6% in 2020, and declined to 9.4% in 2021. This was due to the movement in adjusted profit from operations in the year and translational foreign exchange described earlier. @\n\n## Retirement Benefit Schemes\n\nThe Group's subsidiary undertakings operate defined benefit schemes, including pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes, and defined contribution schemes. The most significant arrangements are in the U.S., UK, Canada, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Together, schemes in these territories account for over 90% of the total underlying obligations of the Group's defined benefit arrangements and over 70% of the defined benefit net costs charged to adjusted profit from operations. Benefits provided through defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as payments fall due. The liabilities arising in respect of defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. It is Group policy that all schemes are formally valued at least every three years. Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded schemes, taking into account regulatory environments.\n\nThe present total value of funded scheme liabilities as at 31 December 2021 was \u00a310,084 million (2020: \u00a312,223 million), while unfunded scheme liabilities amounted to \u00a31,037 million (2020: \u00a31,147 million). The schemes' assets decreased to \u00a310,816 million from \u00a312,576 million in 2020, itself an increase from \u00a311,860 million in 2019. The overall net liability for all pension and healthcare schemes in Group subsidiaries amounted to \u00a3321 million at the end of 2021, compared to \u00a3810 million at the end of 2020.\n\nIn addition, during 2021, the risk profiles and values of amounts relating to retirement benefit arrangements were impacted by a partial buy-out in the U.S. and through buy-ins in the UK and Canada. Please refer to note 15 in the Notes on the Accounts for further details.\n\n## Litigation and Settlements\n\nAs discussed in note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts, various legal proceedings or claims are pending or may be instituted against the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Government Activity\n\nThe marketing, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years. For information about the risks related to regulation, see page 94 and pages 325 to 334.\n\n## Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\n\nExcept for certain indemnities, the Group has no significant off-balance sheet arrangements other than in respect of leaf purchase obligations. The Group has contractual obligations to make future payments on debt guarantees. In the normal course of business, it enters into contractual arrangements where the Group commits to future purchases of goods and services from unaffiliated and related parties. See page 316 for a summary of the contractual obligations as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## Accounting Policies\n\nThe application of the accounting standards and the accounting policies adopted by the Group are set out in the Group Manual of Accounting Policies and Procedures (GMAPP).\n\nGMAPP includes the Group instructions in respect of the accounting and reporting of business activities, such as revenue recognition, asset valuations and impairment testing, adjusting items, the accrual of obligations and the appraisal of contingent liabilities, which include taxes and litigation. Formal processes are in place whereby central management and end-market management confirm adherence to the principles and the procedures and to the completeness of reporting. Central analyses and revision of information are also performed to ensure and confirm adherence.\n\nIn order to prepare the Group's consolidated financial information in accordance with IFRS, management has used estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue, expenses and assets, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the date of the financial statements.\n\nThe critical accounting estimates are described in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts and include:\n\n- - review of asset values, including goodwill and impairment testing;\n- - estimation and accounting for retirement benefit costs; and\n- - estimation of provisions, including as related to taxation and legal matters.\n\nThe critical accounting judgements are described in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts and include:\n\n- - identification and quantification of adjusting items;\n- - determination as to whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims;\n- - determination as to whether control (subsidiaries), joint control (joint arrangements), or significant influence (associates) exist in relation to investments held by the Group;\n- - review of applicable exchange rates for transactions with and translation of entities in territories where there are restrictions on the free access to foreign currency or multiple exchange rates; and\n- - the determination as to whether perpetual hybrid bonds should be classified as equity instead of borrowings.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Rates\n\nThe principal exchange rates used to convert the results of the Group's foreign operations to sterling, for the purposes of inclusion and consolidation within the Group's financial statements, are indicated in the table below.\n\nWhere the Group has provided results at constant rates of exchange, this refers to the translation of the results from the foreign operations at rates of exchange prevailing in the prior period - thereby eliminating the potentially distorting impact of the movement in foreign exchange on the reported results.\n\n## Going Concern\n\nA description of the Group's business activities, its financial position, cash flows, liquidity position, facilities and borrowings position, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in this Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nThe key Group risks include analyses of financial risk and the Group's approach to financial risk management. Notes 23 and 26 in the Notes on the Accounts provide further detail on the Group's borrowings and management of financial risks.\n\nThe Group has, at the date of this report, sufficient existing financing available for its estimated requirements for at least the next 12 months and beyond in respect of general corporate purposes. This includes the payments arising in respect of the Master Settlement Agreement due in the U.S. in 2022 and other known liabilities or future payments (including interim dividends), as they fall due. Actions undertaken during 2021 and 2020 to de-risk future funding requirements, as previously described, provide further assurance with regards to the Group's financial viability.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, COVID-19 has demonstrated the Group's ability to navigate the uncertainties arising through operational, economic and societal volatility. Such challenges have been met through the Group's geographic diversity and ability to flex operations. This, together with the ability to generate cash from trading activities, the performance of the Group's Strategic Portfolio and its leading market positions in a number of countries, as well as numerous contracts with established customers and suppliers across different geographical areas and industries, provides the Directors with the confidence that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully in the context of current financial conditions and the general outlook in the global economy.\n\nAfter reviewing the Group's annual budget, plans and financing arrangements, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue operating and that it is therefore appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\n## Foreign exchange rates\n\n|                    | Average Closing   |   Average Closing |   Average Closing |   Average Closing |   Average Closing |   Average Closing |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                    | 2021              |          2020     |          2019     |          2021     |          2020     |          2019     |\n| Australian dollar  | 1.832             |             1.862 |             1.836 |             1.863 |             1.771 |             1.885 |\n| Brazilian real     | 7. 421            |             6.616 |             5.035 |             7.544 |             7.1   |             5.329 |\n| Canadian dollar    | 1.724             |             1.72  |             1.694 |             1.711 |             1.741 |             1.718 |\n| Euro               | 1.164             |             1.125 |             1.14  |             1.191 |             1.117 |             1.18  |\n| Indian rupee       | 101.702           |            95.097 |            89.898 |           100.684 |            99.88  |            94.558 |\n| Japanese yen       | 151.124           |           137.017 |           139.234 |           155.972 |           141.131 |           143.967 |\n| Russian rouble     | 101.388           |            92.844 |            82.623 |           101.592 |           101.106 |            82.282 |\n| South African rand | 20.335            |            21.099 |            18.437 |            21.617 |            20.079 |            18.525 |\n| US dollar          | 1.376             |             1.284 |             1.277 |             1.354 |             1.367 |             1.325 |\n\n<!-- image -->",

Excluding the impact of translational foreign exchange, this was an increase of 9.2% in 2021 (2020: up 11.2%). This was driven, in both years, by pricing (supported by our Revenue Growth Management (RGM) capabilities) in cigarettes, Vapour and Traditional Oral and the continued growth in vapour volume. 2021 also benefited (by an estimated \u00a3200 million) from trade inventory movements mainly linked to the timing of price increases and uncertainty about a potential excise increase. This was offset by a decline in combustible volume (lapping a strong comparator period). 2020 volume was positively impacted by resilient consumer demand resulting from the increase in fiscal stimulus, lower gas prices and an extra selling day combined with higher supply chain inventories.\n\nReported profit from operations increased 11.9% to \u00a35,566 million in 2021 (2020: up 12.8% to \u00a34,975 million). This was driven by the higher revenue (in both years), lower losses from Vuse in 2021, initiatives including marketing spend effectiveness and the benefit from trade inventory movements. This was also driven by lower adjusting items in 2021, related to the ongoing efficiency programmes (Quantum), credits related to the partial buy-out of the pension fund (\u00a335 million) and the finalisation of the dissenting shareholders litigation (\u00a359 million). These were lower than in 2020, which included a \u00a3400 million charge related to payment obligations under the state settlement agreements with Florida, Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi for brands previously sold to a third party.\n\nExcluding the adjusting items and the impact of a translational foreign exchange headwind, adjusted profit from operations increased by 9.7% (2020: 15.5%) on a constant currency basis.\n\n## New Categories\n\nIn 2021, Vuse performed well, gaining significant vapour value share and approaching value leadership, up 760 bps to 32.5% from 24.9% in 2020 and 16.6% in 2019.",

        "page_content": "- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking. These products are not risk free and are addictive.\n- \u2020  Our products as sold in the U.S., including Vuse, Velo, Grizzly, Kodiak, and Camel Snus, are subject to FDA regulation and no reduced-risk claims will be made as to these products without agency clearance.\n\nVapour consumable volume increased 67% (2020: up 70%), with revenue increasing 46.4% to \u00a3561 million (2020: up 85.1% to \u00a3383 million). This was a growth of 56.9% (2020: 86.1% increase), at constant rates of exchange, with pricing on consumables in the second half of 2021 offsetting the rollover impact of the negative mix from the successful launch of the quad-pack in 2020. The Alto variant now represents over 90% of Vuse revenues in the U.S., up from 83% in 2020 and 50% in 2019.\n\nIndustry vapour volumes were up 21.2% in 2021, following a decline of 13.1% in 2020 as the industry recovered from the effects of the EVALI crisis (in 2019) and implementation of the flavour regulations in early 2020.\n\nIn October 2021, Vuse Solo received the first marketing authorisation from the U.S. FDA as discussed below. We remain confident in the quality of the applications submitted for the rest of our New Category products, which are supported by scientific evidence that the continued marketing of our Vuse and Velo products is appropriate for the protection of public health.\n\nIn Modern Oral, volume increased by over 270% (2020: 45% higher) with volume share up 410 bps in 2021. Revenue declined 81.5% (2020: up 13.5%). The performance in 2021 was driven by promotional pricing and the national roll-out of the Velo-branded nicotine pouch products (available in over 110,000 stores), that were acquired in\n\n## Delivering on our New Categories\n\nThe U.S. business continues its accelerated journey towards A Better Tomorrow\u2122, delivering a year of outstanding results in New Categories.\n\nThat success was mainly driven by Vuse - its market share (by value) was up 760 bps vs 2020, despite an increasingly competitive environment, and is approaching national market leadership. This was balanced with continued investment and quick learning with Velo in the fast-growing Modern Oral category.\n\nVuse's exceptional performance is underpinned by a relentless focus on consumer acquisition and a unique device customisation platform, 'Vuse by U', a leading innovation for adult consumers seeking personal expression.\n\nVuse's adult consumer-centred platform is focused on driving conversion and retention with an expansive portfolio spanning three flavours, across three nicotine levels and three pod pack formats with the introduction of Single and Quad Pods.\n\nOctober 2020 from Dryft Sciences, LLC (Dryft). While growing year-on-year, driven by distribution expansion, the Modern Oral segment remains small, representing only 1.6% of total nicotine value share.\n\n## Combustibles\n\nCombustibles revenue was 0.9% higher in 2021 at \u00a310,015 million (2020: up 9.3% to \u00a39,926 million). However, excluding a translational foreign exchange headwind in both years, this was an increase of 8.1% (2020: 9.9% higher) at constant rates of exchange. The growth was driven by strong pricing (with four price increases announced in both 2021 and 2020, supported by our RGM capabilities) which more than offset a decline in volume of 5.0% to 70 billion sticks in 2021 (2020: 73 billion sticks; 0.5% increase). In 2021, the Group benefited from trade inventory movements (mainly linked to the timing of price increases and uncertainty about a potential excise increase) which are expected to unwind in 2022. Excluding this, volume would have been down 7.0%. Industry volume was down 6.5%, driven by rising gas prices and the partial unwinding of last year's additional supply chain inventories and stronger consumption trends.\n\nValue share of cigarettes increased 60 bps (2020: up 45 bps), driven by our strategic brands (up 80 bps) including Newport and Natural American Spirit. Total volume share declined 40 bps (2020: 10 bps increase) as we focused on value generation from combustibles in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe strategic portfolio performed well, partly due to Lucky Strike which was reintroduced in the final quarter of 2020 and reached 1% national volume share in the first year post launch.\n\nOn 29 April 2021, the FDA announced it is setting into motion the process of advancing two tobacco product standards regarding menthol in cigarettes and all flavoured cigars. The Group's U.S. business will evaluate any proposed regulation and will participate in any consultation and rulemaking processes by submitting robust comments grounded in science-based evidence. The published science does not support regulating menthol cigarettes differently from non-menthol. The scientific evidence neither shows a difference in health risks between menthol and non-menthol cigarettes, nor indicates that menthol cigarettes adversely affect initiation, dependence, or cessation.\n\n## Traditional Oral\n\nTraditional Oral revenue fell 4.3% (2020: up 7.0%), a growth of 2.6% (2020: 7.6%) at constant rates of exchange, driven by strong pricing in both years, which more than offset lower volume (down 5.1% in 2021, and 1.3% in 2020). Through the utilisation of RGM techniques, value share of moist oral grew 10 bps, having declined 25 bps in 2020, largely driven by Grizzly, which performed well in 2021, having been impacted by strong pricing in the final quarter of 2019 and early 2020.\n\n## Our Strategy in Action\n\nInnovation drives performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVuse growth in the U.S. has been fuelled by an evolving marketing plan focused on local brandbuilding plans tailored to the consumer needs in key cities. Vuse is now the value share market leader in 27 states.\n\nThrough collaboration with local artists and leveraging the McLaren partnership and through the Vuse device customisation platform, we have generated significant consumer and media interest. This has all been underpinned by investments in improving data, marketing technology and digital engagement, while the expanding of the vapour pod format options during the year gave consumers more choice.\n\nWe have also made progress in improving the brand's profitability in the U.S. We have focused on value generation, through RGM, while also unlocking cost savings (including in product costs and efficient marketing and trade spend), with the brand achieving profitability in the final quarter of 2021.",

The reported results were negatively impacted by translational foreign exchange headwinds due to the relative strength of sterling against a number of currencies, particularly the Brazilian real, Argentinian peso, Nigerian naira and Kenyan shilling. Excluding the translational headwind, on a constant currency basis, revenue grew by 7.8% in 2021 (2020: increase of 1.4%), driven by combustibles pricing and growth in New Categories in both years. The lower growth rate in 2020 was due to the negative impact of COVID-19 in that year, as a number of markets implemented temporary restrictions in response to the pandemic, with South Africa in particular restricting the production and sale of tobacco products for a period of five months.\n\nReported profit from operations fell 3.7% to \u00a31,496 million partly due to the recognition of a \u00a354 million charge related to goodwill in Peru and by the impact of translational foreign exchange on our reported results. In 2020, this was an increase of 29.0% to \u00a31,553 million, with the growth largely from the absence of the \u00a3436 million charge in 2019 in relation to the Quebec Class Action. Excluding the adjusting items (largely related to Quantum and Peru) and the impact of foreign exchange in both periods, adjusted profit from operations increased 4.3% (2020: decrease of 2.5%) on a constant currency basis, largely driven by the growth in adjusted revenue. However, in 2021, this was partially offset by transactional foreign exchange headwinds and increased investment in New Categories. In 2020, the higher revenue was more than offset by the impact of COVID-19 which led to supply restrictions in South Africa noted above and additional supply chain costs elsewhere (estimated to be \u00a357 million) to manage the operational volatility.\n\nWhile not yet back to pre-COVID-19 levels, South Africa has recovered during 2021 and as such the risk of impairment of goodwill has reduced.

        "page_content": "## New Categories\n\nIn 2021, New Categories revenue more than doubled, up 114% to \u00a3141 million (2021: up 51.3% to \u00a366 million) driven by the growth of vapour in both years.\n\nHaving gained value leadership of the total vapour category in Canada in 2020, Vuse consolidated its leadership position with total value share up 34.3 ppts in 2021, having grown 22.2 ppts in 2020. This was driven by the growth of the ePod variant, including the upgraded 2.0 variant.\n\nIn South Africa, vapour revenue recovered following the suspension, alongside those of cigarettes, between March and August 2020 as part of the country's COVID-19 response. While this was a headwind in 2020, volume recovered and almost tripled in 2021, supported by the completion of the migration of Twisp to Vuse.\n\nIn Kenya, we continue to engage with the relevant authorities on the regulatory and fiscal framework to support a commercially sustainable re-entry into the Modern Oral category.\n\nWe continue to believe that Modern Oral represents an exciting opportunity to offer affordable New Category alternatives* to adult nicotine consumers in emerging markets, given the absence of an electronic device and a pre-existing ritual of oral product consumption in a number of markets.\n\n## Delivering on our New Categories\n\nOur Canadian subsidiary cemented its leadership of the closed system category by delivering consumer relevant offers starting with ePod 2.0 upgrade and a series of flavours through the year amidst COVID-19 restrictions. With the onset of new Canadian federal regulations capping the nicotine ceiling to 20mg, the Vuse portfolio was rotated and expanded with new mint and tobacco flavours to accommodate for provincial flavour bans.\n\nOur focus on digital transformation has delivered data driven insights - propelling e-commerce in key markets. Analytics and enhanced user experiences have enabled us to optimise the subscription model in South Africa and Canada.\n\nTobacco Harm Reduction is high on the vapour agenda, with a focus on category perceptions on quality and trust. Our Canadian subsidiary deployed an integrated campaign centred on safety of pods and devices to demonstrate Vuse is the brand with the highest safety standards.\n\n## Combustibles\n\nCombustibles revenue declined 2.8% to \u00a33,435 million (2020: 11.4% decrease to \u00a33,535 million). A translational foreign exchange headwind impacted both years with revenue, on a constant currency basis, up 4.1% in 2021 and 1.3% in 2020.\n\nCombustibles pricing in both years, supported by our RGM capabilities, was, in 2021, partially offset by negative mix as volume recovered from the impact of COVID-19 in a number of markets including in South Africa (impacted by the sales suspension in 2020, with the market still recovering from the growth in illicit trade in 2020) and Colombia. In Brazil, COVID-19 related lockdowns (in 2020 and 2021) and increased border security led to growth in the duty paid industry, with some growth in consumption at the lower end of the market. Having declined by 3.8% in 2020, combustible volume in AmSSA was flat in 2021.\n\nValue share declined 70 bps driven by Canada, South Africa, Mexico, and Brazil. This compared to an increase in 2020 of 30 bps.\n\n- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking. These products are not risk free and are addictive.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Strategy in Action\n\n## Migration to Vuse in South Africa\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe migration of Twisp to Vuse demonstrates agile transformation at scale. 84 own-retail outlets nationwide were fully redesigned to the global Vuse Inspiration store configuration, supporting the new ePod 2.0 device, recognised as more premium with better sensorial experience.\n\nThe migration retained 99% of the former Twisp franchise with Vuse acquiring new consumers. The full potential of Vuse is being realised with expansion into organised retail and key accounts nationwide with monthly pod sales crossing the 1 million pods mark.\n\nThe franchise is now three times bigger post migration to Vuse.\n\nAs part of its ESG agenda, Vuse has deployed the Drop the Pod scheme, with South Africa recording the highest returns (27% of own-retail sales) among Vuse markets globally.",

was marginally higher than 2020 (2020: down 1.6%) as good pricing in Combustibles and growth in New Categories revenue (2021: up 80%, 2020: up 50%) in both years was largely offset by lower combustible volume (down 3.1% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2020) and a translational foreign exchange headwind of 7.2% (2020: 3.7% headwind).\n\nExcluding the impact of adjusting items (that affected revenue in 2019) and the impact of currency, revenue grew 7.3% on an adjusted constant rates basis (2020: up 2.1%).\n\nReported profit from operations declined by 3.9% to \u00a31,885 million as the strong New Category revenue growth, in combination with tight control of overheads and Quantum cost savings, were more than offset by incremental investment in New Categories and foreign exchange headwinds.\n\nIn 2020, reported profit from operations increased 19% to \u00a31,962 million, largely due to the absence of the \u00a3202 million charge in respect of the Russian excise dispute that impacted the prior year (2019: down 13%).\n\nExcluding the impact of currency and adjusting items (in respect of Quantum and the factory rationalisation programme), adjusted profit from operations at constant rates was down 1.0% in 2021 (2020: down 2.4%) as the region continued to invest in New Categories.\n\n## New Categories\n\nIn 2021, revenue from Vapour was up 40.2% reflecting strong volume growth (up 30%), driven by an increase in industry volume, and higher consumables pricing. In 2020, revenue from Vapour was marginally higher than 2019 as the impact of COVID-19 on our vape stores and an increase in marketing investment to drive consumer activation (recognised as a deduction to revenue in line with IFRS 15), largely offset higher volume (up 23%).",

        "page_content": "Vype was migrated to Vuse, with Vuse growing across the region, extending its value leadership position in all key markets. In the UK and France, trade margin optimisation, together with growth ahead of incremental marketing investment led to a reduced drag on regional profit from operations.\n\nIn 2021, THP volume grew by 195% (2020: up 203%), with revenue 150% higher at \u00a3341 million (2020: up 143% to \u00a3136 million). This was driven by the roll-out of glo Hyper, which has now been launched in 18 markets in the region. glo continued to increase volume share of the THP category in key markets for 2021, including in:\n\n- - Russia, reaching 19.3% up 1,070 bps on 2020;\n- - Italy, increasing by 870 bps to 12.8%;\n- - Ukraine, being 20.9%, an increase of 990 bps; and\n- - Romania, 530 bps higher than 2020 at 22.1%.\n\nHyper also continued to make good progress in Kazakhstan, Poland, Egypt, the Czech Republic and across other smaller ENA launch markets.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022, the markets of North Africa (being Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia) will be reported under APME. From that date, ENA will be known as Europe.\n\n- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking. These products are not risk free and are addictive.\n\n## Delivering on our New Categories\n\nFollowing the successful launch of the Hyper platform in 2020, glo has delivered strong traction in ENA. Hyper was developed using consumer understanding and insights, coupled with breakthrough technology which allowed us to unlock record heating times, delivered by our signature boost feature.\n\nDuring 2021, glo was the first THP to be launched in Egypt and became the fastest growing THP brand in both Poland and Greece. glo is now in 18 countries in ENA, with a winning combination of innovation in product (including an upgraded device design, limited edition products and double capsules), combined with relevant consumer activation.\n\nIn alignment with corporate ESG targets, device take-back schemes were implemented in all end markets during 2021.\n\nIn 2021, Modern Oral revenue grew 44% (2020: up 59%), led by 46% volume growth (2020: 56% increase). In both years, the Group continued to grow its volume share of the total oral category in more established markets such as Sweden and Norway, while also building the overall category, and our volume share of Modern Oral itself, in Denmark and Switzerland.\n\nIn Germany, sales of Modern Oral were suspended during the year, pending engagement with authorities regarding the classification of tobacco-free nicotine pouches.\n\nIn January 2021, we pilot-launched our first CBD vaping product, Vuse CBD Zone. This allowed us, for the first time, to offer adult consumers a range of high-quality CBD vaping products from our trusted, global brand, Vuse, gaining valuable insights into the product and consumer behaviour.\n\n## Combustibles\n\nIn 2021, revenue was 6.2% lower, compared to a decline of 3.4% in 2020. Good price/mix in both years (up 4% in 2021 and 5% in 2020) was more than offset by the impact of lower combustible volume, down 3.1% in 2021 and 4.1% in 2020, and the foreign exchange headwind described earlier. At constant rates of exchange, revenue increased 1.1% (2020: 0.5%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe decrease in combustible volume in 2021 was driven by lower volume in Ukraine, Russia and Kazakhstan, in part due to industry contraction in those markets. In 2020, the decline in combustible volume was despite higher volume in Turkey (driven by Kent and the local portfolio) as this was more than offset by industry volume contraction in a number of markets, partly due to COVID-19.\n\nCigarette value share was down 20 bps in 2021, while 2020 was in line with 2019. Cigarette volume share declined 30 bps (2020: up 30 bps) as growth in Turkey, Germany and the Czech Republic was more than offset by reductions in Russia, Poland, France, Italy, Spain, Romania, the UK, Ukraine and Denmark. The growth in 2020 was largely driven by Russia and Turkey, partly offset by lower volume share in France, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland and the UK.\n\nIn 2020, menthol bans were introduced in Turkey, the UK and the EU. The Group has a long-standing track record of managing regulatory shifts. In 2021, the Group did not experience a material impact from the introduction of the new regulations.\n\n## Our Strategy in Action\n\n## New innovation hub in Italy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn September 2021, we announced the launch of a new A Better Tomorrow\u2122 Innovation Hub in Trieste, Italy.\n\nThe hub will host a new manufacturing site for BAT's New Category products, and a digital boutique encompassing an innovation lab and centre of excellence for digital transformation and digital marketing.\n\nMultiple production lines are anticipated to be developed for European and global export of BAT's reduced-risk* products - demonstrating our commitment to harm reduction.\n\nThe building will be constructed to minimise its environmental impact, aiming for carbon neutrality, with a particular focus on energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources.\n\nThe works for the construction of the structure began in mid-November 2021 with the first module scheduled to be completed and activated in May 2022.",

Revenue in 2021 was also negatively impacted by the sale of the Group's operations in Iran, part way through the year.\n\nIn 2020, the decline in revenue was largely driven by lower cigarette volume (which fell 7.3%). This was partly due to the negative impact of COVID-19 on GTR and other markets in the region and the impact of excise increases and minimum pricing in Indonesia. Revenue in 2020 was also impacted by the excise harmonisation of THP in Japan and a \u00a350 million charge in respect of the withdrawal of glo Sens.\n\nExcluding the impact of translational foreign exchange, in 2021 revenue was in line with 2020 (2020: declined 9.9%) on an adjusted constant rate basis.\n\nReported profit from operations declined 12.6% to \u00a31,287 million, driven by the lower revenue and due to the \u00a3358 million charge (mainly in respect of foreign exchange previously charged to other comprehensive income) recognised in respect of the sale of the Group's operations in Iran, and costs associated with the withdrawal from Myanmar.\n\nIn 2020, reported profit from operations was a decrease of 16.0% to \u00a31,472 million, as the impact of COVID-19 in a number of markets including GTR, the recognition of costs related to the ongoing factory rationalisation programme (principally in Southeast Asia), an impairment in goodwill in respect of the Group's performance in Malaysia (\u00a3197 million) and unfavourable foreign exchange movements more than offset the efficiencies realised through Quantum.",

        "page_content": "Excluding adjusting items in 2021 (largely related to Iran, Myanmar and Quantum) and the impact of translational foreign exchange, adjusted profit from operations at constant rates of exchange declined 1.1% in 2021 (2020: fell 7.3%), driven by the reduction in revenue and continued investment in New Categories.\n\n## New Categories\n\nTotal revenue from New Categories increased 4.2% to \u00a3535 million (2020: declined 24.0% to \u00a3514 million).\n\nIn 2021, this was driven by a 26.5% increase in THP consumable volume to 9.3 billion sticks, compared to a decline of 6.5% to 7.4 billion sticks in 2020. 2021 was underpinned by the success of glo Hyper (the first-to-world THP that uses induction heating technology to provide a step change in taste delivery leading to an increase in consumer satisfaction, driven by 30% more tobacco, faster heating and a boost function), launched in 2020. 2020 was impacted by excise harmonisation affecting the industry and a strong comparator period (2019) that included the launch of glo Pro, glo Nano and glo Sens.\n\n- *  Based on the weight of evidence and assuming a complete switch from cigarette smoking. These products are not risk free and are addictive.\n\n## Delivering on our New Categories\n\nIn 2021, APME reached 3.8 million active consumers of our non-combustible products driven by strong performance across our New Category platforms across the region.\n\nIn Japan, the largest THP market in the world, glo performed very well, being the fastest growing THP brand (in the THP category) by volume and value share and was the No. 1 choice for cigarette smokers who chose to migrate to New Categories. This was driven by improving penetration and conversion rates with consumer relevant product innovation and improved experience across the consumer journey. This was complemented by good performance in South Korea, where glo volume share grew 310 bps with revenue up 2.7 times during the year. On the Vapour front, our regional Vuse volume increased by 66% in 2021, while successfully completing the migration from Vype to Vuse. Our accelerated learning journey in Modern Oral continued in 2021, specifically in Pakistan where we nearly doubled our Velo consumer base.\n\nTHP revenue increased 2.8% (2020: decrease of 26%), or 13.0% (2020: down 27%) excluding the impact of currencies. The growth in 2021 was driven by increased Hyper volume, more than offsetting the continued impact of excise harmonisation, which negatively impacted revenue in 2020 (compared to 2019). The movement between the years was also due to a \u00a350 million charge to revenue in respect of the withdrawal of glo Sens (in 2020, that did not repeat in 2021) as the product did not perform to expectations.\n\nIn Japan, the largest THP market in the world, glo is the fastest growing THP brand (by volume), with volume share increasing to 6.8% in 2021, up 140 bps, maintaining the momentum of 2020 which was up 50 bps on 2019.\n\nOur Modern Oral pilot launches in emerging markets, including in Pakistan and Indonesia, continue to deliver valuable insights, as we roll out in key urban markets. We believe that Modern Oral is an exciting longer-term opportunity to commercialise reduced-risk products* by offering affordable New Category alternatives to adult nicotine consumers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Combustibles\n\nRevenue from combustibles declined 9.6% to \u00a33,555 million (2020: down 10.3% to \u00a33,935 million), or by 2.3% (2020: down 7.7%) at constant rates of exchange.\n\nIn 2021, this was despite an increase in combustible volume (up 4.4%) as emerging markets recovered from COVID-19. However, this led to a negative geographic mix which, combined with structural excise changes in Australia and New Zealand and competitive pricing dynamics in Australia (totalling approximately \u00a3260 million) and the negative impact of the sale of operations in Iran part way through the year, drove revenue down.\n\nIn 2021, value share decreased 20 bps (2020: up 10 bps), with volume share up 20 bps (2020: 55 bps higher), as volume share gains (including in Bangladesh, Japan, Pakistan and Taiwan) more than offset losses in Indonesia (as the Group drove for value growth with pricing ahead of the industry) and Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn 2020, pricing in Australia and Pakistan was more than offset by a 7.2% decline in combustible volume. Higher volume in Bangladesh was more than offset by the impact of COVID-19 in a number of markets, notably within GTR, an increase in local taxes and the minimum retail price compliance in Indonesia, and the continued increase in illicit trade in Pakistan (following an excise-led price increase in 2019).\n\n## Our Strategy in Action\n\n## glo in Japan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, glo attracted more than 700,000 new consumers during the year, to become a brand family with more than 3 million consumers in Japan.\n\nglo's growth was driven by a robust understanding of consumer opportunities, a well-balanced consumable portfolio and integrated online-offline activations, while also successfully increasing device penetration and conversion. Device launches were combined with a more targeted, multi-brand consumables portfolio that delivered credibility and satisfaction to an increasing number of consumers. Improvements in glo's retail presence provided the foundation for growth, complemented by a digital first consumer engagement approach enabling\n\ndirect and tailored consumer interactions.",

        "page_content": "## Group Principal Risks\n\n## Group Principal Risks\n\n## Overview\n\nThe principal risks that may affect the Group are set out on the following pages.\n\nEach risk is considered in the context of the Group's strategy and business model, as set out in this Strategic Report on pages 16 to 19, and 26 to 28. On the following pages is a summary of each principal risk, its potential impact @ and management by the Group @ . Clear accountability is attached to each risk through the risk owner. BAT define the principal risks as those assessed with a high impact and probable likelihood. Additionally, the risks 'Inability to commercialise and deliver New Categories', 'Litigation', 'Solvency and liquidity' are also recognised as principal risks; even though they are not assessed as having high impact and probable likelihood, they are material to the Group and the delivery of its strategic objectives.\n\n@ The Group has identified risks and is actively monitoring and mitigating these risks. @ This section focuses on those risks that the Directors believe to be the principal risks to the Group. Not all of these risks are within the control of the Group and other risks besides those listed may affect the Group's performance. Some risks may be unknown at present. Other risks, currently regarded as less material, could become material in the future.\n\nThe risks listed in this section @ and the activities being undertaken to manage them @ should be considered in the context of the Group's internal control framework. This is described in the section on risk management\n\nand internal control in the corporate governance statement on pages 125 to 126. This section should also be read in the context of the cautionary statement on page 352.\n\nA summary of all the risk factors (including the principal risks) which are monitored by the Board through the Group's risk register is set out in the Additional Disclosures section on pages 317 to 339.\n\n## Assessment of Group Risks @\n\nDuring the year, the Directors carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks, uncertainties and emerging risks facing the Group, including those that could impact delivery of its strategic objectives, business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n\nThe Board assessed that in line with the Group's strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth with a range of innovation and less harmful products that stimulate senses of new adult generations, it was appropriate to no longer consider 'Market size reduction and consumer down trading' as a principal risk to the Group.\n\nOtherwise, the Group's current principal risks remain broadly unaltered compared to 2020.\n\nThe viability statement below provides a broader assessment of long-term solvency and liquidity. The Directors considered a number of factors that may affect the resilience of the Group. Except for the risk 'Injury, illness or death in the workplace' the Directors also assessed the potential impact of the principal risks that may impact the Group's viability.\n\n## Time frame\n\nShort-term\n\nMedium-term\n\nLong-term\n\n## Strategic impact\n\nSimplification\n\nNew Categories\n\nCombustibles\n\n## Key Stakeholders\n\nConsumers\n\nSociety\n\nEmployees\n\nShareholders\n\n## Considered in viability statement @\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- @ Denotes phrase, paragraph or similar that does not form part of BAT's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\n## Viability statement @\n\nThe Board has assessed the viability of the Group taking into account the current position and principal risks, in accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. Whilst the Board believes the Group will be viable over a longer period, owing to the inherent uncertainty arising due to ongoing litigation and regulation, the period over which the Board considers it possible to form a reasonable expectation as to the Group's longer-term viability (that it will continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due) is three years.\n\nIn making this assessment, the Board considered the Group's:\n\n- - strong cash generation from operating activities;\n- - access to, and ability to raise, external sources of financing including the removal of any financial covenants in its credit facilities; and\n- - continued ability to manage the impact of COVID-19 and recognised the Group's ability to utilise its geographic footprint and integrated operating model to minimise the impact to the Group's performance.\n\nThis assessment included a robust review of the Group's operational and financial processes, (which cover both short-term financial forecasts and capacity plans) and the principal risks (as indicated on pages 93 to 97) that may impact the Group's viability. These are considered, with the mitigating actions, at least once a year. The assessment included a reverse stress test of the principal risks and did not identify any individual risk, based upon a prudent annual forecast, that would, if arising in isolation and without mitigation, impact the Group's viability within the 3 year confirmation period. Furthermore, the Board recognised that even if all the principal risks arose simultaneously, given the underlying strong free cashflow generation before the payment of dividends (2021: \u00a37.4 billion), the Group would be able to undertake mitigating actions to meet the liabilities as they fall due. The assessment also reviewed the potential impact of climate-related risks and concluded that these, including the potential cost implications and noting the mitigating actions, would not impact the Group's viability (see pages 58 to 67 with respect to TCFD).\n\nThe Board noted that the Group has access to a \u00a35.85 billion credit facility (2021: undrawn and which will reduce to \u00a35.7 billion in March 2022), US (US$4 billion) and Euro (\u00a33 billion) commercial paper programmes (2021: \u00a3269 million drawn) and \u00a32.5 billion of bilateral agreements which may be utilised. However, the Group is subject to inherent uncertainties with regards to regulatory change and litigation, the outcome of which may have a bearing on the Group's viability. The Group maintains, as referred to in note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts 'Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments,' that, whilst it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case, the defences of the Group's companies to all the various claims are meritorious on both law and the facts. If an adverse judgment is entered against any of the Group's companies in any case, an appeal may be made, the duration of which can be reasonably expected to last for a number of years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Governance\n\n## Chairman's Introduction on Governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nAs your incoming Chairman, I've spent 2021 immersing myself fully in the work and culture of the Board and wider organisation, building on my prior experience as one of your Non-Executive Directors. My sentiments are unchanged: this is an outstanding organisation that is fully committed to realising its corporate purpose of building A Better Tomorrow TM .\n\nI'm grateful to my predecessor, Richard Burrows, the Board and the management team, who have recognised that achieving this purpose is predicated on a consumercentric strategy and empowering ethos. Our ambitious sustainability agenda, strong corporate governance, and robust control environment underpin the delivery of our corporate purpose more so than ever.\n\n## Strategic focus\n\nWe are clear on, and delivering against, our three commercial priorities of combustible value growth; step-change in New Categories; and simplifying the organisation. This year, the Board has also strongly supported executive management's drive to deliver our Quest programme, setting out our five critical enablers for corporate transformation (discussed on page 104). I'm pleased to report that we're confident this programme is progressing well and will accelerate our transformation to a multi-category business, in nicotine and beyond.\n\nThe Board's consideration of the Group's capital allocation for 2022 carefully balanced New Categories investment and our ongoing objective to de-leverage the balance sheet within an appropriate range, as well as laying foundations for our activities beyond nicotine.\n\nWith regard to our new longer-term active capital allocation framework, we are growing the dividend and have announced a \u00a32 billion share repurchase programme for 2022.\n\nAction on climate change is a vital pillar of our sustainability agenda, and momentum in this area must be maintained. The Board has reviewed progress against the glidepath towards achieving the Group's commitment to net zero value chain emissions by 2050. This is also the first year we report to you in full alignment with the TCFD framework.\n\nGiven the importance of the sustainability agenda to our strategy, we extended the scope of external assurance of our reported ESG metrics this year (discussed on page 126) and our Audit Committee's terms of reference were revised to formalise its oversight role in this area (see page 121). This enhanced assurance is something our stakeholders and society are rightly coming to expect as part of good corporate governance.\n\n## Culture and values\n\nThe Board recognises its role in shaping and overseeing Group culture and values. Acting with integrity is an important part of our ethos, and the Board ensures that embedding integrity across our business practices remains a priority.\n\nIn January 2022, we launched our revised Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC) and Supplier Code of Conduct (discussed on page 110). Regular evolution of these longstanding policies keeps them in step with our strategy, ethos, external requirements and stakeholder expectations.\n\nThese policies mandate responsible business practices without compromise, and the Company takes seriously any noncompliance with our standards or our legal obligations. As we accelerate our multicategory platform initiatives, I firmly believe these standards foster sustainable growth. You can read about our SoBC and Delivery with Integrity programme on page 56.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe had an active shareholder and investor engagement programme in 2021.\n\nI met with a number of shareholders in the year, and the Remuneration Committee Chair has engaged extensively on our new Directors' Remuneration Policy. My fellow Board members and I look forward to further dialogue with you ahead of the 2022 AGM, which we plan to hold in person subject to prevailing guidance at the time.\n\nWe also listen to the perspectives of our wider stakeholders and we review how we engage with them across the Group, which you can read about on pages 106 to 109.\n\n## Our people\n\nThe continuing resilience and commitment of our people to overcome the challenges of COVID-19 has been inspirational to the Board. Their safety and well-being remains our top priority, and we devote time to satisfy ourselves that the right support is available and is responsive to change.\n\nThe Board maintains effective engagement with our people worldwide through a range of channels (discussed at page 108).\n\n## Board efficacy\n\nWhile much of the Board's interaction remained virtual in 2021, we have operated effectively and engaged consistently with management and staff throughout the year.\n\nThis year, I led an internal evaluation of the Board, its Committees and each individual Director, set out on page 114. The Board considers that it continues to function effectively and its working relationships with its Committees continue to be sound.\n\nI'm confident that the corporate governance framework that I now oversee as your Chairman enables the Group's strategic objectives. On behalf of the Board, I confirm that we believe that this combined Annual Report and Form 20-F is fair, balanced and understandable, and presents the information necessary to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Luc Jobin\n\nChairman",

        "page_content": "## Board Leadership and Purpose\n\n## Leadership Overview\n\n## Board Leadership\n\nThe Board is collectively responsible to our shareholders for the long-term sustainable success of the Company and for the Group's strategic direction, purpose, values and governance. The Board provides the leadership necessary for the Group to meet its business objectives within a robust framework of internal controls. The Board's primary responsibilities are summarised on page 111.\n\nThe Board has a comprehensive annual programme of meetings to review the Group's strategy and monitor performance across all elements of the Group's business model. The Board's strategic priorities for 2021 are identified within the key performance indicators set out on page 9. The Chairman sets structured meeting agendas in consultation with the Chief Executive and the Company Secretary.\n\nKey activities of the Board in 2021 are set out on pages 104 to 105. The Board considers stakeholder interests in its decision-making on an ongoing basis. Examples of principal decisions made by the Board during the year, and how it considered the long-term consequences of decisions, stakeholder interests, the impact of operations on the environment and corporate reputation in those contexts, are discussed on page 110.\n\nOversight of the impact of COVID-19 and the Group's response remained an important focus for the Board throughout 2021.\n\n## How our governance framework supports our strategy\n\nAn overview of our governance framework, including the structure of the Board and its principal Committees, is set out on page 111. As part of our internal controls framework, the Board has delegated certain authorities to executive management through our Group Statement of Delegated Authorities (SoDA) to enable effective delivery of Group strategy.\n\nOur SoDA is designed to empower management at the right level of our organisation and promote high levels of accountability and ownership. Overseeing the implementation of Group strategy through our SoDA is one of the ways that the Board promotes robust corporate governance, risk management and internal controls across our Group. Our SoDA supports our Board members in managing their responsibility for promoting the success of the Company, in line with their directors' duties.\n\n## Our Purpose and Ethos\n\nOur purpose, to build A Better Tomorrow TM for all our stakeholders, is underpinned by our ethos.\n\nWe launched the BAT ethos in 2020, developed with significant employee input. It guides our culture and behaviours across our Group, enabling an organisation that is future fit for sustainable growth. We believe our ethos empowers our people and fosters a vibrant, rewarding and responsible workplace. Its focus on diversity and inclusion enables better understanding, connectivity and insights across our business.\n\nThe Board is committed to supporting the Management Board in continuing to promote the BAT ethos in every area of our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our purpose on page 27 and our ethos on page 69\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are Bold\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are Responsible\n\nWe are Fast\n\nWe are Empowered\n\nWe are Diverse\n\n## Shaping and Overseeing Culture\n\nThe Board considers the Group's culture and activities promoting our ethos in a range of contexts throughout the year, including through workforce engagement. Key examples of the Board's oversight of culture are highlighted on page 105.\n\nDuring 2021, Board oversight and monitoring of culture was supported by the Board's annual review of the Group culture dashboard. This dashboard presents a series of insights measured over time across the organisation, including diversity at different levels, employee engagement (measured through our Your Voice global employee survey), leadership stability, employee retention, health and safety, and business conduct, including Speak Up allegations.\n\nFollowing review, the Board is satisfied that our culture is aligned with the Group's purpose, strategy and ethos, and reflected consistently in our workplace policies and practices.\n\nOutside of the boardroom, the Directors typically participate in regular market and site visits to give them direct experience of our organisational culture in context. The Directors' market and site visit programme continued to be impacted by travel restrictions in place due to COVID-19. Direct workforce engagement was instead enabled primarily through virtual forums in 2021 (discussed on page 108).\n\n## Delivery with integrity\n\nHow we execute our strategy is as important as its successful delivery. The Board remains focused on ensuring that we deliver with integrity in every aspect of our business. It is essential to our Group's long-term, sustainable success that all our people act with consistently high standards of behaviour. We articulate this through our Group Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC). Compliance with our SoBC, in letter and spirit, is mandatory for all our people worldwide.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur SoBC holds everyone responsible for compliance, and every line manager across our business must act as a role model for high standards of behaviour. The SoBC includes our Speak Up policy, reflecting the range of Speak Up channels for raising any concerns in confidence (anonymously if preferred) and without fear of reprisal. The SoBC also includes our Lobbying and Engagement policy, reinforcing the requirement for all our engagement activities with governments, regulators and other external stakeholders to be conducted with transparency, openness and integrity.\n\nOur SoBC is regularly reviewed and updated. A revised version of our SoBC was introduced in January 2022 (discussed on page 110).\n\nThe Audit Committee is kept updated on SoBC allegations, and reports to the Board to enable Board oversight of behaviour falling short of our standards and the corrective action taken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our commitment to delivery with integrity and our Group Standards of Business Conduct on pages 56 to 57\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board also receives updates from the Head of Investor Relations and our brokers on key issues raised by shareholders and on stock performance.\n\nShareholder and investor perspectives considered by the Board in 2021 included transformation, New Categories strategy and performance, ESG targets, deleveraging, capital allocation and key regulatory developments. The Board takes shareholder feedback into account in decision-making and developing Group strategy (discussed further on this page and on pages 110 and 128 to 132).\n\n## Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nOur AGM is an opportunity for further shareholder engagement, for the Chairman to set out progress, and for the Board to answer questions. Our 2021 AGM was held whilst the UK Government's COVID-19 'Stay at Home' measures were in force, prohibiting public gatherings of more than two people. Given those restrictions, our 2021 AGM was convened with a minimum quorum of two shareholders in accordance with the Company's Articles of Association. Shareholders were given the opportunity to submit questions about AGM business in advance of the meeting and responses to the queries received were published at bat.com/agm.\n\nLooking ahead, we plan to hold our 2022 AGM in person, subject to UK Government guidelines applicable at that time. Details of our 2022 AGM are set out on page 379.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For disclosures required by paragraph 7.2.6 of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Companies Act 2006, see the Other Information section\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## Shareholder communication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                 |   2021 (%) |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| UK              |         40 |\n| United States   |         29 |\n| South Africa    |          9 |\n| Europe (ex.

However, we acknowledge the vote against received in relation to the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Report and the resolution to renew the Directors' authority to allot shares, which we address below.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nFollowing the 2021 AGM and continuing into 2022, we have engaged with a broad cross-section of our shareholders and advisory bodies, including a number of shareholders that voted against this resolution at the 2021 AGM, to understand their perspectives on management of executive pay. Details of this engagement and how the Remuneration Committee has taken shareholder feedback into account in shaping the proposed new Directors' Remuneration Policy are set out on pages 128 to 132.\n\n## Renewal of Directors' authority to allot shares\n\nIn 2021, the Board reviewed the appropriate level of authority to allot shares to maintain future flexibility for the Company, and took into account the perspectives of shareholders unable to support an authority to allot shares of up to two-thirds of issued share capital as sought at our 2021 AGM.\n\nIn light of that review, the Board intends to propose shareholder approval of an authority to allot shares at a reduced level of up to one-third of issued share capital at our 2022 AGM, within the UK Investment Association's share capital management guidelines. Full details of this resolution will be set out in the Company's Notice of Meeting for our 2022 AGM.\n\nWe launched our refreshed investor website in February 2021 alongside our results for FY 2020, taking into account investor feedback. As part of the refresh, site design was fully updated, improving user experience and making content easier to navigate.\n\nWe also added new content areas, including:\n\n- - Our investment case and our approach to ESG; and\n- - Shareholder FAQ and regular consensus sharing.\n\nA new Investor News hub pulls our press releases, news and features together in one place for investors. An automated news alerts service is available to keep investors up to date. We are increasing our investor reach with live broadcasts of events, including results and conferences on our website, with playback slides and transcript available online. During 2021, the refreshed site has seen an 18% increase in traffic with over 417,000 visits.",

Key stakeholders are essential to our ability to generate long-term, sustainable value and we identify them by applying an established stakeholder engagement framework, which takes into account strategic objectives and risks to the Group.\n\nOur key stakeholders are referenced in our business model on page 18, with an overview of their importance, what matters to them, and how we engage and respond to them set out on pages 20 to 21.\n\nTransparency of engagement is woven into our Group policies, such as our Standards of Business Conduct and specific frameworks for stakeholder engagement. Matters reserved for the Board include responsibility for understanding the views of the Group's wider stakeholders (including our workforce) and review of the effectiveness of engagement mechanisms.\n\nThe Board conducted a review of key stakeholders in 2021. This included how engagement is conducted across the Group, stakeholders' perspectives, and how the Board is kept informed of those perspectives where engagement is not at Board level. Following its review, the Board remains satisfied there is well-established and effective engagement with the Group's key stakeholders, which enables the Board to understand their perspectives. The Board will continue to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of stakeholder engagement.\n\nWhere the Board does not engage directly with our stakeholders, it is kept updated so Directors maintain an effective understanding of what matters to them and can draw on these perspectives, including in Board decision-making and strategy development. An overview of how the Board engaged with wider stakeholders and maintained its understanding of their interests during the year follows below, with further information on page 72 and on page 165 in relation to workforce engagement on remuneration matters.\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * Total virtual or face-to-face market visits or other forums by location /region/ central function that one or more Directors attended in 2021.\n\n## Key priorities from workforce feedback\n\n## Transformation\n\nSimpler, faster, stronger organisation\n\n## Innovation\n\nStep change in New Categories\n\n## Staying Connected\n\n- -  Focus areas are implementation of business simplification and change management.\n- -  Initiatives in response to feedback include: Functional briefings on our Quest programme; live global webcast of the 2021 Half Year results with Q&A; the 'Technology Inspiring a Modern Enterprise' global virtual summit; launch of a series of global webinars to develop digital capabilities.\n- -  Focus areas are New Categories strategy, footprint expansion and deepening product knowledge.\n- -  Initiatives in response to feedback include: Regular updates on New Categories product launches and success stories from across the Group, virtual BAT R&D lab tour experience; bulletins spotlighting our Science & Innovation Report and New Categories portfolios.\n- -  Focus areas are maintaining active staff engagement and staff welfare during the pandemic.\n- -  Initiatives in response to feedback include: regular guidance to staff worldwide on measures to safeguard welfare during the pandemic; interactive global and regional briefings on ESG and sustainability topics; and interactive events to highlight International Women's Day.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our People\n\nRead more about our approach to workforce engagement Pages 72 and 165\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board keeps up to date with the current views of our workforce through a combination of engagement methods across multiple channels at different levels of our organisation. These include town halls, works councils, webcasts, our 'Your Voice' global employee survey, and direct engagement through Directors' market and site visits (discussed on page 72). Given the spread, scale and diversity of the Group's workforce, the Board considers it effective to use this blend of established channels, augmented by structured reporting.\n\nThese engagement channels, combined with Group-wide reporting structures to capture workforce feedback, cover all Group company employees and individuals contracted on a fixed-term basis to undertake permanent roles. Focus and action areas reviewed by the Board are then cascaded to our workforce.\n\nEngagement across our organisation remained a top priority in 2021, as COVID-19 continued to affect our organisation and ways of working. The Board reviewed our workforce engagement channels across the Group in 2021 and consolidated feedback from them. The overarching themes were transformation, innovation, and staying connected (particularly in the pandemic context), highlighted below.\n\nOur Board's usual programme of market and site visits allows Directors to engage directly with people across our organisation, but continued to be curtailed in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nHowever, our Executive Directors led a series of virtual market visits and other forums to connect regularly with regional, local and functional teams (highlighted to left), and featured on our internal global news channel 'BATV'. The Chairman delivered a personal video greeting to staff worldwide on his appointment and featured in our internal eZine.\n\nOur Executive Directors also presented global, functional and market webcasts including discussions on our purpose, ethos, strategy, performance and business outlook in real time with Q&A.\n\nThe Board was briefed on London HQ return to site plans, staff perspectives on the positives and negatives, and how safeguarding measures would ensure a COVID-19 secure return for staff working on site.\n\nThe Board noted that staff felt well supported during the pandemic, and the need to balance the advantages of more flexible working practices going forward, with recognition of on-site working as a powerful catalyst for collaborative and cohesive teamwork.\n\n## UK Companies Act: Employee engagement\n\nThis section summarises the Directors' approach to engaging with the Group's workforce, including employees of UK Group companies, and how the Directors have regard to their interests. Further information is provided on pages 20 to 21, 70 to 73, and pages 163 to 165 in relation to remuneration matters. Further details regarding the effect of that regard are provided on page 110.",

In 2021, the Board was updated on how we are responding to consumer views on safety and quality of New Categories products, and our contribution to developing voluntary industry standards in various markets.\n\nThe Board was also briefed on how we understand our consumers' shift to digital and e-commerce channels, and our development of mobile e-commerce and subscription tools.\n\nThrough its strategy sessions in 2021, the Board reviewed how we are actioning our wealth of consumer insights to support delivery of relevant product pipelines for a step-change in New Categories performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about customers and responsible marketing Pages 21 and 57\n\n## Customers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhilst retailer, wholesaler and distributor relationships are managed at local market and business unit levels, the Board is briefed regularly on the Group's route-to-market strategies and developments in the global retail environment.\n\nIn 2021, focus areas for Board updates included our response to retail customer feedback on the accelerating shift to e-commerce, including new tools for digital engagement roll-out across 40 markets, and how markets were adapting to maintain their engagement with customers, as COVID-19 impacts continue and beyond.\n\nThe Audit Committee also reviews the Group's Youth Access Prevention action plans annually, including for New Categories digital channels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about engagement with suppliers and farmers Pages 3, 21, 48 and 53 to 55\n\n## Suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur relationships with suppliers and contracted farmers are managed day-to-day by the Group's Operations function and at local market level. The Board periodically reviews the Group's supply chain strategies, supplier footprint and progress of sustainable agriculture and farmer livelihoods programmes.\n\nIn 2021, the Board was regularly updated on the impact of COVID-19 on our operations and supply chain, mitigation plans to avoid supply chain disruption, and initiatives to support suppliers.\n\nThe Board reviewed the Group's New Categories supplier network and geographic sourcing footprint, supply chain resilience and business continuity. The review focussed on sources of uncertainty and managing external impacts, through increased automation and efficiency improvements in collaboration with our suppliers.\n\nThe Board reviewed the annual Modern Slavery Statement, including commitments to ensure that operations are free from exploitation of labour and modern slavery, and the due diligence and monitoring programmes underpinning those commitments.\n\nThe Board approved the revised Supplier Code of Conduct (discussed on page 110). The Board also approved the Company's annual Conflict Minerals Report which details due diligence undertaken to determine the origin of minerals at risk of being sourced in conditions of conflict.\n\n## Society\n\nRead more about our engagement with governments and wider society Pages 21, 36 and 45 to 67\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe believe tobacco harm reduction can only be solved collaboratively, and that only through collaborative effort can effective regulation be developed to deliver public health objectives and also enable real consumer choice.\n\nThe Board is briefed on scientific engagement with regulators, public health bodies, and scientific communities. In 2021, this included updates covering engagement with the US FDA on vapour products, and the progress of US subsidiary Kentucky BioProcessing towards developing proprietary vaccine technology.\n\nAt every regular Board meeting, the Board reviews a report from our Legal & External Affairs Director covering evolving product regulation, regulatory engagement, developments in excise tax, anti-illicit trade initiatives, litigation and compliance.\n\nFor example, in 2021, these reports included briefings on developments in the US FDA's approach to regulating menthol and flavours. The Board was also kept up to date on evolving product regulation and excise tax regimes, with focus on developments in the US and the EU, at its strategy sessions and through regular briefings from the Chief Executive.\n\nThe Board was briefed on investor and wider stakeholder expectations on sustainability policies, programmes and performance, including on alignment with the TCFD reporting framework and progress towards net zero carbon emissions. It also considered the Group's range of responses to stakeholder feedback on the environmental impact of our products. Examples included our work to enable Vuse's certification as the first carbon neutral global vapour brand, our reduction of single use plastics in our New Categories products, and take-back schemes for New Categories.\n\nThe Audit Committee regularly reviews the Group's ESG performance against key metrics, and is briefed annually on our investment in community and charitable initiatives.\n\nIn 2021, the Audit Committee was briefed on enhanced due diligence and governance guidance for end markets and central functions when making charitable contributions and providing in-kind support under the revised Group Community Investment Framework.\n\nThe Audit Committee is also updated on engagement with tax authorities on material Group tax matters.\n\nThe Non-Executive Directors regularly attend the Corporate Audit Committee and Regional Audit & CSR Committees, where societal and community perspectives at regional and local levels are discussed.

This investment enables our strategy for long-term sustainability in nicotine and beyond.\n\nThe budget is also designed to secure mid-term, high single digit EPS growth, achieve our shareholders' deleverage expectations to maintain financial flexibility, and prioritise dividend distribution, whilst enabling commercial delivery across all categories in line with our guidance.\n\nOur capital allocation anticipates developing our portfolios in nicotine and beyond to meet evolving consumer preferences, underpinned by robust product stewardship, scientific research and collaborative innovation to meet those needs, and considers the environmental impact of our operations and the complexity of navigating external fiscal and regulatory environments.\n\nAmongst other factors, the 2022 budget also takes into account workforce remuneration and commercial arrangements with suppliers and customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Revised Standards of Business Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct\n\nThe Board approved revised Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC) and a revised Supplier Code of Conduct, applicable from 1 January 2022. These revised policies are aligned with our strategy and ethos and take account of evolving external requirements and expectations of all our stakeholders for high standards of integrity in our business conduct.\n\nOur revised SoBC emphasises that a key driver to delivering our corporate purpose is our ethos, which guides our culture and behaviours across the Group and enables an organisation future-fit for sustainable growth (discussed further on page 56). Our revised Supplier Code is aligned to our multi-category portfolio, sets expectations for suppliers to support our work to reduce the environmental impact of our products and operations, and reflects changes to our SoBC.\n\nUpdates to these policies were informed by feedback from our staff and business partners, international standards such as the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and external benchmarking. Continuous development of these policies demonstrates our commitment - within our organisation and in collaboration with our suppliers - to deliver results with high standards of integrity across our value chain.\n\n## Key stakeholder perspectives taken into account\n\nShareholders\n\nand investors\n\nConsumers\n\nSuppliers\n\nCustomers\n\nOur people\n\nGovernments  and wider society\n\n## Shaping the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nThe Remuneration Committee conducted a comprehensive review of the current Directors' Remuneration Policy during 2021, continuing into 2022.\n\nThis review included detailed consideration of the alignment of executive remuneration with our strategy, long-term interests of shareholders, and how best to reflect our ESG ambitions in short and long-term incentives, specifically our commitment to reducing the health impact of our business. The review also took account of the pay policies and practices applicable to our wider workforce, and the importance of promoting performance-based pay. Policy-related considerations are discussed in further detail on pages 128 to 132.\n\nThe review was informed by external market practices, corporate governance regulations, shareholder and governance advisory body guidelines, and advice from the Committee's UK and U.S. remuneration consultants, supported by the Director, Talent, Culture & Inclusion. The Committee discussed initial policy proposals with the Board, and took into account perspectives from the Chairman and other Directors on those initial proposals, drawing on their ongoing dialogue with shareholders.\n\nThe Committee Chair then led several rounds of engagement with institutional shareholders and governance advisory bodies, and the Committee evaluated feedback and had active regard to addressing it when finalising the policy proposals. The Board accepted the recommendation of the Committee to put forward the proposed 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key stakeholder perspectives taken into account\n\nShareholders\n\nand investors\n\nOur people\n\nGovernments  and wider society\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Progress Towards Net Zero Emissions\n\nThe Board reviewed progress against the glidepath towards achieving the Group's commitment to net zero value chain carbon emissions by 2050. This encompasses science-based targets across all emission scopes and is discussed on pages 47 and 61.\n\nIn setting environmental targets, regard was had to the emphasis placed across our key stakeholders - our shareholders and investors, our people, our consumers, our customers and suppliers, and wider society - on the importance of responding to climate change and maintaining high standards of environmental management, as well as to our broader, long-term sustainable success and corporate reputation.\n\nCosts associated with progressing towards these targets were taken into account, balanced against the clear imperative to continue taking action to address worldwide implications of climate change, demonstrating our commitment to act as a responsible organisation and business partner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe define principal decisions as those decisions and discussions by the Board that are strategic or material to the Group and those of significance to any of our key stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Feedback from the annual Board evaluation confirmed that Board meetings continued to operate well and are considered to be chaired effectively.\n\nThe Chairman facilitates constructive Board relations, supporting effective contribution from Non-Executive Directors and promoting a culture of openness and debate. The Chairman seeks a consensus at Board meetings but, if necessary, decisions are taken by majority decision. If any Director has concerns on any issues that cannot be resolved, such concerns are noted in the Board minutes. No such concerns arose in 2021.\n\n## Non-Executive Director meetings\n\n- - The Non-Executive Directors, led by the Chairman, meet following Board meetings on a regular basis. Additional meetings led by the Chairman, and without the Executive Directors present, are scheduled in the Board calendar.\n- - The Executive and the Non-Executive Directors also meet annually, led by the Senior Independent Director and without the Chairman present, to discuss the Chairman's performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Independence\n\nThe Board considers all Non-Executive Directors to be independent, as they are free from any business or other relationships that could interfere materially with, or appear to affect, their judgement.\n\nLuc Jobin was determined by the Board to be independent on his appointment as Chairman, as reported in the Company's Annual Report and Form 20-F for 2020.\n\nThe Board has determined Holly Keller Koeppel to be independent, having taken into account her service on the board of Reynolds American as an independent, non-executive director.\n\nLuc and Holly were originally appointed to the Board in 2017 following the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. (Reynolds American) and pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger with Reynolds American.\n\nThe Board has also considered the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards and has determined that these are met by the Chairman and all the Non-Executive Directors. The Board considers that it includes an appropriate combination of Executive and Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Commitment\n\nBefore appointing prospective Directors, the Board takes into account their other commitments and significant time commitments are disclosed prior to appointment. The letters of appointment for the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors set out their expected time commitment to the Company (see page 116).\n\nAny additional external appointments following appointment to the Board require prior approval by the Board in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board assesses the significance of any additional external appointment notified by a Director, supported by the Company Secretary.\n\nDuring 2021, the Board gave approval to Holly Keller Koeppel's appointment as a non-executive director of Flutter Entertainment plc from 13 May 2021. This additional appointment was considered by the Board to be significant, but not to impair her ability to serve as a Director of the Company in view of the anticipated time commitment and given that she had stepped down as non-executive director of Vesuvius plc on 12 May 2021. Including the Company, Holly is currently a non-executive director of three listed companies.\n\nIn 2021, the Board considered and gave approval to Darrell Thomas' appointment as an independent director of Dorman Products Inc. from 30 October 2021. The Board considered this additional appointment to be significant, but did not consider it to impair Darrell's ability to serve as a Director of the Company as he would hold a total of two listed company mandates (within the voting guidelines of leading corporate governance advisory bodies). Following this appointment, Darrell is currently a non-executive director of two listed companies, including the Company.\n\n## Conflicts of Interests\n\nThe Board has formal procedures for managing conflicts of interest. Directors are required to give advance notice of any conflict issues to the Company Secretary. These are considered either at the next Board meeting or, if the timing requires it, at a meeting of the Board's Conflicts Committee.\n\nEach year, the Board also considers afresh all previously authorised situational conflicts. Directors are excluded from the quorum and vote in respect of any matters in which they have an interest.\n\nIn relation to Darrell's appointment as a non-executive director of Scotia Holdings (US) Inc. from 4 February 2022, a potential situational conflict was reviewed and authorised by the Board as another company in the Bank of Nova Scotia group is a supplier to the Group in Colombia (although those supply arrangements are not material and Darrell has no involvement in the operations of that supplier or BAT subsidiary operations in Colombia). The Board determined that these arrangements did not impact Mr Thomas' independence as a Non-Executive Director of the Company.\n\n## Directors Information and Advice\n\nDirectors receive effective support to assist them in meeting their responsibilities under the UK Corporate Governance Code and discharging their directors' duties, both individually and collectively.\n\n- - Directors receive papers for review in good time ahead of each Board and Committee meeting.\n- - Papers and presentations to the Board and its Committees include discussion of specific stakeholder considerations as applicable.\n- - The Company Secretary ensures effective information flow within and between the Board and its Committees, and between the Non-Executive Directors and senior management.\n- - The Company Secretary, in conjunction with external advisers where appropriate, advises the Board on all governance matters.\n- - All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary. The appointment and replacement of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board.\n- - A procedure is in place for all Directors to take independent professional advice at the Company's expense if required.\n- - Each Board Committee may obtain independent legal or other professional advice, at the Company's expense, and secure attendance at meetings of external participants if needed.\n\n## SPOTLIGHT\n\n## Chairman induction\n\nLuc completed his Chairman induction programme in Q1 2021 following his appointment as Chairman Designate. Luc's induction was conducted primarily through virtual meetings due to COVID-19 restrictions then in place.\n\nThe programme included meetings with outgoing Chairman Richard Burrows and each of the Directors. Luc participated in a comprehensive series of briefings with senior management, enabling in-depth discussion of strategic planning, business regions, product portfolios, digital transformation, our ethos, culture and sustainability agenda, shareholder and wider stakeholder engagement programmes, evolving regulation, corporate governance, and treasury, risk, and legal matters.\n\nLuc met with representatives of key shareholders prior to the AGM in April 2021, and also attended sessions with the external audit partner and the Remuneration Committee's UK and U.S. consultants and introductory meetings with representatives of key external business partners.",

Darrell Thomas completed his Non-Executive Director's induction in early 2021, as set out in the Annual Report and Form 20-F for 2020.\n\n## Professional Development\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive a full programme of briefings during the year across all areas of the Group's activities from the Executive Directors, members of the Management Board, the Company Secretary, other senior executives and outside advisors.\n\nDuring 2021, key briefings for the Board included cyber security, patent portfolios, evolving product regulation, and other regulations impacting the Group's business and governance arrangements, for example, the UK Financial Conduct Authority's consultation on the proposed introduction of new regulations to enhance disclosure of the diversity of boards and executive management.\n\nIn the context of reviewing the Group's climate strategy and enhanced sustainability targets, the Board was briefed on the objectives and requirements of the TCFD framework and stakeholder expectations on progress towards net zero carbon emissions across operational supply chains. The Board also recapped on directors' duties under Section 172 of the UK Companies Act 2006 as part of its annual review of Group stakeholder engagement.\n\nCommittees of the Board are kept updated on developments within their respective remits. In 2021, the Audit Committee was updated on regulator and stakeholder expectations in respect of addressing climate risks in annual reporting, UK Government proposals to reform audit and corporate governance regulation, and in relation to revisions to applicable UK auditing standards and their impact. The Remuneration Committee was regularly updated by its external consultants on UK and U.S. corporate governance developments impacting executive remuneration.\n\n## 2021: Internal Board Review Process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Evaluate\n\n- - Directors evaluate performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees (as applicable) and each of the other Directors.\n\n## 2. Report\n\n- - The Company Secretary collates anonymised feedback and prepares reports for the Board, its Committees and each of the Directors.\n\n## 3. Review and Action\n\n- - Board Committees review evaluation outcomes, identify any actions and provide feedback to the Board.\n- - The Board reviews the evaluation outcomes and identifies action areas.\n- - The Chairman provides feedback to the other Directors. The Senior Independent Director provides feedback to the Chairman.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-Executive Directors regularly attend meetings of the Group's Regional Audit and Corporate and Social Responsibility Committees and Corporate Audit Committee to gain a better understanding of the Group's regions and central functions and the risks faced by the business at market, regional and functional levels. The Chairman meets with each Non-Executive Director individually towards the end of each year, to discuss their individual training and development plans.\n\n## Board Review Process\n\nThe performance and effectiveness of the Board, its Committees, the Executive and Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman were evaluated internally in 2021, facilitated by the Company Secretary. An external evaluation of the Board, its Committees and the Directors was conducted in 2019, facilitated by Independent Audit Limited.\n\nThe Chairman is responsible for the overall evaluation process and each Committee Chair is responsible for the evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of their Committee. The evaluations were conducted through a series of detailed questionnaires and all participants were requested to provide commentary to support their assessments.\n\nAll Directors participated in the evaluation process, assessing the Board, the Committees of which they were a member or regularly attended in 2021, and each of the Directors individually. In addition, several members of the Management Board and other senior management participated in elements of the evaluation.\n\nAnonymised reports specifying the findings of the evaluations were prepared by the Company Secretary for the Board and each Committee. The Board and Committees then reviewed and discussed their respective reports and identified action areas for 2022 taking into account the evaluation findings.\n\nThe Chairman received reports from the Company Secretary on the performance and effectiveness of all Executive and NonExecutive Directors (other than himself) in 2021 and he provided individual feedback to each Director.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director received a report from the Company Secretary on the Chairman's performance and effectiveness, and led a discussion reviewing the Chairman's effectiveness with the other Directors (without the Chairman present). The Senior Independent Director then provided feedback to the Chairman.",

The Board continued to be adaptable in the face of COVID-19, and praised management's consistent approach to prioritising staff welfare in 2021.\n\nThe Chairman and two new Non-Executive Directors were welcomed to the Board, refreshing the skillsets and perspectives of an already diverse and experienced team.\n\nNon-Executive Directors were seen to be supportive in the development of strategy and offering appropriate challenge. The candid nature of their discussions with the executive team was highlighted as a good example of the open culture at Board and senior management level.\n\nThe organisation's resilience was clear to the Board in 2021, notwithstanding constraints on spending time in the wider business. The Non-Executive Directors look forward to resuming their usual programme of market and site visits in 2022.\n\n## Key Action for 2022\n\n- - Plan for Non-Executive Director market and site visits.\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Board considered its strategy discussions to be effective, leading to strong strategic objective setting, and notably in driving the ESG and people agendas forward in the year. The Remuneration Committee has been focused on ensuring that strategic objectives are reflected in the Group's remuneration strategy.\n\nFollowing up on actions arising from the 2020 Board evaluation to allow additional time for deep dives on strategic objectives and review of major initiatives, during the year the Board's agenda included a series of in-depth reviews: for example on talent strategy, ESG agenda and the New Categories supply chain.\n\nThe Board is keen to build on this into 2022 with further emphasis on the competitor landscape, scenario planning, and emerging issues and trends.\n\n## Key Action for 2022\n\n- - More detail for the Board on the competitive landscape and consumer trends, with more time in the Board agenda for in-depth scenario analysis and planning.\n\n## Composition and succession\n\nThe Board regards its composition to be well balanced in terms of skills, experience, geography and gender, with recent appointments demonstrating its effectiveness at bringing the right people around the table.\n\nFollowing up on actions arising from the 2020 Board evaluation, the Nominations Committee completed its skills profile for future non-executive directors to support succession planning. The Nominations Committee is keen to see more of the executive management pipeline in 2022.\n\n## Key Action for 2022\n\n- - Additional time to be allowed on the Board agenda for executive management succession planning.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe continued focus on business controls and compliance is highly regarded by the Board, and the Board's monitoring of key risks and oversight of compliance is considered to be effective.\n\nThe Audit Committee's oversight of the fundamental reporting environment was considered to be sound, with the Committee staying on top of key projects and activities.\n\nIn the context of the Group's transformational agenda, Directors noted the benefit of understanding the risks and stresses of extensive business change and the pressure points from a people perspective.\n\nActions arising from the 2020 Board evaluation, to further enhance the Board's understanding of strategic opportunities and risks presented by evolving technologies, were followed up during the year. For example, the Board reviewed developments in cyber security and the Audit Committee assessed digital transformation risks and the approach to managing risks identified.\n\n## Key Action for 2022\n\n- - Further emphasis in the Board agenda on change management in the context of the Group's transformational agenda, including from a people perspective.\n\n## Dynamics and information\n\nBoard and Committee meetings are considered to be chaired effectively, and well-supported by the Company Secretariat.\n\nThe Chairman was recognised for his inclusive style and fostering open discussion. Agendas are seen as well-balanced between business critical items and governance matters.\n\nDuring the year the Board conducted several in-depth reviews of market analysis and the competitor environment in response to actions identified from the 2020 Board evaluation to emphasise time for these areas in the Board agenda.\n\n## Key Action for 2022\n\n- - Additional pre-read material to be provided for key presentations to enable greater time for discussion in Board meetings.",

Our Non-Executive Directors come from a broad range of industry and professional backgrounds, with varied experience and expertise aligned to the Group's strategy.\n\nBiographies of the Directors, including a summary of their skills, experience and contribution brought to the Board, are set out on pages 100 to 101. The diversity of our Board is set out on this page and our Board Diversity Policy is discussed on page 119.\n\n## Board Succession Planning\n\nThe Board considers the length of service of the Board members as a whole and the need for it to refresh its membership progressively over time. The Nominations Committee is responsible for regularly reviewing the composition of the Board and Management Board to ensure both have an appropriate balance of skills, expertise and knowledge. The Committee is also responsible for identifying candidates for Board positions and ensuring that all appointments are made on merit, against objective criteria, and with due regard for our Board Diversity Policy (see page 119). This process includes a full evaluation of candidates' attributes and how these would augment the Board's mix of skills, expertise and knowledge and involves interviews with a range of candidates.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee assessed the profiles, skills and experience required of future Non-Executive Directors, taking into account the Group's purpose and strategy. Following this assessment, the Committee developed candidate profile requirements to support Non-Executive Director succession planning. Heidrick & Struggles 1 was appointed to support the Committee with future Non-Executive Director search activities in 2021. The Committee will report on the process leading to the appointment of Krishnan 'Kandy' Anand as a Non-Executive Director from 14 February 2022 in the Annual Report and Form 20-F for 2022.\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2022\n\nWith the exception of Marion Helmes, the Company will submit all eligible Directors for re-election and, in the case of Kandy Anand, election for the first time. Prior to making recommendations to the Board in respect of Directors' submissions for re-election, the Committee carried out an assessment of each Director, including their performance, contribution to the long-term sustainable success of the Company and, in respect of each of the Non-Executive Directors, their continued independence.\n\nIn relation to the proposed reappointment of Savio Kwan, who will have served as a Non-Executive Director for just over eight years at the time of the 2022 AGM, the Committee conducted a particularly rigorous review, taking into account relevant considerations including his performance and his attendance record. The Committee concluded that Savio continues to make effective use of his experience, challenges management constructively and maintains independence of thought and approach, and considered it appropriate to recommend to the Board that Savio be submitted for re-election at the 2022 AGM.\n\nThe Chairman's letter accompanying the 2022 AGM Notice confirms that all Non-Executive Directors being proposed for re-election are effective and that they continue to demonstrate commitment to their roles.\n\n## Board Retirements\n\nRichard Burrows stepped down as Chairman and from the Board with effect from the conclusion of the Company's AGM on 28 April 2021. Jerry Fowden stepped down from the Board with effect from 1 April 2021. Marion Helmes will step down from the Board with effect from the conclusion of the Company's AGM on 28 April 2022.\n\n## Board Balance at 31 December 2021\n\n## Balance of Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Length of tenure of Non-Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nationality of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors: Ethnicity balance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Directors: Gender balance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.

Our policy expresses how we think of diversity in its widest sense, as those attributes that make each of us unique. These include our race, ethnicity, cultural and social background, geographical origin, gender, age, any disability, sexual orientation, religion, skills, experience, education and professional background, perspectives and thinking styles.\n\n## Objectives and Progress Update\n\nThe objectives of our Board Diversity Policy (as applied in 2021) and progress against these objectives in the year are set out below. The Board complies with the recommendations on ethnic diversity made by the Parker Review.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the representation of women on the Board was 40%, compliant with the recommendations on gender diversity made by the Hampton-Alexander Review.\n\n## Objective in 2021\n\n## Progress in 2021\n\n| Considering all aspects of diversity when reviewing  the composition of, and succession planning for, the  Board and Management Board.                                   | - The Nominations Committee has regard to diversity in its widest  sense, including attributes such as gender, race, ethnicity, cultural and  social backgrounds, and other personal attributes, when undertaking  these activities.                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Considering a wide pool of candidates  across genders for appointment to the Board.                                                                                      | - Executive search firms are engaged to support Board and Management  Board succession planning where applicable and are required to provide  gender-balanced shortlists of candidates.

The Nominations Committee will be actively progressing its Non-Executive Director succession planning to meet this objective, supported by the Board Diversity Policy.\n\nIn view of the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) consultation on enhanced disclosure of the diversity of boards and executive management, the Board also anticipates that a revised Board Diversity Policy will be introduced during 2022, aligned to any new UK Listing Rules requirements implemented by the FCA.",

The report sets out the Committee's role and responsibilities, and discusses our activities during the year.\n\nKaren Guerra joined the Committee on 1 April 2021 and, later that month, Luc Jobin stepped down from the Committee on his appointment as Chairman. We welcome Karen and extend our thanks to Luc for his service to the Committee since 2019.\n\nWe have addressed a series of important topics this year. We assessed climate-related risks and their impact on the Group to ensure robust processes are in place to identify, assess and manage climate risks in alignment with the TCFD framework. We also reviewed the approach to managing cyber security and digital transformation risks across the Group and our role in monitoring cyber security controls is now expressly recognised in the Committee's revised terms of reference.\n\nWe have given detailed consideration to a range of accounting matters during the year, including rigorous assessment of adjusting items. We also introduced a new Group accounting policy on biological assets in view of the Group's acquisition of a noncontrolling interest in Organigram Holdings Inc.\n\nAlongside these activities, we maintained our focus on safeguarding a sound control environment, taking account of the continued impact of COVID-19 on ways of working. We monitored progress on the internal audit plan during the year and are satisfied the blended approach to remote and on-site audits continues to be effective. The internal audit plan approved for 2022 builds on these principles and is designed to be responsive to the evolving nature of Group risks.\n\nWe appreciate the expectations of our shareholders and wider stakeholders for transparent, high quality reporting on our ESG metrics and progress on our sustainability agenda. Our Group sustainability reporting is well established, including procedures for reporting ESG metrics and related information. To enhance this, we have extended the scope of external assurance of reported ESG metrics, overseen by the Committee under our revised terms of reference.\n\n## Holly Keller Koeppel\n\nAudit Committee Chair",

The Committee concurred with management's assessments and disclosures in respect of these (see note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts);\n- -contingent liabilities, provisions and deposits in connection with ongoing litigation:\n\nImperial Tobacco Canada (ITCAN): monitoring the status of the ongoing Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) proceedings under which Group subsidiary ITCAN filed for protection in March 2019 following the judgment of the Quebec Court of Appeal in the Quebec Class Action lawsuits. The Committee also reassessed the accounting treatment in respect of all other ongoing tobacco-related litigation to which ITCAN is a defendant and confirmed that it continued to be appropriate to make no provision in respect of that litigation, as it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount of any potential settlement (see note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts) and that, whilst ITCAN is subject to the CCAA proceedings, it continued to be appropriate to consolidate ITCAN's financial results in the Group financial statements;\n\nFox and Kalamazoo rivers: the Committee reassessed the provision in respect of the Fox River clean-up costs and related legal expenses and confirmed that the provision would continue to be retained at the prior year level (see note 24 in the Notes on the Accounts), although inherent uncertainties remain (see note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts). The Committee reviewed the position in respect of the Kalamazoo River claim and assessed that no provision should be recognised on the basis set out at note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts;\n\nReynolds American Companies: the Committee considered and endorsed management's approach to accounting for the Master Settlement Agreement and the Engle class-action and progeny cases consistent with the prior year (see note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts); and\n\nVAT on social contributions in Brazil: the Committee assessed the accounting treatment applicable to claims made by a Group subsidiary in Brazil for refunds of VAT on social contributions made in Brazil (see note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts) and in relation to the disposal of part of the associated contingent asset (see note 5 in the Notes on the Accounts);\n\n- -foreign exchange and hyperinflation: as the Group has operations in certain jurisdictions with severe currency restrictions where foreign currency is not readily available, including in hyperinflationary territories such as Venezuela, the Committee assessed management's approach to applicable accounting treatment and confirmed that methodologies used to determine relevant exchange rates for accounting purposes were appropriate;\n- -goodwill and intangibles impairment review: the Committee reviewed management's assessments of the carrying value of intangibles including goodwill (see note 12 in the Notes on the Accounts), with particular focus on:\n\nUS Business: the Committee considered potential regulatory changes in the US in relation to menthol in cigarettes and assessed that no impairment was required for US business goodwill or intangible assets and that retaining indefinite-life designation for the Newport and Camel brand intangibles was appropriate;\n\nGTR: despite a delay in returning to normal operations after COVID-19, the Committee concurred with management's assessment that there was no indication of impairment;\n\nPeru: the Committee reviewed the Group's business in Peru and concluded that an impairment to goodwill or other intangibles of \u00a354 million was required;\n\nImperial Tobacco Canada (ITCAN): the Committee assessed that, notwithstanding ongoing proceedings (including the CCAA process) in respect of Group subsidiary ITCAN, there was no indication of impairment to goodwill;\n\n- -changes in the Group: the Committee considered the accounting treatment in relation to the Group's disposal of operations in Iran (concurring with the accounting for the disposal including treatment of costs and foreign exchange) and acquisition of an initial 19.9% equity investment in Organigram Holdings Inc. and concurred with management's assessment to account for this as an associate ( see note 14 in the Notes on the Accounts);\n- -hybrid bonds: the Committee assessed the issuance of perpetual hybrid bonds, concurring with management's assessment for such to be classified as equity instead of borrowings; and\n- -adjusting items: the Committee conducted a rigorous assessment of all adjusting items, including the appropriate application of adjusting items treatment to Quantum programme implementation costs (see note 7 in the Notes on the Accounts) and costs arising from the disposal of the Group's operations in Iran (see note 6(f) in the Notes on the Accounts).\n\n## Risk topics considered by the Committee included:\n\n- - risks relating to the continued impact of COVID-19 and the approach to incorporating those risks into existing risks to the Group managed under the Group's risk register;\n- - climate change risks and their impact on the Group, to ensure robust processes are in place to manage both physical and transitional climate change risks, and annual reporting on the identification, assessment and management of those risks, in alignment with the TCFD framework;\n- - risks related to ESG and the approach to incorporating ESG risks into existing risks managed under the Group's risk register, to ensure appropriate internal standards, strategic plans, governance, monitoring and reporting mechanisms are in place to align with recognised international standards, meet external expectations and identify emerging issues;\n- - current and emerging risks in the context of the Group's digital strategy, technology architecture and data management, with particular focus on digital transformation, cyber security, protection of the Group's information systems and data, and the approach to managing those risks;",

The Committee continually reviews its relationship with the auditors, including consideration as to when it next intends to complete a competitive tender process for the Company's external audit. The Committee also reviews the quality of the audit and discusses opportunities for improvement with KPMG and management. These are taken into consideration in determining when the Committee next intends to complete a competitive tender process for the external audit.\n\nThe Committee considers the relationship with the auditors to be working well and remains satisfied with their effectiveness. The Committee's review of external auditor effectiveness is discussed on page 124. In view of this, and having considered the continued independence and objectivity of the auditors, the Committee considers it to be in the best interests of the Company's shareholders for KPMG to remain as auditors for the following financial year.\n\nThe Committee will continue to monitor this, taking into account the effectiveness and independence of the auditors and the best interests of shareholders, and will ensure that an audit tender is conducted no later than in respect of the 2025 financial year in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\n## UK Competition and Markets Authority Audit Order\n\nThe Company has complied with the Statutory Audit Services Order issued by the UK Competition and Markets Authority for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Group Auditor Independence Policy (AIP)\n\nThe Group has an established AIP, reflecting the requirements of applicable laws, to safeguard the independence and objectivity of the Group's external auditors and to specify the approval processes for the engagement of the Group's external auditors to provide audit, audit-related and other non-audit services. The key principle of the AIP is that the Group's external auditors may only be engaged to provide services in cases where the provision of those services does not impair auditor independence and objectivity.\n\nThe Committee recognises that using the external auditors to provide services can be beneficial given their detailed knowledge of our business. However, the AIP does not permit the Committee to delegate its responsibilities to the external auditors and the external auditors are only permitted to provide audit, audit-related and non-audit services in accordance with the AIP.\n\nThe AIP does not permit the external auditors to maintain a financial, employment or business relationship with any Group company, or provide services to any Group company, which:\n\n- - creates a mutual or conflicting interest with any Group company;\n- - places the external auditors in the position of auditing their own work;\n- - results in the external auditors acting as a manager or employee of any Group company; or\n- - places the external auditor in the position of advocate for any Group company.\n\nAudit services are approved in advance by the Committee on the basis of an annual engagement letter and the scope of audit services is agreed by the Committee with the external auditors.\n\nSubject to the restrictions specified in the AIP, the external auditors may also provide certain non-audit services with the prior approval of the Committee. The requirement for the Committee's preapproval of non-audit services may be waived only if the aggregate amount of all non-audit services provided is less than 5% of the total amount paid to the external auditors during the reporting year, where those services were not recognised to be non-audit services at the time of engagement, and provided those services are promptly brought to the attention of the Committee and their provision is approved prior to completion of the audit in the relevant reporting year.\n\nThe provision of permitted non-audit services must be put to tender if expected spend exceeds limits specified in the AIP, unless a waiver of this requirement, in accordance with the terms of the AIP, is agreed by the Finance and Transformation Director and notified to the Committee.\n\n## The AIP:\n\n- - requires Committee pre-approval for all audit, audit-related and other non-audit services, except in respect of non-audit services falling within the exceptions described above;\n- - prohibits the provision of certain types of services by the external auditors, including those with contingent fee arrangements, expert services unrelated to audit and other services prohibited by US securities laws and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;\n- - prohibits the Chief Executive, Finance and Transformation Director, Group Financial Controller and Group Chief Accountant from having been employed by the external auditors in any capacity in connection with the Group audit for two years before initiation of an audit;\n- - specifies requirements in respect of audit partner rotation, including for both the lead and the concurring external audit partners to rotate off the Group audit engagement at least every five years, and not to recommence provision of audit or audit-related services to the Group for a further five years; and\n- - provides authority for the Committee to oversee any allegations of improper influence, coercion, manipulation or purposeful misleading in connection with any external audit, and to review any issues arising in the course of engagement with the external auditors.",

Tax services and other non-audit services in excess of the tender thresholds referred to above must be itemised. Updated schedules are also submitted to the Committee at midyear and year-end, so that it has full visibility of the Group spend on services provided by the Group's external auditors.\n\nA breakdown of audit, audit-related, tax and other non-audit fees paid to KPMG firms and associates in 2021 is provided in note 6(i) in the Notes on the Accounts and is summarised as follows:\n\n## Services provided by KPMG firms and associates 2021\n\n|                                        | 2021  \u00a3m   | 2020  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Audit services                         | 18.2       | 18.6       |\n| Audit of defined benefit schemes       | 0.4        | 0.5        |\n| Audit-related assurance services       | 8.0        | 8.5        |\n| Total audit and audit-related services | 26.6       | 27.6       |\n| Other assurance services               | 0.3        | 0.5        |\n| Tax advisory services                  | -          | -          |\n| Tax compliance                         | -          | -          |\n| Other non-audit services               | -          | -          |\n| Total non-audit services               | 0.3        | 0.5        |\n\n## Note:\n\nIn 2021, non-audit fees paid to KPMG amounted to 1.1% of the audit and audit-related assurance fees paid to them (2020: 1.8%). All audit and non-audit services provided by the external auditors in 2021 were pre-approved by the Committee.\n\n## External auditor effectiveness\n\nThe Committee, on behalf of the Board, is responsible for the relationship with the external auditors. The Committee carries out an annual assessment of the Group's external auditors, covering qualification, expertise and resources, objectivity and independence, and the effectiveness of the audit process. This assessment takes into account the Committee's interactions with, and observations of, the external auditors and considers a range of factors, including:\n\n- - experience and expertise of the external auditors in their direct communication with, and support to, the Committee;\n- - their mindset and professional scepticism;\n- - their effectiveness in completing the agreed external audit plan;\n- - their approach to handling significant audit and accounting judgements;\n- - content, quality and robustness of the external auditors' reports; and\n- - their provision of non-audit services, as noted above, and other matters that may impact independence.\n\nThe Committee's assessment is also informed by an external audit satisfaction survey completed by members of the Group's senior management. No material issues were identified during the external auditor assessment in 2021. The Committee is satisfied with the qualification, expertise and resources of its external auditors, and that the objectivity and independence of its external auditors are not in any way impaired by the non-audit services which they provide. The Committee has recommended to the Board the proposed reappointment of KPMG at the 2022 AGM.\n\nThe Committee Chair, Finance and Transformation Director, Director, Legal & External Affairs and General Counsel, Group Head of Internal Audit and the Company Secretary all meet with the external auditors regularly throughout the year to discuss relevant issues as well as the progress of the external audit. Any significant issues are included on the Committee's agenda.\n\n## Audit Partner Rotation\n\nIn accordance with the requirements of the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Ethical Standard and the US SEC independence rules on partner rotation, the previous audit partner's term concluded at the end of the 2020 year-end audit and the current audit partner's tenure commenced from the start of the 2021 year-end audit.\n\n## FRC review of Half Year report to 30 June 2021\n\nThe FRC carried out a review of the Company's Half Year report to 30 June 2021. The FRC correspondence with the Company regarding the outcomes of that review confirmed there were no questions or queries that required substantive correspondence between the Company and the FRC.\n\nThe outcomes of the FRC review of the Company's Half Year report were reviewed by the Committee and have been taken into account in the preparation of the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe review conducted by the FRC was based solely on the Company's published Half Year report to 30 June 2021. The FRC's review does not provide any assurance that the Half Year Report is correct in all material respects; the FRC's role is to consider compliance with reporting requirements, not to verify the information provided.\n\n## Risk Management and Internal Control\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Company maintains its system of risk management and internal control with a view to safeguarding shareholders' investment and the Company's assets. It is designed to identify, evaluate and manage risks that may impede the Company's objectives. It cannot, and is not designed to, eliminate them entirely. The system therefore provides a reasonable, not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. A description of the principal risks that may affect the Group's business is provided in our Strategic Report on pages 92 to 97.\n\nThe main features of the risk management processes and system of internal control operated within the Group are described below. These have been in place throughout the year under review and remain in place to date. These do not cover associates of the Group.\n\n## Board oversight\n\nDuring the year, the Board considered the nature and extent of the principal risks that the Group is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives (its 'risk appetite') and its framework for maintaining sound risk management and internal control systems. Risk appetite is reviewed annually by the Board to ensure that it is appropriate. Alongside a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group (including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency, liquidity and viability), the Board also considers emerging risks which may challenge the Group's ability to achieve its strategic objectives in the future. Each emerging risk is assessed by the Board on its potential impact and likelihood and, where applicable, incorporated into the Group's risk register with appropriate mitigating activities. Emerging risks are kept under regular review by the Committee, prior to Board assessment.\n\nWith the support of the Committee, the Board also conducts an annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems. This review covers all material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls and risk management systems, with the Committee continuing to have a strong focus on IT systems and controls.",

        "page_content": "## Audit and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Committee framework\n\nThe Group's Regional Audit and CSR Committee framework underpins the Audit Committee. It provides a flexible channel for the structured flow of information through the Group, with committees for each of the three Group regions, for the US business, and for locally-listed Group entities and specific markets where considered appropriate.\n\nThe Regional Audit and CSR Committees are supported by Risk and Control Committees established at business unit level, and within certain Group functions where applicable.\n\nThis framework ensures that significant financial, social, environmental, governance and reputational risks faced by the Group are appropriately managed and that any failings or weaknesses are identified so that remedial action may be taken. The Group's Regional Audit and CSR Committees are all chaired by an Executive Director, comprise members of the Management Board and regularly attended by one or more NonExecutive Directors.\n\nIn addition, the Corporate Audit Committee focuses on the Group's risks and control environment that fall outside the regional committees' remit, such as central functions, and global programmes, processes and projects. It comprises members of the Management Board and is chaired by a Regional Director. One or more of the Non-Executive Directors also regularly attend meetings of the Corporate Audit Committee.\n\nExternal and internal auditors attend meetings of these committees and regularly have private audiences with members of the committees after meetings. Additionally, central, regional and individual market management, along with Internal Audit, support the Board in its role of ensuring a sound control environment.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRisk registers, based on a standardised methodology, are used at Group, functional, directly-reporting business unit (DRBU), and individual market levels to identify, assess and monitor the risks (both financial and non-financial) faced by the business at each level. Risks are assessed and prioritised at three levels by reference to their impact (high/medium/low) and likelihood (probable/ possible/unlikely).\n\nMitigation plans are required to be in place to manage the risks identified, and progress against those plans is monitored. The risk registers are reviewed on a regular basis. Functional and regional risk registers are reviewed regularly by the relevant Regional Audit and CSR Committee or the Corporate Audit Committee, as appropriate. DRBU and market risk registers are reviewed as part of local Risk and Controls meetings.\n\nAt the Group level, specific responsibility for managing each identified risk is allocated to a member of the Management Board. The Group risk register is reviewed regularly by a committee of senior managers, chaired by the Finance and Transformation Director. In addition, it is reviewed annually by the Board and twice yearly by the Committee. The Board and the Committee review changes in the status of identified risks and assess the changes in impact and likelihood. The Committee also conducts detailed reviews on selected risks, meeting senior managers responsible for managing and mitigating them, so that it can consider those risks at a more granular level.\n\nAs reported in the Company's half-year report to 30 June 2021, the Group no longer maintains 'market size reduction and consumer downtrading' as a principal risk, due to the Group's strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth with a range of innovation and less harmful products. The Group's current principal risks otherwise remain broadly unaltered from those maintained as at 31 December 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board also considered the Group Viability Statement see page 92 of the Strategic Report @\n\nFor more information on risks see the Group Principal Risks on pages 92 to 97 and the Group risk factors on pages 317 to 339\n\n## Internal control\n\nGroup operating companies and other business units are annually required to complete a controls self-assessment, called Control Navigator, of the key controls that they are expected to have in place. Its purpose is to enable them to self-assess their internal control environment, assist them in identifying any controls that may need strengthening and support them in implementing and monitoring action plans to address control weaknesses. The Control Navigator assessment is reviewed annually to ensure that it remains relevant to the business and covers all applicable key controls. In addition, at each year-end, Group operating companies and other business units are required to:\n\n- - review their system of internal control, confirm whether it remains effective, and report on any specific control deficiencies and the action being taken to address them; and\n- - review and confirm that policies and procedures to promote compliance with the SoBC are fully embedded and identify any material instances of non-compliance.\n\nThe results of these reviews are reported to the relevant Regional Audit and CSR Committees or to the Corporate Audit Committee, and to the Audit Committee, to ensure that appropriate remedial action has been, or will be, taken where necessary. They are also considered by the SOx Steering Committee and the Disclosure Committee in determining management's opinion on the internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR).\n\n## Annual review\n\nThe Financial Reporting Council's 'Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting' provides guidance in relation to issues of risk and internal control management and related reporting.\n\nThe processes described above, and the reports that they give rise to, enable the Board and the Committee to monitor risk and internal control management on a continuing basis throughout the year and to review its effectiveness at the year-end. The Board, with advice from the Committee, has completed its annual review of the effectiveness of that system for 2021.\n\nThe Board is satisfied that the system of risk and internal control management accords with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and satisfies the requirements for internal controls over financial reporting.",

A separate Business Controls Team provides advice and guidance on controls to the Group's businesses.\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit function works to a rolling 18-month audit plan, prioritising principal risk areas aligned to the Group's risk register. During 2021, the Internal Audit plan was kept under regular review with the Committee, enabling flexibility to augment the plan to cover additional audit assignments in response to emerging risks where appropriate and ongoing monitoring of the continuing effectiveness of remote audit work.\n\nIn 2021, internal audits covered various markets, manufacturing facilities in various locations and a range of other business activities, including business continuity planning, cyber and data security and access controls, IT infrastructure, supply chain compliance, leaf sourcing, business transformation programmes, business to consumer (B2C) e-commerce channels and New Categories youth access prevention procedures. The Committee considered internal audit findings and action plans established to address any issues identified.\n\nThe scope of each internal audit is assessed for SOx impact and audit of applicable SOx controls is included where relevant. Reviews of SOx controls and their effectiveness are primarily conducted by the Group's Business Controls Team and assurance is also undertaken by the Group's external auditors, see page 127.\n\nThe Committee has approved the Internal Audit plan for 2022 and assessed its alignment with the Group's risk register and coverage of Group risks. The design of the Internal Audit plan for 2022 builds on progress made in 2021, with enhanced use of data analytics, and takes account of the evolving nature of Group risks.\n\nThe strategic priorities for Internal Audit underpin the design of the Internal Audit plan for 2022, with continued emphasis on New Categories and innovation in ways of working, whilst maintaining thorough coverage of core business activities, lines of defence and IT controls. The Internal Audit plan for 2022 anticipates the continuation of COVID-19 travel restrictions into 2022, balancing remote fieldwork and use of data analytics with focused site visits.\n\nThe Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group's internal audit function annually. The Committee considers the Internal Audit function to be effective and to have the necessary resources to enable it to fulfil its mandate.\n\n## Financial reporting controls\n\nThe Group has in place a series of policies, practices and controls in relation to the financial reporting and consolidation process, which are designed to address key financial reporting risks, including risks arising from changes in the business or accounting standards, and to provide assurance of the completeness and accuracy of the Annual Report and Form 20-F.\n\nA key area of focus is to assess whether the Annual Report and Form 20-F and financial statements are 'fair, balanced and understandable' in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, with particular regard to:\n\nFair: Consistency of reporting between the financial statements and narrative reporting of Group performance and coverage of an overall picture of the Group's performance;\n\nBalanced: Consistency of narrative reporting of significant accounting judgements and key matters considered by the Committee with disclosures of material judgements and uncertainties noted in the financial statements; appropriate use, prominence and explanation of primary and adjusted performance measures; and\n\nUnderstandable: Clarity and structure of the Annual Report and Form 20-F and financial statements, appropriate emphasis of key messages, and use of succinct and focused narrative with strong linkage throughout the report, to provide shareholders with the information needed to assess the Group's business, performance, strategy and financial position.\n\nThe Group Manual of Accounting Policies and Procedures sets out the Group accounting policies, its treatment of transactions and its internal reporting requirements.\n\nThe internal reporting of financial information to prepare the Group's annual and half-year financial statements is signed off by the heads of finance responsible for the Group's markets and business units. The heads of finance responsible for the Group's markets and all senior managers must also confirm annually that all information relevant to the Group audit has been provided to the Directors and that reasonable steps have been taken to ensure full disclosure in response to requests for information from the external auditors.\n\nThe Committee Chair participated in the 2021 Annual Report and Form 20-F drafting and review processes, and engaged with the Finance and Transformation Director and the Group Head of Internal Audit during the drafting process.\n\n## External assurance of ESG metrics and related information\n\nTo further strengthen robust procedures in place for reporting ESG metrics and related information for the Group in the Annual Report and Form 20-F, the scope of external assurance over annual reporting of ESG metrics and related information has been extended, with the work of the external assurance provider overseen by the Committee under its revised terms of reference discussed on page 121.\n\nFollowing a competitive tender process, KPMG LLP were appointed as the external assurance provider in relation to defined ESG metrics and related information. The Committee approved KPMG's provision of these services in accordance with the requirements of the Group Auditor Independence Policy. ESG metrics and related information subject to external assurance are identified in the assurance statement set out in our 2021 ESG Report.",

SOx places specific responsibility on our Chief Executive and the Finance and Transformation Director to certify or disclose information applicable to the financial statements, disclosure controls and procedures (DCP) and ICFR. This includes our Chief Executive and Finance and Transformation Director giving attestations in respect of ICFR effectiveness under \u00a7404 of SOx.\n\nThe Committee has oversight of processes established to ensure full and ongoing compliance with applicable US securities laws, including SOx. Two committees provided assurance during 2021 with regard to applicable SOx certifications. The Disclosure Committee reviews the Company's financial statements for appropriate disclosure, designs and maintains DCPs, and reports to, and is subject to the oversight of, the Chief Executive and the Finance and Transformation Director.\n\nA sub-committee of the Disclosure Committee, the SOx Steering Committee, provides assurance that ICFR have been designed, and are being operated, implemented, evaluated and disclosed appropriately, in accordance with applicable requirements and subject to the oversight of the Chief Executive and Finance and Transformation Director.

No waivers or exceptions to the Code of Ethics were granted in 2021.\n\n## Group Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC)\n\nThe Committee is responsible for monitoring compliance with the SoBC, and reports on this to the Board. The SoBC requires all staff to act with a high degree of business integrity, comply with applicable laws and regulations, and ensure that standards are never compromised for the sake of results. Every Group company and all staff worldwide, including senior management and the Board, are expected to adhere to the SoBC. The SoBC and the Group's Delivery with Integrity compliance programme are discussed on pages 56 to 57.\n\nAll Group companies have adopted the SoBC or local equivalent. Information on compliance with the SoBC is gathered at a regional and global level and reports of SoBC allegations, including details of the channels through which allegations are reported, are provided on a regular basis to the Regional Audit and CSR Committees, Corporate Audit Committee, and to the Committee. A breakdown of SoBC contacts and SoBC allegations reported across the Group in 2021 is set out on page 57.\n\nThe SoBC and information on the total number of SoBC contacts and SoBC allegations reported in 2021 (including established breaches) is available at bat.com/sobc.\n\n## Speak Up\n\nThe Group maintains Speak Up channels which enable concerns regarding SoBC compliance matters, including concerns about possible improprieties in financial reporting, to be raised in confidence (and anonymously should an individual wish) without fear of reprisal.\n\nThe SoBC includes the Group's Speak Up policy, which is supplemented by local procedures throughout the Group that provide staff with further guidance on reporting matters and raising concerns, and the channels through which they can do so. The Board periodically reviews the Group's Speak Up policy and reports arising from Speak Up channels. The Speak Up policy was revised with effect from 1 January 2022 (as part of the revised SoBC). The Board is satisfied that the Group's Speak Up policy and procedures enable proportionate and independent investigation of matters raised, and ensure that appropriate follow-up action is taken.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about Speak Up channels and Speak Up reports on page 57\n\n## Political contributions\n\nThe Group does not make contributions to UK or European Union (EU) political organisations or incur UK or EU political expenditure.

Directors' Remuneration Policy for 2022 onwards                  | 152   |\n\nThe following Annual Report on Remuneration has been prepared in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 and as prescribed in The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the UK Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations). @ Where required and for the purpose of the audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA), data has been audited by KPMG and this is indicated appropriately. @\n\n## Introduction\n\nI am pleased to present to you the Directors' Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2021 which sets out our role and the new Remuneration Policy. This report contains:\n\n- - The Annual Remuneration Report, explaining how the current Remuneration Policy has been implemented during 2021; and\n- - The new Directors' Remuneration Policy, which will be put forward for a binding vote at the 2022 AGM.\n\n2021 has been a year of further volatility as we have continued to manage the disruption arising from the COVID-19 pandemic across our business. We are incredibly proud of the collective effort made by the Group's employees and management teams as they have remained focused on delivering growth, serving the needs of our customers and consumers, while managing through continued disruption.\n\nOur response to the pandemic has continued to be guided by our Ethos and our primary focus has been on looking after our people and protecting their health, safety, and wellbeing. Throughout the disruption caused by COVID-19 the Group has continued to focus on providing practical support to employees to navigate through this unprecedented period and has not entered furlough arrangements or made redundancies as a result of the pandemic.\n\n## Our Focus in 2021\n\nWe have completed the review of the Directors' Remuneration Policy during 2021, which has focused on opportunities to strengthen alignment with 1) the Group's strategy and ESG agenda, 2) shareholder and advisory body feedback arising from the AGM in 2021 and 3) an assessment of our position in the marketplace.\n\nOur priority has been to ensure that the Remuneration Policy:\n\n- - Creates close, long-term links between the Group's senior management and our shareholders;\n- - Enables the Group to attract and retain top quality talent in the global marketplace;\n- - Directly supports Group strategy delivery and our A Better Tomorrow TM agenda, by rewarding high levels of sustainable long-term performance in both an appropriate and competitive manner; and\n- - Continues to incorporate best practice policy features.\n\nIn summary we are proposing no changes to the headline operation or quantum of our Remuneration Policy. Our overarching objective has been to ensure that the new Remuneration Policy reflects our corporate purpose and our primary ESG ambition, to reduce the health impact of our business. Specifically, we have sought through the new Remuneration Policy to:\n\n- - Strengthen focus on revenue growth in New Categories;\n- - Ensure focus on improving profitability in New Categories; and\n- - Incentivise the continued financial performance of the Group.\n\nThe Committee acknowledges that a significant minority of shareholders have been unable to support recent decisions regarding fixed pay increases for Executive Directors and have sought fuller disclosures as to the Committee's decision-making process, which has been reflected through voting on the Directors' Remuneration Reports in 2020 and 2019. This has been a key consideration throughout the Committee's review process and our report this year is structured differently to provide greater detail on the perspectives of shareholders and how the Committee has responded, which are set out in the following pages.\n\n## Shareholder Engagement and New Remuneration Policy\n\nThe latter part of 2021 was dedicated to a programme of engagement with shareholders on the proposals which are contained in the new Remuneration Policy. We have engaged with shareholders representing 60% of our issued share capital, together with the Investment Association, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis.\n\nOur objective has been to undertake a focused review of the Remuneration Policy, building on the work undertaken in 2018 which introduced a variety of changes to our policy, including alignment of Executive Directors' pensions arrangements with those of the wider workforce and post-employment shareholding requirements. Our current Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2019 AGM with significant support from our shareholders.\n\nOur programme of shareholder engagement has helped to refine proposals and ensure that proposed changes to the Remuneration Policy are targeted and focused. Initial feedback indicated:\n\n- - That the proposals to strengthen the focus on New Categories performance within the short-term incentive plan (STI) and long-term incentive plan (LTI) are timely and appropriate for the Group, and\n- - There were opportunities to reconsider some aspects of the proposed metrics for both the STI and LTI, such as the balance and weighting between metrics and some specific performance conditions.\n\nThe tables on pages 129 and 130 summarise the proposals put forward by the Committee during shareholder engagement, together with the key points of feedback received from shareholders and the adjustments made by the Committee taking into account the feedback received.",

        "page_content": "Incentive plans - Short-Term Incentive Plan (IEIS) : The Group made changes to the IEIS for 2021 following engagement with shareholders and introduced New Categories revenue performance into the plan. Recent discussions with shareholders have focused on opportunities to further strengthen prioritisation of New Categories performance, together with the incentivisation of the continued financial performance of the Group.\n\nThe Committee considers that the proposed changes outlined below will strengthen alignment with the Group's long-term strategy delivery and the interests of shareholders.\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n2021 measures\n\nOriginal proposal\n\nFinal proposal\n\n| Short-term incentive       |     |                                    |     |                                         |     |\n|----------------------------|-----|------------------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------------|-----|\n| Volume Share               | 15% | Volume Share                       | 10% | Volume Share                            | 10% |\n| New Categories Revenue     | 20% | New Categories Revenue             | 15% | New Categories Revenue                  | 15% |\n| Adj Profit from Operations | 30% | Adj Profit from Operations         | 25% | Adj Profit from Operations              | 25% |\n| Deleverage (ex FX)         | 35% | Adj Cash Generated From Operations | 30% | Adj Cash Generated From Operations  30% |     |\n|                            |     | New Categories Contribution        | 20% | New Categories Contribution             | 20% |\n\n## Proposed change and rationale (I)\n\nThe introduction of a new measure 'New Categories contribution' with a 20% weighting. This measure will incentivise year-on-year improvement in New Categories profit contribution in line with the Group's pathway to profitability by 2025. Further details are provided on page 143.\n\n## Shareholder feedback\n\nShareholders have welcomed the introduction of 'New Categories contribution' to the IEIS as both timely and relevant.\n\nSome shareholders indicated that they need to understand how they may assess performance in this area, as at present the Group does not disclose details for New Categories contribution.\n\n## Committee response\n\nThe introduction of this new measure will be accompanied by a change in Group reporting from 2022 where we will provide revenue and category contribution as separate disclosures. Performance targets for this measure will be disclosed in the normal manner, following the close of the performance period.\n\n## Proposed change and rationale (II)\n\nThe introduction of 'adjusted cash generated from operations' with a 30% weighting. This measure will ensure continued focus on cash generation to fund further leverage reductions and returns to our shareholders. Further details are provided on page 143.\n\nThis measure will replace the 'deleveraging excluding foreign exchange' measure - the Committee is pleased with the progress made to de-lever the balance sheet over the last two years towards our medium-term corridor of 2-3x, to the point that it is felt more appropriate to re-focus on cash performance within the IEIS.\n\n## Shareholder feedback\n\nShareholders have in general been supportive of the proposed change.\n\nHowever, adjusting items within this measure have generated mixed views among some shareholders, with some expressing discomfort with adjusting for restructuring costs and litigation settlements, while other shareholders have been comfortable to adjust for litigation settlements on the basis that these are unpredictable and outside of management control.\n\n## Committee response\n\nThe Committee has considered the feedback carefully and understands shareholder views regarding adjusting for restructuring costs, which may be considered as an ongoing cost of doing business for purposes of the performance measure.\n\nConsequently, adjusting for restructuring costs has been removed from the performance measure. Litigation settlements are considered unpredictable and outside of management control, accordingly, adjusting for these have been retained as part of this measure.\n\n## Proposed change and rationale (III)\n\nMinor adjustments were proposed to the weightings for the 'Group share of key markets' measure (from 15% to 10%), the 'New Categories revenue' measure (from 20% to 15%) and the 'adjusted profit from operations' measure (from 30% to 25%).\n\n## Shareholder feedback\n\nThe majority of shareholders have been supportive of the proposed re-weightings, with some specific questions raised to understand the balance of weighting between performance measures.\n\n## Committee response\n\nWeightings were maintained as originally proposed during shareholder engagement. The Committee considered it appropriate to retain a slightly higher weighting for the 'adjusted cash generated from operations' measure given the Group's continued need to focus on cash generation to support returns to shareholders and provide flexibility with capital allocation.\n\nThe introduction of the 'New Categories contribution' measure also further strengthens the focus within the IEIS on financial performance, whereby financial metrics represent 75% of the weighting within the plan.",

These changes take into account shareholder feedback and focus on harm reduction as an imperative to delivering long-term sustainable growth, as follows:\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\n| 2021 measures            |     | Original proposal                            | Original proposal   | Final proposal                               | Final proposal   |\n|--------------------------|-----|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Long-term incentive      |     |                                              |                     |                                              |                  |\n| Adjusted revenue growth  | 20% | Adjusted revenue growth                      | 20%                 | Adjusted revenue growth                      | 15%              |\n| EPS (current / constant) | 40% | EPS (current / constant)                     | 20%                 | EPS (current / constant)                     | 30%              |\n| Cash Conversion          | 20% | Cash Conversion                              | 20%                 | Cash Conversion                              | 20%              |\n| Relative TSR             | 20% | Relative TSR (streamlined  comparator group) | 20%                 | Relative TSR (streamlined  comparator group) | 20%              |\n| Relative TSR             |     | New Categories revenue growth                | 20%                 | New Categories revenue growth                | 15%              |\n\n## Proposed change and rationale (I)\n\nThe introduction of a new measure 'New Categories revenue growth', with a 15% weighting. Our strategic objective is to provide long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders and this performance measure is directly aligned with our transformation ambitions and stated targets and will measure future growth in New Categories. Further details are provided on page 144.\n\n## Shareholder feedback\n\nThe majority of shareholders have been supportive of the introduction of this new measure.\n\nSome shareholders have wanted to understand the basis of measurement and the relationship with the 'New Categories revenue' metric in the IEIS.\n\nWhen we presented our original proposals, some shareholders requested that the Committee reconsider the relative weight between revenue measures and EPS, such that there is a greater balance between profit delivery and revenue growth.\n\n## Committee response\n\nThe inclusion of New Categories revenue growth in both the IEIS and LTIP is an important step given New Categories growth is a critical part of our long-term strategy and ESG agenda. The IEIS measure will continue to provide focus on in year delivery, while the LTIP measure will focus on cumulative and sustained performance over a three-year period.\n\nThe Committee understands the views expressed by shareholders and as a result has adjusted the original proposals such that the weighting for the 'New Categories revenue growth' and 'adjusted revenue growth' measures have been reduced from 20% to 15% and the weighting for the 'adjusted diluted earnings per share' measure has been increased from 20% to 30% to increase the overall proportion based on profitability versus the original proposals.\n\n## Proposed change and rationale (II)\n\nThe 'relative total shareholder return' (TSR) measure is retained with the current weighting of 20%. The comparator group of companies has undergone a review as the constituents have been in place since 2013, other than the addition of the Altria Group in 2019. A review of comparator companies was believed to be timely and relevant considering changes in the Group's business over the last eight years, our strategic focus and ambition to become to multi-category, new-category led business.\n\nThe review exercise has aimed to deliver a more focused and relevant comparator group comprised of businesses which are adjacent to the Group's, well correlated and broadly comparable in terms of their size and scale. The final constituents represent the tobacco, soft drinks, alcohol and fast moving consumer goods sectors. Back testing of the comparator group changes for past awards confirmed that these changes would not have impacted vesting under the TSR measure. Further details are provided on page 144.\n\n## Shareholder feedback\n\nThe majority of shareholders have expressed comfort with the proposed comparator group changes and the intent to ensure the TSR comparator group is well calibrated and relevant for the future.\n\nA small number of shareholders had requested that additional specific companies were considered for inclusion in the comparator group.\n\nMore broadly, the Committee is aware that relative TSR can attract strong and often conflicting opinions, with a small number of shareholders expressing a preference for the removal of the measure from the LTIP.\n\n## Committee response\n\nThe Committee is pleased that the comparator group changes have been met with support and has taken into consideration feedback as to the composition of the group. Consequently, Swedish Match, which was not part of the original proposal, will be included in the new TSR comparator group from 2022.\n\nThe Committee remains of the view that the relative TSR measure is an important component of the LTIP and helps to maintain alignment with shareholder interests, a view which is shared by the majority of our shareholders.",

        "page_content": "These changes to performance measures will apply to the IEIS from 2022 and to new awards made under the LTIP from 2022 for the Executive Directors and the Group's wider management population. Importantly they will ensure that the Group's transformation ambitions and core financial delivery are appropriately reflected in both the IEIS and LTIP.\n\n## Wider Themes from Shareholder Engagement\n\nESG measures: A small number of shareholders have enquired whether the Committee considered the introduction of broader ESG measures to either the IEIS or the LTIP. The Committee gave consideration to broader ESG measures as part of the policy review process. In view of our primary ESG commitment, to reduce the health impact of our business, and accordingly, the importance of sustainable New Categories growth, the Committee concluded that the proposed changes to IEIS and LTIP would focus on incentivising delivery of our corporate purpose and stated ambitions of delivering \u00a35 billion in revenues in New Categories by 2025, reaching profitability in New Categories over the same time period and the continued transformation of our portfolio. Discussions with shareholders have confirmed there is consensus that this is the right approach for the Group at this time, being both directly linked to Group strategy delivery and quantifiable. The Remuneration Committee will continue to monitor ESG measures and we will continue to drive performance across our comprehensive suite of objectives across all areas of ESG, which are discussed in the Strategic Report.\n\nReturns measures : A discrete group of shareholders have expressed a preference for a returns-type measure within the LTIP. While the Committee concurs that this is an important metric for the business to continue to track, it believes there are other important metrics to focus remuneration on at this time. We expect the Group's return on capital performance will over the near to medium term be driven by organic profit growth which is a key performance metric already represented in the IEIS and LTIP. Further, at this stage of our transformation journey the Committee believes the IEIS and LTIP should be focused on measures more closely linked to the Group's transformation agenda (such as New Categories revenue growth and category contribution) and key financial performance measures (such as adjusted profit from operations, EPS and cash). The Committee will continue to keep metric formulation and the orientation of our incentive plans under review as our transformation journey progresses.\n\nExecutive Director remuneration : A significant minority of shareholders have been unable to support recent decisions regarding fixed pay increases for the Executive Directors and have requested fuller disclosures as to the Committee's decision-making process in the future. During our engagement, shareholders have provided their feedback on decisions made in 2020 and 2021; while the rationale followed by the Remuneration Committee at the time has been understood, shareholders have explained their expectation of restraint with regard to fixed pay increases in future, with the majority wishing to see an employee average-led approach. The Remuneration Committee has considered the matters raised by shareholders in detail and the approach to be taken in 2022 is set out on page 132 .\n\nI would like to thank our shareholders, and wider stakeholders who have worked with us, for their feedback and help to maintain an ongoing and transparent dialogue regarding executive remuneration.\n\n## Group Performance\n\nThe performance measures included in our incentive plans are closely aligned with the Group's strategy and the metrics as set out in the Strategic Report.\n\nThe Group has delivered a strong performance in 2021, accelerating growth in New Categories, delivering on its leverage commitment and advancing the ESG agenda while managing the ongoing impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. The performance targets set by the Committee early in the year have remained unchanged throughout the 2021 performance period.\n\nTarget setting for 2021 assumed a rate of recovery from lockdown impacts in emerging markets and Global Travel Retail, while expecting ongoing disruption from further lockdowns elsewhere in the Group, together with prolonged travel restrictions and excise shocks. A key focus area of target setting was growth in the New Categories business, founded on geographic expansion, growth in the consumer base and achieving leadership of the Vapour category in the US. Target setting also assumed a continuing strong profit performance in developed markets driven by an increase in pricing. The impact of price increases and consequent flow through to revenue and profit growth was expected to be constrained by less favourable geographical mix due to the weighting of the post-pandemic volume recovery towards emerging markets. In order to meet profit objectives, ambitious cost savings were also embedded in the targets, anticipated to be delivered from product costs and the continued simplification of the organisation. The Group's continued emphasis on deleveraging was reflected in a stretch target which was calibrated in anticipation of further strong delivery in operating cash flow conversion as well as the Group delivering against its profit targets.\n\n## 2021 Short-term Incentive\n\nThe Group has delivered combustibles and THP volume share gains of 6 bps over performance in 2020 together with a robust performance with growth in New Categories revenue at constant rates of 50.9% and growth in adjusted profit from operations at constant rates of 5.2%. In addition, there has been continued progress with the deleveraging ambition (excluding foreign exchange) with a full year performance of -0.50x.\n\nThese results are reflected in the outcomes for the IEIS, for which the corporate result across the four measures (Group's share of key markets, New Categories revenue, adjusted profit from operations and deleveraging excluding foreign exchange) was 85.7%.\n\n## 2019 Long-term Incentive\n\nThe Group has delivered a compound annual growth rate in Group revenue of 5.3% at constant rates through the three year 2019 to 2021 period, a compound annual growth rate in adjusted, diluted EPS of 6.8% at constant rates and a corresponding operating cash flow conversion ratio of 101.0% at current rates over the same period.\n\nThese results are reflected in the outcomes for the 2019 LTIP award, for which the corporate result across relative total shareholder return (TSR), adjusted diluted EPS, adjusted revenue growth at constant rates and the operating cash flow conversion ratio, results in a vesting in March 2022 of 49.1%.\n\nThe vesting result reflects, through the relative TSR measure, movements in the Group's share price during the performance period. The Committee applied a downward adjustment at grant to the 2019 LTIP award, whereby the number of shares awarded were calculated on the basis of the Group's closing share price on 25 February 2019, increased by 15%. This adjustment was made in recognition of the decline in Group share price over the preceding 12 months. Given the share price is below that used to determine the grant, the Committee are comfortable that there has been no windfall gain.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Annual Statement on Remuneration Continued\n\nFollowing evaluation of the formulaic outcomes for both the 2021 IEIS and 2019 LTIP, the Committee considered the results against the underlying performance of the Group and the experience of our shareholders. The Committee concluded that the outcomes were a fair reflection of performance delivered in what continues to be challenging and volatile market conditions and no adjustments were required. In addition, share price fluctuations are reflected throughout the Executive Directors' remuneration, in the vesting and holding periods as well as their individual shareholdings. The performance against the key measures that delivered the IEIS and LTIP remuneration outcomes are summarised on pages 138 and 139.\n\n## Executive Director Remuneration\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has considered in detail the views of shareholders and wider stakeholders with respect to annual salary reviews and the management of executive pay. This topic was discussed at length with shareholders during our engagement on the Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe Committee has also given due consideration to the total remuneration positioning of the Executive Directors in relation to the wider market, their individual performance, and the level of pay increases for UK employees generally. Pay increases for UK employees are expected to range between 0% and 7.2%, based on performance in the prior year, with the average of employee increases falling within the 2.6% to 3.8% range.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has decided that the salaries of the Chief Executive and the Finance and Transformation Director will be maintained at their current levels, with no further increases to apply in April 2022.\n\n## Pay and Transparency\n\nThe Remuneration Committee recognises the importance of considering executive compensation in the broader context of the Group's workforce and the role that large organisations may play in encouraging greater transparency in this respect. Consequently, from 2022 the Group has broadened the scope of its pay equality reporting as follows.\n\n## Gender Pay: UK\n\nIn March 2022, we will be publishing data relating to UK Gender Pay in line with the statutory requirements. As a result of our continued focus we have seen an improvement in both our mean and median pay gaps by 3 percentage points when compared to 2020 and an improvement in the median bonus gap by 7 percentage points compared to 2020.\n\nThese improvements are attributable to increased time at level among senior female employees reflecting our commitment to continue to nurture and retain our female talent in more senior roles. The Group is committed to driving further progress in this area and has a comprehensive set of diversity initiatives in place which are explained further on pages 3 to 5 in our Diversity and Inclusion Report.\n\n## Gender Pay: International Business\n\nWe will also be publishing in March 2022 voluntary disclosures on gender pay for our international business. We felt it important to complement the statutory reporting for the UK with a broader view of the Group. Our international business gender pay data includes gender pay information from a cross-section of key markets, representing each of the Group's regions and functions. Further details are included on pages 7 to 10 in our Diversity and Inclusion Report.\n\n## Ethnicity Pay: UK\n\nDuring 2021 we completed a data gathering exercise with the help of UK employees. I am delighted to say that 77% of employees in the UK supported this effort and this has allowed the Group to complete a review of UK ethnicity pay data. Further details are included on page 11 in our Diversity and Inclusion Report.\n\nWe will continue to review our approach to ensure the Group provides as much transparency as is practicable in this important area.\n\n## Looking Ahead to 2022\n\nThe annual report on remuneration details remuneration in 2021 and the decisions made by the Remuneration Committee during this period. The new Remuneration Policy will be put forward for a binding vote at the 2022 AGM.\n\nThe Group has delivered a strong performance in 2021 and I believe that our proposed new Remuneration Policy supports Group strategy, drives pay for performance and meets the needs of our stakeholders in a considered way.\n\nI would once again like to thank our shareholders and wider stakeholders for the direct engagement and feedback during this past year on both our remuneration policy and practices. I look forward to continuing this dialogue in 2022.\n\n## Dimitri Panayotopoulos\n\nChairman, Remuneration Committee\n\n10 February 2022",

The LTIP vesting figure above for Jack Bowles reflects the first award made as an Executive Director. The LTIP vesting figure above for Tadeu Marroco reflects an award made prior to being appointed as an Executive Director.\n- 5. LTIP award shown for 2020: the values disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2020 were estimated values as the award had not vested by the date of that report; these amounts have been re-presented based on the actual market value on the date of vesting of 27 March 2021 of 2,578p.\n- 6. LTIP dividend equivalent payments: the dividend equivalent payment that will attach to the LTIP award that is included in the Single Figure Table is reported. The values for the year ended 31 December 2020 have been restated on this basis. The amount reported for Jack Bowles will be delivered in shares following the end of the two-year additional holding period.",

The underpin for adjusted revenue growth measure: the adjusted revenue growth measure can only vest provided the corresponding three-year CAGR of APFO exceeds the CAGR of the threshold performance level for APFO as approved annually in the STI and approved by the Board. The underpin was exceeded with reference to the APFO STI outcomes for 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n- 3. The Remuneration Committee did not consider that any discretion to adjust the formulaic outcome need be applied.",

His 'single figure' remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2019 has been time-apportioned to reflect the period he was Chief Executive.\n\n## Total shareholder return (TSR) performance: 1 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note:\n\n- 1. Performance and pay chart: this shows the performance of a hypothetical investment of \u00a3100 in ordinary shares (as measured by the TSR for the Company) against a broad equity market index (the FTSE 100 Index) over a period of 10 financial years starting from 1 January 2012 through to 31 December 2021 based on 30-trading-day average values. The FTSE 100 has been selected by the Committee as an appropriate comparator group due to BAT's position within the FTSE. A local currency basis is used for the purposes of the TSR calculation making it consistent with the approach to TSR measurement for the LTIP.",

This comparator group is considered to be the most appropriate group due to the limited number of employees employed under BAT p.l.c. contracts outside of the Director group. In addition, using a more widely-drawn group encompassing the worldwide nature of the Group's business would also present practical difficulties in collation and a less relevant comparator, given the significant variations in employee pay across the Group, the differing economic conditions and wide variations in gross domestic product per capita.\n\n1\n\n|                             | % change in salary/fees   | % change in salary/fees   | % change in taxable benefits   | % change in taxable benefits   | % change in STI   | % change in STI   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                             | 2020 to   2021            | 2019 to   2020            | 2020 to   2021                 | 2019 to   2020                 | 2020 to   2021    | 2019 to   2020    |\n| Executive Directors         |                           |                           |                                |                                |                   |                   |\n| Jack Bowles                 | 5%                        | 7%                        | (37%)                          | 84%                            | 26%               | (21%)             |\n| Tadeu Marroco 2             | 4%                        | 5%                        | (33%)                          | 22%                            | 25%               | (24%)             |\n| Chairman                    |                           |                           |                                |                                |                   |                   |\n| Richard Burrows 3           | 2%                        | 3%                        | 8%                             | (44%)                          | -                 | -                 |\n| Luc Jobin 4                 | 334%                      | 2%                        | 24%                            | (79%)                          | -                 | -                 |\n| Non-Executive Directors     |                           |                           |                                |                                |                   |                   |\n| Sue Farr                    | 1%                        | 2%                        | 0%                             | (100%)                         | -                 | -                 |\n| Dr Marion Helmes            | 1%                        | 2%                        | (72%)                          | (77%)                          | -                 | -                 |\n| Jerry Fowden 5              | 2%                        | 2%                        | (98%)                          | 14%                            | -                 | -                 |\n| Holly Koeppel               | 1%                        | 3%                        | (99%)                          | (82%)                          | -                 | -                 |\n| Savio Kwan                  | 1%                        | 2%                        | (97%)                          | (84%)                          | -                 | -                 |\n| Dimitri Panayotopoulos 6    | 9%                        | 21%                       | (78%)                          | (88%)                          | -                 | -                 |\n| Karen Guerra 7              | 0%                        | n/a                       | 0%                             | n/a                            | -                 | -                 |\n| Darrell Thomas 8            | n/a                       | n/a                       | n/a                            | n/a                            | -                 | -                 |\n| Average UK-based employee 9 | 6%                        | 3%                        | (1%)                           | 1%                             | 20%               | (5%)              |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1. Changes in taxable benefit values for 2019 to 2020 and for 2020 to 2021 for Non-Executive Directors were primarily a result of a reduction in travel and subsistence costs associated with business functions due to COVID-related travel restrictions throughout 2020 and 2021. Further details of the taxable benefits figures can be found in the table on page 144.\n- 2. Tadeu Marroco was appointed as an Executive Director from 5 August 2019. For the period 5 August 2019 to 31 December 2019, annualised figures have been used to calculate the year-onyear change.\n- 3. Richard Burrows departed the Company 28 April 2021. For the period 1 January to 28 April 2021, annualised figures have been used to calculate the year-on-year change.\n- 4. Luc Jobin was appointed Chairman from 28 April 2021. The change in fees from 2020 to 2021 is due to the increase in fees received following the appointment.\n- 5. Jerry Fowden was appointed to the Board on 1 September 2019 and departed the Company on 31 March 2021. For the periods 1 September to 31 December 2019 and 1 January to 31 March 2021, annualised figures have been used to calculate the year-on-year change.\n- 6. Dimitri Panayotopoulos started receiving the Senior Independent Director fee with effect from 1 May 2020.\n- 7. Karen Guerra was appointed to the Board on 14 September 2020. For the period 14 September 2020 to 31 December 2020, annualised figures have been used to calculate the year-onyear change.\n- 8. Darrell Thomas was appointed to the Board on 7 December 2020, receiving no fees or taxable benefits in 2020. Accordingly, no year-on-year change figures have been included.\n- 9.  The data for the UK-based employees comparator group are made up as follows as at 1 November 2021: (1) the weighted average base salaries; (2) the average taxable benefits per grade; and (3) the weighted average bonus result based on that population as at that date.",

Option A uses the total full-time equivalent remuneration for all UK employees for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and has been used to calculate the ratio as this is viewed to be the most robust and comprehensive means of assessment and is also reflective of shareholder preferences.\n- 2. Total pay and benefits are based on the workforce as at 1 November 2021 and include the annualised income for the earnings period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.\n- 3. Total pay and benefits for the Chief Executive are based on the single figure calculation on page 135.\n- 4. Total pay and benefits for the workforce is calculated as far as possible on the same basis as the Chief Executive single figure calculation. This includes salary, taxable benefits, short-term incentive, long-term incentive, dividends, pension benefits and any other remuneration receivable. For the purposes of this analysis, the following has been assumed:\n- - For all employees that are eligible for a car benefit, the applicable car allowance amounts have been used;\n- - For all employees that participate in the global International Executive Incentive Scheme or equivalent corporate incentive scheme, incentive pay-outs are calculated based on the same metrics; and\n- - For all employees that participate in the UK DC scheme, Company contributions of 15% of salary have been used.\n- 5. For the calculation of the total pay and benefits for employees, employees on international assignment into and out of the UK have been included; however, assignment benefits, such as housing support, education support, home leave allowance or relocation costs, have not been included as these are not consistent with the benefits included in the Chief Executive single figure calculation.\n- 6. For hourly paid employees who are not full time, total pay and benefits have been pro-rated based on full-time employee hours.\n\nThe figures above show that following the decrease from 2019 to 2020, there has been an increase in the Chief Executive pay ratio across all quartiles from 2020 to 2021.\n\nThe increase in pay ratio from 2020 to 2021 is due to the 2019 LTIP award being the first award made to Jack Bowles at Chief Executive award levels.\n\nFixed remuneration remained aligned with that of the wider UK-based workforce, with salary increasing in line with the wider workforce increase range, pension contribution percentage remaining aligned with the wider workforce at 15% and taxable benefits reducing significantly.\n\nThe CEO pay ratio is likely to continue to vary over time, with variances being attributable to the CEO variable pay opportunity which accounts for 80% to 90% of the total remuneration.\n\nThe Company believes the median pay ratio for 2021 reflects the diversity of our business footprint and employee population across the UK. The Group's remuneration policies and practices are founded on a high degree of alignment and consistency, with total remuneration at all levels providing competitive compensation that enables the attraction and retention of talent while also providing equitable differentiated remuneration based on grade, performance and experience.

Further details of the metric can be found on page 305.\n- 3. New Categories Contribution is the contribution to APFO from Vapour, THP and Modern Oral products. It is stated after deduction of directly attributable costs and allocated cross-category shared costs, before the deduction of administrative overheads and excluding the impact of adjusting items. The measure is assessed at constant rates of exchange.\n- 4.

The shareholding guidelines require Executive Directors to hold ordinary shares equal to the value of a percentage of salary as set out in the table below.\n\nValue of eligible\n\n|               | No. of eligible   ordinary shares   held at   31 Dec 2021   | ordinary shares   held at  31 Dec 2021 1 \u00a3m   | Actual   percentage (%)   of base salary at   31 Dec 2021   | Shareholding   requirements   (% of base salary   31 Dec 2021)   | Compliant  with shareholding   requirement   |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Jack Bowles   | 301,919                                                     | 8,255                                         | 623%                                                        | 500%                                                             | Yes                                          |\n| Tadeu Marroco | 106,653                                                     | 2,916                                         | 363%                                                        | 400%/two.sup                                                     | See note 2                                   |\n\nExecutive Directors are required to hold shares equivalent to 100% of current shareholding requirements for two full years following the date of their departure with a sale restriction mechanism in place for this period. More detail on Executive Director shareholding requirements can be found in the Directors Remuneration policy on page 157.\n\nBen Stevens was compliant with the post-employment shareholding requirement up to the end of the two year post employment shareholding period which ended on 4 August 2021.\n\nEligibility of shares: (a) unvested ordinary shares under the DSBS, which represent deferral of earned bonus, are eligible and count towards the requirement on a net-of-tax basis; (b) unvested ordinary shares under the LTIP are not eligible and do not count towards the requirement during the performance period, but the estimated notional net number of ordinary shares held during the LTIP Extended Vesting Period are eligible and will count towards the requirement; and (c) ordinary shares held in trust under the all-employee share ownership plan (SIP) are not eligible and do not count towards the shareholding requirement.\n\nNon-Executive Directors are not subject to any formal shareholding requirements although they are encouraged to build a small interest in ordinary shares during, the term of their appointment. As noted in the Directors' Remuneration policy on page 162, future fees for Non-Executive Directors may be paid in cash or a combination of cash and shares, with the proportion to be paid in shares in a year to be disclosed in the relevant Directors' Remunerations Report.\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1. Value of ordinary shares shown above: this is based on the closing mid-market share price on 31 December 2021 of 2,734p.\n- 2. Tadeu Marroco was appointed as an Executive Director on 5 August 2019, prior to which the shareholding requirement for Mr Marroco was set at a lower percentage of salary with Mr Marroco being compliant with required percentage. Under the Directors' Remuneration Policy, Executive Directors may generally sell a maximum of up to 50% of any shares vesting (after tax) under the Company's share plans until the threshold for shareholding requirements has been met and Mr Marroco is compliant with this policy requirement. In line with the Directors' Remuneration Policy, the shareholding requirement is equal to the value of the same multiple of salary at which LTIP awards are made to that Director, as such the shareholding requirement for Mr Marroco increased to 400% in 2020.\n- 3. Meeting the guidelines: if an Executive Director does not at any time, meet the requirements of the shareholding guidelines, the individual may, generally, only sell a maximum of up to 50% of any ordinary shares vesting (after tax) under the Company share plans until the threshold required under the shareholding guidelines has been met.\n- 4. Waiver of compliance with guidelines: this is permitted with the approval of the Remuneration Committee in circumstances where a restriction on a requested share sale could cause undue hardship. No such applications were received from the Executive Directors during 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Annual Statement on Remuneration\n\n## Continued\n\n## Policy Report\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis policy section of the Remuneration Report (the Policy Report) sets out a proposed new Remuneration Policy for the Executive Directors and the Non-Executive Directors.\n\nThis new Remuneration Policy, which is intended to replace the current remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM, is subject to a binding vote by shareholders at the AGM on 28 April 2022 and, if approved, will come into effect from 29 April 2022. The new Remuneration Policy is set out in full on the following pages with changes from the current remuneration policy identified for reference.\n\n## Principles of remuneration\n\nThe Committee's remuneration principles are to:\n\n- - reward, as an overriding objective, the delivery of the Group's long-term strategy in a manner which is simple, straightforward and understandable and which is aligned with shareholders' interests;\n- - structure a remuneration package that is appropriately positioned relative to the market and comprises core fixed elements and performance-based variable elements;\n- - design the fixed elements of pay (comprising base salary, pension and other benefits) to recognise the skills and experience of our Executive Directors and to ensure current and future market competitiveness in attracting talent;\n- - design the variable elements of pay (provided via two performance-based incentive schemes: a short-term incentive scheme delivered through a combination of a cash element and a deferral element, and a long-term incentive scheme), to be both transparent and stretching and to support, motivate and reward the successful delivery of the Group's long-term strategy and growth for shareholders on a sustainable basis;\n- - ensure that reputational, behavioural and other risks that can arise from target-based incentive plans are identified and mitigated;\n- - maintain an appropriate balance between fixed pay and the opportunity to earn performance-related remuneration with immediate and deferred elements, such that the majority of the Executive Directors' total remuneration package is delivered in BAT shares;\n- - ensure that the performance-based elements form, at maximum opportunity, between 80% and 90% of the Executive Directors' total remuneration packages;\n- - ensure, through its annual review, that the Remuneration Policy is both rigorously applied and remains aligned with the Company's purpose, values and strategy and the need to promote the long-term success of the Company; and\n\n- ensure that remuneration arrangements are transparent and promote effective engagement with shareholders and the workforce. Our remuneration principles and the key elements of the Directors' Remuneration Policy align with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 requirements, as follows:\n\n## Clarity and simplicity\n\nOur policy provides an overall remuneration package that is transparent for our Executive Directors and shareholders alike; its simple structure has a clear and straightforward link to the delivery of the Group's long-term strategy. Principles driving fixed remuneration (salary, benefits, pension) are closely aligned with the wider workforce and variable remuneration (STI and LTI) rewards delivery of financial and strategic objectives both in the short and long-term.\n\n## Risk\n\nThe combination of performance target setting for the STI and LTI, the inclusion of provisions for discretionary adjustments and malus and clawback provisions ensure that we remunerate our Executive Directors in accordance with high standards of governance while mitigating, as far as possible, reputational and other risks arising from remuneration that are not proportionate to outcomes.\n\n## Predictability and proportionality\n\nThere is a clear link between the operation of our short and long-term incentive plan awards and the delivery of our strategy and long-term performance. Variable remuneration at the Company accounts for between 80%-90% of an Executive Directors' total remuneration, ensuring that poor performance is not rewarded. Further detail on short and long-term incentive plan awards are detailed on pages 155 and 156.\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has worked extensively to develop a policy that closely aligns the Executive Directors to the wider workforce and rewards long-term sustainable performance. The Remuneration Committee continually reviews the Policy, taking into account any feedback received from engagement with the wider workforce and shareholders, to ensure it is aligned to the Company's purpose and values, and promotes the long-term success of the Company.\n\n## Summary of key changes\n\nThe background and explanation of the proposed key changes from the current remuneration policy are given in the Annual Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee starting on page 128 of this Remuneration Report. Those key changes have been further explained in relevant sections of the Policy Report as summarised below:\n\nPolicy Element\n\nChange in Policy\n\nPage Number\n\n| Short-Term Incentive (STI),  performance measures       | Underlying policy is unchanged, however alternative measures and weightings have been  selected for awards to be made in 2022.   |   155 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Long-Term Incentive  Plan (LTIP),  performance measures | Underlying policy is unchanged, however alternative measures and weightings have been  selected for awards to be made in 2022.   |   156 |\n| Malus and clawback                                      | Updated and expanded to reflect market best practice                                                                             |   157 |",

The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payments where the terms were agreed prior to an individual being appointed an Executive Director of the Company or prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy (including, for the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the current Remuneration Policy). This includes the achievement of the applicable performance conditions for Executive Directors who are eligible to receive payment from any award made prior to the approval and implementation of the Remuneration Policy.\n- 2. The Company recognises the opportunities and benefits that accrue to the Company and its Executive Directors who undertake non-executive roles. Consequently, an Executive Director may, with the permission of the Board, undertake a single external appointment and the Executive Director may retain the fees from such appointment.\n- 3. Malus and clawback : Bonus amounts paid under the IEIS are subject to clawback provisions, and awards made under the DSBS and the LTIP are subject to malus and clawback provisions.\n- Malus and clawback provisions apply to DSBS awards and the cash portion of the IEIS respectively for the duration of three years from the date of the award and to LTIP awards for the duration of five years from the date of award if: (1) there has been a material misrepresentation in relation to the performance of any Group company, relevant business unit and/or the participant; (2) an erroneous calculation was made in assessing the extent to which an award vested or bonus was paid, which in either case resulted in the value of the award or payment being more than it should have been; or (3) there is an insolvency event or corporate failure.\n- Malus and Clawback provisions apply to DSBS and LTIP awards at any time before or after the vesting of a share award or at any time after the payment of IEIS cash element where it is determined that the participant: (1) committed misconduct; (2) caused a material loss for any Group company as a result of (a) reckless, negligent or wilful actions or (b) inappropriate behaviour or behaviour that is not aligned with corporate values; (3) contributed to serious reputational damage of any Group company or one of its business units, in each case prior to the vesting of the relevant award or payment of the bonus.\n- Where the Committee determines that these provisions are to be applied, the participant may be required to repay up to the excess value which was paid or vested. This repayment may also be effected by the number of shares subject to the award being reduced and/or by a reduction in other cash or share-based awards held by the participant.\n- 4. The operation of the remuneration policy for employees below Board level is discussed on pages 163 and 164.",

        "page_content": "## Principles of Remuneration for Our Wider Workforce\n\nThe Group's remuneration policies and practices are founded on a high degree of alignment and consistency across the organisation. Accordingly, remuneration for senior management is determined considering the remuneration principles that apply to the Executive Directors, and similar principles also form the basis of the remuneration arrangements for the wider workforce.\n\nThe reward strategy for all employees is built around the following four strategic pillars and comprises fixed and variable remuneration elements:\n\n## Competitive yet sustainable\n\n## Equitably differentiated\n\n- - Competitive remuneration, able to attract and retain talent.\n- - Agility to meet changing generational needs.\n- - Responsible cost structure to support profit delivery.\n\n## Transparent\n\n## Aligned to shareholder interests\n\n- - Clear and inclusive policies, openly communicated.\n- - Individual total reward package statements form part of regular annual cycle.\n- - Competitive employment cost base and incentives that align the interests of employees with those of shareholders.\n\nA globally consistent pay comparator group, derived from the peer group used by the Remuneration Committee for executive pay benchmarking, is utilised across all levels of the organisation for pay benchmarking purposes, with an appropriate level of flexibility provided to the other employing entities.\n\nThe approach to annual salary reviews is consistent across the Group, with consideration given to the scope of the role, level of individual experience, responsibility, individual performance and pay levels in the selected peer group.\n\nAll middle-to-senior managers are eligible to participate in a short-term incentive plan with the same metrics as Executive Directors. Other employees in corporate functions are eligible to participate in annual bonus plans, which mirror the Executive Directors' performance objectives. Functional incentive schemes are offered to the Group's employees in non-corporate positions such as sales force or manufacturing roles. Opportunities and metrics which apply to those schemes may vary by organisational level with functional performance indicators incorporated where appropriate.\n\nSenior managers are eligible to participate in the long-term incentive schemes, namely the Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Restricted Share Plan (RSP), with opportunities varying across levels with the most senior managers having a bigger portion of their pay delivered under the long-term incentive schemes. Metrics under the PSP are the same as those for Executive Directors.\n\nIn the UK, all employees are encouraged to become shareholders by participating in all-employee share plans on the same terms as Executive Directors. Similar all-employee share schemes have been adopted for other jurisdictions with the goal of encouraging broader long-term employee ownership.\n\nRetirement benefits, typically in the form of a pension, are provided based on local market practice. Pension contribution rates for Executive Directors under the defined contribution scheme are aligned with those available to the wider UK employee population. Other benefits provided to the wider employee population reflect local market practice and legislative requirements.\n\nThe key difference between Executive Directors' remuneration and the wider employee population is the increased emphasis on longterm performance in respect of Executive Directors, with a greater percentage of their total remuneration being performance-related and delivered in BAT shares. This includes an additional two-year holding period on vested LTIPs, and post-employment shareholding requirements which do not apply to other employees other than members of the Management Board.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\n## Salary\n\n- - Salary is a key element of total remuneration for all employees.\n- - Salary ranges for each grade are set by reference to external market data, and individual positioning within the set salary ranges will depend on level of experience, responsibility and individual performance.\n- - Annual salary reviews typically take place in April each year.\n\nIn several markets Collective Labour Agreements (CLAs) exist covering some employees, therefore, some of the above principles may not apply.\n\n## Benefits and recognition\n\n- - Benefits provided to employees reflect local market practice and legislative requirements.\n- - The benefits architecture for the Group includes core benefits (such as medical insurance and life insurance) and local statutory benefits and may be delivered as a combination of benefits in kind, cash allowance and flexible benefits.\n- - Additional financial and non-financial rewards can be made for outstanding contributions to the business in exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Pension\n\n- - Retirement benefits are provided to employees based on local market practice.\n- - Under the UK Defined Contribution arrangements, the Company contributions for all UK employees is 10% of base salary rising to a maximum of 15% on a matching basis. For managers in senior management roles, the total contribution to the British American Tobacco UK Pension Plan ('Plan') is automatically restricted to \u00a34,000 per annum in line with the UK Government's Tapered Annual Allowance. The balance of any Company contributions due above this \u00a34,000 limit is paid as a cash allowance or, alternatively, paid into the Defined Contribution Unapproved Unfunded Retirement Benefits Scheme (DC UURBS). The DC UURBS closed to new entrants on 31 March 2021. Employees can choose to opt out of the restriction and have all the Company contribution paid into the Plan.\n\n- - Differentiated on clear and objective criteria - level, performance and experience.\n- - Supported by unbiased processes and tools.",

The Group operates various short-term incentive arrangements, as set out below, with participation dependent on role.\n\nInternational Executive Incentive Scheme (IEIS) - globally aligned scheme for all managers in senior management roles (c. 1,700 employees), including the Executive Directors.\n\n- - Incentive opportunities for the IEIS participants are defined globally for each eligible grade.\n- - A portion of any award receivable is deferred in BAT shares for three years, with the remaining portion paid in cash during the following year.\n- - Dividend-equivalent payments on all unvested deferred shares are paid quarterly in cash via payroll.\n\nCorporate annual bonus plans - in operation for employees in corporate functions who are not eligible to participate in the IEIS (c. 15,000 employees).\n\n- - Designed to mirror the basic construct of the IEIS with opportunity levels set locally.\n- - Performance metrics aligned to those of the IEIS.\n\nFunctional incentive schemes - in operation for employees in non-corporate functions, examples include trade marketing or factory incentive schemes.\n\n- - Opportunity levels are set locally and vary by grade.\n- - Functional performance measures are incorporated into each scheme to ensure line of sight for participants.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\nLong-term incentive schemes are designed to reward and retain our senior talent while aligning the interests of leaders with those of our shareholders. From 2020, we have moved from a single LTI plan to a segmented approach by grade as set out below.\n\nRestricted Share Plan (RSP) - globally aligned discretionary plan for managers at eligible grades in senior management roles (c. 540 employees), excluding the Executive Directors. Aligns scheme participants with the success of the Group through its share price.\n\n- - Opportunity levels are defined globally for each eligible grade.\n- - No performance conditions apply to awards.\n- - Awards are typically granted in March of each year, and vest in full following the end of the three-year vesting period provided the participant remains an employee of the Group on the vesting date.\n- - Dividend-equivalent payments are paid on shares vesting.\n\nPerformance Share Plan (PSP) - discretionary plan for our most senior managers (c. 160 employees), including the Executive Directors, which rewards their contribution to the long-term global performance of the Company.\n\n- - Consistent performance measures across all plan participants with opportunity levels defined globally for each eligible grade.\n- - Awards vest only to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period.\n- - Awards are typically granted in March of each year, and vest following the end of a three-year performance period.\n- - Dividend-equivalent payments are paid on any shares vesting.\n\n## All-employee share schemes\n\n- - In the UK, all employees are eligible to participate in the Company's all-employee share schemes (c. 2,500 employees) - the Partnership Share Scheme, the Sharesave Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan - all of which are HMRC-approved plans, which are designed to incentivise employees by giving them an opportunity to build shareholdings in the Company.",

These include town halls, works councils, webcasts, global independently managed Speak Up channels, our biennial 'Your Voice' global employee survey, and direct engagement through Directors' market and site visits where possible.\n\nFeedback from these channels is collected across the Group and are independently analysed to define the priority themes. The consolidated feedback and themes are reviewed by our Board each year, as part of our Workforce Voice in the Boardroom programme. This focuses on ensuring the Board understands the views of our workforce, and reviews details of the key themes identified and how we have responded.\n\nThe views of our workforce are a key consideration for the Remuneration Committee when reviewing the reward priorities of the organisation. In 2021 we conducted our latest 'Your Voice' global employee survey, with the results of this survey also serving as a factor in shaping the reward agenda of the organisation. Although employees are not specifically consulted on the policy for Directors' remuneration, there continues to be an ongoing dialogue with employees, through a variety of channels, about the Company's broader pay practices.\n\nIn addition to the Workforce Voice in the Boardroom programme, the Remuneration Committee also receives updates from management on feedback received during the year where relevant to remuneration matters considered by the Remuneration Committee and takes feedback into account as applicable in determining executive remuneration.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is regularly updated on the pay principles and practices in operation across the Group and considers them in relation to the implementation of the Directors' Remuneration Policy, and in ensuring there is an appropriate degree of alignment throughout the Group.",

Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework . In preparing these Group financial statements, the Directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS as issued by the IASB).\n\nUnder company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Parent Company and of the Group's profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- - make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent;\n- - for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- - for the Parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent Company financial statements;\n- - assess the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- - use the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Annual Report included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Directors' Declaration in Relation to Relevant Audit Information @\n\nHaving made appropriate enquiries, each of the Directors who held office at the date of approval of this Annual Report confirms that:\n\n- - to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company's auditors are unaware; and\n- - he or she has taken all steps that a Director might reasonably be expected to have taken in order to make himself or herself aware of relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\n## Responsibility Statement of the Directors in Respect of the Annual Financial Report @\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- - the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- - the Strategic Report and the Directors' Report include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nThis responsibility statement has been approved and is signed by order of the Board by:\n\n## Luc Jobin\n\nTadeu Marroco\n\nChairman\n\nFinance and Transformation Director\n\n10 February 2022\n\nBritish American Tobacco p.l.c.

('the Company') for the year ended 31 December 2021 which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Group and parent Company Statement of Changes in Equity, the Group and parent Company Balance Sheets, the Group Cash Flow Statement, and the related notes, including the accounting policies in note 1.\n\n## In our opinion:\n\n- - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the parent Company's affairs as at 31 December 2021 and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n- - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- - the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and\n- - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Additional opinion in relation to IFRS as issued by the IASB\n\nAs explained in the note to the Group financial statements, the Group, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply UKadopted international accounting standards, has also applied International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nIn our opinion, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the directors on 23 March 2015. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 7 financial years ended 31 December 2021. We have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.\n\n## 2 Key Audit Matters: Our Assessment of Risks of Material Misstatement\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2020), in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives impairment analysis - arising from the Reynolds American Inc. acquisition in 2017.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to page 122 (Audit Committee report), page 186 (accounting policy) and pages 206 to 210 (financial disclosures). Risk vs 2020:\n\n## The risk:\n\nForecast-based assessment: As a result of the 2017 acquisition of Reynolds American Inc. ('Reynolds American'), the Group, as at 31 December 2021 has goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives of \u00a333,021 million and \u00a369,475 million, respectively (2020: goodwill of \u00a332,719 million and trademarks with indefinite lives of \u00a368,839 million). There is inherent uncertainty with regard to assumptions and estimates involved in the Group's forecast-based assessment of the recoverability of the trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill. There is significant auditor judgement involved in evaluating: (i) the budgeted revenue and discount rates used in the analysis of the recoverability of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill allocated to the Reynolds American cash-generating unit; and (ii) the impact of the proposed menthol ban on the terminal value and the discount rate for the Camel and Newport indefinite life trademarks and goodwill allocated to the Reynolds American cash-generating unit.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment for audit planning purposes, we determined that the value-in-use calculations of both trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill had a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. In conducting our final audit work, we concluded that reasonably possible changes to the value-in-use of both trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill would not be expected to result in material impairment. The financial statements (note 12) disclose the sensitivity of the carrying amounts of relevant trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill estimated by the Group.",

In addition, and specifically for the Newport and Camel indefinite lived trademarks and the goodwill allocated to the Reynolds American cash-generating unit, using relevant elements of this information to assess and challenge the terminal value used in Reynolds American's value-in-use based assessment of the recoverability of those assets;\n\nHistorical comparisons: Challenging the reasonableness of the assumptions, particularly budgeted revenue, by comparing the historical projections to actual results to assess the Group's ability to accurately forecast;\n\nAssessment of the discount rate: We independently developed a range of discount rates with the assistance of our own valuations specialist and compared these rates to those utilised by Reynolds American to assess their reasonableness;\n\nSensitivity analysis: Performing sensitivity analysis on the budgeted revenue to assess its impact on the Group's determination that the fair values of the Reynolds American goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives exceed their carrying value; and\n\nAssessing transparency: Assessing whether the Group's disclosures detail the key estimates, judgements, and sensitivities with regard to the impairment testing of trademarks with indefinite lives and the goodwill arising from the Reynolds American acquisition.\n\n## Our results:\n\nWe found the conclusion that there is no impairment of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill arising from the Reynolds American acquisition to be acceptable (2020: acceptable).\n\n## Contingent liabilities arising from litigation in Canada\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRefer to page 122 (Audit Committee report), page 189 (accounting policy) and pages 261 to 263 and 264 to 266 (financial disclosures). Risk vs 2020:\n\n## The risk:\n\nDispute outcome: The Group is subject to a large number of claims including class actions, which could have a significant impact on the results if potential exposures were to materialise. For our 2021 audit, in our judgement, the most significant risk continues to relate to ongoing litigation in Canada. Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited ('Imperial') has received an unfavourable judgement on the smoking and health class actions certified by the Quebec Superior Court. As a result of this judgement, Imperial has filed for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the 'CCAA'). In seeking protection under the CCAA, Imperial will look to resolve not only the Quebec case but also all other tobacco litigation in Canada under an efficient and court supervised process, while continuing to trade in the normal course of business.\n\nThe amounts involved are significant, and the Group's application of accounting standards to determine the amount, if any, to be provided as a liability or disclosed as a contingent liability, is inherently subjective. Significant judgement was involved in auditing this determination, including evaluating the Group's assessment of the relevant law, historical and pending court rulings, and the Group's ability to estimate the likelihood and extent of any future economic outflow arising from the ultimate resolution of the Canadian litigation.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the potential exposure to litigation requires a high degree of judgement, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\n\n## Our response:\n\nControl design and operation: Evaluating the processes and controls within the legal exposure process, including controls over the interpretation of relevant law and related court rulings and estimation of the likelihood and extent of any future economic outflow arising from the ultimate resolution of the Canadian litigation;\n\nEnquiry of lawyers: Reading letters received directly from the Group's external and internal legal counsel that evaluated the current status of the Canadian legal proceedings. We also inquired of internal legal counsel to evaluate their basis for conclusions in their letter, including challenging that it is not possible to reliably estimate any potential liability based on the current status of the proceedings;\n\nAssess local legal precedence: Assessing relevant historical and recent judgements passed by the judicial court authorities in relation to the Canadian litigation and reading the related Canadian court rulings in order to challenge Imperial's interpretation of the Canadian legal proceedings and the related contingent liability disclosures; and\n\nAssessing transparency: Assessing whether the Group's disclosures in relation to the Canadian litigation adequately disclose the potential liabilities.",

Risk vs 2020:\n\n## The risk:\n\nLow risk, high value: The carrying amount of the parent Company's investments in subsidiaries is \u00a327,809 million (2020: \u00a327,995 million) which represents 71% (2020: 77%) of the Company's total assets. Their recoverability is not a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement.\n\nHowever, due to the materiality of investments in subsidiaries in the context of the parent Company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall parent Company audit.\n\n## Our response:\n\nTests of detail: Comparing the carrying amount of parent Company's direct investments, representing 100% (2020: 100%) of the total investment balance with the relevant subsidiary's draft balance sheet to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the parent Company's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our results:\n\nWe found the conclusion that there is no impairment of the investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable (2020: acceptable).\n\n## 3 Our Application of Materiality and an Overview of the Scope of Our Audit\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a3425 million (2020: \u00a3420 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before taxation. This represents 4.6% (2020: 4.7%) of the Group's reported profit before taxation. Materiality for the parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a355 million (2020: \u00a350 million) which is the component materiality for the parent Company determined by the group audit engagement team. This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to Company net assets and represents 0.15% of the Company's net assets (2020: 0.15%).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality for the Group was set at 75% (2020: 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a3318 million (2020: \u00a3315 million). We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\nPerformance materiality for the parent Company was set at 75% (2020: 75%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a341.2 million (2020: \u00a337.5 million). We applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality because we did not identify any factors indicating an elevated level of risk.\n\nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u00a321 million (2020: \u00a320 million) in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\n5%",

        "page_content": "## Financial Statements\n\n## Independent Auditor's Report @\n\n## Continued\n\n## Scope of our audit\n\nThe Group operates three shared service centres (2020: three) in Romania, Malaysia and Costa Rica, the outputs of which are included in the financial information of the reporting components they service and therefore they are not separate reporting components. Each of the service centres is subject to specified risk-focused audit procedures, predominantly the testing of transaction processing and review controls. Additional procedures are performed at certain reporting components to address the audit risks not covered by the work performed over the shared service centres.\n\nWe performed full scope audits for Group reporting purposes of 23 components (2020: 23 components). Audits of these components were performed using materiality levels assigned by the group audit team, which were lower than the materiality level for the Group as a whole, ranging from \u00a355 million to \u00a3220 million (2020: \u00a350 million to \u00a3200 million), and determined by reference to the size and risk profile of the components.\n\nAudits of one or more account balances were performed in respect of a further 10 components (2020: 13), using a materiality ranging from \u00a345 million to \u00a390 million (2020: \u00a340 to \u00a370 million) assigned by the Group audit team. Specified audit procedures have been performed at 2 components (2020: 2) using a materiality of \u00a345 million (2020: \u00a340 million). These 12 components for which we performed work other than full scope audits for group reporting purposes were not individually significant but were included in the scope of our Group reporting work in order to provide further coverage over the Group's results. This is consistent with the approach that was adopted in 2020.\n\nThe work on 30 of the 35 components (2020: 33 of the 38 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent Company, was performed by the Group team.\n\nThe percentages of the Group's revenue, the total profits and losses that make up the Group's profit before taxation and the Group's total assets represented by the components within the scope of our work and procedures performed at corporate level are as follows:\n\nGroup revenue\n\n## 83% (84% 2020)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Full scope for Group audit purposes 2021\n\nAudit of one or more account balances 2021\n\nSpecified risk-focused audit procedures 2021\n\nFull scope for Group audit purposes 2020\n\n- Audit of one or more account balances 2020\n- Specified risk-focused audit procedures 2020\n- Residual components\n\nThe remaining 17% (2020: 16%) of total group revenue, 21% (2020: 22%) of group profit before taxation and 4% (2020: 5%) of total group assets is represented by 274 (2020: 295) reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 2% (2020: 2%) of any of total Group revenue, Group profit before taxation or total Group assets. For the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.\n\nThe Group team instructed component auditors, and the auditors of the shared service centres, as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back.\n\nGroup profit before tax\n\n(78% 2020)\n\nGroup total assets\n\n96% (95% 2020)\n\n79%",

        "page_content": "We were able to rely upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting in several areas of our audit, where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work; in the other areas the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive.\n\nDue to the travel restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19, the Group team limited physical site visits to one component location in the United States for the purpose of business understanding, risk assessment and oversight procedures through discussions with the component team. This was performed as a virtual site visit in 2020.\n\nConsistent with 2020, the Group team performed virtual site visits at the shared service centres in Costa Rica, Malaysia, and Romania for the purpose of business understanding, risk assessment and performing detailed file reviews.\n\nIn addition, the Group team held an audit risk planning and strategy virtual global conference which in-scope component auditors attended. Further to these visits and conference, the Group team also held regular telephone and/or online meetings as part of the audit planning phase to explain our audit instructions and discuss the component auditors' audit plans as well as performing detailed remote file reviews upon the completion of the component auditors' engagements. The findings reported to the Group audit team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group team that was then performed by the component auditor.\n\n## 4 The Impact of Climate Change on Our Audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of risks arising from climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has set its targets under the Paris Agreement to be net carbon neutral in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2030, and net carbon neutral in scope 3 emissions by 2050. Further information has been provided in the Group's Strategic Report on page 47. This year has also seen the Group align their climate related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure ('TCFD') for the first time. These disclosures are included on pages 58 to 67 of the Annual Report.\n\nClimate change risk could have a significant impact on the Group's business as it adapts its strategy and operations to address the potential financial risks which could arise from both the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. To evaluate and assess the resilience of their business to climate change, the Group conducted a risk assessment exercise focusing on the impact of climate change on their agricultural supply chain. Further information can be found on page 63 and 64.\n\nAs part of our audit, we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group's financial statements. We have performed a risk assessment of how climate risks facing the Group, particularly the agricultural supply chain, and the Group's strategy to mitigate these risks may affect the financial statements and our audit. Our risk assessment focused on the risk climate change may pose to the determination of future cash flows. We also held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessment, we determined that while climate change poses a risk to future access to tobacco and nicotine and therefore to the forecast future cash flows, the risk to this year's financial statements is not significant taking into account the extent of headroom on the Reynolds American cash-generating unit and indefinite-life intangibles. As such, there was no impact on our key audit matters.\n\nWe have read the climate related information in the front half of the Annual Report, which included the Group's adoption of climate related disclosures as recommended by the TCFD and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 5 Going Concern\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- - The enactment of regulation that significantly impairs the Group's ability to communicate, differentiate, market or launch its products; and\n- - Product liability, regulatory or other significant cases may be lost or compromised resulting in a material loss or other consequence.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as the impact COVID-19 and the erosion of customer or supplier confidence, which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Statements\n\n## Independent Auditor's Report\n\n## Continued\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.\n\nOur conclusions based on this work:\n\n- - we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- - we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- - we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in note 1 to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable; and\n- - the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 83 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Company will continue in operation.\n\n## 6 Fraud and Breaches of Laws and Regulations - Ability to Detect\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- - Enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, and internal audit whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud, and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing'.\n- - Reading Board, Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nominations Committee, Transactions Committee, Corporate Committee and Committees of the Board's minutes.\n- - Considering the International Executive Incentive Scheme and performance targets for senior management.\n- - Using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.\n- - Our forensic specialists assisted us in identifying fraud risk factors. This included attending the Risk Assessment and Planning Discussion and participating in meetings with management to discuss matters relating to ongoing criminal investigations and allegations of misconduct. With regards to anti-bribery and corruption, they assisted us in developing our audit approach to address fraud risk factors and reviewed reporting deliverables submitted by component audit teams that were scoped in for additional antibribery and corruption audit procedures.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates. On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition as the revenue model is non-complex with no material estimation or manual intervention, revenue is disaggregated between a significant number of End Markets and remuneration targets are based on Group performance rather than End Market performance.\n\nWe did not identify any additional fraud risks.",

        "page_content": "In determining the audit procedures, we took into account the results of our evaluation and testing of the operating effectiveness of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.\n\nWe also performed procedures including:\n\n- - Identifying journal entries to test from a Group perspective based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted to revenue accounts, those approved by an individual not authorised to approve postings, those posted to accounts that contain significant estimates and period-end adjustments and those posted to accounts which could drive certain key metrics such as the bonus calculation.\n- - Identifying journal entries to test for all components based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management or directors, journal entry posted by a user who only posted one entry for the fiscal year and those posted with an unusual combination.\n- - Assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at the Group level.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: health and safety, anti-bribery and corruption, money-laundering, sanctions, environmental protection legislation, food and drug administration, data privacy, competition and contract legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the Group's activities. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\nFor the criminal investigations into allegations of misconduct by the governmental authorities' matters discussed in note 31 we performed inquiries, obtained legal confirmations, and assessed disclosures against our understanding from legal correspondence.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- - we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report;\n- - in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- - in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' remuneration report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- - the directors' confirmation within the viability statement on page 92 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- - the group principal risks disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- - the directors' explanation in the viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the viability statement, set out on page 92 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge:\n\n- - the directors' statement that they consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- - the section of the Annual Report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the Audit Committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and\n- - the section of the Annual Report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nWe are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. We have nothing to report in these respects.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## 10 The Purpose of Our Audit Work and to Whom We Owe Our Responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and the terms of our engagement by the Company. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and the further matters we are required to state to them in accordance with the terms agreed with the Company, and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Philip Smart (Senior Statutory Auditor)\n\nfor and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor Chartered Accountants\n\n15 Canada Square London E14 5GL\n\n10 February 2022",

UK-adopted international accounting standards differ in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except as described in the accounting policy below on financial instruments. In performing its going concern assessment, management considered forecasts and liquidity requirements within the going concern period. This includes the impact of COVID-19, as well as the payments arising from the Master Settlement Agreement due in the U.S. in 2022 and other known liabilities or future payments (including interim dividends), as they fall due.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The key estimates and assumptions are set out in the accounting policies below, together with the related notes to the accounts.\n\nThe critical accounting judgements include:\n\n- - the identification and quantification of adjusting items, which are separately disclosed as memorandum information, is explained below and the impact of these on the calculation of adjusted earnings per share is described in note 11;\n- - the determination as to whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims, as well as other contingent liabilities. The accounting policy on contingent liabilities, which are not provided for, is set out below and the contingent liabilities of the Group are explained in note 31. Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a pending claim is probable (more likely than not to succeed), possible or remote;\n- - the determination as to whether control (subsidiaries), joint control (joint arrangements), or significant influence (associates) exists in relation to the investments held by the Group. This is assessed after taking into account the Group's ability to appoint Directors to the entity's Board, its relative shareholding compared with other shareholders, any significant contracts or arrangements with the entity or its other shareholders and other relevant facts and circumstances. The application of these policies to Group subsidiaries in territories including Canada is explained in note 32;\n- - the review of applicable exchange rates for transactions with and translation of entities in territories where there are restrictions on the free access to foreign currency, or multiple exchange rates; and\n- - the determination as to whether perpetual hybrid bonds should be classified as equity instead of borrowings (note 22(d)).\n\nThe critical accounting estimates include:\n\n- - the review of asset values, especially indefinite life assets such as goodwill and certain trademarks and similar intangibles. The key assumptions used in respect of the impairment testing are the determination of cash-generating units, the budgeted and forecast cash flows of these units, the long-term growth rate for cash flow projections and the rate used to discount the cash flow projections. These are described in note 12;\n- - the estimation of and accounting for retirement benefit costs. The determination of the carrying value of assets and liabilities, as well as the charge for the year, and amounts recognised in other comprehensive income, involves judgements made in conjunction with independent actuaries. These involve estimates about uncertain future events based on the environment in different countries, including life expectancy of scheme members, salary and pension increases, inflation, as well as discount rates and asset values at the year-end. The assumptions used by the Group and sensitivity analysis are described in note 15; and\n- - the estimation of amounts to be recognised in respect of taxation and legal matters, and the estimation of other provisions for liabilities and charges are subject to uncertain future events, may extend over several years and so the amount and/or timing may differ from current assumptions. The accounting policy for taxation is explained below. The recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities, together with a note of unrecognised amounts, are shown in note 16, and a contingent tax asset is explained in note 10(b). Other provisions for liabilities and charges are as set out in note 24. Litigation related deposits are shown in note 17. The application of these accounting policies to the payments made and credits recognised under the Master Settlement Agreement by Reynolds American Inc. (Reynolds American) is described in note 6(b).\n\nSuch estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances and constitute management's best judgement at the date of the financial statements. In the future, actual experience may deviate from these estimates and assumptions, which could affect the financial statements as the original estimates and assumptions are modified, as appropriate, in the year in which the circumstances change.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 10 February 2022.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial information includes the financial statements of British American Tobacco p.l.c. and its subsidiary undertakings, collectively 'the Group', together with the Group's share of the results of its associates and joint arrangements.\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Non-controlling interests represent the share of earnings or equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to shareholders of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 1 Accounting Policies Continued\n\nAssociates comprise investments in undertakings, which are not subsidiary undertakings or joint arrangements, where the Group's interest in the equity capital is long-term and over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercises a significant influence. They are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nJoint arrangements comprise contractual arrangements where two or more parties have joint control and where decisions regarding the relevant activities of the entity require unanimous consent.\n\nJoint operations are jointly-controlled arrangements where the parties to the arrangement have rights to the underlying assets and obligations for the underlying liabilities relating to the arrangement. The Group accounts for its share of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of any such arrangement.\n\nJoint ventures comprise arrangements where the parties to the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. They are accounted for using the equity method.\n\n## Foreign currencies and hyperinflationary territories\n\nThe functional currency of the Parent Company is sterling and this is also the presentation currency of the Group. The income and cash flow statements of Group undertakings expressed in currencies other than sterling are translated to sterling using exchange rates applicable to the dates of the underlying transactions. Average rates of exchange in each year are used where the average rate approximates the relevant exchange rate at the date of the underlying transactions. Assets and liabilities of Group undertakings are translated at the applicable rates of exchange at the end of each year. In territories where there are restrictions on the free access to foreign currency or multiple exchange rates, the applicable rates of exchange are regularly reviewed.\n\nThe differences between retained profits translated at average and closing rates of exchange are taken to reserves, as are differences arising on the retranslation to sterling (using closing rates of exchange) of overseas net assets at the beginning of the year, and are presented as a separate component of equity. They are recognised in the income statement when the gain or loss on disposal of a Group undertaking is recognised.\n\nForeign currency transactions are initially recognised in the functional currency of each entity in the Group using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities at year-end rates of exchange are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges, on intercompany net investment loans and qualifying net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains or losses recognised in the income statement are included in profit from operations or net finance costs depending on the underlying transactions that gave rise to these exchange differences.\n\nIn addition, for hyperinflationary countries where the effect on the Group results would be significant, the financial statements in local currency are adjusted to reflect the impact of local inflation prior to translation into sterling, in accordance with IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies . Where applicable, IAS 29 requires all transactions to be indexed by an inflationary factor to the balance sheet date, potentially leading to a monetary gain or loss on indexation. In addition, the Group assesses the carrying value of fixed assets after indexation and applies IAS 36 Impairment of Assets , where appropriate, to ensure that the carrying value correctly reflects the economic value of such assets.\n\nThe results and balance sheets of operations in hyperinflationary territories are translated at the period end rate. In the case of Venezuela, the Group uses an estimated exchange rate calculated by reflecting the development of the general price index since the Group last achieved meaningful repatriation of dividends.\n\n## Revenue\n\nRevenue principally comprises sales of cigarettes, other tobacco products, and nicotine products, to external customers. Revenue excludes duty, excise and other taxes related to sales in the period and is stated after deducting rebates, returns and other similar discounts and payments to direct and indirect customers. For vast majority of the Group's sales, revenue is recognised when control of the goods is transferred to a customer at a point in time; this is usually evidenced by a transfer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership upon delivery to the customer, which in terms of timing is not materially different to the date of shipping.\n\n## Retirement benefit costs\n\nThe Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes including post-retirement healthcare schemes. For defined benefit schemes, the actuarial cost charged to profit from operations consists of current service cost, net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset, past service cost and the impact of any settlements. The net deficit or surplus for each defined benefit pension scheme is calculated in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits based on the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the scheme assets adjusted, where appropriate, for any surplus restrictions or the effect of minimum funding requirements. Some benefits are provided through defined contribution schemes and payments to these are charged as an expense as they fall due.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group has equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans.\n\nEquity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of awards that will eventually vest. For plans where vesting conditions are based on total shareholder returns, the fair value at date of grant reflects these conditions, whereas earnings per share vesting conditions are reflected in the calculation of awards that will eventually vest over the vesting period.\n\nFor cash-settled share-based payments, a liability equal to the portion of the services received is recognised at its current fair value determined at each balance sheet date.\n\nFair value is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model, except where vesting is dependent on market conditions when the Monte-Carlo option pricing model is used. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Statements\n\n## Notes on Accounts Continued\n\n## 1 Accounting Policies Continued\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is charged to income in the year in which it is incurred. Development expenditure is charged to income in the year it is incurred, unless it meets the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets to be capitalised as an intangible asset.\n\n## Taxation\n\nTaxation is chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred taxation. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group's subsidiaries, associates and joint arrangements operate and generate taxable income.\n\nDeferred taxation is provided in full using the liability method for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amount used for taxation purposes. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nTax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income or the statement of changes in equity.\n\nThe Group has exposures in respect of the payment or recovery of a number of taxes. With effect from 1 January 2019, the Group adopted the requirements of IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments which requires that, where there is uncertainty as to whether a particular tax treatment will be accepted by the relevant taxation authority, the financial statements reflect the probable outcome with estimated amounts determined based on the most likely amount or expected value, depending on which method is expected to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Prior to 1 January 2019, liabilities or assets for these payments or recoveries were recognised at such time as an outcome became probable and when the amount could reasonably be estimated.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised and any impairment of goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.\n\nGoodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. In respect of associates and joint ventures, goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in the associated company or joint venture. On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Intangible assets other than goodwill\n\nThe intangible assets shown on the Group balance sheet consist mainly of trademarks and similar intangibles, including certain intellectual property, acquired by the Group's subsidiary undertakings and computer software.\n\nAcquired trademarks and similar assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortised but are reviewed annually for impairment. Other trademarks and similar assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their remaining useful lives, consistent with the pattern of economic benefits expected to be received, which do not exceed 20 years. Any impairments of trademarks are recognised in the income statement, but increases in trademark values are not recognised.\n\nComputer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment, and, with the exception of global software solutions, is amortised on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from three years to five years. Global software solutions are software assets designed to be implemented on a global basis and used as a standard solution by all of the operating companies in the Group. Prior to 2021, these assets were amortised on a straight-line basis over periods not exceeding 10 years. Since 2021, global software solutions are amortised on a straightline basis over periods not exceeding 13 years. The revision in useful economic life is a result of ongoing use of global software solutions due to the extension of third-party supplier support. In 2021 and 2022, the estimated impact of this change in accounting estimate is a reduction in annual amortisation expense of \u00a326 million and, in 2023, a reduction in annual amortisation expense of \u00a312 million.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the assets over their useful economic life. No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets classified as held-for-sale. Freehold and leasehold property are depreciated at rates between 2.5% and 4% per annum, and plant and equipment at rates between 3% and 25% per annum.\n\n## Capitalised interest\n\nBorrowing costs which are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of intangible assets or property, plant and equipment that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.\n\n## Leased assets\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2019, the Group has applied IFRS 16 Leases to contractual arrangements which are, or contain, leases of assets, and consequently recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the commencement of the leasing arrangement, with the assets included as part of property, plant and equipment in note 13 and the liabilities included as part of borrowings in note 23.\n\nIn adopting IFRS 16, the Group applied the modified retrospective approach with no restatement of prior periods, as permitted by the Standard. The Group took advantage of certain practical expedients available under the Standard, including 'grandfathering' previously recognised lease arrangements such that contracts were not reassessed at the implementation date as to whether they were, or contained, a lease, and leases previously classified as finance leases under IAS 17 Leases remained capitalised on the adoption of IFRS 16.",

    {
        "page_content": "## 1 Accounting Policies Continued\n\nFor leasing arrangements entered into after 1 January 2019, the Group has also adopted several practical expedients available under the Standard including not applying the requirements of IFRS 16 to leases of intangible assets, applying the portfolio approach where appropriate to do so, and to not apply the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 16 to shortterm leases (leases of less than 12 months maximum duration) or leases of low-value assets. Except for property-related leases, non-lease components have not been separated from lease components.\n\nLease liabilities are initially recognised at an amount equal to the present value of estimated contractual lease payments at the inception of the lease, after taking into account any options to extend the term of the lease. Lease commitments are discounted to present value using the interest rate implicit in the lease if this can be readily determined, or the applicable incremental rate of borrowing, as appropriate. Right-of-use lease assets are initially recognised at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs in relation to the assets, then depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their estimated useful lives.\n\nPrior to 1 January 2019, the Group applied IAS 17 Leases . Arrangements where the Group had substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset were classified as finance leases and were included as part of property, plant and equipment. Under IAS 17, leases which were not classified as finance leases were classified as operating leases and such arrangements were not capitalised. Rental payments under operating leases were charged to operating profit on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAssets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of a cash-generating unit may not be recoverable. In addition, assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.\n\nA cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash flows which are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to the relevant cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units expected to benefit from the acquisition for the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets held at amortised cost\n\nLoss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets which are held at amortised cost are recognised on initial recognition of the underlying asset. As permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , loss allowances on trade receivables arising from the recognition of revenue under IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers are initially measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses. Allowances in respect of loans and other receivables are initially recognised at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. Allowances are measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses where the credit risk on the receivables increases significantly after initial recognition.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the weighted average cost incurred in acquiring inventories and bringing them to their existing location and condition, which will include raw materials, direct labour and overheads, where appropriate. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to completion and sale. Tobacco inventories which have an operating cycle that exceeds 12 months are classified as current assets, consistent with recognised industry practice.\n\n## Biological Assets\n\nThe investments in associates and joint ventures shown in the Group balance sheet include biological assets held by Organigram Holdings Inc. In accordance with IAS 41 Agriculture , the Group measures biological assets at fair value less costs to sell up to the point of harvest, at which point this becomes the basis for the cost of finished goods inventories after harvest with subsequent expenditures incurred on these being capitalised, where applicable, in accordance with IAS 2 Inventories . Unrealised fair value gains and losses arising during the growth of biological assets are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nInstruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that cannot be settled in the Group's own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of issuance costs.\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Group issued two \u20ac1 billion perpetual hybrid bonds. As the Group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these bonds, they are classified as equity instruments in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nThe Group's business model for managing financial assets is set out in the Group Treasury Manual which notes that the primary objective with regard to the management of cash and investments is to protect against the loss of principal. Additionally, the Group aims: to maximise Group liquidity by concentrating cash at the Centre, to align the maturity profile of external investments with that of the forecast liquidity profile, to wherever practicable, match the interest rate profile of external investments to that of debt maturities or fixings, and to optimise the investment yield within the Group's investment parameters. The majority of financial assets are held in order to collect contractual cash flows (typically cash and cash equivalents and loans and other receivables), but some assets (typically investments) are held for investment potential.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions. Such assets and liabilities are classified as current if they are expected to be realised or settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date. If not, they are classified as non-current. In addition, current liabilities include amounts where the entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Statements\n\n## Notes on Accounts Continued\n\n## 1 Accounting Policies Continued\n\nThe Group early adopted the phase one and phase two Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures regarding Interest Rate Benchmark Reform in 2019 and 2020 respectively. The Amendments provide an exemption for certain hedging relationships directly affected by changes in interest rate benchmarks where the reform gives rise to uncertainties regarding the interest rate designated as a hedged risk, or the timing or amount of interest rate cashflows of either the hedged item or of the hedging instrument, such that without the exemption the relationship might not qualify for hedge accounting. In addition, the Amendments provide a practical expedient for financial assets and financial liabilities that are modified or have existing contractual terms activated that change the basis for determining the contractual cash flows as a result of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform, such that the change to the contractual cash flows is applied prospectively by revising the effective interest rate.\n\nNon-derivative financial assets are classified on initial recognition in accordance with the Group's business model as investments, loans and receivables, or cash and cash equivalents and accounted for as follows:\n\n- -Investments: these are non-derivative financial assets that cannot be classified as loans and other receivables or cash and cash equivalents. Dividend and interest income on these investments are included within finance income when the Group's right to receive payments is established. This category includes financial assets at fair value through profit and loss and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n- -Loans and other receivables: these are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, that are primarily held in order to collect contractual cash flows. These balances include trade and other receivables, which are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method, and stated net of allowances for credit losses, and deposits with banks and other financial institutions which cannot be classified as cash and cash equivalents. In addition, as explained in note 17, certain litigation related deposits are recognised as assets within loans and other receivables where management has determined that these payments represent a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events. These deposits are held at the fair value of consideration transferred less impairment, if applicable, and have not been discounted.\n- -Cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and deposits held on call, together with other short-term highly liquid investments including investments in certain money market funds. Cash equivalents normally comprise instruments with maturities of three months or less at their date of acquisition. In the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are shown net of bank overdrafts, which are included as current borrowings in the liabilities section on the balance sheet.\n\nFair values for quoted investments are based on observable market prices. If there is no active market for a financial asset, the fair value is established by using valuation techniques principally involving discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nNon-derivative financial liabilities , including borrowings and trade payables, are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. For borrowings, their carrying value includes accrued interest payable, as well as unamortised issue costs. As shown in note 23, certain borrowings are subject to fair value hedges, as defined below.\n\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value, which includes accrued interest receivable and payable where relevant. Changes in their fair values are recognised as follows:\n\n- - for derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in their fair values are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement. Where the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, the accumulated gains and losses, previously recognised in other comprehensive income, are included in the initial carrying value of the asset (basis adjustment) and recognised in the income statement in the same periods as the hedged item. Where the underlying transaction does not result in such an asset, the accumulated gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement in the same periods as the hedged item;\n- - for derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for the fair value changes attributable to the risk being hedged, with the corresponding entry being made in the income statement. The changes in fair value of these derivatives are also recognised in the income statement;\n- - for derivatives that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in their fair values are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement. Where non-derivatives such as foreign currency borrowings are designated as net investment hedges, the relevant exchange differences are similarly recognised. The accumulated gains and losses are reclassified to the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of; and\n- - for derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges, the changes in their fair values are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they arise. These are referred to as 'held-for-trading'.\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the economic relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is re-performed periodically to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain, highly effective.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised (e.g. through expiry or disposal), or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain in equity until the transaction takes place, when they are reclassified to the income statement in the same manner as for cash flow hedges as described above. When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses, previously recognised in other comprehensive income, are immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\nDerivative fair value changes recognised in the income statement are either reflected in arriving at profit from operations (if the hedged item is similarly reflected) or in finance costs.",

These are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the focus of the Group's internal reporting systems and are the basis used by the chief operating decision maker, identified as the Management Board, for assessing performance and allocating resources.\n\nThe Group is primarily a single product business providing cigarettes and other tobacco products. While the Group has clearly differentiated brands, global segmentation between a wide portfolio of brands is not part of the regular internally reported financial information. The results of New Category products are reported as part of the results of each geographic region, and currently individually and in aggregate represent less than 10% of the Group's revenue and operating profit in total.\n\nThe prices agreed between Group companies for intra-group sales of materials, manufactured goods, charges for royalties, commissions, services and fees, are based on normal commercial practices which would apply between independent businesses. Royalty income, less related expenditure, is included in the region in which the licensor is based.\n\n## Adjusting items\n\nAdjusting items are significant items of income or expense in revenue, profit from operations, net finance costs, taxation and the Group's share of the post-tax results of associates and joint ventures which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Group's underlying financial performance because of their size, nature or incidence. In identifying and quantifying adjusting items, the Group consistently applies a policy that defines criteria that are required to be met for an item to be classified as adjusting. These items are separately disclosed in the segmental analyses or in the notes to the accounts as appropriate.\n\nThe Group believes that these items are useful to users of the Group financial statements in helping them to understand the underlying business performance and are used to derive the Group's principal non-GAAP measures of adjusted revenue, adjusted profit from operations, adjusted diluted earnings per share and @ operating cash flow conversion ratio @ , all of which are before the impact of adjusting items and which are reconciled from revenue, profit from operations, diluted earnings per share, @ cash conversion ratio and net cash generated from operating activities @ .\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when either a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event exists at the balance sheet date, it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reasonable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nSubsidiaries and associate companies are defendants in tobaccorelated and other litigation. Provision for this litigation (including legal costs) is made at such time as an unfavourable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\n\nContingent assets are possible assets whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the entity and are not recognised as assets until the realisation of income is virtually certain.\n\nWhere a provision has not been recognised, the Group records its external legal fees and other external defence costs for tobaccorelated and other litigation as these costs are incurred.\n\nAs explained in note 17, certain litigation-related deposits are recognised as assets within loans and other receivables where management has determined that these payments represent a resource controlled by the entity. These deposits are held at the fair value of consideration transferred less impairment, if applicable, and have not been discounted.\n\n## Repurchase of share capital\n\nWhen share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares purchased for the employee share ownership trusts, are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.\n\n## Future changes to accounting policies\n\nA number of interpretations and revisions to existing standards have been issued which will be applicable to the Group financial statements in future years, but are not expected to have a material effect on reported profit or equity or on the disclosures in the financial statements.",

Therefore, the results of New Categories (comprising Tobacco Heating Products, Vapour products and Modern Oral products) are reported to the Management Board as part of the results of each geographic region. However, additional information has been provided to disaggregate revenue based on product category to enable investors to better compare the Group's business performance across periods and by reference to the Group's investment activity. Interest income, interest expense, share of post-tax results of associates and joint ventures and taxation are centrally managed, and accordingly, such items are not presented by segment as they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability.\n\nThe four geographic regions are the reportable segments for the Group as they form the focus of the Group's internal reporting systems and are the basis used by the Management Board for assessing performance and allocating resources. Transactions between Group subsidiaries are conducted on arm's length terms in accordance with appropriate transfer pricing rules and Organisation for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD) principles. The Management Board reviews current and prior year adjusted segmental revenue and adjusted profit from operations at constant rates of exchange. The constant rate comparison provided for reporting segment information is based on a retranslation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year results of the Group, including intercompany royalties payable in foreign currency to UK entities. However, the Group does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in operations which are generated by movements in exchange rates.\n\nIn respect of the U.S. region, all financial statements and financial information provided by or with respect to the U.S. business or RAI (and/ or RAI and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Reynolds Group')) are prepared on the basis of US GAAP and constitute the primary financial statements or financial information of the U.S. business or RAI (and/or the Reynolds Group). Solely for the purpose of consolidation within the results of BAT p.l.c. and the BAT Group, this financial information is then converted to IFRS. To the extent any such financial information provided in these financial statements relates to the U.S. business or RAI (and/or the Reynolds Group), it is provided as an explanation of the U.S. business's or RAI's (and/or the Reynolds Group's) primary US GAAP based financial statements and information.\n\nEffective 1 January 2022, the North African markets of Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan and Tunisia, which currently form part of the ENA region, will be moved to the APME region.\n\nThe following table shows 2021 revenue and adjusted revenue at current rates, and 2021 adjusted revenue translated using 2020 rates of exchange.

The amortisation and impairment of these acquired trademarks and similar intangibles are charged to the income statement as adjusting. In 2021, the amortisation and impairment of these acquired trademarks and similar intangibles is \u00a3306 million (2020: \u00a3339 million; 2019: \u00a3481 million).

The Group also recognised a goodwill impairment charge of \u00a354 million in 2021 due to continued difficult trading conditions in Peru as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group impaired the goodwill arising from Malaysia amounting to \u00a3197 million, goodwill arising from the acquisition of Twisp of \u00a311 million and goodwill arising from the acquisition of Blue Nile of \u00a31 million.\n\nDuring 2019, the Group impaired the goodwill arising from the Bentoel acquisition, amounting to \u00a3172 million, goodwill arising from the VapeWild acquisition of \u00a312 million and goodwill arising from the Highendsmoke acquisition of \u00a310 million.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - depreciation and impairment\n\nThe following items are included within depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment:\n\n- - Restructuring and integration related depreciation and impairment costs and reversals were a net credit of \u00a311 million (2020: \u00a3151 million net cost; 2019: \u00a363 million net cost) resulting from obsolete machines in relation to downsizing and factory rationalisation as mentioned in note 7; and\n- - Gains and losses recognised on disposal of property, plant and equipment.\n\n## 5 Other Operating Income\n\nOther operating income of \u00a3196 million (2020: \u00a3188 million; 2019: \u00a3163 million) comprises income that is associated with the Group's normal activities, but which falls outside the definition of turnover and includes one-off capital profits on property sales and one-off disposals of fixed assets.\n\nAs explained in note 31, the Group recognised \u00a35 million (2020: \u00a358 million; 2019: \u00a386 million) in respect of a tax case in Brazil. In addition, during 2021, \u00a3130 million of the unrecognised contingent asset in respect of historical VAT on social contributions claims was sold to financial institutions for \u00a345 million.\n\nAlso, in 2021, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJRT) reached an agreement with several Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) states to waive RJRT's claims under the MSA in connection with a settlement between those MSA states and a non-participating manufacturer, S&M Brands, Inc. (S&M Brands), under which the states released certain claims against S&M Brands in exchange for receiving a portion of the funds S&M Brands had deposited into escrow accounts in those states pursuant to the states' escrow statutes. In consideration for waiving claims, RJRT, together with Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, received approximately \u00a340 million from the escrow funds paid to those MSA states under their settlement with S&M Brands.\n\nIn 2019, as discussed in note 7, certain items of operating income have been incurred as part of the Group's restructuring and integration activities.",

Reynolds Tobacco Company, Lorillard and Brown & Williamson, businesses which are now part of the Reynolds Group) entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with attorneys general representing most U.S. states and territories. The MSA imposes a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers. The amounts of money that the participating manufacturers are required to annually contribute are based upon, amongst other things, the volume of cigarettes sold and market share (based on cigarette shipments in that year).\n\nDuring 2012, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company (SFNTC), various other tobacco manufacturers, 17 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico reached an agreement related to the Non-Participating Manufacturer (NPM) adjustment under the MSA, and three more states joined the agreement in 2013. Under this agreement, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has received credits of more than US$1 billion, in respect of its Non-Participating Manufacturer (NPM) Adjustment claims related to the period from 2003 to 2012. These credits have been applied against the companies' MSA payments over a period of five years from 2013, subject to, and dependent upon, meeting the various ongoing performance obligations. During 2014, two additional states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2003 to 2012. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has received US$170 million in credits, which has been applied over a five-year period from 2014. During 2015, another state agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2014 and included a method to determine future adjustments from 2015 forward. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has received US$285 million in credits, which was applied over a four-year period from 2016. During 2016, no additional states agreed to settle NPM disputes. During 2017, two more states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2014. It is estimated that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will receive US$61 million in credits, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2017. During 2018, nine more states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2019, with an option through 2022, subject to certain conditions. It is estimated that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will receive US$182 million in credits for settled periods through 2017, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2018. Also, in 2018, one additional state agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2024, subject to certain conditions. It is estimated that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will receive US$205 million in credits for settled periods through 2017, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, certain conditions set forth in the 2017 and 2018 agreements were met for those 10 states. In addition, in August 2020, 24 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2018 to 2022. Credits in respect of future years' payments and the NPM Adjustment claims would be accounted for in the applicable year and will not be treated as adjusting items. Only credits in respect of prior year payments are included as adjusting items.\n\nIn 2020, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recognised additional expenses under the state settlement agreements in the States of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recognised US$241 million of expense for payment obligations to the State of Florida for the ITG Brands, LLC acquired brands from the date of divestiture, June 12, 2015, as a result of an unfavourable judgment. In addition, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recognised US$264 million related to the resolution of claims against it in the States of Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi for payment obligations to those states for the ITG Brands, LLC acquired brands from the date of divestiture. Finally, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company settled certain related claims with Phillip Morris USA under the state settlement agreements in the states of Mississippi, Texas and Minnesota for US$8 million. Additional information related to the resolution of these claims is included in notes 6(d) and 31. During 2021, an additional US$17 million expense was recognised in relation to the final resolution of the Texas and Minnesota claims.\n\nThe BAT Group is subject to substantial payment obligations under the MSA and the state settlement agreements with the States of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (such settlement agreements, collectively State Settlement Agreements). Reynolds Group's operating subsidiaries' expenses and payments under the MSA and the State Settlement Agreements for 2021 amounted to US$3,420 million (2020: US$3,572 million; 2019: US$2,762 million) in respect of settlement expenses and US$3,744 million (2020: US$2,848 million; 2019: US$2,918 million) in respect of settlement cash payments.",

Other marketing expenses, such as point of sale and promotional materials, media advertising and sponsorship, and consumer research, are reported as operating expenses and have been shown in the table above.\n\n## (d) Litigation costs\n\nLitigation costs included within other operating expenses, and reported as an adjusting item, were \u00a354 million (2020: \u00a387 million; 2019: \u00a3236 million) predominantly related to other litigation costs including Engle progeny.\n\nIn 2020, also included as an adjusting item was a charge of \u00a3400 million incurred largely in respect of charges following the development in cases regarding payment obligations under the state settlement agreements with Florida, Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi for brands previously sold to a third party. The Group recognised a charge of \u00a3188 million in the period for a final judgment of a case in the Florida court. The Group continues to pursue indemnification remedies in a Delaware court for payments made to Florida as a result of this judgment, as explained in note 31. During 2020, the Group also recognised a provision of \u00a3212 million related to the settlement discussions with other manufacturers and the States of Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi for payment obligations related to these brands in prior years.

Included in the 2019 research and development costs is \u00a365 million of costs primarily related to packages in respect of employee benefit reductions as part of the Group's 2019 restructuring initiative (Quantum), as discussed in note 7.\n\n## (f) Loss on disposal of BAT Pars\n\nOn 6 August 2021, the Group disposed of its Iranian subsidiary, B.A.T. Pars Company PJSC (BAT Pars). Included within other operating expenses, and recognised as an adjusting item, is a charge of \u00a3358 million comprising \u00a3272 million of foreign exchange reclassified from other comprehensive income (note 22(c)(i)) and an impairment charge and associated costs of \u00a388 million. In addition, a credit of \u00a32 million was recognised in relation to a partial unwind of discounting on the deferred proceeds. More information has been provided in note 27(d).\n\n## (g) Tax disputes in Turkey, South Korea and Russia\n\nThe settlement of tax disputes in Turkey, South Korea and Russia were recognised as adjusting items.\n\n## Turkey\n\nAs explained in note 31, British American Tobacco Tutun Mamulleri Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi (BAT Tutun) was subject to a series of tax audits mainly on inventory movements for the years 2015, 2016 and 2019. In August 2021, BAT Tutun applied under the relevant tax amnesty law to settle its retrospective tax assessments. Based on the settlement through the tax amnesty procedure, BAT Tutun agreed to pay \u00a347 million in 18 instalments from 1 November 2021 until 31 July 2024. Of the \u00a347 million, \u00a330 million of excise and penalties were recognised and charged to operating profit, \u00a311 million as interest in net finance costs (note 8(b)) and \u00a36 million in taxation.\n\n## South Korea\n\nAs explained in note 31, on 16 September 2021, Rothmans Far East B.V. Korea Branch Office received \u00a34 million in relation to a VAT case. In line with the treatment of the associated expense incurred in 2016, the cash received was recognised as an adjusting item.\n\n## Russia\n\nIn August 2019, the Russian tax authority issued a final audit report to JSC British American Tobacco-SPb (BAT SpB) related to the application of legislation introduced in 2017 that prospectively limited the amount of production that could take place prior to excise tax increases, without being subject to higher excise tax rates. The final audit report sought to retrospectively apply the legislation to the years 2015 to 2017. BAT SpB submitted an appeal to the Federal Tax Services (FTS) objecting to the findings. The FTS accepted some of BAT SpB's arguments and, on 27 January 2020, a final claim was issued by the FTS. As a consequence, the Group recognised a charge of \u00a3202 million. The Group also recognised an interest charge of \u00a350 million (note 8(b)).\n\nIn 2020, a credit of \u00a340 million was recognised in relation to the 2019 charge discussed above, of which \u00a314 million was offset in the adjusting items included in taxation (note 10(d)).\n\n## (h) Quebec class actions\n\nIn 2019, a charge of \u00a3436 million was incurred in respect of the Quebec class actions, as explained in note 31, and charged as an adjusting item.",

Audit-related fees are in respect of services provided to associated pension schemes. All other fees are in respect of other assurance services, including those provided over information derived from the financial information systems subject to audit or over the controls over those systems.\n\n## 7 Restructuring and Integration Costs\n\nRestructuring costs reflect the costs incurred as a result of initiatives to improve the effectiveness and the efficiency of the Group as a globally integrated enterprise. These costs represent additional expenses incurred that are not related to the normal business and day-to-day activities. These initiatives include the costs associated with Quantum, being a review of the Group's organisational structure announced in 2019 to simplify the business and create a more efficient, agile and focused company. In 2019 and 2020, these also included a review of the Group's manufacturing operations. It is expected that such restructuring programmes (related to Quantum) will be substantially complete by the end of 2022.\n\nThe costs of the Group's initiatives are included in profit from operations under the following headings:\n\n|                                                          | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Employee benefit costs (note 3)                          | 160       | 91        | 364       |\n| Depreciation, amortisation and impairment costs (note 4) | (11)      | 151       | 63        |\n| Other operating income (note 5)                          | -         | -         | (7)       |\n| Other operating expenses                                 | 1         | 166       | 145       |\n|                                                          | 150       | 408       | 565       |\n\nThe adjusting charge in 2021 relates to the cost of employee packages in respect of Quantum and the ongoing costs associated with initiatives to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the Group as a globally integrated organisation. In addition, Quantum initiatives in certain countries have resulted in the move to above market business models utilising local distributors as importers. As a consequence, with the cessation of a physical presence in these markets, foreign exchange previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income for these countries has been reclassified to the income statement and reported within other operating expenses (note 22(c)(i)).\n\nIncluded under the Quantum initiatives above is a charge of \u00a327 million, including \u00a34 million for foreign exchange reclassified from equity (note 22(c)(i)), related to the Group's withdrawal from Myanmar. In addition, as set out in note 4, goodwill in relation to Myanmar was impaired and charged to the income statement. These costs were recognised in 2021 as an adjusting item.",

The costs also cover the downsizing and factory rationalisation activities in the Netherlands and Hungary in 2020, Germany in 2019, and Russia and APME in both 2020 and 2019.\n\nAlso, in 2020, as a consequence of a reduction in volumes due to the significant increase in excise in Indonesia, the Group announced a restructuring programme which included the partial closure of the factory operations in Indonesia. As a result of this decision, a \u00a369 million impairment was recognised in respect of machinery. This impairment charge related to some of the machinery in use as well as machinery held for future use which, following the significant changes in consumer preferences, is not expected to be brought in to manufacturing in the future.\n\nAlso included in other operating income in 2019 are amounts related to cash and reversal of deferred consideration associated with the acquisition of TDR d.o.o. (TDR) (note 27).\n\n## 8 Net finance Costs\n\n## (a) Net finance costs/(income)\n\n2021\n\n|                                                                          | \u00a3m    | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Interest expense                                                         | 1,436 | 1,605     | 1,676     |\n| Interest expense on lease liabilities                                    | 24    | 26        | 32        |\n| Facility fees                                                            | 33    | 23        | 10        |\n| Interest and fair value related to early repurchase of bonds (note 8(b)) | -     | 142       | -         |\n| Interest related to adjusting tax payables (note 8(b))                   | 31    | 11        | 80        |\n| Fair value changes on derivative financial instruments and hedged items  | 252   | (217)     | 367       |\n| Fair value change on other financial items (note 8(b))                   | 24    | -         | -         |\n| Exchange differences                                                     | (279) | 205       | (479)     |\n| Finance costs                                                            | 1,521 | 1,795     | 1,686     |\n| Interest under the effective interest method                             | (35)  | (50)      | (84)      |\n| Finance income                                                           | (35)  | (50)      | (84)      |\n| Net finance costs                                                        | 1,486 | 1,745     | 1,602     |\n\nThe Group manages foreign exchange gains and losses and fair value changes on a net basis excluding adjusting items, which are explained in note 8(b). The derivatives that generate the fair value changes are explained in note 19.\n\nFacility fees principally relate to the Group's central banking facilities.\n\nIn October 2020, the Group completed a tender offer to repurchase sterling-equivalent \u00a32,653 million of bonds, including \u00a324 million of accrued interest. Following this, in November 2020, the Group also completed a 'make-whole' bond redemption exercise of sterlingequivalent \u00a3462 million of bonds, including \u00a36 million of accrued interest. Further details on the tender offer and 'make-whole' redemption exercise are provided in note 26. Other costs directly associated with the early repurchase of bonds, including the premium paid, were treated as adjusting items, as detailed in note 8(b).\n\n## (b) Adjusting items included in net finance costs\n\nAdjusting items are significant items in net finance costs which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Group's underlying financial performance.\n\nIn 2021, as part of the disposal of the Group's operations in Iran (note 27(d)), a provision of \u00a324 million was charged to net finance costs against non-current investments held at fair value due to the uncertainty around recovery of these funds.\n\nIn addition, the Group recognised interest on adjusting tax payables of \u00a331 million (2020: \u00a311 million; 2019: \u00a380 million), which included interest of \u00a320 million (2020: \u00a321 million; 2019: \u00a328 million) in relation to the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order (FII GLO) (note 10(b)), an amnesty tax payment in Turkey of \u00a311 million (2020: \u00a3nil; 2019: \u00a3nil) and \u00a3nil (2020: net credit of \u00a310 million; 2019: charge of \u00a350 million) in respect of the excise dispute (note 6(g)) and withholding tax in Russia.\n\nIn 2020, the Group incurred additional interest costs of \u00a3157 million and fair value gains of \u00a315 million in relation to the early repurchase of bonds.",

The amounts below were reported as adjusting items under the share of profit from associates in the income statement.\n\n## (a) Adjusting items\n\nIn 2021, the Group's interest in ITC Ltd. (ITC) decreased from 29.42% to 29.38% (2020: 29.46% to 29.42%; 2019: 29.57% to 29.46%) as a result of ITC issuing ordinary shares under the ITC Employee Share Option Scheme. The issue of these shares and change in the Group's share of ITC resulted in a gain of \u00a36 million (2020: \u00a317 million; 2019: \u00a325 million), which is treated as a deemed partial disposal and included in the income statement.\n\nIn 2021, due to a challenging operating environment, the investment in Kamaran Industry & Investment Company, one of the Group's associates in Yemen, was impaired. This resulted in a charge of \u00a318 million to the income statement.\n\nAs detailed in note 14, as a result of the liquidation of Tisak d.d., the Group reclassified the foreign exchange previously recognised in other comprehensive income to the income statement. This resulted in a credit of \u00a32 million to the income statement.\n\nAlso, in 2021, the Group incurred a \u00a32 million charge in relation to the amortisation of acquired intangibles associated with the acquisition of Organigram in March 2021, as described in note 14.\n\nIn 2020, ITC recognised a charge in respect of the cost of leaf tobacco stocks destroyed in a third-party warehouse fire, the Group's share of which was \u00a34 million.\n\n## (b) Other financial information\n\nThe Group's share of the results of associates and joint ventures is shown in the table below.\n\n|                                                        | 2021 Group's share \u00a3m   | 2020 Group's share \u00a3m   | 2019 Group's share \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Profit on ordinary activities after taxation           |                         |                         |                         |\n| - attributable to owners of the Parent                 | 415                     | 455                     | 498                     |\n| Other comprehensive income:                            |                         |                         |                         |\n| Items that may be reclassified to profit and loss      | (17)                    | (98)                    | (115)                   |\n| Items that will not be reclassified to profit and loss | 14                      | (34)                    | 7                       |\n| Total comprehensive income                             | 412                     | 323                     | 390                     |",

There were 18 corporate groups in the FII GLO as at 31 December 2021. The case concerns the treatment for UK corporate tax purposes of profits earned overseas and distributed to the UK.\n\nThe original claim was filed in 2003. The trial of the claim was split broadly into issues of liability and quantification. The main liability issues were heard by the High Court, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court in the UK and the European Court of Justice in the period to November 2012. The detailed technical issues of the quantification mechanics of the claim were heard by the High Court during May and June 2014 and the judgment handed down on 18 December 2014. The High Court determined that in respect of issues concerning the calculation of unlawfully charged corporation tax and advance corporation tax, the law of restitution including the defence on change of position and questions concerning the calculation of overpaid interest, the approach of the Group was broadly preferred. The conclusion reached by the High Court would, if upheld, produce an estimated receivable of \u00a31.2 billion for the Group. Appeals on a majority of the issues were made to the Court of Appeal, which heard the arguments in June 2016. The Court of Appeal determined in November 2016 on the majority of issues that the conclusion reached by the High Court should be upheld. The Supreme Court gave permission for a number of issues to be appealed in two separate hearings. The first, in February 2020, concerned the time limit for bringing claims. HMRC sought to challenge existing case law. In November 2020, the Supreme Court handed down its judgment. The Supreme Court agreed to overturn existing case law partially but introduced a new test for determining whether claims of this type are in time. The case has been remitted to the High Court to apply that new test to the facts. The second hearing was heard in December 2020 and concerned issues relating to the type of claims BAT is entitled to bring. The judgment from the second hearing was handed down in July 2021. Applying that judgment reduces the value of the FII claim to approximately \u00a30.3 billion, mainly as the result of the application of simple interest and the limitation to claims for advance corporation tax offset against lawful corporation tax charges, which is subject to the determination of the timing issue by the High Court and any subsequent appeal.\n\nDuring 2015, HMRC paid to the Group a gross amount of \u00a31,224 million in two separate payments. The payments made by HMRC have been made without any admission of liability and are subject to refund were HMRC to succeed on appeal. The second payment in November 2015 followed the introduction of a new 45% tax on the interest component of restitution claims against HMRC. HMRC held back \u00a3261 million from the second payment contending that it represents the new 45% tax on that payment, leading to total cash received by the Group of \u00a3963 million. Actions challenging the legality of the withholding of the 45% tax have been lodged by the Group. The First Tier Tribunal found in favour of HMRC in July 2017 and the Group's appeal to the Upper Tribunal was heard in July 2018 and judgment has not yet been handed down.\n\nThe net \u00a30.9 billion held by the Group is higher than the current value of the claim referred to above. Due to the uncertainty of the amounts and eventual outcome, the Group has not recognised any impact in the Income Statement in the current or prior period. The receipt, net of the deduction by HMRC, is held within trade and other payables as disclosed in note 25. Any future recognition as income will be treated as an adjusting item, due to the size of the amount, with interest of \u00a320 million for the 12 months to 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a321 million; 2019: \u00a328 million) accruing on the balance, which was also treated as an adjusting item.\n\nThe final resolution of all issues in the litigation is likely to take a number of years and the Group intends from 2022 onwards to commence annual interim repayments to HMRC of at least \u00a350 million per annum.",

Adjusting items are significant items in the profit from operations, net finance costs, taxation and the Group's share of the post-tax results of associates and joint ventures which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, are relevant to an understanding of the Group's underlying financial performance. The Group believes that these items are useful to users of the Group financial statements in helping them to understand the underlying business performance. To illustrate the impact of these items, an adjusted earnings per share calculation is shown below.\n\nBasic\n\n|                                                                                                                    | Notes   | Earnings \u00a3m   | 2021 Earnings per share pence   | Earnings \u00a3m   | 2020 Earnings per share pence   | Earnings \u00a3m   | 2019 Earnings per share pence   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------|\n| Basic earnings per share                                                                                           |         | 6,789         | 296.9                           | 6,400         | 280.0                           | 5,704         | 249.7                           |\n| Effect of restructuring and integration costs                                                                      | 7       | 150           | 6.5                             | 408           | 17. 8                           | 565           | 24.7                            |\n| Tax and non-controlling interests on restructuring  and integration costs                                          |         | (39)          | (1.7)                           | (64)          | (2.8)                           | (101)         | (4.4)                           |\n| Effect of amortisation and impairment of goodwill,  trademarks and similar intangibles                             | 4       | 363           | 15.9                            | 548           | 24.0                            | 675           | 29.6                            |\n| Tax and non-controlling interests on amortisation  and impairment of goodwill, trademarks and  similar intangibles |         | (71)          | (3.1)                           | (77)          | (3.4)                           | (115)         | (5.0)                           |\n| Effect of associates' adjusting items net of tax                                                                   | 9(a)    | 12            | 0.5                             | (13)          | (0.6)                           | (25)          | (1.1)                           |\n| Effect of Quebec class action                                                                                      | 6(h)    | -

The principal allocations of goodwill in the Rothmans' acquisition are to the cashgenerating units of Europe and South Africa, with the remainder mainly relating to operations in APME.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group recognised a goodwill impairment charge of \u00a357 million (2020: \u00a3209 million) as explained in note 12(e)(iv) below.",

        "page_content": "## 12 Intangible Assets Continued\n\n## (c) Trademarks and similar intangibles\n\n## Trademarks and similar intangibles with indefinite lives\n\nThe net book value of trademarks and similar intangibles with indefinite lives is \u00a369,475 million (2020: \u00a368,839 million) and relates to the acquisition of Reynolds American. The trademarks acquired, including Newport, Camel, Natural American Spirit, Grizzly and Pall Mall, all of which are part of the Group's Strategic Portfolio of key brands, form the core focus of the U.S. business and receive significant support in the form of dedicated internal resources, forecasting and, where appropriate, marketing investment. These trademarks have significant market share and positive cashflow growth expectations. There are no regulatory or contractual restrictions on the use of the trademarks, and there are no plans by management to significantly redirect resources elsewhere. Consequently, in the view of management, these trademarks do not have a foreseeable and definite end to their ability to generate future cash flows and hence are not amortised.\n\n## Trademarks and similar intangibles with definite lives\n\nThe majority of trademarks and similar intangibles with definite lives relate to trademarks acquired in previous years. These trademarks are amortised over their expected useful lives, which do not exceed 20 years. Included in the net book value of trademarks and similar intangibles are trademarks relating to the acquisition of Reynolds American \u00a32,038 million (2020: \u00a32,260 million). In 2020, the Group acquired the formulations, brands, associated know-how and other relevant assets owned by Dryft Sciences, LLC, relating to its white nicotine pouch products. These have been accounted as trademarks with a value of \u00a3103 million (see note 27(c)).\n\nAlso, in 2020, due to the migration to Vuse and difficult trading conditions in South Africa and the delisting of certain brands in Belize, the Group recognised an impairment charge of \u00a318 million.\n\n## (d) Computer software and assets in the course of development\n\nIncluded in computer software and assets in the course of development are internally developed assets with a carrying value of \u00a3517 million (2020: \u00a3513 million). The costs of internally developed assets include capitalised expenses of employees working full time on software development projects, third-party consultants and software licence fees from third-party suppliers.\n\nThe Group has \u00a32 million of future contractual commitments (2020: \u00a36 million) related to intangible assets.\n\n## (e) Impairment testing\n\n## (i) Overview\n\n## a. Estimation uncertainty\n\nAs described in note 1, the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements include the review of asset values, especially indefinite life assets such as goodwill and certain trademarks and similar intangibles.\n\nThere is significant judgement with regard to assumptions and estimates involved in the forecasting of future cash flows, which form the basis of the assessment of the recoverability of these assets, with the effect that the value-in-use of calculations incorporate estimation uncertainty, particularly for certain assets held in relation to the Canadian, U.S., Malaysian, Peruvian and South African markets and the Global Travel Retail (GTR) business.\n\n## b. Impact of climate change\n\nThe impact of climate change on the future cash flows has been considered for scenarios analysed in terms of future access to tobacco and nicotine. The climate change scenario analyses - conducted in line with TCFD recommendations - undertaken this year did not identify any material financial impact.\n\n## (ii) Impairment testing - Trademarks and similar intangibles with indefinite lives (brands)\n\nThe trademarks and similar intangibles with indefinite lives (brands) have been tested for impairment on a value-in-use basis. The valuein-use calculations use cash flows based on detailed brand budgets prepared by management using projected sales volumes, revenues and projected brand profitability covering a five-year horizon and, thereafter, grown into perpetuity. Corporate costs are allocated to the brand budgets based on either specific allocations, where appropriate, or based on volumes. The pre-tax discount rates, ranging between 8.71% and 9.94%, and long-term growth rates of between 0.75% and 1%, applied to the brand value-in-use calculations have been determined by local management based on experience, specific market and brand trends and pricing and cost expectations. Following the application of a reasonable range of sensitivities, there was no indication of impairment.\n\nRefer to note 12(e)(v) for further information on the Newport and Camel brand impairment testing. As the trademarks and similar intangibles with indefinite lives relate to the acquisition of Reynolds American, the brand budgets used in the value-in-use calculations have also been incorporated into the budget information used in the impairment testing of the Reynolds American goodwill.",

The pre-tax discount rate represents the weighted average pre-tax discount rate.\n\nThe recoverable amounts of all cash-generating units have been determined on a value-in-use basis. The key assumptions for the recoverable amounts of all units are the budgeted volumes, revenues, operating margins and terminal growth rates, which directly impact the cash flows, and the discount rates used in the calculation. The long-term growth rate is used purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.\n\nPre-tax discount rates, as shown above, were used in the impairment testing, based on the Group's weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made. These adjustments are derived from external sources and are based on the spread between bonds (or credit default swaps, or similar indicators) issued by the U.S. or comparable governments and by the relevant local government, adjusted for the Group's own credit market risk. For ease of use and consistency in application, these results are periodically calibrated into bands based on internationally recognised credit ratings. The long-term growth rates and discount rates have been applied to the budgeted cash flows of each cashgenerating unit. These cash flows have been determined by local management based on experience, specific market and brand trends, as well as pricing and cost expectations. These have been endorsed by Group management as part of the consolidated Group's budget.\n\n## (iv) Impairment testing - Goodwill (excluding Reynolds American and Canada)\n\nThe value-in-use calculations use cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a one-year period extrapolated over a 10-year horizon with growth of 3% (2020: 3%) in years 2 to 10 having been assumed as the long-term volume decline is more than offset by pricing to drive revenue growth. A 10-year horizon is considered appropriate based on the Group's history of profit and cash growth, its well-balanced portfolio of brands and the industry in which it operates. For recent acquisitions and start-up ventures the detailed financial budget is expanded to reflect the medium-term plan of the country or market management spanning five years or beyond.\n\nAs a result of difficult trading conditions, the above assumptions were amended to reflect the short- to medium-term plans of the country or area management spanning up to a period of five years for the Malaysian, GTR, South African and Peruvian cash-generating units.\n\nHaving recognised an impairment charge in 2020 due to difficult trading conditions in Malaysia (\u00a3197 million), including high incidence of illicit trade and downtrading, the Malaysian CGU assessment was amended to reflect the short- to medium-term country plans. As a result of the assessment, in 2021, no further deterioration in performance was identified requiring further impairment consideration. The Group will continue to monitor Malaysia's performance going forward to identify if any impairment triggers materialise.\n\nDuring 2021, GTR continued to experience difficult trading conditions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, as global travel continued to be significantly constrained. As a result, management prepared forecasted cashflows assuming a phased recovery, alongside maintaining the long-term growth rate at 0%. Following the application of a reasonable range of sensitivities, there was no indication of impairment. For the GTR cash-generating unit headroom to reduce to \u00a3nil, the forecast cash flows would need to reduce by a further 79% in each forecast year or the pre-tax discount rate would need to increase to 29.7%. Management believes that the duty-free business will recover and therefore both scenarios are not considered, at this stage, to be reasonably possible.",

Following the application of a reasonable range of sensitivities, there was no indication of impairment. For the South African cash-generating unit headroom to reduce to \u00a3nil, the forecast cash flows would need to reduce by a further 23% in each forecast year or the pre-tax discount rate would need to increase to 18.9%. Management believes that the post-ban recovery will continue in South Africa and therefore both scenarios are not considered by management, at this stage, to be reasonably possible.\n\nIn Peru, due to continued difficult trading conditions as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the forecasted operating cashflows, the Group had recognised an impairment charge of \u00a354 million in 2021. This partial impairment reduces the carrying value of goodwill to \u00a391 million. Also, in 2021, the Group impaired in full the goodwill of Myanmar resulting in an impairment charge of \u00a33 million.\n\nThe table below shows the headroom and the impairment charge that would be recognised if the assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation were changed:\n\n|                      | Carrying amount of  CGU \u00a3m           | Headroom \u00a3m                          | Increase in discount rate 1 \u00a3m       | Decrease in cash flows 1 \u00a3m          | Increase in terminal value 1 \u00a3m      |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n|                      | Change in headroom/impairment charge | Change in headroom/impairment charge | Change in headroom/impairment charge | Change in headroom/impairment charge | Change in headroom/impairment charge |\n| Cash-generating unit |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |                                      |\n| Peru 1               | 91                                   | -                                    | (14)                                 | (10)                                 | (11)                                 |\n\nNote:\n\nWith the exception of the Peruvian cash-generating unit, following the application of a reasonable range of sensitivities to all the cashgenerating units, and after reflecting the impairments above, there was no indication of any further impairment.\n\nIn 2020, the Group also impaired in full the goodwill arising from the acquisitions of Twisp in South Africa and Blue Nile in Sudan due to difficult trading conditions in these markets. This resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of \u00a311 million and \u00a31 million, respectively.\n\n## (v) Impairment testing - Reynolds American\n\n## Goodwill relating to Reynolds American and the Newport and Camel trademarks\n\nOn 29 April 2021, the FDA reconfirmed its intention to issue a proposed product standard to ban menthol as a characterising flavour in cigarettes. Management notes that the FDA announcement does not itself constitute a ban on menthol in cigarettes, and any proposed regulation of menthol in cigarettes would need to be introduced through the established U.S. comprehensive rule-making process, the timetable and outcome for which was, and remains, uncertain. Management continues to believe that any ban, given the mechanisms and processes required to be followed in the U.S., is unlikely to be implemented within the next five years. In addition, it is unclear how any such potential U.S. regulation might affect the manufacture and marketing of Group combustible brands containing menthol. The base case scenario used in the impairment model therefore does not include any potential impact of changes in regulation in relation to menthol flavourings in combustibles within the five-year discrete forecast period. Any potential impacts have been captured within the terminal growth rate and discount rates applied.\n\nThe Group has a long-standing track record of managing regulatory shifts and, in the event of regulatory change, the Group remains confident in its ability to navigate that environment successfully.\n\nSince 2018, having considered the combination of the risk of implementation and impact of any change in regulations, the Group has not recognised any impairment on either the Newport or Camel brands or the Reynolds American goodwill, as management concluded that there would not be a significant impact to the value-in-use.\n\nThe carrying amounts for Reynolds American goodwill, Newport and Camel brands intangibles were \u00a333,021 million, \u00a329,517 million and \u00a312,485 million, respectively (2020: \u00a332,719 million, \u00a329,248 million and \u00a312,371 million). The value-in-use calculations for brands, as described in note 12(e)(ii) above, have been incorporated in the base case scenario used in the Reynolds American goodwill model. The value-in-use calculations have been prepared based on a five-year cash flow forecast which assumes long-term volume decline of cigarettes. This decline is more than offset by pricing. After this forecast, a growth rate of 1% has been assumed for Reynolds American goodwill, 0.75% for Newport and 0.85% for Camel and a pre-tax discount rate of 8.4% (2020: 7.6%), 9.9% (2020: 8.3%) and 9.4% (2020: 8.3%), respectively.",

For Newport and Camel, the change in revenue assumption is based on the revenue in the five-year forecast reducing by 15.1% and 15.2%, respectively in each year and assumes that other assumptions are not changed.\n\n## (vi) Impairment testing - Canada\n\n## Goodwill relating to Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd (ITCAN)\n\nIn March 2019, ITCAN obtained an Initial Order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice granting it protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). If the CCAA bankruptcy protection were to end, significant liabilities might crystallise. As a consequence, to reflect the risk to future operating cash flows, the value-in-use calculations have been prepared based on a fiveyear cash flow forecast, after which a growth rate of -2.5% and a pre-tax discount rate of 19.3% (2020: 19.1%) have been assumed. Further information on the Quebec Class Actions and CCAA can be found in note 31.\n\nIn addition to the increase in discount rate, a reasonable range of sensitivities was applied to the value-in-use calculation, and there was no indication of impairment.\n\nThe excess of value-in-use earnings over the carrying values (headroom) of the ITCAN goodwill would be reduced to nil if the following individual changes, none of which are considered reasonably possible by management, were made to the key assumptions used in the impairment model. The change in revenue assumption is based on combustibles revenue in the five-year forecast reducing by 27.4% in each year and assumes that other assumptions are not changed.\n\n|                                      | Canada  goodwill  %   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Assumptions                          |                       |\n| Decrease in revenue by               | 27.4                  |\n| Increase in pre-tax discount rate by | 14.7                  |\n\nThe \u00a32,345 million of goodwill relating to ITCAN on the Group's balance sheet at 31 December 2021 will continue to be reviewed on a regular basis. Any future impairment charge would result in a non-cash charge to the income statement that will be treated as an adjusting item.",

(collectively, Organigram). Under the terms of the transaction, a Group subsidiary acquired a 19.9% equity stake in Organigram Holdings Inc. (listed on both the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol 'OGI') to become its largest shareholder.\n\nThe Group's share of the fair value of net assets acquired included \u00a349 million of intangibles and \u00a330 million of goodwill, representing a strategic premium to enter the legal cannabis market in North America.\n\nThe carrying value of the investment at 31 December 2021 is \u00a3125 million, which is higher than the value implied by the market price of individual shares at that date. Due to the likelihood of short-term volatility in the share price, third-party valuations were considered which indicate a valuation for the Group's investment in excess of the current carrying value. Any potential impairment of the investment would be immaterial to the Group. Management will continue to monitor the carrying value, in line with IAS 36, over the course of future periods.\n\n## Tisak d.d.\n\nThe Group's investment in Tisak d.d. (Tisak) was acquired as part of the TDR transaction (note 27). During 2016, the Group entered into an agreement with Tisak's parent Agrokor d.d. (Agrokor) to convert certain outstanding trading balances into long-term loans and an additional shareholding in Tisak. As part of the agreement, Agrokor had the right to reacquire the additional shareholding in Tisak. As a consequence of this, while the Group had legal ownership of the additional shareholding, it did not consider that the shares provided any additional equity interest and continued to account for 26% of the equity of Tisak. In 2017, due to the financial difficulties of Agrokor and Tisak, the Group fully impaired this investment resulting in a charge of \u00a327 million to the income statement in that year that was reported as an adjusting item. In July 2018, Agrokor's creditors approved a settlement plan proposed by Agrokor's administrators. The settlement plan has not returned any value to the Group, and Tisak was liquidated on 21 September 2021.",

Together, schemes in these territories account for over 90% of the total underlying obligations of the Group's defined benefit arrangements and over 70% of the defined benefit net costs charged to adjusted profit.\n\nPension obligations consist mainly of final salary pension schemes which provide benefits to members in the form of a guaranteed level of pension payable for life. The level of benefits provided depends on members' length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement. In addition, the Group operates several healthcare benefit schemes, of which the most significant are in the U.S. and Canada. The majority of defined benefit schemes allow for the future accrual of benefits. With the exception of arrangements required under local regulations, most of the Group's arrangements are closed to new entrants.\n\nBenefits provided through defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as payments fall due. The liabilities arising in respect of defined benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit credit method. It is Group policy that all schemes are formally valued at least every three years.\n\nThrough its defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare benefit schemes, the Group is exposed to a number of risks, including:\n\n- -Asset volatility: The scheme liabilities are calculated using discount rates set by reference to bond yields. If scheme assets underperform this yield, e.g. due to stock market volatility, this will create a deficit. However, most funded schemes hold a proportion of assets which are expected to outperform bonds in the long term, and the majority of schemes by value are subject to local regulation regarding funding deficits.\n- -Changes in bond yields: A decrease in corporate bond yields will increase scheme liabilities, although this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings, 'buy-in' insurance assets or other hedging instruments.\n- -Inflation risk: Some of the Group's pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities, although in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place in the scheme rules, while some assets and derivatives provide specific inflation protection.\n- -Life expectancy: The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the plans' liabilities. Assumptions regarding mortality and mortality improvements are regularly reviewed in line with actuarial tables and scheme specific experience.\n\nThe Group has an internal body, the Pensions Executive Committee (PEC), that is chaired by the Finance and Transformation Director. The PEC sets and oversees a set of philosophies, policies and practices in respect of post-employment benefits including, but not limited to, design, funding, investment strategy, risk management and governance. It also reviews significant changes to defined benefit schemes in the countries with the most significant liabilities, and defined contribution schemes in the countries with the most significant costs. Significant changes to defined benefit arrangements include scheme closures to future accrual and risk management exercises such as the 'buy-in' and 'buy-out' transactions referred to below.\n\nA 'buy-out' transaction is where a pension scheme derecognises all (or part) of its liabilities, removing it from the balance sheet, by permanently transferring those obligations from the sponsoring employer to a third-party provider and eliminating all further legal or constructive obligation to the pension scheme or to the sponsoring employer. By contrast, with a 'buy-in' transaction the scheme liabilities remain on the balance sheet and the sponsoring employer remains responsible for the fulfilment of the pension obligations. However, these obligations are de-risked through the purchase of an insurance product designed to match the underlying cash flows of the pension liability reducing the risks associated with improved longevity and interest and discount rate movements. The Group consequently benefits from the 'buy-in' as it reduces the individual scheme's reliance on the Group for future cash funding requirements.",

        "page_content": "## 15 Retirement Benefit Schemes Continued\n\nAll of the Group's arrangements, including funded schemes where formal trusts or equivalents are required, have been developed and are operated in accordance with local practices and regulations where applicable in the countries concerned. Responsibility for the governance of these schemes, including specific investment decisions and funding contribution schedules, generally lies with the trustees, or equivalent bodies, of each arrangement. The trustees will usually consist of representatives appointed by both the sponsoring company and the beneficiaries.\n\nThe funded arrangements in the Group have policies on investment management, including strategies over a preferred long-term investment profile, and schemes in certain territories including Canada and the Netherlands manage their bond portfolios to match the weighted average duration of scheme liabilities. In addition, as noted below, certain arrangements in the UK and Canada have been de-risked through the purchase of insurance policies. The majority of funded schemes are subject to local regulations regarding funding requirements. Contributions to defined benefit schemes are determined after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded schemes, and after taking into account regulatory requirements in each territory. The Group's contributions to funded defined benefit schemes in 2022 in total are expected to be \u00a383 million compared to \u00a374 million in 2021.\n\n## U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., the main funded pension plans are the Reynolds American Retirement Plan (PEP) and the Retirement Income Plan for Certain RAI Affiliates (Affiliates), and the only funded healthcare scheme is the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation Welfare & Fringe Benefit Plan , all of which are established with corporate trustees that are required to run the plans in accordance with the plan's rules and to comply with all relevant legislation, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n\nThe corporate trustees act as custodians with a committee of local management acting in a fiduciary capacity with regard to investment decisions, risk mitigation and administration of the arrangements. Contributions to the various funded plans are agreed with the named fiduciary, scheme actuaries and the committee of local management after taking account of statutory requirements including the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended. Through its U.S. subsidiaries, the Group may make significant contributions, either as required by statutory requirements or at the discretion of the Group, with the aim of maintaining a funding status of at least 90% and remaining fully funded in the long term. During 2021, the Group did not contribute to its funded pension and post-retirement plans in the U.S. and does not expect to do so in 2022.\n\nFor funded plans in the U.S., the trustees employ a risk mitigation strategy which seeks to balance pension plan returns with a reasonable level of funded status volatility. Based on this framework, the asset allocation has two primary components. The first component is the hedging portfolio, which uses extended duration fixed income holdings (typically U.S. Government and investment grade corporate bonds) and, to a lesser extent, derivatives to match a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the benefit obligations, thereby reducing expected funded status volatility. The second component is the return-seeking portfolio, which is designed to enhance portfolio returns. The return-seeking portfolio is broadly diversified across asset classes.\n\nOn 7 October 2021, the Group concluded a transaction affecting portions of the membership of the PEP and the Affiliates plans referred to above, allowing the Group to fully settle portions of its liability by transferring the obligations to the Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company in a buy-out. Approximately US$1.9 billion (\u00a31.4 billion) of plan liabilities have been removed from the balance sheet, resulting in a settlement gain of \u00a335 million.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the PEP and Affiliates plans referred to above were reporting surpluses under IAS 19 totalling \u00a3463 million (2020: \u00a3232 million). Under the rules of these plans, after assuming the gradual settlement of the plan liabilities over the lives of the arrangements, any surplus would be returnable to the Group in the event of a termination or could otherwise be repurposed for other existing or replacement benefit plans, and accordingly, no surplus restrictions have been recognised.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nIn the UK, the main pension arrangement is the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund (UKPF), which is established under trust law and has a corporate trustee that is required to run the scheme in accordance with the UKPF's Trust Deed and Rules and to comply with the Pension Scheme Act 1993, Pensions Act 1995, Pensions Act 2004 and all other relevant legislation. With effect from 1 July 2020, UKPF was closed to further accrual of benefits with all active members becoming deferred members. A past service credit was recognised on the difference between the salary increase assumption for active members and the inflation assumption for deferred members at the date of the plan amendment and curtailment of benefits.\n\nThe formal triennial actuarial valuation of the UKPF was last carried out with an effective date of 31 March 2020. This showed that UKPF had a surplus of \u00a3139 million on a Technical Provisions basis, in accordance with the statutory funding objective. The Trustee also has a Long-Term Funding Target to be fully funded on a Solvency Liabilities basis by 2026, and on this basis UKPF had a surplus of \u00a37 million at the valuation date. Under IAS 19, this was reported as a net retirement benefit asset of \u00a3293 million (2020: \u00a3389 million).\n\nFollowing the completion of the valuation noted above, the Trustee and the Group agreed a new Schedule of Contributions with an effective date of 5 October 2020. This schedule was subsequently replaced with a new Schedule with an effective date of 30 March 2021, such that the Group made no contributions in 2021 but is committed to pay \u00a318 million in July 2022 and \u00a318 million in July 2023 as contributions towards further de-risking of UKPF's assets and securing members' benefits. Contributions were \u00a321 million in 2020 and \u00a330 million in 2019.\n\nUnder the UKPF scheme rules, the Trustee does not have a unilateral power to commence a wind up of UKPF, and the Group has recognised a surplus as an unconditional right to a refund assuming the gradual settlement of the UKPF liabilities over the life of the scheme with any future surplus returnable to the Group at the end of the life of the scheme. The funding commitment is not considered onerous and no additional liabilities or surplus restrictions have been recognised.",

On an IAS 19 basis, the subsequent fair value of the insurance policy matches the present value of the liabilities being insured. On 19 May 2021, the Trustee entered into an agreement with PIC to acquire a second buy-in policy which involved the transfer of \u00a3383 million of assets held by UKPF to PIC. As a result of these transactions, approximately 84% of the assets held by UKPF (2020: 75%) are represented by the buy-in contracts, covering 91% of UKPF's liabilities (2020: 83%).\n\nFor the residual assets held by UKPF, the current allocation is broadly split as 75% in risk reducing assets and 25% in return seeking assets. The return seeking portfolio is invested in illiquid assets which, in the normal course of events, will wind down naturally over time, with their value being realised as the investments mature. This is consistent with the Trustee's ultimate target which is to be 100% invested in risk reducing assets or matching assets. Given the strong funding position of UKPF as shown in the 31 March 2020 Actuarial valuation, the Trustee will continue to review the investment strategy and may look to increase the proportion of risk-reducing or matching assets, commensurate with their ultimate target to further reduce UKPF's exposure to asset volatility.\n\n## Other territories\n\nPayments made to pensioners by the operating companies in Germany, net of income on scheme assets, are deemed to be company contributions to the Contractual Trust Arrangements and are anticipated to be around \u00a337 million in 2022 and \u00a333 million per annum for the four years after that. Contributions to pension schemes in Canada, Netherlands and Switzerland in total are anticipated to be around \u00a311 million in 2022 and then also around \u00a311 million per annum for the four years after that.\n\nFor schemes in the Netherlands reporting surpluses of \u00a377 million (2020: \u00a326 million), these surpluses have been recognised as an unconditional right to a refund assuming the gradual settlement of the pension liabilities over the life of the scheme, with any future surplus returnable to the Group at the end of the life of the scheme. For schemes in surplus in Canada of \u00a327 million (2020: \u00a319 million), the economic benefit has been calculated as a combination of the expected level of administration expenses which may be charged to the plan assets in accordance with the plan rules, which economically represents a potential surplus refund, and the value of the employer reserve account as defined in legislation, which represents a potential reduction in contributions on an ongoing basis or a surplus refund at the end of the life of the scheme.\n\nOn 2 September 2021, the Group through its Canadian subsidiaries entered into a buy-in agreement with five insurers to acquire insurance policies that operate as assets of its largest Canadian scheme, the Imasco Pension Fund Society Plan (Society Plan), by transferring plan assets of CAD $766 million (\u00a3451 million). The transaction was met entirely from the pension plan assets with no further funding required from the Group. The buy-in covered all the Society Plan's liabilities in relation to pensioners and deferred members as well as the pensions accrued up to 31 December 2020 for active members. The Group consequently benefits from the buy-in as it reduces the Society Plan's reliance on the Group for future cash funding requirements. For the residual assets, the Society Plan is 100% invested in risk reducing assets, consistent with the Canadian subsidiary's ultimate de-risking target.\n\n## Unfunded arrangements\n\nThe majority of benefit payments are from trustee administered funds, however, there are also a number of unfunded schemes where the sponsoring company meets the benefit payment obligation as it falls due, including UK-based Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution Unapproved Unfunded Retirement Benefit Schemes (DB UURBS and DC UURBS respectively). The DC UURBS credits accrued in the year are increased in line with the Company's Weighted Average Cost of Debt and the scheme is therefore treated as a defined benefit scheme under IAS 19. For unfunded pension schemes in the U.S. and UK, 38% of the liabilities reported at year-end are expected to be settled by the Group within 10 years, 28% between 10 and 20 years, 19% between 20 and 30 years, and 15% thereafter. For unfunded healthcare schemes in the U.S. and Canada, 63% of the liabilities reported at year-end are expected to be settled by the Group within 10 years, 27% between 10 and 20 years, 8% between 20 and 30 years, and 2% thereafter.\n\nThe amounts recognised in the balance sheet are determined as follows:\n\n|                                                                                | Pension schemes                                                                | Pension schemes                                                                | Healthcare schemes                                                             | Healthcare schemes                                                             | Total                                                                          | Total                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                | 2021 \u00a3m                                                                        | 2020 \u00a3m                                                                        | 2021 \u00a3m                                                                        | 2020 \u00a3m                                                                        | 2021 \u00a3m                                                                        | 2020 \u00a3m                                                                        |\n| Present value of funded scheme liabilities                                     | (9,859)                                                                        | (11,970)                                                                       | (225)                                                                          | (253)                                                                          | (10,084)                                                                       | (12,223)                                                                       |\n| Fair value of funded scheme assets                                             | 10,644                                                                         | 12,403                                                                         | 172                                                                            | 173                                                                            | 10,816                                                                         | 12,576                                                                         |\n|                                                                                | 785                                                                            | 433                                                                            | (53)                                                                           | (80)                                                                           | 732                                                                            | 353                                                                            |\n| Unrecognised funded scheme surpluses                                           | (16)                                                                           | (16)                                                                           | -

Other assets include insurance contracts, cash and other deposits, derivatives and other hedges, recoverable taxes, infrastructure investments and investment property.\n\nIn the U.S., pension plan assets are invested using active investment strategies and multiple investment management firms. Managers within each asset class cover a range of investment styles and approaches. Allowable investment types include global equity, fixed income, real assets, private equity and absolute return. The range of allowable investment types utilised for pension assets provides enhanced returns and more widely diversifies the plan.\n\nAs noted above, during 2021 and 2019, the UKPF Trustee acquired insurance policies that operate as a UK Fund investment asset in a buy-in transaction. The residual assets now predominantly consist of liability driven investments and absolute return funds as well as a proportion of illiquid investments, such as private equity and infrastructure investments. Insurance policies acquired in buy-in transactions in the UK and Canada are included within 'other assets-unlisted' in the table above.",

The fair value of buy-in insurance products was estimated as the present value of the underlying obligations covered by the insurance policy. The fair values of other unlisted assets were derived from cash flow projections of estimated future income after taking into account the estimated recoverable value of these assets.\n\nThe recognition of retirement benefit surpluses on the balance sheet is restricted where the economic benefit, in the form of a potential refund or reduction in future contributions, has a present value which is less than the net assets of the scheme. The movements in the unrecognised scheme surpluses, recognised in other comprehensive income, are as follows:\n\nPension schemes\n\nHealthcare schemes\n\nTotal\n\n|                                                      | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   | 2019 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Unrecognised funded scheme  surpluses at 1 January   | (16)      | (28)      | (20)      | -         | -         | -         | (16)      | (28)      | (20)      |\n| Differences on exchange                              | 2         | 3         | (1)       | -         | -         | -         | 2         | 3         | (1)       |\n| Interest on unrecognised funded  scheme surpluses    | (1)       | (1)       | -         | -         | -         | -         | (1)       | (1)       | -         |\n| Movement in year (note 22)                           | (1)       | 10        | (7)       | -         | -         | -         | (1)       | 10        | (7)       |\n| Unrecognised funded scheme  surpluses at 31 December | (16)      | (16)      | (28)      | -         | -         | -         | (16)      | (16)      | (28)      |\n\nThe principal actuarial assumptions (weighted to reflect individual scheme differences) used in the following territories are shown below.

Pension increases, where allowed for, are generally assumed to be in line with inflation. Assumptions of life expectancy are in line with best practice in each territory. For countries where there is not a deep market in such corporate bonds, the yield on government bonds is used.\n\nThe valuation of retirement benefit schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events. Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 December 2021 are set out below. These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions such as salary increases. While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation, while asset values also change, and the impacts may offset to some extent.\n\n|                                                                     | 1 year increase \u00a3m   | 1 year decrease \u00a3m   | 0.25 percentage  point  increase \u00a3m   | 0.25 percentage  point  decrease \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Average life expectancy - increase/(decrease) of scheme liabilities | 271                  | (267)                |                                       |                                       |\n| Rate of inflation - increase/(decrease) of scheme liabilities       |                      |                      | 182                                   | (175)                                 |\n| Discount rate - (decrease)/increase of scheme liabilities           |                      |                      | (327)                                 | 346                                   |\n\nA one percentage point increase in healthcare inflation would increase healthcare scheme liabilities by \u00a333 million, and a one percentage point decrease would decrease liabilities by \u00a325 million.

No amount of deferred tax has been recognised in respect of these unused tax credits.\n\nAt the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of undistributed earnings of subsidiaries which would be subject to dividend withholding tax and for which no withholding tax liability has been recognised was \u00a30.9 billion (2020: \u00a30.6 billion).",

In certain countries, however, the Group has entered into factoring arrangements and periodically sells certain trade receivables to banks and other financial institutions, without recourse, for cash. These trade receivables have been derecognised from the statement of financial position to reflect the transfer by the Group of substantially all of the risks and rewards of the receivables, including credit risk. Consequently, the cash inflows have been recognised within operating cash flows. Typically in these arrangements, the Group also acts as a collection agent for the bank. At 31 December 2021, the value of trade receivables derecognised through the factoring arrangements where the Group acts as a collection agent was \u00a3562 million (2020: \u00a3600 million) and where the Group does not act as a collection agent was \u00a38 million (2020: \u00a325 million). Included in trade receivables above is \u00a3110 million (2020: \u00a3205 million) of trade debtor balances which were available for factoring under these arrangements. In addition, the Group participates in certain supply chain finance programmes utilised by our customers allowing us to receive payment for invoices earlier than the agreed due date at a discounted value. At 31 December 2021, the value of trade receivables derecognised through these arrangements was \u00a3171 million (2020: \u00a3131 million).\n\nIncluded in loans and other receivables are \u00a384 million of litigation related deposits (2020: \u00a378 million). Management has determined that these payments represent a resource controlled by the entity, as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity either by being recoverable on conclusion of ongoing appeal processes or by reducing amounts potentially payable should the appeal process fail. These deposits are held at the fair value of consideration transferred less impairment, if applicable. The effect of discounting would be immaterial.\n\nAlso included in loans and other receivables are deposits that do not meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents as well as loans provided to farmers. The cash flows arising from these transactions are included in investing activities and have been reconciled to the cash flow statement in note 18.\n\nPrepayments and accrued income include \u00a324 million (2020: \u00a38 million) of accrued income primarily in relation to rebates.\n\nAmounts receivable from related parties including associated undertakings are shown in note 30.",

Allowances in respect of loans and other receivables are initially recognised at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. Allowances are measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses where the credit risk on the receivables increases significantly after initial recognition.\n\nThe Group holds bank guarantees, other guarantees and credit insurance in respect of some of the past due debtor balances.\n\nTrade and other receivables are predominantly denominated in the functional currencies of subsidiary undertakings apart from the following: U.S. dollar: 2.2% (2020: 2.6%), UK sterling: 0.1% (2020: 0.1%), Euro: 3.6% (2020: 0.4%) and other currencies: 0.9% (2020: 1.7%).\n\nThere is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value due to the short-term duration of the majority of trade and other receivables as determined using discounted cash flow analysis. There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of internationally dispersed customers.",

Investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) include equity investments in various start-up businesses which are held for their strategic value.\n\nInvestments held at fair value through profit and loss above include restricted amounts of \u00a3351 million (2020: \u00a3115 million) due to investments held by subsidiaries in CCAA protection (note 32), as well as \u00a361 million (2020: \u00a397 million) subject to potential exchange control restrictions.\n\nIn 2021, as part of the disposal of the Group's operations in Iran (note 27(d)), a provision of \u00a324 million (2020: \u00a3nil) against non-current investments held at fair value was charged to net finance costs as recoverability of these funds is not certain.\n\nInvestments held at fair value are predominantly denominated in the functional currencies of subsidiary undertakings with less than 4% in other currencies (2020: less than 2% in other currencies).\n\nThe classification of these investments under the IFRS 13 Fair value measurement fair value hierarchy is given in note 26.\n\nThere is no material difference between the investments held at fair value and their gross contractual values.\n\nBelow is a reconciliation of the fair value investments cash flows to the cash flow statement - investing activities:\n\n|                                                        | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash outflow from investments held at fair value       | 345       | 248       |\n| Cash outflow from loans and other receivables          | 24        | 95        |\n| Cash outflows from investments per cash flow statement | 369       | 343       |\n| Cash inflow from investments held at fair value        | (98)      | (111)     |\n| Cash inflow from loans and other receivables           | (43)      | (73)      |\n| Cash inflows from investments per cash flow statement  | (141)     | (184)     |",

In the absence of sufficient market data, fair values would be based on the quoted market price of similar derivatives. The classification of these derivative assets and liabilities under the IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy is given in note 26.\n\n|                                      | 2021      | 2021           | 2020      | 2020           |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|\n|                                      | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m | Assets \u00a3m | Liabilities \u00a3m |\n| Fair value hedges                    |           |                |           |                |\n| - interest rate swaps                | 5         | 2              | 20        | -              |\n| - cross-currency swaps               | 114       | -              | 255       | -              |\n| Cash flow hedges                     |           |                |           |                |\n| - cross-currency swaps               | 107       | 35             | 189       | -              |\n| - forward foreign currency contracts | 81        | 35             | 62        | 100            |\n| Net investment hedges                |           |                |           |                |\n| - forward foreign currency contracts | 62        | 81             | 211       | 43             |\n| Held-for-trading*                    |           |                |           |                |\n| - interest rate swaps                | 28        | 34             | 45        | 53             |\n| - forward foreign currency contracts | 28        | 127            | 15        | 123            |\n| Total                                | 425       | 314            | 797       | 319            |\n| Current                              | 182       | 235            | 430       | 278            |\n| Non-current                          | 243       | 79             | 367       | 41             |\n|                                      | 425       | 314            | 797       | 319            |\n| Derivatives                          |           |                |           |                |\n| - in respect of net debt**           | 273       | 182            | 518       | 172            |\n| - other                              | 152       | 132            | 279       | 147            |\n|                                      | 425       | 314            | 797       | 319            |\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the timing of expected cash flows is as follows: assets of \u00a3188 million (2020: \u00a3251 million) of which \u00a378 million (2020: \u00a398 million) is expected within one year and \u00a3107 million (2020: \u00a3143 million) beyond five years and liabilities of \u00a370 million (2020: \u00a3100 million) of which \u00a333 million (2020: \u00a394 million) is expected within one year and \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a3nil) beyond five years.\n\nThe Group's cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments. A certain number of forward foreign currency contracts were used to manage the currency profile of external borrowings and are reflected in the currency table in note 23. Interest rate swaps have been used to manage the interest rate profile of external borrowings and are reflected in the re-pricing table in note 23.",

All ordinary shares rank equally with regard to participation in dividends and to share in the proceeds of the Company's residual assets upon a winding up of the Company. Shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, declare final dividends, but not in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors. Holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights.\n\nOn a show of hands every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting is entitled to one vote regardless of the number of shares held by the shareholder, unless a poll is demanded. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share held by the shareholder. The Company's Annual General Meeting voting is undertaken by way of a poll.\n\nAll rights attached to the Company's shares held by the Group as treasury shares are suspended until those shares are reissued.\n\n## (b) Share premium account, capital redemption reserves and merger reserves comprise:\n\nShare\n\n|                  |   premium account \u00a3m |   redemption reserves \u00a3m | Merger reserves \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| 31 December 2021 |                  107 |                      101 | 26,414               | 26,622     |\n| 31 December 2020 |                  103 |                      101 | 26,414               | 26,618     |\n| 31 December 2019 |                   94 |                      101 | 26,414               | 26,609     |\n\nCapital\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe share premium account includes the difference between the value of shares issued and their nominal value. The share premium increase includes \u00a3nil (2020: \u00a32 million; 2019: \u00a33 million) in respect of ordinary shares issued under the Company's share option schemes. A further \u00a34 million (2020: \u00a37 million; 2019: \u00a3nil) increase in share premium is related to shares repurchased and not cancelled that have been transferred from the Company to other Group undertakings, to be granted to certain employees on vesting of awards, and represents the excess of transfer price of the share over the original weighted average cost of shares.\n\n## Capital redemption account\n\nOn the purchase of own shares as part of the share buy-back programme for shares which are cancelled, a transfer is made from retained earnings to the capital redemption reserve equivalent to the nominal value of shares purchased. Purchased shares which are not cancelled are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.\n\n## Merger reserve account\n\nThe merger reserve comprises:\n\n- a.  In 1999, shares were issued for the acquisition of the Rothmans International B.V. Group and the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of \u00a33,748 million was credited to merger reserves; and\n- b.  On 25 July 2017, the Group announced the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 57.8% of RAI not already owned by the Group. Shares were issued for the acquisition and the difference between the fair value of shares issued and their nominal value of \u00a322,666 million was credited to merger reserves.",

Translation reserve:\n\nThe translation reserve is explained in the accounting policy on foreign currencies in note 1.\n\nIn 2021, included within the differences on exchange from translation of foreign operations is \u00a3291 million which has been reclassified from reserves to the income statement and recognised in other operating expenses as an adjusting item. The \u00a3291 million comprises \u00a3272 million in respect of the disposal of BAT Pars (note 27(d)) and \u00a319 million from the Group exiting certain countries. As a result of Quantum initiatives, the Group has withdrawn its operations from Myanmar and, in certain countries, the Group has moved to above market business models utilising local distributors as importers. As a consequence, with the cessation of a physical presence in these markets, foreign exchange previously recognised in other comprehensive income for these countries has been reclassified to the income statement.\n\nAs detailed in note 14, as a result of the liquidation of Tisak d.d., the Group reclassified to the income statement the foreign exchange previously recognised in associates other comprehensive income. This resulted in a credit of \u00a32 million to the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 22 Capital and Reserves Continued\n\n## ii. Hedging reserve:\n\nThe hedging reserve is explained in the accounting policy on financial instruments in note 1.\n\nOf the amounts reclassified from the hedging reserve and reported in profit for the year, a loss of \u00a329 million (2020: \u00a316 million gain; 2019: \u00a312 million gain) and a gain of \u00a36 million (2020: \u00a319 million gain; 2019: \u00a33 million gain) were reported within revenue and raw materials and consumables, respectively, together with a loss of \u00a34 million (2020: \u00a32 million loss; 2019: \u00a311 million gain) reported in other operating expenses, and a gain of \u00a359 million (2020: \u00a357 million gain; 2019: \u00a327 million gain) reported within net finance costs.\n\nThe Group hedges certain foreign currency denominated borrowings with cross-currency interest rate swaps. As permitted by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments , the foreign currency basis spreads have been separated from the hedging instrument and are recognised in reserves as a 'cost of hedging' and are reclassified to the income statement in the same period in which profit and loss is affected by the hedged expected cashflows as a component of the associated interest expense. The basis spreads are disclosed within hedging reserves as they are not material. Included within the balance of hedging reserves at 31 December 2021 is an accumulated gain of \u00a34 million (2020: \u00a39 million; 2019: \u00a314 million) in respect of the cost of hedging.\n\n## iii. Fair value reserve:\n\nThe fair value reserve is explained in the accounting policy on financial instruments in note 1. Fair value gains and losses arising from investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in this reserve.\n\n## iv. Revaluation reserve:\n\nThe revaluation reserve relates to the acquisition of the cigarette and snus business of ST in 2008.\n\n## v. Other reserves:\n\nOther reserves comprise:\n\n- (a)  \u00a3483 million which arose in 1998 from merger accounting in a Scheme of Arrangement and Reconstruction whereby British American Tobacco p.l.c. acquired the entire share capital of B.A.T Industries p.l.c. and the share capital of that company's principal financial services subsidiaries was distributed, so effectively demerging them; and\n- (b)  In the 1999 Rothmans transaction, convertible redeemable preference shares were issued as part of the consideration. The discount on these shares was amortised by crediting other reserves and charging retained earnings. The \u00a390 million balance in other reserves comprises the accumulated balance in respect of the preference shares converted during 2004.\n\n## vi. Treasury shares:\n\nTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent is stated after deducting the cost of treasury shares which include \u00a34,823 million (2020: \u00a34,836 million; 2019: \u00a34,845 million) for shares repurchased and not cancelled and \u00a3299 million (2020: \u00a3314 million; 2019: \u00a3416 million) in respect of the cost of own shares held in employee share ownership trusts. The reduction in the shares repurchased and not cancelled is primarily due to shares reissued to satisfy the vesting of U.S. share options.\n\nThe previous share buy-back programme was suspended from 30 July 2014. As at 31 December 2021, treasury shares include 6,269,959 (2020: 6,053,158; 2019: 8,275,677) shares held in trust and 161,930,217 (2020: 162,347,246; 2019: 162,645,590) shares repurchased and not cancelled as part of the Company's share buy-back programme. From March 2020, the Company has utilised shares acquired in the share buy-back programme to satisfy shared-based payment awards made to certain employees. On 10 February 2022, the Board approved a proposed \u00a32 billion share repurchase programme for 2022.\n\n## (d) Perpetual hybrid bonds\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Group issued two \u20ac1 billion perpetual hybrid bonds amounting to \u00a31,703 million, which have been classified as equity. Issuance costs of these bonds, amounting to \u20ac26 million (\u00a322 million), have been recognised within equity.\n\nThese bonds include redemption options exercisable at the Group's discretion from September 2026 to December 2026 (the 3% perpetual hybrid bond) and June 2029 to September 2029 (the 3.75% perpetual hybrid bond), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue.\n\nThe coupons associated with these perpetual hybrid bonds are fixed at 3% until 2026 and 3.75% until 2029, respectively, and would reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. The bonds are perpetual in nature and do not have maturity dates for the repayment of principal. The contractual terms of the perpetual hybrid bonds allow the Group to defer coupon payments, however certain contingent events could trigger mandatory payments of such deferred coupons, including the payment of dividends on and the repurchase of ordinary shares, subject to certain exceptions in each case. The full terms and conditions of such events can be found in the prospectus dated 27 September 2021 which is available under the debt facilities section of the Group's debt microsite (bat.com/debt). As the Group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these bonds, they are classified as equity instruments in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nDuring the year, the Group did not defer any eligible coupon payments and in December 2021 paid a coupon of \u00a36 million on the 3% December 2026 bond which has been recognised within equity. The fair value of these bonds at 31 December 2021 is \u00a31,651 million.\n\n## (e) Non-controlling interests\n\nMovements in non-controlling interests primarily relate to profit for the year and dividends (reported as a movement in retained earnings) and differences on exchange arising from the translation into sterling (reported as a movement in other reserves). Information on subsidiaries with material non-controlling interests is provided in note 32.",

The total dividends recognised as an appropriation from reserves in 2021 was \u00a34,904 million (2020: \u00a34,747 million).\n\nThe Board has declared an interim dividend of 217.8p per ordinary share of 25p, for the year ended 31 December 2021, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 54.45p per ordinary share in May 2022, August 2022, November 2022 and February 2023. These payments will be recognised as appropriations from reserves in 2022 and 2023.

The principal restructuring activities in 2021 and 2020 are as described in note 7 and primarily include the cost of employee packages and long-term social plans associated with redundancy programmes from previous years. Provisions associated with redundancy packages are determined based on termination packages offered in each country. The long-term social plans primarily relate to social plans in Germany, which span over several years and are based on actuarial calculations. These are discounted to present value using Central Bank rates. We do not consider the effect of discounting to be material. While some elements of the non-current provisions of \u00a356 million will unwind over several years, as termination payments are made over extended periods in some countries, it is estimated that approximately 97% of these non-current provisions will unwind within five years.\n\nEmployee-related benefits mainly relate to employee benefits other than post-employment benefits. The principal components of these provisions are gratuity and termination awards, 'jubilee' payments due after a certain service period and expected payments associated with long-term disability. The majority of these provisions are calculated by actuaries. It is estimated that approximately 84% of the noncurrent provisions of \u00a327 million will unwind within five years.\n\nA provision of \u00a3274 million was made in 2011 for a potential claim under a 1998 settlement agreement entered into by a Group subsidiary in respect of the clean-up of sediment in the Fox River. On 30 September 2014, the Group, NCR, Appvion and Windward Prospects entered into a funding agreement; the details of this agreement are explained in note 31. This agreement led to payments of \u00a32 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a32 million). In addition, the Group incurred legal costs of \u00a36 million (2020: \u00a31 million), which were also charged against the provision. It is expected that the non-current provision will unwind within five years.",

The nature of the amounts provided in respect of disputes is such that the extent and timing of cash flows are difficult to estimate and the ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided. Other provisions also include a provision for interest of \u00a3150 million in relation to the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation Order (FII GLO), as mentioned in notes 8(b) and 10(b). The provision is calculated based on the UK central bank base rate plus 2% and has been charged to net finance costs. As there is uncertainty over the potential timing of the utilisation, as explained in note 10(b), the provision has been reported as a non-current provision.\n\nIn 2020, the Group recognised a provision of US$272 million (\u00a3212 million) in relation to the ITG Brands, LLC MSA litigation agreements with the States of Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi which was utilised in 2021. Further details are provided in note 31.\n\nOn 1 March 2019, the Quebec Court of Appeal in Montreal upheld the Superior Court's decision of May 2015 (reducing ITCAN's share of the judgment due to a change in interest computation to a maximum of CAD$9.2 billion). The Court of Appeal also upheld the previously stated requirements for the defendants to deposit CAD$1.1 billion into an escrow account. The Board of Directors of ITCAN reassessed the recoverability of the litigation related deposit and, accordingly, the Group recognised a charge against the income statement of CAD$758 million (\u00a3436 million) in 2019, reflecting the amount of the judgment that is considered to be probable and estimable in line with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . Consequently, the Group utilised the litigation related deposit which was shown as a receivable at 31 December 2018 (within trade and other receivables) against the current estimate of the liability and both the provision and litigation related deposit were reduced accordingly. Further details are provided in note 31.\n\nIn 2019, the Group recognised a provision of \u00a3252 million in relation to the Russia excise dispute. The provision was utilised in January 2020, when the tax claim was paid.\n\n## 25 Trade and Other Payables\n\n2021\n\n|                                     | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Trade payables                      | 3,923  | 3,722  |\n| Duty, excise and other taxes        | 3,148  | 3,410  |\n| Accrued charges and deferred income | 2,095  | 2,228  |\n| FII GLO (note 10(b))                | 963    | 963    |\n| Social security and other taxation  | 55     | 53     |\n| Sundry payables                     | 375    | 381    |\n|                                     | 10,559 | 10,757 |\n| Current                             | 9,577  | 9,693  |\n| Non-current                         | 982    | 1,064  |\n|                                     | 10,559 | 10,757 |\n\n2020\n\nAs explained in note 17, the Group acts as a collection agent for banks and other financial institutions in certain debt factoring arrangements. The cash collected in respect of these arrangements that has not yet been remitted amounts to \u00a3137 million (2020: \u00a3128 million) and is included in sundry payables.\n\nIn addition, the Group has certain Supply Chain Financing (SCF) or 'reverse factoring' arrangements in place. The principal purpose of these arrangements is to provide the supplier with the option to access liquidity earlier through the sale of its receivables due from the Group to a bank or other financial institution prior to their due date. Management has determined that the Group's payables to these suppliers have neither been extinguished nor have the liabilities been significantly modified by these arrangements. The value of amounts payable, invoice due dates and other terms and conditions applicable, from the Group's perspective, remain unaltered, with only the ultimate payee being changed. At 31 December 2021, the value of amounts payable under the SCF programmes was \u00a3251 million (2020: \u00a348 million). The cash outflows in respect of these arrangements have been recognised within operating cash flows. Included in this amount is \u00a3156 million of leaf payables where the standard payment terms with the vendor is 150 days, consistent with credit terms normally available in certain markets.\n\nAccrued charges and deferred income include \u00a31 million of deferred income (2020: \u00a3nil) and \u00a358 million (2020: \u00a355 million) in respect of interest payable mainly related to tax matters. FII GLO of \u00a3963 million relates to receipts in 2015, in respect of the Franked Investment Income Government Litigation Order (note 10(b)). Amounts payable to related parties including associated undertakings are shown in note 30.\n\nThere is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other payables and their fair value due to the short-term duration of the majority of trade and other payables, as determined using discounted cash flow analysis.\n\nTrade and other payables are predominantly denominated in the functional currencies of subsidiary undertakings with less than 6% in other currencies (2020: less than 5% in other currencies).",

        "page_content": "## 26 Financial Instruments and Risk Management\n\n## Management of financial risks\n\nOne of the principal responsibilities of Treasury is to manage the financial risks arising from the Group's underlying operations. Specifically, Treasury manages, within an overall policy framework set by the Group's Main Board and Corporate Finance Committee (CFC), the Group's exposure to funding and liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty risks. The Group's treasury position is monitored by the CFC which meets regularly throughout the year and is chaired by the Group Finance Director. The approach is one of risk reduction within an overall framework of delivering total shareholder return.\n\nThe Group defines capital as net debt (note 23) and equity (note 22). There are no externally imposed capital requirements for the Group. Group policies include a set of financing principles that provide a framework within which the Group's capital base is managed and, in particular, the policies on dividends (as a percentage of long-term sustainable earnings) and share buyback are decided. The key objective of the financing principles is to appropriately balance the interests of equity and debt holders in driving an efficient financing mix for the Group. The Group's average cost of debt in 2021 is 3.5% (2020: 3.6%).\n\nThe Group manages its financial risks in line with the classification of its financial assets and liabilities in the Group's balance sheet and related notes. The Group's management of specific risks is dealt with as follows:\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nIt is the policy of the Group to maximise financial flexibility and minimise refinancing risk by issuing debt with a range of maturities, generally matching the projected cash flows of the Group and obtaining this financing from a wide range of sources. The Group has a target average centrally managed debt maturity of at least five years with no more than 20% of centrally managed debt maturing in a single rolling year. As at 31 December 2021, the average centrally managed debt maturity was 10.1 years (2020: 9.9 years) and the highest proportion of centrally managed debt maturing in a single rolling year was 18.6.% (2020: 16.4%). Perpetual hybrid bonds are treated as equity (note 22 (d)) and therefore not included within the debt maturity analysis.\n\nThe Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to intercompany loans and borrowings to mobilise cash efficiently within the Group. The key objectives of Treasury in respect of cash and cash equivalents are to protect their principal value, to concentrate cash at the centre, to minimise the required debt issuance and to optimise the yield earned. The amount of debt issued by the Group is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash.\n\nThe Group continues to target a solid investment-grade credit rating. In January 2017, Moody's and S&P revised the Group's rating to Baa2 and BBB+ with stable outlook, respectively, following the announcement of the Reynolds American acquisition. The Group's strategy is to continue deleveraging and is seeking to recover to Baa1/BBB+ in the medium term. The Group is confident of its continued ability to successfully access the debt capital markets for future refinancing requirements.\n\nAs part of its short-term cash management, the Group invests in a range of cash and cash equivalents, including money market funds, which are regarded as highly liquid and are not exposed to significant changes in fair value. These are kept under continuous review as described in the credit risk section below. At 31 December 2021, the Group does not have any investments in money market funds (2020: \u00a3nil).\n\nAs part of its working capital management, in certain countries, the Group has entered into factoring arrangements and supply chain financing arrangements. These are explained in further detail in note 17 and note 25.\n\nSubsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies to predominantly fund short- to mediumterm working capital requirements.\n\n## Available facilities in current year:\n\nIt is Group policy that short-term sources of funds (including drawings under both the Group US$4 billion U.S. commercial paper (U.S. CP) programme and the Group \u00a33 billion euro commercial paper (ECP) programme) are backed by undrawn committed lines of credit and cash. Commercial paper is issued by B.A.T. International Finance p.l.c, B.A.T. Netherlands Finance B.V. and B.A.T Capital Corporation and guaranteed by British American Tobacco p.l.c. At 31 December 2021, commercial paper of \u00a3269 million was outstanding (2020: \u00a3nil). Cashflows relating to commercial paper that have maturity periods of three months or less are presented on a net basis in Group's cash flow statement.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group had access to a \u00a35.85 billion revolving credit facility. This facility was undrawn at 31 December 2021. In 2021, the Group exercised the first of the one-year extension options on both tranches of the revolving credit facility with the second one-year extension subsequently exercised in February 2022. Effective March 2022, therefore, the \u00a32.85 billion 364-day tranche will be extended to March 2023 at the reduced amount of \u00a32.7 billion and \u00a32.5 billion of the five-year tranche will be extended from March 2026 to March 2027 (with \u00a33.0 billion of this tranche remaining available until March 2025 and \u00a32.85 billion remaining available from March 2025 to March 2026).\n\nDuring 2021, the Group extended short-term bilateral facilities totalling \u00a32.5 billion until March or April 2022, some with extension options to extend for further periods. As at 31 December 2021, \u00a3500 million was drawn on a short-term basis. Of such shortterm bilateral facilities, in December 2021, the Group amended and extended a total of \u00a3500 million until December 2022 and subsequent to year end, the Group amended and extended a further \u00a3500 million until January 2023 and effective April 2022, an additional \u00a3350 million was agreed to be extended until October 2022 and \u00a3500 million until April 2023. Cashflows relating to bilateral facilities that have maturity periods of three months or less are presented on a net basis in the Group's cash flow statement.",

As at 31 December 2020, the facility was undrawn.\n\nIn March and April 2020, the Group arranged short-term bilateral facilities with core relationship banks for a total amount of approximately \u00a34.8 billion, strengthening the Group's liquidity position and further mitigating liquidity risks during the COVID-19 crisis. The bilateral facilities have since been reduced to a total amount of approximately \u00a33.4 billion. At 31 December 2020, these facilities were undrawn.\n\n## Issuance, drawdowns and repayments in prior year:\n\n- - In April 2020, the Group accessed the U.S. dollar market under its SEC Shelf Programme, raising a total of US$2.4 billion across three tranches. Additionally, the Group accessed the European market under its EMTN programme, raising a total of \u20ac1.7 billion across two tranches;\n- - In May and June 2020, the Group repaid US$750 million and US$770.8 million bonds at maturity, respectively. Additionally, in June 2020, the Group raised \u00a3500 million in the sterling market under its EMTN Programme;\n- - In July 2020, the Group repaid a \u20ac600 million bond and a \u00a31.9 billion term loan at maturity, and in August 2020, the Group repaid a US$1 billion bond at maturity;\n- - In September 2020, the Group accessed the U.S. dollar market under its SEC Shelf programme, raising a total of US$6.25 billion across five tranches. The Group also made a tender offer to repurchase portions of seven series of bonds prior to their maturities. The tender offer was completed in October 2020, totalling US$3.2 billion under five series of bonds, \u00a370 million and \u20ac100 million under two separate series of bonds, all of which would have otherwise matured in 2021 and 2022; and\n- - In October 2020, the Group exercised the make whole redemption provision to fully redeem the remaining amounts outstanding following the tender offer on three series of bonds that would have otherwise matured in 2022. In November 2020, the balance outstanding on these bonds was repurchased, totalling US$597.6 million.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe Group is subject to exposure on the translation of the net assets of foreign currency subsidiaries and associates into its reporting currency, sterling. The Group's primary balance sheet translation exposures are to the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, euro, Danish krone, Swiss franc, South African rand, Russian rouble, Brazilian real, Australian dollar, Malaysian ringgit, Singaporean dollar and Indian rupee. These exposures are kept under continuous review. The Group's policy on borrowings is to broadly match the currency of these borrowings with the currency of cash flows arising from the Group's underlying operations. Within this overall policy, the Group aims to minimise all balance sheet translation exposure where it is practicable and cost-effective to do so through matching currency assets with currency borrowings. The main objective of these policies is to protect shareholder value by increasing certainty and minimising volatility in earnings per share. At 31 December 2021, the currency profile of the Group's gross debt, after taking into account derivative contracts, was 68% U.S. dollar (2020: 63%), 13% euro (2020: 13%), 13% sterling (2020: 19%) and 6% other currencies (2020: 5% other currencies).\n\nThe Group faces currency exposures arising from the translation of profits earned in foreign currency subsidiaries and associates and joint arrangements; these exposures are not normally hedged. Exposures also arise from:\n\n(i) foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries. These exposures comprise committed and highly probable forecast sales and purchases, which are offset wherever possible. The remaining exposures are hedged within the Treasury policies and procedures with forward foreign exchange contracts and options, which are designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the identified future transactions; and\n\n(ii) forecast dividend flows from subsidiaries to the centre. To ensure cash flow certainty, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts which are designated as net investment hedges of the foreign exchange risk arising from the investments in these subsidiaries.\n\nIFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the income statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of exchange rates in respect of non-functional currency financial assets and liabilities held across the Group. All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation. Financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of the Group's subsidiaries, as well as non-financial assets and liabilities and translation risk, are not included in the analysis. The Group considers a 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency against the non-functional currency of its subsidiaries as a reasonably possible change. The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year-end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.",

A 10% weakening of functional currencies against nonfunctional currencies would result in pre-tax profit being \u00a365 million higher (2020: \u00a374 million higher; 2019: \u00a320 million higher) and items recognised directly in other comprehensive income being \u00a3177 million lower (2020: \u00a370 million lower; 2019: \u00a327 million higher).\n\nThe exchange sensitivities on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income relate to hedging of certain net asset currency positions in the Group, as well as on cash flow hedges in respect of future transactions, but do not include sensitivities in respect of exchange on non-financial assets or liabilities.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe objectives of the Group's interest rate risk management policy are to lessen the impact of adverse interest rate movements on the earnings, cash flow and economic value of the Group. Additional objectives are to minimise the cost of hedging and the associated counterparty risk.\n\nDuring 2020, the Group financial covenant, being gross interest cover, was removed from the centrally managed banking facilities.\n\nIn order to manage its interest rate risk, the Group maintains both floating rate and fixed rate debt. The Group sets targets (within overall guidelines) for the desired ratio of floating to fixed rate debt on a net basis (at least 50% fixed on a net basis in the short to medium term) as a result of regular reviews of market conditions and strategy by the Corporate Finance Committee and the board of the main central finance company. At 31 December 2021, the relevant ratios of floating to fixed rate borrowings were 10:90 (2020: 7:93) on a net basis. Underlying borrowings are arranged on both a fixed rate and a floating rate basis and, where appropriate, the Group uses derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps to vary the fixed and floating mix, or forward starting swaps to manage the refinancing risk. The interest rate profile of liquid assets is taken into account in determining the net interest rate exposure.\n\nIFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that shows the impact on the income statement and on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income of hypothetical changes of interest rates in respect of financial assets and liabilities of the Group. All other variables are held constant although, in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation. For the purposes of this sensitivity analysis, financial assets and liabilities with fixed interest rates are not included. The Group considers a 100 basis point change in interest rates a reasonably possible change except where rates are less than 100 basis points. In these instances, it is assumed that the interest rates increase by 100 basis points and decrease to zero for the purpose of performing the sensitivity analysis. The impact is calculated with reference to the financial asset or liability held as at the year-end, unless this is unrepresentative of the position during the year.\n\nA 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in pre-tax profit being \u00a344 million lower (2020: \u00a331 million lower; 2019: \u00a3143 million lower). A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, or less where applicable, would result in pre-tax profit being \u00a347 million higher (2020: \u00a329 million higher; 2019: \u00a3108 million higher). The effect of these interest rate changes on items recognised directly in other comprehensive income is not material in either year.\n\nIn accordance with the UK Financial Conduct Authority's announcement on 27 July 2017, and following the decision taken by global regulators in 2018 to replace Interbank Offered Rates with alternative nearly risk-free rates, such benchmark rates are expected to be largely discontinued after 2021. The IASB addressed the effects of interest rate benchmark reform on financial reporting, with two phases of Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (and other Standards) which the Group adopted in its Year End 2019 and 2020 accounts, respectively, as explained in the accounting policies (note 1). The impact on the Group's profit or equity from the application of these amendments was not material.\n\nIn January 2021, the Group confirmed adherence to the ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol as published by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) on 23 October 2020 (the Protocol), ensuring that appropriate fallback rates can apply to derivatives in the event of LIBOR discontinuation.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group has a floating rate bond with a nominal value US$750 million (\u00a3554 million) (2020: US$750 million (\u00a3549 million)) that is due to mature in August 2022 before USD LIBOR ceases. \u00a31,929 million of floating rate borrowings outstanding at 31 December 2020 were repaid during the year. In addition, the Group has bilateral facilities totalling \u00a32.5 billion of which \u00a3500 million was drawn down at 31 December 2021. The contractual language on these facilities was updated during 2021 such that all drawings are based on SONIA with effect from the end of November 2021. The Group's syndicated revolving credit facility (undrawn at 31 December 2021 and 2020) has historically had references to USD LIBOR, EURIBOR and GBP LIBOR. This facility includes market standard LIBOR replacement language, and with effect from June 2021 the agreement has adopted SOFR and SONIA as the alternative benchmark rates in respect of USD LIBOR and GBP LIBOR, respectively.\n\nFollowing announcements by the respective regulators, EURIBOR and USD LIBOR are now expected to continue for the foreseeable future, with USD LIBOR rates potentially discontinued after June 2023.\n\nThe Group has a total of nine derivatives that may be impacted by an interest rate benchmark reform of which two are free-standing derivatives (EUR interest rate swaps) maturing in January 2023 with nominal values of \u20ac750 million (\u00a3630 million). There are three derivatives (USD interest rate swaps) in fair value hedge relationship with nominal value US$300 million (\u00a3221 million) maturing in June 2022 (before USD LIBOR cessation) and therefore no further exposure arises.\n\nThe remaining four impacted derivatives (cross currency interest rate swaps) with nominal values totalling \u20ac800 million (\u00a3672 million) maturing in October 2023 are in fair value hedge relationships which are indexed to the sterling LIBOR interest rates. The Group is party to the ISDA fallback protocol and in January 2022, it automatically replaced the GBP LIBOR with an economically equivalent interest rate derivatives referencing SONIA on their reset date. The Group has updated the respective hedge documentation accordingly since the uncertainty regarding the transition for these four derivatives has ceased. The hedge relationship on these derivatives will continue with any resulting ineffectiveness likely to be immaterial.",

Subsidiaries have policies in place requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence. The process for monitoring and managing credit risk once sales to customers have been made varies depending on local practice in the countries concerned.\n\nCertain territories have bank guarantees, other guarantees or credit insurance provided in the Group's favour in respect of Group trade receivables, the issuance and terms of which are dependent on local practices in the countries concerned. All derivatives are subject to ISDA agreements or equivalent documentation.\n\nCash deposits and other financial instruments give rise to credit risk on the amounts due from the related counterparties. Generally, the Group aims to transact with counterparties with strong investment grade credit ratings. However, the Group recognises that due to the need to operate over a large geographic footprint, this will not always be possible. Counterparty credit risk is managed on a global basis by limiting the aggregate amount and duration of exposure to any one counterparty, taking into account its credit rating. The credit ratings of all counterparties are reviewed regularly.\n\nThe Group ensures that it has sufficient counterparty credit capacity of requisite quality to undertake all anticipated transactions throughout its geographic footprint, while at the same time ensuring that there is no geographic concentration in the location of counterparties.\n\nWith the following exceptions, the maximum exposure to the credit risk of financial assets at the balance sheet date is reflected by the carrying values included in the Group's balance sheet. The Group has entered into short-term risk participation agreements in relation to certain leaf supply arrangements and the maximum exposure under these would be \u00a389 million (2020: \u00a388 million). In addition, the Group has entered into a guarantee arrangement to support a short-term bank credit facility with distribution and supply chain partner. The maximum exposure under the arrangement would be \u00a31 million (2020: \u00a336 million).\n\n## Price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to price risk on investments held by the Group, which are included in investments held at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet, but the quantum of such is not material.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document prospectively the economic relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is also required to demonstrate an assessment of the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is repeated periodically to ensure that the hedge has remained, and is expected to remain, highly effective. The prospective effectiveness testing determines that an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument exists.\n\nIn accordance with the Group Treasury Policy, the exact hedge ratios and profile of a hedge relationship will depend on several factors, including the desired degree of certainty and reduced volatility of net interest costs and market conditions, trends and expectations in the relevant markets. The sources of ineffectiveness include spot and forward differences, impact of time value and timing differences between periods in the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nThe Group's risk management strategy has been explained in further detail under the interest rate risk and currency risk sections of this note.\n\n## Fair value estimation\n\nThe fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities of less than one year, other than derivatives, are assumed to approximate their book values. For other financial instruments which are measured at fair value in the balance sheet, the basis for fair values is described below.",

In case of any event of default, the non-defaulting party will calculate the sum of the replacement cost of outstanding transactions and amounts owed to it by the defaulting party. If that sum exceeds the amounts owed to the defaulting party, the defaulting party will pay the balance to the non-defaulting party. If the sum is less than the amounts owed to the defaulting party, the non-defaulting party will pay the balance to the defaulting party.",

The change in the value used for calculating hedge ineffectiveness for hedged items designated under net investment hedge relationships is \u00a324 million (2020: \u00a321 million).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the accumulated balance of the cash flow hedge reserve was a loss of \u00a3363 million (2020: loss of \u00a3504 million) including an accumulated loss of \u00a3538 million (2020: loss of \u00a3628 million) in relation to interest rate exposure and foreign currency exposure arising from borrowings held by the Group, and an accumulated gain of \u00a3116 million (2020: gain of \u00a3139 million) in relation to deferred tax arising from cash flow hedges. The remainder related to the Group's foreign currency exposure on forecasted transactions and cost of hedging (note 22(c)(ii)).",

        "page_content": "## 27 Changes in the Group\n\n## (a) Acquisitions\n\nThe Group acquired certain businesses and other tobacco assets as noted below. The financial impact of these transactions to the Group were immaterial individually and in aggregate. Except as noted, there were no material differences between the fair value and book values of net assets acquired in business combinations.\n\nOn 12 November 2020, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital in Eastern Tobacco Company for Trading , formerly known as Rafique Mohammed Sudki Jad Establishment for Trading when acting as BAT's distributor in Saudi Arabia (KSA), for \u00a350 million (SAR 246 million). Goodwill of \u00a336 million, representing anticipated synergies, and trademarks and similar intangibles of \u00a339 million, as well as \u00a396 million of cash and cash equivalents, were recognised on acquisition.\n\nOn 8 April 2019, the Group via its U.S. subsidiary R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company (RJR Vapor), acquired a 45% stake in VapeWild Holdings LLC , a vertically integrated vapour manufacturer and retailer for US$40 million. This was followed by a further acquisition of 15% on 24 June 2019 for US$8 million, giving the Group a 60% interest for US$48 million (\u00a336 million). The Group consolidated VapeWild as a subsidiary from the date of the first investment. Goodwill of \u00a311 million, representing a strategic premium to enter this segment of the U.S. vapour market, and trademarks and similar intangibles of \u00a339 million were recognised on acquisition. Following the announcements with regard to flavours in vapour in the U.S., goodwill was impaired in full in 2019. The business was subsequently discontinued and liquidation proceedings commenced in December 2020.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, the Group signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of Twisp Proprietary Limited , a South African e-cigarette/nicotine vapour company with a market share of circa 70% within South Africa and a leading presence in shopping malls via its branded kiosks outlets. Completion of the proposed acquisition was conditional upon South African antitrust clearance, which was given in the second half of 2019 and BAT acquired control on 30 September 2019 for a purchase price of \u00a325 million of which \u00a36 million was deferred and contingent upon future performance in the market. Goodwill of \u00a312 million, representing a strategic premium to enter this segment of the South African vapour market, and trademarks and similar intangibles of \u00a315 million were recognised on acquisition. Due to difficult trading conditions, the goodwill and intangibles were fully impaired in 2020 and deferred consideration adjusted by \u00a33 million. The final payment of deferred consideration of \u00a33 million was paid in 2021.\n\nOn 5 May 2017, the Group acquired certain tobacco assets, including a distribution company, Express Logistic and Distribution EOOD (ELD) , from Bulgartabac Holding AD in Bulgaria. The assets acquired, including brands and other intangibles of \u00a3117 million, were purchased for a total consideration of \u00a3110 million, of which \u00a328 million was contingent upon future performance in the market. \u00a314 million of this was paid during 2018 and \u00a313 million of this was paid during 2019. Subsequently, ELD was disposed of in 2019 at carrying value.\n\nOn 4 January 2017, the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of Winnington Holding AB , a Swedish manufacturer of 'white' snus, for a purchase price of \u00a331 million. Goodwill of \u00a38 million and brands and similar intangibles of \u00a328 million were recognised. \u00a38 million of the consideration was contingent on post-acquisition targets being met and was substantially settled in January 2019.\n\nOn 17 November 2015, the Group acquired 100% of Blue Nile Cigarette Company Limited from a private shareholder. The fair value of the consideration payable was \u00a345 million of which \u00a38 million was contingent on achievement of certain post-acquisition targets. Subsequent payments in respect of this were \u00a31 million in 2016, \u00a35 million in 2017, \u00a31 million in 2018 and \u00a31 million in 2019.\n\nOn 30 September 2015, the Group acquired TDR and other tobacco and retail assets from Adris Grupa d.d. (Adris) for a total enterprise value of \u20ac550 million. Part of the consideration was contingent upon certain targets being met post-acquisition, and \u00a35 million of this was paid in January 2017. In 2019, the Group reached an agreement with Adris regarding the level of contingent consideration such that any remaining amounts would not be paid by the Group and the Group received \u20ac3 million in full and final settlement of all claims between Adris and the Group. Consequently, \u20ac9 million of cash and deferred consideration was recognised as other income (note 7).\n\n## (b) Non-controlling interests\n\nIn 2021, the Group made a capital contribution to Brascuba Cigarrillos S.A. at a cost of \u00a36 million (2020: \u00a317 million; 2019: \u00a320 million). This contribution was in proportion to a capital contribution made by the non-controlling interest to the company and as such, the Group's shareholding remains unchanged.\n\nIn addition, in 2021, as part of a Voluntary Tender Offer for the noncontrolling interests of the Group's Indonesian subsidiary, the Group acquired 0.2% additional shares at a cost of \u00a34 million as explained in note 30.\n\nAlso in 2021, the Group acquired a further 2.7% in Hrvatski Duhani d.d. Tobacco Leaf Processing at a cost of \u00a31 million.\n\n## (c) Other transactions (i) Organigram\n\nOn 11 March 2021, the Group announced a strategic collaboration agreement with Organigram Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of publicly traded Organigram Holdings Inc. (collectively, Organigram). Under the terms of the transaction, a Group subsidiary acquired a 19.9% equity stake in Organigram Holdings Inc. (listed on both the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol 'OGI') to become its largest shareholder, with the ability to appoint two directors to Organigram Holdings Inc.'s board of directors and representation on its investment committee. At closing, one BAT nominee, Mr. Jeyan Heper, was added to the board. A second nominee and a replacement for Mr. Heper, who resigned on 31 October 2021, are expected to be proposed in due course. The Group accounts for the investment as an associate.\n\nThe Group's investment provides a significant injection of capital for Organigram that will enable them to expand and accelerate their R&D and product development activities and support business expansion. The Group's investment of \u00a3129 million has been allocated against the Group's share of Organigram's net assets, including the recognition of \u00a349 million of intangibles, and goodwill of \u00a330 million, which represents a strategic premium to enter the legal cannabis market in North America.\n\nDuring 2021, Organigram acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of The Edibles & Infusions Corporation (EIC) for an initial consideration of CAD$22 million, payable in shares.",

The impact of these transactions on the Group was not material. As a result of these transactions, the Group's shareholding was reduced to 18.8%. Potential additional shares are payable on both transactions upon the acquired businesses achieving certain earnout milestones. The transactions and results of these changes are immaterial to the Group and organic measures, excluding the results of these acquisitions, are not presented.\n\n## (ii) Other acquisitions\n\nDuring 2021, the Group increased its ownership of a wholesale producer and distributor operating in the agriculture sector based in Uzbekistan, FE 'Samfruit' JSC to 42.61%, for \u00a31 million. During 2020, the ownership was increased to 38.63%, for \u00a35 million.\n\nOn 20 October 2020, the Group acquired the formulations, brands, associated know-how and other relevant assets owned by Dryft Sciences, LLC (DSL) relating to its white nicotine pouch products for consideration of up to US$150 million payable in accordance with the achievement of certain milestones. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, rather than as a business combination, as the intellectual property and associated assets acquired do not represent an integrated set of activities required by IFRS for business combination accounting. Consequently, the consideration payable has been assigned to the acquired assets by relative fair value.\n\nOn 10 January 2019, the Group acquired a minority stake in AYR Limited , a vapour technology company based in the UK, for \u00a38 million, with the potential to increase this in the future. The investment terms also provide for the Group and AYR to agree a commercial collaboration agreement under which the Group and AYR will jointly develop future vaping products.\n\n## (d) Disposals\n\nOn 25 June 2021, the Group agreed to dispose of its Iranian subsidiary, B.A.T. Pars Company PJSC (BAT Pars) to DTM ME FZE LLC. Accordingly, BAT Pars was classified as held-for-sale at that date and \u00a3152 million of assets, primarily comprised \u00a398 million of cash and cash equivalents, \u00a338 million of inventory and \u00a314 million of property, plant and equipment, were transferred to held-for-sale assets. Also, \u00a324 million of liabilities, primarily comprised \u00a310 million of trade creditors and \u00a38 million of corporation tax payable, were transferred to held-for-sale liabilities. Subsequently an impairment charge and associated costs of \u00a388 million was recognised in the income statement and treated as an adjusting item.\n\nCompletion took place on 6 August 2021. The value of the consideration, in Euros, is subject to the finalisation of the completion accounts process, as well as various other matters, with payment deferred until September 2022. Discounted estimated proceeds of \u00a345 million have been recognised as a current receivable. At 31 December 2021, a credit of \u00a32 million was recognised in operating profit in relation to a partial unwind of discounting on the deferred proceeds. In addition, \u00a3272 million in respect of foreign exchange previously recognised in other comprehensive income has been reclassified to the income statement. The financial impact of this has also been treated as an adjusting item.\n\nThe held-for-sale impairment charge of \u00a383 million and the foreign exchange reclassification of \u00a3272 million which were charged to the income statement have been included as non-cash items in the cash flow statement.\n\nIn compliance with IAS 7 Statement of cash flows , the \u00a398 million of cash and cash equivalents held at the date of disposal have been reported as a cash outflow under investing activities.\n\nIn addition, \u00a324 million of related investments held at fair value were provided against as a charge to net finance costs given uncertainties regarding recovery of these funds.\n\n## 28 Share-based Payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of share-based payment arrangements of which the two principal ones are:\n\n## Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nAwards granted from 2020 under the Long-Term Incentive Plan are the Performance Share Plan and the Restricted Share Plan with the following conditions:\n\nPerformance Share Plan (PSP): nil-cost options released three years from date of grant. Payout is subject to performance conditions based on earnings per share (40% of grant), operating cash flow (20% of grant), total shareholder return (20% of grant) and net turnover (20% of grant) in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Total shareholder return combines the share price and dividend performance of the Company by reference to one comparator group. Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of the options. A cash equivalent dividend accrues through the vesting period and is paid on vesting. Both equity and cashsettled PSP awards are granted in March each year.\n\nRestricted Share Plan (RSP): Nil-cost options released three years from date of grant and may be subject to forfeit if a participant leaves employment before the end of the three-year holding period. Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of the options. A cash equivalent dividend accrues through the vesting period and is paid on vesting. Both equity- and cash-settled RSP awards are granted in March.\n\nAwards granted in 2019 are nil-cost options exercisable after three years from date of grant with a contractual life of 10 years. The performance conditions and the dividend entitlement attached to these awards are identical to the PSP award mentioned above. Both equity and cash-settled LTIP awards were granted in March.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of Reynolds American on 25 July 2017, underlying Reynolds American shares for LTIPs were replaced with BAT American Depositary Shares (ADS). LTIP awards for ADSs are measured against the performance conditions of Reynolds American at the maximum of 150% at the vesting date. Equitysettled LTIPs were granted by Reynolds American in March each year with options exercisable after three years from the date of grant with the payment made no later than 90 days from date of vesting. Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to exercise of the options.\n\n## Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSBS)\n\nFree ordinary shares released three years from date of grant and may be subject to forfeit if a participant leaves employment before the end of the three-year holding period. Participants receive a separate payment equivalent to a proportion of the dividend payment during the holding period. Both equity- and cash-settled deferred shares are granted in March each year.\n\nThe Group also has a number of other arrangements which are not material for the Group and these are as follows:",

Options to this equity-settled scheme are exercisable at the end of a three-year or fiveyear savings contract. Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of the options. The maximum amount that can be saved by a participant in this way is \u00a36,000 in any tax year.\n\n## Share Reward Scheme (SRS) and International Share Reward Scheme (ISRS)\n\nFree shares granted in April each year (maximum \u00a33,600 in any year) under the equity-settled schemes are subject to a three-year holding period. Participants receive dividends during the holding period which are reinvested to buy further shares.\n\n## Partnership Share Scheme\n\nOpen to all eligible employees, where employees can allocate part of their pre-tax salary to purchase shares in British American Tobacco p.l.c. The maximum amount that can be allocated in this way to any individual is \u00a31,800 in any tax year. The shares purchased are held in a UK-based trust and are normally capable of transfer to participants tax-free after a five-year holding period.\n\n## Share-based payment expense\n\nThe amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of share-based payments were as follows:\n\n|                                                   | 2021               | 2021             | 2020               | 2020             | 2019 Cash-         | 2019 Cash-   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n|                                                   | Equity- settled \u00a3m | Cash- settled \u00a3m | Equity- settled \u00a3m | Cash- settled \u00a3m | Equity- settled \u00a3m | settled \u00a3m   |\n| LTIP (note (a))                                   | 30                 | -                | 36                 | -                | 58                 | 1            |\n| DSBS (note (b))                                   | 39                 | 2                | 44                 | 3                | 50                 | 4            |\n| Other schemes                                     | 7                  | -                | 8                  | -                | 7                  | -            |\n| Total recognised in the income statement (note 3) | 76                 | 2                | 88                 | 3                | 115                | 5            |\n\n## Share-based payment liability\n\nThe Group issues to certain employees cash-settled share-based payments that require the Group to pay the intrinsic value of these share-based payments to the employee at the date of exercise.

Assumptions used in these models were as follows:\n\n|                                                          |   2021 LTIP (PSP) |   2020 LTIP (PSP) |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Average share price volatility FMCG comparator group (%) |                23 |                21 |\n| Average correlation FMCG comparator group (%)            |                29 |                31 |\n\nFair values determined from the Black-Scholes and Monte-Carlo models use assumptions revised at the end of each reporting period for cash-settled share-based payment arrangements.\n\nThe expected British American Tobacco p.l.c. share price volatility was determined taking account of the return index (the share price index plus the dividend reinvested) over a five-year period. The FMCG share price volatility and correlation was also determined over the same periods. The average expected term to exercise used in the models has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural conditions, forfeiture and historical experience.\n\nThe risk-free rate has been determined from market yield curves for government gilts with outstanding terms equal to the average expected term to exercise for each relevant grant. The expected dividend yield was determined by calculating the yield from the last two declared dividends divided by the grant share price.\n\nIn addition to these valuation assumptions, LTIP awards, excluding RSP, contain earnings per share performance conditions. As these are nonmarket performance conditions they are not included in the determination of fair value of share options at the grant date, however, they are used to estimate the number of awards expected to vest. This pay-out calculation is based on expectations published in analysts' forecasts.",

        "page_content": "## 31 Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments\n\n- 1. The Group is subject to contingencies pursuant to requirements that it complies with relevant laws, regulations and standards.\n- 2. Failure to comply could result in restrictions in operations, damages, fines, increased tax, increased cost of compliance, interest charges, reputational damage or other sanctions. These matters are inherently difficult to quantify. In cases where the Group has an obligation as a result of a past event existing at the balance sheet date, if it is probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation and if the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated, a provision will be recognised based on best estimates and management judgement.\n- 3. There are, however, contingent liabilities in respect of litigation, taxes in some countries and guarantees for which no provisions have been made.\n\n## General Litigation Overview\n\n- 4. There are a number of legal and regulatory actions, proceedings and claims against Group companies related to tobacco and New Category products that are pending in a number of jurisdictions. These proceedings include, among other things, claims for personal injury (both individual claims and class actions) and claims for economic loss arising from the treatment of smoking- and health-related diseases (such as medical recoupment claims brought by local governments).\n- 5. The plaintiffs in these cases seek recovery on a variety of legal theories, including negligence, strict liability in tort, design defect, failure to warn, fraud, misrepresentation, violations of unfair and deceptive trade practices statutes, conspiracy, public nuisance, medical monitoring and violations of competition and antitrust laws. The plaintiffs seek various forms of relief, including compensatory and, where available, punitive damages, treble or multiple damages and statutory damages and penalties, creation of medical monitoring and smoking cessation funds, disgorgement of profits, attorneys' fees, and injunctive and other equitable relief.\n- 6. Although alleged damages often are not determinable from a complaint, and the law governing the pleading and calculation of damages varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, compensatory and punitive damages have been specifically pleaded in a number of cases, sometimes in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions and even hundreds of billions of sterling.\n- 7. With the exception of the Engle progeny cases described below, the Group continues to win the majority of tobaccorelated litigation claims that reach trial, and a very high percentage of the tobacco-related litigation claims brought against them, including Engle progeny cases, continue to be dismissed at or before trial. Based on their experience in tobacco-related litigation and the strength of the defences available to them in such litigation, the Group's companies believe that their successful defence of tobacco-related litigation in the past will continue in the future.\n- 8. Group companies generally do not settle claims. However, Group companies may enter into settlement discussions in some cases, if they believe it is in their best interests to do so. Exceptions to this general approach include, but are not limited to, actions taken pursuant to 'offer of judgment' statutes and Filter Cases, as defined below. An 'offer of judgment,' if rejected by the plaintiff, preserves the Group's right to recover attorneys' fees under certain statutes in the event of a verdict favourable to the Group. Such offers are sometimes made through court-ordered mediations. Other settlements by Group companies include the State Settlement Agreements (as defined in paragraph 41 below), the funding by various tobacco companies of a US$5.2 billion (approximately \u00a33.8 billion) trust fund contemplated by the Master Settlement Agreement (as described in paragraph 41 below) to benefit tobacco growers, the original Broin flight attendant case, and most of the Engle progeny cases pending in U.S. federal court, after the initial docket of over 4,000 such cases was reduced to approximately 400 cases. The Group believes that the circumstances surrounding these claims are readily distinguishable from the current categories of tobacco-related litigation claims involving Group companies.\n- 9. Although the Group intends to defend all pending cases vigorously, and believes that the Group's companies have valid bases for appeals of adverse verdicts and valid defences to all actions, and that an outflow of resources related to any individual case is not considered probable, litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and, generally, it is not possible to predict the outcome of any particular litigation pending against Group companies, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Furthermore, a number of political, legislative, regulatory and other developments relating to the tobacco industry and cigarette smoking have received wide media attention. These developments may negatively affect the outcomes of tobacco-related legal actions and encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation. Therefore, the Group does not provide estimates of the financial effect of the contingent liabilities represented by such litigation, as such estimates are not practicable.\n- 10.  The following table lists the categories of the tobacco-related actions pending against Group companies as of 31 December 2021 and the increase or decrease from the number of cases pending against Group companies as of 31 December 2020. Details of the quantum of past judgments awarded against Group companies, the majority of which are under appeal, are also identified along with any settlements reached during the relevant period. Given the volume and more active nature of the Engle progeny cases and the Filter Cases in the U.S. described below, and the fluctuation in the number of such cases and amounts awarded from year to year, the Group presents judgment or settlement figures for these cases on a three-year basis. Where no quantum is identified, either no judgment has been awarded against a Group company, or where a verdict has been reached no quantification of damages has been given, or no settlement has been entered into. Further details on the judgments, damages quantification and settlements are included within the case narratives below. For a discussion of the non-tobacco related litigation pending against the Group, see note 31, paragraph 83, et seq.",

(Reynolds American) group companies were a party at such date.\n\n(Note 2) This category of cases includes the Department of Justice action. See note 31, paragraphs 20-24.\n\n(Note 3) See note 31, paragraphs 25-38.\n\n(Note 4) This category of cases includes smoking and health cases alleging personal injuries caused by tobacco use or exposure brought by or on behalf of individual plaintiffs based on theories of negligence, strict liability, breach of express or implied warranty and violations of state deceptive trade practices or consumer protection statutes. The plaintiffs seek to recover compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and costs and punitive damages. Out of the 222 active individual smoking and health cases, six judgments have been returned in the plaintiffs' favour, awarding damages totalling approximately US$150.1 million (approximately \u00a3110.8 million), which are pending post-trial in trial courts or on appeal. For a further description of these cases, see note 31, paragraphs 39-40.\n\n(Note 5) In July 1998, trial began in Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co ., a then-certified class action filed in Circuit Court, Miami-Dade County, Florida, against U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. (RJRT) (individually, and as successor by merger to Lorillard Tobacco Company (Lorillard Tobacco)) and Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc. (formerly Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation) (B&W). In July 2000, the jury in Phase II awarded the class a total of approximately US$145 billion (approximately \u00a3107.1 billion) in punitive damages, apportioned US$36.3 billion (approximately \u00a326.8 billion) to RJRT, US$17.6 billion (approximately \u00a313 billion) to B&W, and US$16.3 billion (approximately \u00a312 billion) to Lorillard Tobacco. This decision was appealed and ultimately resulted in the Florida Supreme Court in December 2006 decertifying the class and allowing judgments entered for only two of the three Engle class representatives to stand and setting aside the punitive damages award. Putative Engle class members were permitted to file individual lawsuits, deemed ' Engle progeny cases', against the Engle defendants, within one year of the Supreme Court's decision (subsequently extended to 11 January 2008). Between the period 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2021, 21 judgments have been returned in the plaintiffs' favour, awarding damages totalling approximately US$225 million (approximately \u00a3166.1 million). Certain of these judgments have been appealed by RJRT and in certain other cases, RJRT still had time to appeal, as of 31 December 2021. For a further description of the Engle progeny cases, see note 31, paragraphs 29-38 seq.\n\n(Note 6) Broin v. Philip Morris, Inc . was a class action filed in Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County, Florida in 1991 and brought on behalf of flight attendants alleged to have suffered from diseases or ailments caused by exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS) in airplane cabins. Group companies and other cigarette manufacturer defendants settled Broin , agreeing to pay a total of US$300 million (approximately \u00a3221.5 million) to fund research on the detection and cure of tobacco-related diseases and US$49 million (approximately \u00a336.2 million) in plaintiffs' counsel's fees and expenses. Group companies' share of these payments totalled US$174 million (approximately \u00a3128.5 million). Broin II cases refer to individual cases by class members. There have been no Broin II trials since 2007. For a further description of the Broin II cases, see note 16 to paragraph 40.\n\n(Note 7) Includes claims brought against Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard Inc. by individuals who seek damages resulting from their alleged exposure to asbestos fibres that were incorporated into filter material used in one brand of cigarettes manufactured by a predecessor to Lorillard Tobacco for a limited period of time ending more than 50 years ago. Since 1 January 2019, Lorillard Tobacco and RJRT have paid, or have reached agreement to pay, a total of approximately US$25.9 million (approximately \u00a319.1 million) in settlements to resolve 102 Filter Cases. See note 17 to paragraph 40.\n\n(Note 8) Group companies' expenses and payments under the State Settlement Agreements for 2021 amounted to approximately US$3.4 billion (approximately \u00a32.5 billion) in respect of settlement expenses and US$3.7 billion (approximately \u00a32.7 billion) in respect of settlement cash payments. See note 31, paragraph 43. The pending cases referred to above relate to the enforcement, validity or interpretation of the State Settlement Agreements in which RJRT, B&W or Lorillard Tobacco is a party. See note 31, paragraphs 41-54.",

        "page_content": "## 31 Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments Continued\n\n(Note 9) Outside the United States, there are 12 class actions being brought against Group companies as of 31 December 2021. These include class actions in the following jurisdictions: Canada (11) and Venezuela (1). For a description of the Group companies' class actions, see note 31, paragraphs 70-81. Pursuant to the judgment in 2015 in the two Quebec class actions, the plaintiffs were awarded damages and interest in the amount of CAD$15.6 billion, most of which were on a joint and several basis (approximately \u00a39.1 billion), of which the Group companies' share was CAD$10.4 billion (approximately \u00a36.1 billion). On 1 March 2019, the Quebec Court of Appeal handed down a judgment which largely upheld and endorsed the lower court's previous decision in the Quebec Class Actions, as further described below. The share of the judgment for Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited (Imperial), the Group's operating company in Canada, was reduced to approximately CAD$9.2 billion (approximately \u00a35.4 billion). For a further description of the Quebec Class Actions, see paragraph 76. All of the class actions in Canada are currently stayed pursuant to a court order. See paragraph 58.\n\n(Note 10) As at 31 December 2021, the jurisdictions with the most active individual cases against Group companies were, in descending order: Brazil (23), Italy (11), Canada (5), Argentina (5), Chile (4) and Ireland (2). There were a further two jurisdictions with one active case only. Out of these 52 cases, one case in Argentina ( Baldassare ) returned a first instance judgment on 28 December 2020, in the amount of ARS 685,976 (approximately \u00a35,000) in compensatory damages and ARS 2,500,000 (approximately \u00a318,000) in punitive damages (plus interest), in the plaintiffs' favour as of 31 December 2021. BAT Argentina filed a notice of appeal of the judgment on 3 February 2021.\n\n- 11. Certain terms and phrases used in this note 31 may require some explanation.\n- a. 'Judgment' or 'final judgment' refers to the final decision of the court resolving the dispute and determining the rights and obligations of the parties. At the trial court level, for example, a final judgment generally is entered by the court after a jury verdict and after post-verdict motions have been decided. In most cases, the losing party can appeal a verdict only after a final judgment has been entered by the trial court.\n- b. 'Damages' refers to the amount of money sought by a plaintiff in a complaint, or awarded to a party by a jury or, in some cases, by a judge. 'Compensatory damages' are awarded to compensate the prevailing party for actual losses suffered, if liability is proved. In cases in which there is a finding that a defendant has acted wilfully, maliciously or fraudulently, generally based on a higher burden of proof than is required for a finding of liability for compensatory damages, a plaintiff also may be awarded 'punitive damages'. Although damages may be awarded at the trial court stage, a losing party may be protected from paying any damages until all appellate avenues have been exhausted by posting a supersedeas bond. The amount of such a bond is governed by the law of the relevant jurisdiction and generally is set at the amount of damages plus some measure of statutory interest, modified at the discretion of the appropriate court or subject to limits set by a court or statute.\n- c. 'Settlement' refers to certain types of cases in which cigarette manufacturers, including RJRT, B&W and Lorillard Tobacco, have agreed to resolve disputes with certain plaintiffs without resolving the cases through trial.\n\n- d. All sums set out in note 31 have been converted to GBP and US$ using the following end closing rates: GBP 1 to US$ 1.3545, GBP 1 to CAD$ 1.7109, GBP 1 to EURO 1.1910, GBP 1 to BRL 7.5443, GBP 1 to AOA 763.1513, GBP 1 to NGN 711.7127, GBP 1 to KRW 1610.1000, GBP 1 to HRK 8.9537, GBP 1 to JPY 155.9717, GBP 1 to QAR 4.9316, GBP 1 to SAR 5.0852 and GBP 1 to ARS 139.0908.\n\n## U.S. Tobacco Litigation\n\n- 12.  Group companies, notably RJRT (individually and as successor by merger to Lorillard Tobacco) and B&W as well as other leading cigarette manufacturers, are defendants in a number of product liability cases. In a number of these cases, the amounts of compensatory and punitive damages sought are significant.\n- 13.  The total number of U.S. tobacco product liability cases pending at 31 December 2021 involving RJRT, B&W and/or Lorillard Tobacco was approximately 2,573. As at 31 December 2021, British American Tobacco (Investments) Limited (Investments) has been served as a co-defendant in one of those cases (2018:1). No other UK-based Group company has been served as a co-defendant in any U.S. tobacco product liability case pending as at 31 December 2021.\n- 14.  Since many of these pending cases seek unspecified damages, it is not possible to quantify the total amounts being claimed, but the aggregate amounts involved in such litigation are significant, possibly totalling billions of U.S. dollars. The cases fall into four broad categories: medical reimbursement cases; class actions; individual cases; and other claims.\n- 15.  RJRT (individually and as successor by merger to Lorillard Tobacco), American Snuff Co., Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, Inc. (SFNTC), R.J. Reynolds Vapor Company (RJR Vapor), Reynolds American, Lorillard Inc., other Reynolds American affiliates and indemnitees, including but not limited to B&W (collectively, the Reynolds Defendants), believe that they have valid defences to the tobacco-related litigation claims against them, as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them. The Reynolds Defendants have, through their counsel, filed pleadings and memoranda in pending tobacco-related litigation that set forth and discuss a number of grounds and defences that they and their counsel believe have a valid basis in law and fact.\n- 16.  Scheduled trials. Trial schedules are subject to change, and many cases are dismissed before trial. In the U.S., there are 57 cases, exclusive of Engle progeny cases, scheduled for trial as of 31 December 2021 through 31 December 2022, for the Reynolds Defendants: 39 individual smoking and health cases, 15 Filter Cases, and 3 non-smoking and health cases. There are also approximately 151 Engle progeny cases against RJRT (individually and as successor to Lorillard Tobacco) and B&W scheduled for trial through 31 December 2022. It is not known how many of these cases will actually be tried.\n- 17. Trial results. From 1 January 2019 through 31 December 2021, 53 trials occurred in individual smoking and health, Engle progeny, and Filter Cases in which the Reynolds Defendants were defendants, including five where mistrials were declared. Verdicts in favour of the Reynolds Defendants and, in some cases, other defendants, were returned in 15 cases, tried in Florida (11), Oregon (1), and Massachusetts (3). Verdicts in favour of the plaintiffs were returned in 24 cases, which were tried in Florida (21), Massachusetts (2) and New Mexico (1). Six of the cases (four in Florida, one in New York, and one in Connecticut) were dismissed during trial. Two cases were punitive damages retrials. One case in Massachusetts is awaiting a decision.",

These civil actions seek to recover amounts spent by government entities and other third-party providers on healthcare and welfare costs claimed to result from illnesses associated with smoking.\n- 19.  At 31 December 2021, one U.S. medical reimbursement suit ( Crow Creek Sioux Tribe v. American Tobacco Co. ) was pending against RJRT, B&W and Lorillard Tobacco in a Native American tribal court in South Dakota. The plaintiffs seek to recover actual and punitive damages, restitution, funding of a clinical cessation programme, funding of a corrective public education programme, and disgorgement of unjust profits from sales to minors. No other medical reimbursement suits are pending against these companies by county or other political subdivisions of the states.\n\n## U.S. Department of Justice Action\n\n- 20. On 22 September 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against various industry members, including RJRT, B&W, Lorillard Tobacco, B.A.T Industries p.l.c. (Industries) and Investments ( United States v. Philip Morris USA Inc. ). The U.S. Department of Justice initially sought (1) recovery of federal funds expended in providing health care to smokers who developed alleged smoking-related diseases pursuant to the Medical Care Recovery Act and Medicare Secondary Payer provisions of the Social Security Act and (2) equitable relief under the civil provisions of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), including disgorgement of roughly US$280 billion (approximately \u00a3206.7 billion) in profits the government contended were earned as a consequence of a purported racketeering 'enterprise' along with certain 'corrective communications'. In September 2000, the district court dismissed the government's Medical Care Recovery Act and Medicare Secondary Payer claims. In February 2005, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit (the DC Circuit) ruled that disgorgement was not an available remedy.\n- 21.  Industries was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction on 28 September 2000. In addition, Investments was a defendant at the trial, but intervening changes in controlling law posttrial led to a 28 March 2011 court ruling that the court's Final Judgment and Remedial Order no longer applied to Investments prospectively, and for this reason, Investments would not have to comply with any of the remaining injunctive remedies being sought by the government. As the government did not appeal the 28 March 2011 ruling, this means that Investments is no longer in the case and is not subject to any injunctive relief that the court is expected to order against the remaining defendants. As the case continued as against RJRT and Lorillard Tobacco with respect to injunctive relief and related matters, the following is noted.\n- 22. The non-jury trial of the RICO portion of the claim began on 21 September 2004 and ended on 9 June 2005. On 17 August 2006, the federal district court issued its Final Judgment and Remedial Order, which found certain defendants, including RJRT, B&W, Lorillard Tobacco and Investments, had violated RICO, but did not impose any direct financial penalties. The district court instead enjoined the defendants from committing future racketeering acts, participating in certain trade organisations, making misrepresentations concerning smoking and health and youth marketing, and using certain brand descriptors such as 'low tar', 'light', 'ultra-light', 'mild' and 'natural'. The district court also ordered the defendants to issue 'corrective communications' on five subjects, including smoking and health and addiction, and to comply with further undertakings, including maintaining websites of historical corporate documents and disseminating certain marketing information on a confidential basis to the government. In addition, the district court placed restrictions on the defendants' ability to dispose of certain assets for use in the United States, unless the transferee agrees to abide by the terms of the district court's order, and ordered certain defendants to reimburse the U.S. Department of Justice its taxable costs incurred in connection with the case.\n- 23. Defendants, including RJRT, B&W, Lorillard Tobacco and Investments, appealed, and the U.S. government crossappealed to the DC Circuit. On 22 May 2009, the DC Circuit affirmed the federal district court's RICO liability judgment, but vacated the order and remanded for further factual findings and clarification as to whether liability should be imposed against B&W, based on changes in the nature of B&W's business operations (including the extent of B&W's control over tobacco operations). The court also remanded on three other discrete issues relating to the injunctive remedies, including for the district court 'to reformulate' the injunction on the use of low-tar descriptors 'to exempt foreign activities that have no substantial, direct, and foreseeable domestic effects,' and for the district court to evaluate whether corrective communications could be required at point-of-sale displays (which requirement the DC Circuit vacated). On 28 June 2010, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the parties' petitions for further review.\n- 24. On 22 December 2010, the district court dismissed B&W from the litigation. In November 2012, the trial court entered an order setting forth the text of the corrective statements and directed the parties to engage in discussions with the Special Master to implement them. After various proceedings and appeals, the federal district court in October 2017 ordered RJRT and the other U.S. tobacco company defendants to fund the publishing of compelled public statements in various U.S. media outlets, including in newspapers, on television, on the companies' websites, and in onserts on cigarette packaging. The compelled public statements in newspapers and on television were completed in 2018 and in package onserts were completed in mid-2020. Also, the compelled public statements now appear on RJRT websites. The district court is considering mandating the display of the compelled public statements at retail point of sale; an evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on 13 June 2022.",

        "page_content": "## 31 Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments Continued\n\n## (b) Class Actions\n\n- 25. At 31 December 2021, RJRT, B&W and Lorillard Tobacco were named as defendants in two separate actions attempting to assert claims on behalf of classes of persons allegedly injured or financially impacted by their smoking, one asserting claims of violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, and SFNTC was named in 16 separate cases relating to the use of the words 'natural,' '100% additive-free,' or 'organic' in Natural American Spirit advertising and promotional materials. If the classes are or remain certified, separate trials may be needed to assess individual plaintiffs' damages. Among the pending class actions, 16 specified the amount of the claim in the complaint and alleged that the plaintiffs were seeking in excess of US$5 million (approximately \u00a33.7 million) and one that alleged that the plaintiffs were seeking less than US$75,000 (approximately \u00a355,370) per class member plus unspecified punitive damages.\n\n## No Additive/Natural/Organic Claim Cases\n\n- 26. A total of 16 pending putative class actions were filed in nine U.S. federal district courts against SFNTC, a subsidiary of Reynolds American, which cases generally allege, in various combinations, violations of state deceptive and unfair trade practice statutes, and claim state common law fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment based on the use of descriptors such as 'natural', 'organic' and '100% additivefree' in the marketing, labelling, advertising, and promotion of SFNTC's Natural American Spirit brand cigarettes. In these actions, the plaintiffs allege that the use of these terms suggests that Natural American Spirit brand cigarettes are less harmful than other cigarettes and, for that reason, violated state consumer protection statutes or amounted to fraud or a negligent or intentional misrepresentation. The actions seek various categories of recovery, including economic damages, injunctive relief (including medical monitoring and cessation programmes), interest, restitution, disgorgement, treble and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. In April 2016, in response to a motion by the various plaintiffs, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) consolidated these cases for pre-trial purposes before a federal court in New Mexico. On 21 December 2017, that court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss in part, dismissing a number of claims with prejudice, and denied it in part. The district court conducted a five-day hearing on the motion for class certification and on the motion challenging the admissibility of expert opinion testimony in December 2020. The parties filed post-hearing briefs in January 2021 and filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law in February 2021. A decision is pending.\n\n## Other Putative Class Actions\n\n- 27. Jones v. American Tobacco Co . is a putative class action filed in December 1998 in the Circuit Court, Jackson County, Missouri. The action was brought by a plaintiff on behalf of a putative class of Missouri tobacco product users and purchasers against various defendants, including RJRT, B&W and Lorillard Tobacco alleging that the plaintiffs' use of the defendants' tobacco products has caused them to become addicted to nicotine, and seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. There is currently no activity in this case.\n\n- 28. Young v. American Tobacco Co. is a case filed in November 1997 in the Circuit Court, Orleans Parish, Louisiana against various U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJRT and B&W, and parent companies of such manufacturers. This putative ETS class action was brought on behalf of a putative class of Louisiana residents who, though not themselves cigarette smokers, have been exposed to second-hand smoke from cigarettes manufactured by the defendants, and who allegedly suffered injury as a result of that exposure, and seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages. In March 2016, the court entered an order staying the case, including all discovery, pending the completion of an ongoing smoking cessation programme ordered by the court in a nowconcluded Louisiana state court certified class action, Scott v. American Tobacco Co.\n\n## Engle Class Action and Engle Progeny Cases (Florida)\n\n- 29. In July 1998, trial began in Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co ., a then-certified class action filed in Circuit Court, MiamiDade County, Florida, against U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJRT, B&W and Lorillard Tobacco. The then-certified class consisted of Florida citizens and residents, and their survivors, who suffered from smoking-related diseases that first manifested between 5 May 1990, and 21 November 1996, and were caused by an addiction to cigarettes. In July 1999, the jury in this Phase I found against RJRT, B&W, Lorillard Tobacco and the other defendants on common issues relating to the defendants' conduct, general causation, the addictiveness of cigarettes, and entitlement to punitive damages.\n- 30. In July 2000, the jury in Phase II awarded the class a total of approximately US$145 billion (approximately \u00a3107.1 billion) in punitive damages, apportioned US$36.3 billion (approximately \u00a326.8 billion) to RJRT, US$17.6 billion (approximately \u00a313 billion) to B&W, and US$16.3 billion (approximately \u00a312 billion) to Lorillard Tobacco. The three class representatives in the Engle class action were awarded US$13 million (approximately \u00a39.6 million) in compensatory damages.\n- 31.  This decision was appealed and ultimately resulted in the Florida Supreme Court in December 2006 decertifying the class and allowing judgments entered for only two of the three Engle class representatives to stand and setting aside the punitive damages award. The court preserved certain of the jury's Phase I findings, including that cigarettes can cause certain diseases, nicotine is addictive, and defendants placed defective cigarettes on the market, breached duties of care, concealed health-related information and conspired. Putative Engle class members were permitted to file individual lawsuits, deemed ' Engle progeny cases', against the Engle defendants, within one year of the Supreme Court's decision (subsequently extended to 11 January 2008).\n- 32. During 2015, RJRT and Lorillard Tobacco, together with Philip Morris USA Inc. (PM USA), settled virtually all of the Engle progeny cases then pending against them in federal district court. The total amount of the settlement was US$100 million (approximately \u00a373.8 million) divided as follows: RJRT US$42.5 million (approximately \u00a331.4 million); PM USA US$42.5 million (approximately \u00a331.4 million); and Lorillard Tobacco US$15 million (approximately \u00a311.1 million). The settlement covered more than 400 federal Engle progeny cases but did not cover 12 federal progeny cases previously tried to verdict and then pending on post-trial motions or appeal, and two federal progeny cases filed by different lawyers from the ones who negotiated the settlement for the plaintiffs.",

As at 31 December 2021, there were approximately 1,071 Engle progeny cases pending in which RJRT, B&W and/or Lorillard Tobacco have all been named as defendants and served. These cases include claims by or on behalf of 1,304 plaintiffs. In addition, as of 31 December 2021, RJRT was aware of four additional Engle progeny cases that have been filed but not served. The number of pending cases fluctuates for a variety of reasons, including voluntary and involuntary dismissals. Voluntary dismissals include cases in which a plaintiff accepts an 'offer of judgment' from RJRT, Lorillard Tobacco and/or RJRT's affiliates and indemnitees. An offer of judgment, if rejected by the plaintiff, preserves RJRT's and Lorillard Tobacco's right to recover attorneys' fees under Florida law in the event of a verdict favourable to RJRT or Lorillard Tobacco, or affiliates of such entities. Such offers are sometimes made through courtordered mediations.\n- 34. 41 trials occurred in Engle progeny cases in Florida state and federal courts against RJRT, B&W and/or Lorillard Tobacco from 1 January 2019 through 31 December 2021, and additional state court trials are scheduled for 2022.\n- 35.

By statute, Florida applies a US$200 million (approximately \u00a3147.7 million) bond cap to all Engle progeny cases in the aggregate. Individual bond caps for any given Engle progeny case vary depending on the number of judgments in effect at a given time. Judicial attempts by several plaintiffs in the Engle progeny cases to challenge the bond cap as violating the Florida Constitution have failed. In addition, bills have been introduced in sessions of the Florida legislature that would eliminate the Engle progeny bond cap, but those bills have not been enacted as of 31 December 2021.\n- 37.  In 2021, RJRT or Lorillard Tobacco paid judgments in five Engle progeny cases. Those payments totalled US$15.14 million (approximately \u00a311.2 million) in compensatory or punitive damages. Additional costs were paid in respect of attorneys' fees and statutory interest.\n- 38. In addition, accruals for damages and attorneys' fees and statutory interest for two cases ( Starr-Blundell v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Hardin v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. ) was recorded in Reynolds American's consolidated balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 to the value of US$208,400 (approximately \u00a3153,860).",

As of 31 December 2021, 222 individual cases were pending in the United States against RJRT, B&W and/or Lorillard Tobacco. This category of cases includes smoking and health cases alleging personal injuries caused by tobacco use or exposure brought by or on behalf of individual plaintiffs based on theories of negligence, strict liability, breach of express or implied warranty, and violations of state deceptive trade practices or consumer protection statutes. The plaintiffs seek to recover compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and punitive damages. The category does not include the Engle progeny cases, Broin II cases, and Filter Cases discussed above and below. One of the individual cases is brought by or on behalf of an individual or his/her survivors alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to ETS.\n- 40.

Please see earlier table in paragraph 35.\n\n(Note 16) Broin v. Philip Morris, Inc . was a class action filed in Circuit Court in Miami-Dade County, Florida in 1991 and brought on behalf of flight attendants alleged to have suffered from diseases or ailments caused by exposure to ETS in airplane cabins. In October 1997, RJRT, B&W, Lorillard Tobacco and other cigarette manufacturer defendants settled Broin , agreeing to pay a total of US$300 million (approximately \u00a3221.5 million) in three annual US$100 million (approximately \u00a373.8 million) instalments, allocated among the companies by market share, to fund research on the early detection and cure of diseases associated with tobacco smoke. It also required those companies to pay a total of US$49 million (approximately \u00a336.2 million) for the plaintiffs' counsel's fees and expenses. RJRT's portion of these payments was approximately US$86 million (approximately \u00a363.5 million); B&W's was approximately US$57 million (approximately \u00a342.1 million); and Lorillard Tobacco's was approximately US$31 million (approximately \u00a322.9 million). The settlement agreement, among other things, limits the types of claims class members may bring and eliminates claims for punitive damages. The settlement agreement also provides that, in individual cases by class members that are referred to as Broin II lawsuits, the defendants will bear the burden of proof with respect to whether ETS can cause certain specifically enumerated diseases, referred to as 'general causation'. With respect to all other liability issues, including whether an individual plaintiff's disease was caused by his or her exposure to ETS in airplane cabins, referred to as 'specific causation', individual plaintiffs will bear the burden of proof. On 7 September 1999, the Florida Supreme Court approved the settlement. There have been no Broin II trials since 2007. There have been periodic efforts to activate cases and the Group expects this to continue over time.\n\n(Note 17) Includes claims brought against Lorillard Tobacco and Lorillard Inc. by individuals who seek damages resulting from their alleged exposure to asbestos fibres that were incorporated into filter material used in one brand of cigarettes manufactured by a predecessor to Lorillard Tobacco for a limited period of time ending more than 50 years ago. Pursuant to the terms of a 1952 agreement between P. Lorillard Company and H&V Specialties Co., Inc. (the manufacturer of the filter material), Lorillard Tobacco is required to indemnify Hollingsworth & Vose for legal fees, expenses, judgments and resolutions in cases and claims alleging injury from finished products sold by P. Lorillard Company that contained the filter material. As of 31 December 2021, Lorillard Tobacco and/or Lorillard Inc. was a defendant in 46 Filter Cases. Since 1 January 2019, Lorillard Tobacco and RJRT have paid, or have reached agreement to pay, a total of approximately US$25.9 million (approximately \u00a319.1 million) in settlements to resolve 102 Filter Cases.\n\n## (d) State Settlement Agreements\n\n- 41.  In November 1998, the major U.S. cigarette manufacturers, including RJRT, B&W and Lorillard Tobacco, entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) with attorneys general representing 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories and possessions. These cigarette manufacturers previously settled four other cases, brought on behalf of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota, by separate agreements with each state (collectively and with the MSA, the 'State Settlement Agreements').\n- 42. These State Settlement Agreements settled all health care cost recovery actions brought by, or on behalf of, the settling jurisdictions; released the defending major U.S. cigarette manufacturers from various additional present and potential future claims; imposed future payment obligations in perpetuity on RJRT, B&W, Lorillard Tobacco and other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers; and placed significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products. In accordance with the MSA, various tobacco companies agreed to fund a US$5.2 billion (approximately \u00a33.8 billion) trust fund to be used to address the possible adverse economic impact of the MSA on tobacco growers.",

RJRT and SFNTC are subject to the substantial payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements. Payments under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to various adjustments for, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold, relative market share, operating profit and inflation. Reynolds American's operating subsidiaries' expenses and payments under the State Settlement Agreements for 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 and the projected expenses and payments for 2022 and onwards are set forth below (in millions of U.S. dollars)*:\n\n2023 and\n\n|                                    | 2018   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022    | thereafter   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------------|\n| Settlement expenses                | $2,741 | $2,762 | $3,572 | $3,420 |         |              |\n| Settlement cash payments           | $917   | $2,918 | $2,848 | $3,744 |         |              |\n| Projected settlement expenses      |        |        |        |        | $>3,300 | $>3,200      |\n| Projected settlement cash payments |        |        |        |        | $>3,100 | $>3,200      |\n\n- 44. The State Settlement Agreements have materially adversely affected RJRT's shipment volumes. Reynolds American believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of Reynolds American and RJRT in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJRT's share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the State Settlement Agreements.\n- 45. In addition, the MSA includes an adjustment that potentially reduces the annual payment obligations of RJRT, Lorillard Tobacco and the other signatories to the MSA, known as 'Participating Manufacturers' (PMs). Certain requirements, collectively referred to as the 'Adjustment Requirements', must be satisfied before the Non-Participating Manufacturers (NPM) Adjustment for a given year is available: (i) an Independent Auditor must determine that the PMs have experienced a market share loss, beyond a triggering threshold, to those manufacturers that do not participate in the MSA (such non-participating manufacturers being referred to as NPMs); and (ii) in a binding arbitration proceeding, a firm of independent economic consultants must find that the disadvantages of the MSA were a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share. This finding is known as a significant factor determination.\n- 46. When the Adjustment Requirements are satisfied, the MSA provides that the NPM Adjustment applies to reduce the annual payment obligation of the PMs. However, an individual settling state may avoid its share of the NPM Adjustment if it had in place and diligently enforced during the entirety of the relevant year a 'Qualifying Statute' that imposes escrow obligations on NPMs that are comparable to what the NPMs would have owed if they had joined the MSA. In such event, the state's share of the NPM Adjustment is reallocated to other settling states, if any, that did not have in place and diligently enforce a Qualifying Statute.\n- 47.  RJRT and Lorillard Tobacco are or were involved in NPM Adjustment proceedings concerning the years 2003 to 2019. In 2012, RJRT, Lorillard Tobacco, and SFNTC entered into an agreement (the Term Sheet) with certain settling states that resolved accrued and potential NPM adjustments for the years 2003 through 2012 and, as a result, RJRT and SFNTC collectively received, or are to receive, more than US$1.1 billion (approximately \u00a3812.1 million) in credits that, in substantial part, were applied to MSA payments in 2014 through 2017. After an arbitration panel ruled in September 2013 that six states had not diligently enforced their qualifying statutes in the year 2003, additional states joined the Term Sheet. RJRT executed the NPM Adjustment Settlement Agreement on 25 September 2017 (which incorporated the Term Sheet). Since the NPM Adjustment Settlement Agreement was executed, an additional 10 states have joined. NPM proceedings are ongoing and could result in further reductions of the companies' MSA-related payments.\n- 48. On 18 January 2017, the State of Florida filed a motion to join Imperial Tobacco Group, PLC (ITG) as a defendant and to enforce the Florida State Settlement Agreement, which motion sought payment under the Florida State Settlement Agreement of approximately US$45 million (approximately \u00a333.2 million) with respect to the four brands (Winston, Salem, Kool and Maverick) that were sold to ITG in the divestiture of certain assets, on 12 June 2015, by subsidiaries or affiliates of Reynolds American and Lorillard, together with the transfer of certain employees and certain liabilities, to a wholly owned subsidiary of Imperial Brands plc (the Divestiture), referred to as the 'Acquired Brands'. The motion also claimed future annual losses of approximately US$30 million per year (approximately \u00a322.1 million) absent the court's enforcement of the Florida State Settlement Agreement. The State's motion sought, among other things, an order declaring that RJRT and ITG are in breach of the Florida Settlement Agreement and are required, jointly and severally, to make annual payments to the State under the Florida State Settlement Agreement with respect to the Acquired Brands. In addition, on 18 January 2017, PM USA filed a motion to enforce the Florida State Settlement Agreement, asserting among other things that RJRT and ITG breached that agreement by failing to make settlement payments as to the Acquired Brands, which PM USA asserts has improperly shifted settlement payment obligations to PM USA. On 27 January 2017, RJRT sought leave to file a supplemental pleading for breach by ITG of its obligations regarding joinder into the Florida State Settlement Agreement. The Florida court, on 30 March 2017, ruled that ITG should be joined into the enforcement action.",

After a bench trial, on 27 December 2017 the court entered an order holding that RJRT (not ITG) is liable for annual settlement payments for the Acquired Brands, finding that ITG did not assume liability for annual settlement payments under the terms of the asset purchase agreement relating to the Divestiture and RJRT remained liable for payments under the Florida State Settlement Agreement as to the Acquired Brands. In January 2018, the auditor of the Florida State Settlement Agreement adjusted the final 2017 invoice for the annual payment and amended the 2015 and 2016 invoices for the respective annual payment and the net operating profit penalty for each of those years under the Florida Settlement Agreement, based on the auditor's interpretation of the court's order. The adjusted invoices reflected amounts due to both the State of Florida and PM USA. In total, the estimated additional amounts due were US$99 million (approximately \u00a373.1 million) with US$84 million (approximately \u00a362 million) to the State of Florida and US$16 million (approximately \u00a311.8 million) to PM USA. RJRT advised the auditor that it disputed these amounts, and therefore no further amounts were due or would be paid for those years pending the final resolution of RJRT's appeal of the court's order. On 23 January 2018, RJRT filed a notice of appeal, and on 25 January 2018, RJRT filed an amended notice of appeal, and PM USA filed a notice of appeal as to the court's ruling as to ITG. On 26 January 2018, the State moved for recovery of its attorneys' fees and costs from RJRT. The State and PM USA filed a joint motion for the entry of final judgment on 1 February 2018. The court declined to enter a final judgment until after resolution of the dispute between RJRT and PM USA regarding PM USA's assertion that settlement payment obligations have been improperly shifted to PM USA. On 15 August 2018, the court entered a final judgment in the action (the Final Judgment). As a result of the Final Judgment, PM USA's challenge to RJRT's accounting assumptions related to the Acquired Brands was rendered moot, subject to reinstatement if ITG joins the Florida State Settlement Agreement or if judgment is reversed. On 29 August 2018, RJRT filed a notice of appeal on the Final Judgment. On 7 September 2018, PM USA filed a notice of appeal with respect to the court's ruling as to ITG. On 12 September 2018, RJRT filed a motion to consolidate RJRT's appeal with the appeal filed by PM USA, which was granted on 1 October 2018. Appellate briefing was completed on 6 February 2020. Oral argument, originally scheduled for 7 April 2020, was conducted through video conference on 9 June 2020. On 29 July 2020, Florida's Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the Final Judgement. On 12 August 2020, RJRT filed a motion for rehearing or for certification to the Florida Supreme Court of the 29 July 2020 decision. On 10 June 2020, RJRT posted an additional bond in the amount of US$84,102,984.75 (approximately \u00a362.1 million), over the US$103,694,155.08 (approximately \u00a376.6 million) bond initially posted, to cover additional disputed amounts plus two years of statutory interest. The total amount RJRT bonded for its appeal was US$187,797,139.83 (approximately \u00a3138.6 million). RJRT's motion for rehearing or certification to the Florida Supreme Court was denied on 18 September 2020 and its motion for review was denied by the Florida Supreme Court on 18 December 2020. On 5 October 2020, RJRT satisfied the Final Judgment (approximately US$192,869,589.86 (approximately \u00a3142,400,000)) and paid approximately US$3.2 million (approximately \u00a32.4 million) of Florida's attorneys' fees. RJRT's appellate bonds were released to RJRT by order dated 5 November 2020. RJRT is seeking indemnification from ITG in the Delaware action, as described below.\n- 50. On 17 February 2017, ITG filed an action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware seeking declaratory relief against Reynolds American and RJRT. In its complaint, ITG asked the court to declare various matters related to its rights and obligations under the asset purchase agreement (and related documents) relating to the Divestiture with respect to the subject of the Florida enforcement litigation. On 24 March 2017, Reynolds American and RJRT answered the ITG complaint and counterclaimed. Cross-motions for partial judgment on the pleadings were filed focusing on whether ITG's obligation to use 'reasonable best efforts' to join the Florida State Settlement Agreement continued after the 12 June 2015 closing. On 30 November 2017, following argument, the Delaware court ruled in favour of RJRT, holding that ITG's obligation to use its reasonable best efforts to join the Florida Settlement Agreement did not terminate due to the closing of the asset purchase agreement relating to the Divestiture. On 4 January 2019, RJRT filed another motion for partial judgment on the pleadings seeking to resolve two contract-interpretation questions under the asset purchase agreement: first, to the extent RJRT is held liable for any settlement payments based on post-closing sales of the Acquired Brands, ITG assumed this liability, and second, that the asset purchase agreement does not entitle ITG to a unique protection from an equityfee law that does not yet exist in a Previously Settled State. Argument on RJRT's motion for partial judgment was heard on 4 June 2019. On 23 September 2019, the Delaware Chancery Court declined to resolve, at that time, the first issue, whether ITG had assumed any liability imposed on RJRT for making settlement payments on ITG's brands. The court concluded that both sides had presented reasonable interpretations of the asset purchase agreement, which was therefore ambiguous, so the court would receive any parole evidence that may exist to help interpret the intent of the asset purchase agreement on assumed liabilities. The court granted RJRT's motion on the second issue and ruled that ITG could not refuse to join the Florida State Settlement Agreement unless a joinder exempted it from a future equity-fee statute. On 11 October 2019, ITG filed in the Chancery Court a motion to seek interlocutory appeal in the Delaware Supreme Court on the second issue, which was denied on 31 October 2019. On 31 October 2019, ITG filed a notice of interlocutory appeal directly to the Delaware Supreme Court, which was denied on 7 November 2019. Following the settlement of the Minnesota and Texas enforcement litigation, as described below, claims in the Delaware litigation with respect to those states were voluntarily dismissed by orders entered, respectively, on 7 April 2021 and 2 June 2021. On 20 August 2021, Reynolds American and RJRT amended their counterclaims to account for those settlements, as well as the resolution of the Florida enforcement litigation, described above, which included adding a claim for indemnification for the Final Judgment in Florida. Discovery is ongoing and scheduled to end in early 2022. A hearing on summary judgment motions is scheduled to follow, and trial is scheduled to begin on 8 September 2022.\n- 51.  On 26 March 2018, the State of Minnesota filed a motion against RJRT to enforce the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement, which motion sought payments under the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement of approximately US$40 million (approximately \u00a329.5 million) with respect to the Acquired Brands. The motion also claimed future annual losses of approximately US$15 million (approximately \u00a311.1 million) absent the court's enforcement of the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement.",

The State's motion against RJRT and complaint against ITG sought, among other things, an order declaring that RJRT and ITG were in breach of the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement and were jointly and severally liable to make annual payments to the State of Minnesota under the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement with respect to the Acquired Brands. In addition, on 28 March 2018, PM USA filed a motion to enforce the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement, asserting, among other things, that RJRT and ITG breached the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement by failing to make settlement payments as to the Acquired Brands, which PM USA asserted had improperly shifted settlement payment obligations to PM USA. On 27 March 2018, the Minnesota court consolidated the motions to enforce and separate complaint against ITG into one proceeding captioned In re Petition of the State of Minnesota for an Order Compelling Payments of Settlement Proceeds Related to ITG Brands LLC , Court File No. 62-CV-181912. On 11 June 2018, the court held a scheduling conference in the case and by order dated 21 June 2018, set a discovery schedule for the case, under which discovery is complete. A hearing on the motions to enforce to determine if RJRT and/ or ITG are liable to make payments on the Acquired Brands was held on 26 June 2019. On 24 September 2019, the Minnesota District Court issued an Order and Memorandum, holding RJRT liable for settlement payments on the Acquired Brands, and determining the issue of whether ITG is a 'successor or assign' of RJRT under the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement is unresolved, reasoning ITG's status depends on whether it satisfied its post-closing obligation to expend its reasonable best efforts to join the Minnesota State Settlement Agreement. On 23 December 2019, ITG filed a motion in the Minnesota District Court seeking certification of an appeal of certain questions arising from the 24 September 2019 order. On 21 January 2020, a hearing was held on ITG's motion seeking certification of an appeal. On 19 February 2020, the Minnesota District Court entered an Order and Memorandum denying ITG's motion for certification. A multi-day hearing to determine whether ITG is liable for settlement payments was completed on 9 September 2020. The parties filed post-hearing briefs on 13 November 2020. A status conference was held on 3 March 2021, during which the parties agreed to notify the Court of the status of settlement discussions by 15 March 2021. On 15 March 2021, the parties resolved all claims and an order of dismissal was entered by the Minnesota district court on 17 March 2021.\n\n- 52.  On 28 January 2019, the State of Texas filed motions in the original Texas health care reimbursement case, brought against the tobacco industry that led to the Texas State Settlement Agreement, to join ITG as a defendant and to enforce the Texas State Settlement Agreement against RJRT and ITG, seeking payment under the Texas State Settlement Agreement of approximately US$125 million (approximately \u00a392.3 million) with respect to the Acquired Brands that were sold to ITG in the Divestiture. The motion also claimed future annual losses of an unspecified amount absent the court's enforcement of the Texas State Settlement Agreement. The State's motion sought, among other things, an order declaring that RJRT, or in the alternative, ITG, is in breach of the Texas Settlement Agreement and is required to make annual payments to the State under the Texas State Settlement Agreement with respect to the Acquired Brands. In addition, on 29 January 2019,\n\nPM USA filed a motion to enforce the Texas State Settlement Agreement, asserting among other things that RJRT and ITG breached that agreement by failing to make settlement payments as to the Acquired Brands, which PM USA asserts has improperly shifted settlement payment obligations to PM USA. After completion of discovery, a hearing on the motions to enforce was held on 30 October 2019. On 25 February 2020, the Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order holding that RJRT remains liable for settlement payments on the Acquired Brands under the Texas Settlement Agreement. The Court further held that, although ITG is unambiguously an assign within the meaning of the Texas Settlement Agreement, a final determination of the scope of ITG's obligations under the asset purchase agreement is to be determined in the litigation pending before the Delaware Court. Pursuant to the Court's direction, on 9 March 2020 the parties submitted a status report indicating the remaining issues before the Court include RJRT's position that the Court should subtract the equity fee payments made on the Acquired Brands by ITG's distributors from the settlement payments due by RJRT after including the Acquired Brands in calculating damages, whether a final judgment should be entered in favour of ITG, whether a partial final judgment should be entered against RJRT and the State's request for an award of attorneys' fees and costs against RJRT and/or ITG. On 5 May 2020 the Court entered final judgment (later clarified in a 14 August 2020 amended judgment) on the State's motion, ordering RJRT to pay all settlement amounts due on the Acquired Brands under the Texas Settlement Agreement; granting RJRT a full dollar-fordollar set-off for all equity fee payments made on the Acquired Brands by ITG or its distributors, but holding RJRT liable for any equity fee payments that are lawfully refunded; and ordering the case closed, to be reopened after ITG's liability under the asset purchase agreement is determined by the Delaware Court. ITG's equity fee payments to Texas for the Acquired Brands currently equal approximately 90% of the annual Texas settlement payments for those brands. Thus, the settlement payments for those Acquired Brands exceed ITG's equity fee payments by approximately US$3 million (approximately \u00a32.2 million) per year. As such, RJRT would owe approximately US$3 million (approximately \u00a32.2 million) a year after an equity fee credit. Due to how the profit penalty is allocated, RJRT will pay approximately US$10 million (approximately \u00a37.4 million) less in 2019 in Texas payments than it would have paid had ITG joined, with that trend continuing in future years. However, because ITG made equity fee payments at a substantially lower rate before 2019, and because of how the profit penalty was calculated before now, RJRT owed approximately US$260.4 million (before interest) (approximately \u00a3192.2 million) in past payments under the judgment through 2020. On 3 and 4 June 2020, respectively, RJRT and ITG filed notices of appeal of the 5 May 2020 judgment. In August 2020, RJRT filed a notice of appeal, and in September 2020, the State and ITG filed notices of appeal from the portion of the judgment denying the motion to remove the equity fee set-off. RJRT moved to dismiss ITG's appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which motion was ordered by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to be argued with ITG's appeal. On 2 November 2020 RJRT filed its appellate brief. On 19 January 2021 the parties filed responses. On 21 May 2021, the parties entered into a settlement agreement resolving all claims. On 27 May 2021, the parties filed a stipulation dismissing all claims, and on 28 May 2021, the Fifth Circuit dismissed the parties' appeals.",

On 26 December 2018, PM USA filed a Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement against RJRT and ITG alleging RJRT and ITG failed to act in good faith in calculating the base-year net operating profits for the Acquired Brands, claiming damages of approximately US$6 million (approximately \u00a34.4 million) through 2017. On 21 February 2019, the Chancery Court of Jackson County, Mississippi held a scheduling conference and issued a discovery schedule order. A hearing on PM USA's Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement originally scheduled for 3-6 May 2021 was adjourned on consent of the parties to 11-12 August 2021. On 8 June 2021, PM USA and RJRT entered into a settlement agreement resolving the outstanding payment calculation issues. On 11 June 2021, the Mississippi Chancery Court entered an order withdrawing PM USA's motion to enforce. On 3 December 2019, the State of Mississippi filed a Notice of Violation and Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement in the Chancery Court of Jackson County, Mississippi against RJRT, PM USA and ITG, seeking a declaration that the base year 1997 net operating profit to be used in calculating the Net Operating Profit Adjustment was not affected by the change in the federal corporate tax rate in 2018 from 35% to 21%, and an order requiring RJRT to pay the approximately US$5 million (approximately \u00a33.7 million) difference in its 2018 payment because of this issue. Determination of this issue may affect RJRT's annual payment thereafter. A hearing on Mississippi's Motion to Enforce Settlement Agreement occurred on 6-7 October 2021.\n- 54. In January 2021, RJRT reached an agreement with several MSA states to waive RJRT's claims under the MSA in connection with a settlement between those MSA states and a non-participating manufacturer, S&M Brands, Inc. (S&M Brands), under which the states released certain claims against S&M Brands in exchange for receiving a portion of the funds S&M Brands had deposited into escrow accounts in those states pursuant to the states' escrow statutes. In consideration for waiving claims, RJRT, together with SFNTC, received approximately $55.4 million from the escrow funds paid to those MSA states under their settlement with S&M Brands.\n\n## Tobacco-Related Litigation Outside the U.S.\n\n55. As at 31 December 2021:\n\n- a. medical reimbursement actions are being brought in Angola, Brazil, Canada, Nigeria and South Korea;\n- b. class actions are being brought in Canada and Venezuela; and\n- c. active tobacco product liability claims against the Group's companies existed in 12 markets outside the U.S. The only markets with five or more claims were Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Nigeria and Italy.\n\n## (a) Medical reimbursement cases\n\n## Angola\n\n- 56. In or about November 2016, BAT Angola affiliate Sociedade Unificada de Tabacos de Angola (SUT) was served with a collective action filed in the Provincial Court of Luanda, 2nd Civil Section, by the consumer association Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Angolana dos Direitos do Consumidor (AADIC). The lawsuit seeks damages of AOA 800,000,000 (approximately \u00a31,000,000) allegedly incurred by the Angolan Instituto Nacional do Controlo do Cancro (INCC) for the cost of treating tobacco-related disease, non-material damages allegedly suffered by certain individual smokers on the rolls of INCC, and the mandating of certain cigarette package warnings. SUT filed its answer to the claim on or about 5 December 2016. The case remains pending.\n\n## Argentina\n\n- 57.  In 2007, the non-governmental organisation the Argentina Tort Law Association (ATLA) and Emma Mendoza Voguet brought a reimbursement action against Nobleza Piccardo S.A.I.C.y.F. (Nobleza) and Massal\u00edn Particulares. The case is being heard in the Contentious Administrative Court. The parties filed conclusive briefs on 20 May 2019. On 11 May 2021, the Court dismissed the case on the basis of plaintiffs' lack of legal standing to bring the suit. Plaintiffs did not appeal within the applicable deadline and accordingly the judgment dismissing the case has become final.\n\n## Canada\n\n- 58. On 1 March 2019, the Quebec Court of Appeal handed down a judgment which largely upheld and endorsed the lower court's previous decision in two Quebec class actions (the Quebec Class Actions), as further described below. The share of the judgment for Imperial, the Group's operating company in Canada, is approximately CAD $9.2 billion (approximately \u00a35.4 billion). As a result of this judgment, there were attempts by the Quebec plaintiffs to obtain payment out of the CAD $758 million (approximately \u00a3443 million) on deposit with the court. JTIMacDonald Corp (a co-defendant in the cases) filed for creditor protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the CCAA) on 8 March 2019. A court order to stay all tobacco litigation in Canada against all defendants (including RJRT and its affiliate R.J. Reynolds Tobacco International Inc. (collectively, the RJR Companies)) until 4 April 2019 was obtained, and the need for a mediation process to resolve all the outstanding litigation across the country was recognised. On 12 March 2019 Imperial filed for creditor protection under the CCAA. In its application Imperial asked the Ontario Superior Court to stay all pending or contemplated litigation against Imperial, certain of its subsidiaries and all other Group companies that were defendants in the Canadian tobacco litigation, including British American Tobacco p.l.c. (the Company), Investments, Industries and Carreras Rothmans Limited (collectively, the UK Companies). On 22 March 2019, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. also filed for CCAA protection and obtained a stay of proceedings (together with the other two stays, the Stays). The Stays are currently in place until 31 March 2022. While the Stays are in place, no steps are to be taken in connection with the Canadian tobacco litigation with respect to any of the defendants.\n- 59. The below represents the state of the referenced litigation as at the advent of the Stays.\n- 60. Following the implementation of legislation enabling provincial governments to recover health-care costs directly from tobacco manufacturers, 10 actions for recovery of health-care costs arising from the treatment of smoking- and health-related diseases have been brought. These proceedings name various Group companies as defendants, including the UK Companies and Imperial as well as the RJR Companies. Pursuant to the terms of the 1999 sale of RJRT's international tobacco business to Japan Tobacco Incorporated (JTI), JTI has agreed to indemnify RJRT for all liabilities and obligations (including litigation costs) arising in respect of the Canadian recoupment actions. Subject to a reservation of rights, JTI has assumed the defence of the RJR Companies in these actions.\n- 61.  The 10 cases were proceeding in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The enabling legislation is in force in all 10 provinces. In addition, legislation has received Royal Assent in two of the three territories in Canada, but has yet to be proclaimed into force.",

British American Tobacco (Nigeria) Limited (BAT Nigeria), the Company and Investments have been named as defendants in a medical reimbursement action by the federal government of Nigeria, filed on 6 November 2007 in the Federal High Court, and in similar actions filed by the Nigerian states of Kano (9 May 2007), Oyo (30 May 2007), Lagos (13 March 2008), Ogun (26 February 2008), and Gombe (17 October 2008) commenced in their respective High Courts. In the five cases that remain active, the plaintiffs seek a total of approximately 10.6 trillion Nigerian naira (approximately \u00a314.9 billion) in damages, including special, anticipatory and punitive damages, restitution and disgorgement of profits, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief.\n- 63. The suits claim that the state and federal government plaintiffs incurred costs related to the treatment of smoking-related illnesses resulting from allegedly tortious conduct by the defendants in the manufacture, marketing, and sale of tobacco products in Nigeria, and assert that the plaintiffs are entitled to reimbursement for such costs. The plaintiffs assert causes of action for negligence, negligent design, fraud and deceit, fraudulent concealment, breach of express and implied warranty, public nuisance, conspiracy, strict liability, indemnity, restitution, unjust enrichment, voluntary assumption of a special undertaking, and performance of another's duty to the public.\n- 64. The Company and Investments have made a number of challenges to the jurisdiction of the Nigerian courts. Such challenges are still pending (on appeal) against the federal government and the states of Lagos, Kano, Gombe and Ogun. The underlying cases are stayed or adjourned pending the final outcome of these jurisdictional challenges. In the state of Oyo, on 13 November 2015, and 24 February 2017, respectively, the Company's and Investments' jurisdictional challenges were successful in the Court of Appeal and the issuance of the writ of summons was set aside.\n\n## South Korea\n\n- 65. In April 2014, Korea's National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) filed a healthcare recoupment action against KT&G (a Korean tobacco company), PM Korea and BAT Korea (including BAT Korea Manufacturing). The NHIS is seeking damages of roughly 54 billion Korean Won (approximately \u00a333.5 million) in respect of health care costs allegedly incurred by the NHIS treating patients with lung (small cell and squamous cell) and laryngeal (squamous cell) cancer between 2003 and 2012. Court hearings in the case, which constitute the trial, commenced in September 2014. On 20 November 2020, the court issued a judgment in favour of the defendants and dismissing all of the plaintiff's claims. The NHIS filed an appeal of the judgment on 11 December 2020. Appellate proceedings commenced in June 2021 and remain ongoing.",

On 21 May 2019, the Federal Attorney's Office (AGU) in Brazil filed an action in the Federal Court of Rio Grande do Sul against the Company, the BAT Group's Brazilian subsidiary Souza Cruz LTDA (Souza Cruz), Philip Morris International, Philip Morris Brazil Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9rcio LTDA and Philip Morris Brasil S/A, asserting claims for medical reimbursement for funds allegedly expended by the federal government as public health care expenses to treat 26 tobacco-related diseases over the last five years and that will be expended in perpetuity during future years, including diseases allegedly caused both by cigarette smoking and exposure to ETS. The action includes a claim for moral damages allegedly suffered by Brazilian society to be paid into a public welfare fund. The action is for an unspecified amount of monetary compensation, as the AGU seeks a bifurcated action in which liability would be determined in the first phase followed by an evidentiary phase to ascertain damages.\n- 67.  On 19 July 2019, the trial court ordered that service of the action on the Company be effected via service on Souza Cruz. On 6 August 2019, Souza Cruz refused to receive service on behalf of the Company due to Souza Cruz's lack of power to receive the summons on behalf of the Company and such refusal was attached to the case files on 9 August 2019. On 7 August 2019, Souza Cruz was served with the complaint by the AGU and Souza Cruz's acknowledgement of service was attached to the case files on 12 August 2019.\n- 68. On 19 August 2019, Souza Cruz filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the 19 July 2019 trial court order permitting the AGU to effect service on the Company by serving Souza Cruz and requesting a stay of the proceedings until the appeal is decided. Souza Cruz also appealed the fact that several documents attached to the AGU's complaint are in English, without proper translation, and it also appealed the very short term of 30 days for the defendants to prepare their defences.\n- 69. On 20 August 2019, Souza Cruz informed the trial court about the appeal and the trial court entered an order, which ordered the closure of the online system preventing the parties from submitting any petition so that no prejudice would be caused to the defendants and permitted the AGU, within 15 days of its notification, to respond to the argument that the service of a foreign defendant via its Brazilian subsidiary constituted improper service. On 21 August 2019, the substitute reporting judge of the appellate court, having been notified that the trial court judge had in the meantime issued a new decision (thereby revoking the previous decision), ruled that the appeal filed had therefore been rendered moot. The AGU filed its submission in the trial court on 19 September 2019, and Souza Cruz filed a reply submission on 25 September 2019. Souza Cruz reported on 4 February 2020 that the trial court ruled that service of the Company via its Brazilian subsidiary constituted proper service, denied the request for additional time to file defences, denied the request to have the foreign language documents attached to the initial complaint fully translated into Portuguese, and ordered that defences be filed within 30 business days. On 18 February 2020, Souza Cruz filed an interlocutory appeal (including a request to stay the deadline to file defences). On 12 March 2020, the court denied the request for a stay. On 11 May 2020, the Company filed a petition to intervene in Souza Cruz's interlocutory appeal. On 17 June 2020, AGU filed its opposition to Souza Cruz's interlocutory appeal. The Company filed a reply submission on 8 July 2020. On 15 July 2020, the court denied the interlocutory appeal.\n\nSouza Cruz and the Company submitted on 6 August 2020 requests for clarification of this appellate decision. The court granted the Company's request to intervene, and rejected Souza Cruz and the Company's request for clarification of the appellate decision, which decision became final on 6 June 2021. Souza Cruz and the Company filed their respective defences on 12 May 2020. On 19 May 2020, a notice was sent to the Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF) regarding the AGU's request that the MPF join the action as a plaintiff. The MPF, in its response filed 10 July 2020, rejected the AGU's request, and declined to join the action as party, but will act as an 'inspector of the law', which enables MPF to express its opinion on matters in the case. The court to date has not opened up the term for the AGU to reply to the defences presented. On 19 February 2021, the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o de Controle do Tabagismo, Promo\u00e7\u00e3o da Sa\u00fade (ACT) filed a petition seeking to intervene in the case as amicus curiae , which petition remains pending. On 25 March 2021 and 26 March 2021, respectively, Souza Cruz and PMB filed petitions requesting that ACT's powers be limited should ACT be admitted as amicus curiae . On 19 May 2021, ACT filed a brief in further support of its amicus curiae petition. On 8 August 2021, the Company responded to ACT's request to intervene as amicus curiae , arguing that ACT's request should be rejected or in the alternative that the scope of ACT's intervention rights should be limited. On 31 August 2021, ACT responded to the Company's submission. A court ruling on ACT's petition is pending.\n\n## (b) Class Actions\n\n## Canada\n\n- 70.  As noted above, on 1 March 2019 the Quebec Court of Appeal handed down a judgment which largely upheld and endorsed the lower court's previous decision in two Quebec Class Actions, as further described below. Imperial's share of the judgment is approximately CAD $9.2 billion (approximately \u00a35.4 billion). As a result of this judgment, there were attempts by the Quebec plaintiffs to obtain payment out of the CAD $758 million (approximately \u00a3443 million) on deposit with the court. JTI-MacDonald Corp (a co-defendant in the cases) filed for creditor protection under the CCAA on 8 March 2019. A court order to stay all tobacco litigation in Canada against all defendants (including the RJR Companies) until 4 April 2019 was obtained, and the need for a mediation process to resolve all the outstanding litigation across the country was recognized. On 12 March 2019 Imperial filed for protection under the CCAA. In its application Imperial asked the Ontario Superior Court to stay all pending or contemplated litigation against Imperial, certain of its subsidiaries and all other Group companies that were defendants in the Canadian tobacco litigation, including the UK Companies. On 22 March 2019, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. also filed for CCAA protection and obtained a stay of proceedings (together with the other two stays, the Stays). The Stays are currently in place until 31 March 2022. While the Stays are in place, no steps are to be taken in connection with the Canadian tobacco litigation with respect to any of the defendants.\n- 71.  The below represents the state of the referenced litigation as at the advent of the Stays.\n- 72.  There are 11 class actions being brought in Canada against Group companies.",

        "page_content": "## 31 Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments Continued\n\n- 73. Knight Class Action : the Supreme Court of British Columbia certified a class of all consumers who purchased Imperial cigarettes in British Columbia bearing 'light' or 'mild' descriptors since 1974. The plaintiff is seeking compensation for amounts spent on 'light and mild' products and a disgorgement of profits from Imperial on the basis that the marketing of light and mild cigarettes was deceptive because it conveyed a false and misleading message that those cigarettes are less harmful than regular cigarettes.\n- 74.  On appeal, the appellate court confirmed the certification of the class, but limited any financial liability, if proven, to 1997 onward. Imperial's third-party claim against the federal government was dismissed by the Supreme Court of Canada. The federal government is seeking a cost order of CAD$5 million (approximately \u00a32.9 million) from Imperial relating to its now dismissed third-party claim. After being dormant for several years, the plaintiff delivered a Notice of Intention to Proceed, and Imperial delivered an application to dismiss the action for delay. The application was heard on 23 June 2017 and was dismissed on 23 August 2017. Notice to class members of certification was provided on 14 February 2018. As at the date of the Stays, the next steps were expected to include discoveryrelated ones.\n- 75. Growers' Class Action : in December 2009, Imperial was served with a proposed class action filed by Ontario tobacco farmers and the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers' Marketing Board. The plaintiffs allege that Imperial and the Canadian subsidiaries of Philip Morris International and JTI failed to pay the agreed domestic contract price to the growers used in products manufactured for the export market and which were ultimately smuggled back into Canada. JTI has sought indemnification pursuant to the JTI Indemnities (discussed below at paragraphs 137-138). The plaintiffs seek damages in the amount of CAD$50 million (approximately \u00a329.2 million). Various preliminary challenges have been heard, the last being a motion for summary judgment on a limitation period. The motion was dismissed and ultimately, leave to appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed in November 2016. In December 2017, the plaintiffs proposed that the action proceed by way of individual actions as opposed to a class action. The defendants did not consent. As at the date of the Stays, the claim was in abeyance pending further action from the plaintiffs.\n- 76. Quebec Class Actions : there are currently two class actions in Quebec. On 21 February 2005, the Quebec Superior Court granted certification in two class actions against Imperial and two other domestic manufacturers. The court certified two classes, with the class definitions being revised in the judgment rendered 27 May 2015. One class consists of residents of Quebec who (a) smoked before 20 November 1998 at least 12 pack years of cigarettes manufactured by the defendants; and (b) were diagnosed before 12 March 2012 with: lung cancer, or cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) of the throat, or emphysema. The group also includes the heirs of persons deceased after 20 November 1998 who meet the criteria described above. The second consists of residents of Quebec who, as of 30 September 1998, were addicted to nicotine contained in cigarettes and who in addition meet the following three criteria: (a) they started smoking before 30 September 1994 by smoking cigarettes manufactured by the defendants; (b) between 1 September and 30 September 1998 they smoked on average at least 15 cigarettes manufactured by the defendants on a daily basis; and (c) they still smoked an average of at least 15 cigarettes manufactured by the defendants as of 21 February 2005, or until their death if it occurred before that date.\n\nThe group also includes the heirs of members who meet the criteria described above. Pursuant to the judgment, the plaintiffs were awarded damages and interest against Imperial and the Canadian subsidiaries of Philip Morris International and JTI in the amount of CAD$15.6 billion (approximately \u00a39.1 billion), most of which was on a joint and several basis, of which Imperial's share was CAD$10.4 billion (approximately \u00a36.1 billion). An appeal of the judgment was filed on 26 June 2015. The court also awarded provisional execution pending appeal of CAD$1,131 million (approximately \u00a3661.1 million), of which Imperial's share was approximately CAD$742 million (approximately \u00a3433.7 million). This order was subsequently overturned by the Court of Appeal. Following the cancellation of the order for provisional execution, the plaintiffs filed a motion against Imperial and one other manufacturer seeking security in the amount of CAD $5 billion (approximately \u00a32.9 billion) to guarantee, in whole or in part, the payment of costs of the appeal and the judgment. On 27 October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered the parties to post security in the amount of CAD$984 million (approximately \u00a3575.1 million), of which Imperial's share was CAD$758 million (approximately \u00a3443 million). The security was paid in seven equal quarterly instalments of just over CAD$108 million (approximately \u00a363.1 million) between 31 December 2015 and 30 June 2017. The appeal was heard in November 2016. On 1 March 2019, the trial judgment was upheld by a unanimous decision of the five-member panel of the Court of Appeal, with one exception being an amendment to the original interest calculation applied to certain portions of the judgment. The interest adjustment has resulted in the reduction of the total maximum award in the two cases to CAD $13.7 billion (approximately \u00a38 billion) as of 1 March 2019, with Imperial's share being reduced to approximately CAD $9.2 billion (approximately \u00a35.4 billion). The Court of Appeal also upheld the payment of the initial deposits into the defendants' solicitors' trusts account within 60 days, totalling approximately CAD $1.13 billion (approximately \u00a3660.5 million), of which Imperial's share was recalculated by the Court of Appeal as CAD $759 million (approximately \u00a3443.6 million). Imperial has already paid CAD $758 million (approximately \u00a3443 million) into court as security for the judgment.\n\n- 77. Other Canadian Smoking and Health Class Actions : seven putative class actions, described below, have been filed against various Canadian and non-Canadian tobacco-related entities, including the UK Companies, Imperial and the RJR Companies, in various Canadian provinces. In these cases, none of which have quantified their asserted damages, the plaintiffs allege claims based on fraud, fraudulent concealment, breach of warranty of merchantability, and of fitness for a particular purpose, failure to warn, design defects, negligence, breach of a 'special duty' to children and adolescents, conspiracy, concert of action, unjust enrichment, market share liability and violations of various trade practices and competition statutes. Pursuant to the terms of the 1999 sale of RJRT's international tobacco business, and subject to a reservation of rights, JTI has assumed the defence of the RJR Companies in these seven actions (Semple, Kunka, Adams, Dorion, Bourassa, McDermid and Jacklin, discussed below).",

In June 2009, four smoking and health class actions were filed in Nova Scotia (Semple), Manitoba (Kunka), Saskatchewan (Adams) and Alberta (Dorion) against various Canadian and non-Canadian tobacco-related entities, including the UK Companies, Imperial and the RJR Companies. In Saskatchewan, the Company, Carreras Rothmans Limited and Ryesekks p.l.c. have been released from Adams, and the RJR Companies have brought a motion challenging the jurisdiction of the court. There are service issues in relation to Imperial and the UK Companies in Alberta and in relation to the UK Companies in Manitoba. The plaintiffs did not serve their certification motion materials and no dates for certification motions were set.\n- 79.  In June 2010, two further smoking and health class actions were filed in British Columbia against various Canadian and non-Canadian tobacco-related entities, including Imperial, the UK Companies and the RJR Companies. The Bourassa claim is allegedly on behalf of all individuals who have suffered chronic respiratory disease and the McDermid claim proposes a class based on heart disease. Both claims state that they have been brought on behalf of those who have 'smoked a minimum of 25,000 cigarettes'. The UK Companies, Imperial, the RJR Companies and other defendants objected to jurisdiction. Subsequently, the Company, Carreras Rothmans Limited and Ryesekks p.l.c. were released from Bourassa and McDermid. Imperial, Industries, Investments and the RJR Companies remain as defendants in both actions. The plaintiffs did not serve their certification motion materials and no dates for certification motions were set.\n- 80. In June 2012, a smoking and health class action was filed in Ontario (Jacklin) against various Canadian and non-Canadian tobacco-related entities, including the UK Companies, Imperial and the RJR Companies. The claim has been in abeyance.\n\n## Venezuela\n\n- 81.  In April 2008, the Venezuelan Federation of Associations of Users and Consumers (FEVACU) and Wolfang Cardozo Espinel and Giorgio Di Muro Di Nunno, acting as individuals, filed a class action against the Venezuelan government. The class action seeks regulatory controls on tobacco and recovery of medical expenses for future expenses of treating smokingrelated illnesses in Venezuela. Both C.A Cigarrera Bigott Sucs. (Cigarrera Bigott), a Group subsidiary, and ASUELECTRIC, represented by its president Giorgio Di Muro Di Nunno (who had previously filed as an individual), have been admitted as third parties by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. A hearing date for the action is yet to be scheduled. On 25 April 2017 and on 23 January 2018, Cigarrera Bigott requested the court to declare the lapsing of the class action due to no proceedings taking place in the case in over a year. A ruling on the matter is yet to be issued.\n\n## (c) Individual Tobacco-Related Personal Injury Claims\n\n- 82. As at 31 December 2021, the jurisdictions with the most active individual cases against Group companies were, in descending order: Brazil (23), Italy (11), Canada (5), Argentina (5), Chile (4) and Ireland (2). There were a further two jurisdictions with one active case only. Out of the 52 active individual tobacco related personal injury claims, one case in Argentina ( Baldassare ) received an unfavourable verdict as at 31 December 2021. In that case, a first instance judgment, issued on 28 December 2020, awarded damages to the plaintiff in the amount of ARS 685,976 (approximately \u00a35,000) in compensatory damages and ARS 2,500,000 (approximately \u00a318,000) in punitive damages (plus interest). BAT Argentina filed a notice of appeal of the judgment on 3 February 2021.\n\n## Non-Tobacco-Related Litigation\n\n## VUSE Litigation\n\n- 83. On 22 July 2020, Nicholas Bernston filed a personal injury action in the Northern District of Oklahoma against JUUL Labs Inc. (JUUL), Altria Client Services, LLC, RJR Vapor, Reynolds American, and others. The complaint seeks damages for personal injuries (including pneumonia and acute respiratory failure) allegedly resulting from vaping on several theories, including strict liability, negligence, and breach of implied warranty of merchantability. On 24 July 2020, JUUL notified the JPML that this case could be a potential tag-along in the JUUL MDL. On 5 August 2020, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation entered a conditional transfer order transferring the case to the Northern District of California. That order became effective on 12 August 2020, and this case now is a member case in the JUUL multidistrict litigation (MDL). On 13 October 2020, RJR Vapor and Reynolds American moved to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, for a stay or a suggestion of remand to the Northern District of Oklahoma. On 16 October 2020, the MDL court issued an order staying those motions to dismiss. The case will remain pending against Reynolds American and RJR Vapor, but they will not be subject to discovery or other pretrial obligations absent further order from the court.\n\n## Croatian Distributor Dispute\n\n- 84. BAT Hrvatska d.o.o u likvidaciji and British American Tobacco Investments (Central and Eastern Europe) Limited are named as defendants in a claim by Mr Perica received on 22 August 2017 and brought before the commercial court of Zagreb, Croatia. Mr Perica seeks damages of HRK 408,000,000 (approximately \u00a345.6 million) relating to a BAT Standard Distribution Agreement dating from 2005. BAT Hrvatska d.o.o and British American Tobacco Investments (Central and Eastern Europe) Ltd filed a reply to the statement of claim on 6 October 2017. A hearing had been scheduled to take place on 10 May 2018, but it was postponed due to a change of the judge hearing the case. The Commercial Court in Zagreb declared they do not have jurisdiction and that the competent court to hear this case is the Municipal Court in Zagreb. TDR d.o.o. is also named as the defendant in a claim by Mr Perica received on 30 April 2018 and brought before the commercial court of Zagreb, Croatia. Mr. Perica seeks payment in the amount of HRK 408,000,000 (approximately \u00a345.6 million) claiming that BAT Hrvatska d.o.o. transferred a business unit to TDR d.o.o, thus giving rise to a liability of TDR d.o.o. for the debts incurred by BAT Hrvatska d.o.o, on the basis of the provisions of Croatian civil obligations law. A response to the statement of claim was filed on 30 May 2018. The Commercial Court in Zagreb declared they do not have jurisdiction and that the competent court to hear this case is the Municipal Court in Pula. Mr Perica filed an appeal against this decision which was rejected by the High Commercial Court of The Republic of Croatia confirming therewith that the competent court to hear this case is the Municipal Court in Pula. The Municipal Court in Zagreb has decided that the claims by Mr Perica initiated on 22 August 2017 and 30 April 2018 shall be heard as one case in front of the Municipal Court of Zagreb. After the two hearings have been held, the Municipal Court of Zagreb has appointed the court financial and auditing appraisal to determine the value of Mr Perica's claim.",

Following the Company's acquisition of the remaining 57.8% of Reynolds American in July 2017, pursuant to North Carolina law, under which Reynolds American was incorporated, a number of Reynolds American shareholders dissented and asserted their rights to a judicial appraisal of the value of their Reynolds American stock. On 29 November 2017, Reynolds American filed a Complaint for Judicial Appraisal in state court in North Carolina against 20 dissenting shareholders holding an aggregate of approximately 9.65 million shares. The complaint asked the court to determine the fair value of the dissenting shareholders' shares in Reynolds American and any accrued interest. A trial was held in June 2019, at which the dissenters sought US$92.17 per share plus interest. On 27 April 2020, the court issued its final judgment upholding Reynolds American's proposed valuation of $59.64 per share and concluding that no further payment is due to the dissenters for their shares. Dissenting shareholders holding an aggregate of approximately 6.52 million shares filed a notice of appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court. On 17 December 2021, the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion affirming the Business Court's determination, and on 21 January 2022 the dissenters' deadline to seek further review expired, meaning that this matter is now concluded.\n\n## Patents Litigation\n\n- 86. Certain Group companies are party to a number of patent litigation cases and procedural challenges concerning the validity of patents owned by or licensed to them and/or the alleged infringement of third-parties' patents.\n- 87.  On 22 June 2018, an affiliate of Philip Morris International (PMI) commenced proceedings against British American Tobacco Japan, Ltd. (BAT Japan) in the Japanese courts challenging the import, export, sale and offer of sale of the glo device and of the NeoStiks consumable in Japan at the time the claim was brought (and earlier models of the glo device), alleging that the glo devices directly infringe certain claims of two Japanese patents that have been issued to the PMI affiliate and that the NeoStiks indirectly infringe certain claims of those patents. On 17 January 2019, the PMI affiliate introduced new grounds of infringement, alleging that the glo device also infringes some other claims in the two PMI affiliate's Japanese patents. Damages for the glo device and NeoStik are claimed in the court filing, to the amount of 100 million Yen (approximately \u00a3641,000). The PMI affiliate has also filed a request for injunction with respect to the glo device. BAT Japan denies infringement and is challenging the validity of the two PMI affiliate's Japanese patents.\n- 88. Fuma International LLC (Fuma) filed two separate patent infringement complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against RJR Vapor on 6 March 2019 and 2 July 2019, each alleging that Vuse Solo and Vuse Ciro products infringe a patent. The two complaints were consolidated into a single proceeding involving both asserted Fuma patents. The parties resolved this matter pursuant to a Confidential Settlement and License Agreement effective 29 November 2021.\n- 89. On 9 April 2020, Nicoventures Trading Limited (Nicoventures) commenced an action in the England and Wales High Court (Patents Court) against Philip Morris Products S.A. (PMP) for revocation against three divisional patents in the same family, of which PMP is the proprietor (a further divisional patent in the same family was added into the revocation action on 9 July 2020). On 12 May 2020 PMP filed its defence\n\ntogether with a counterclaim for patent infringement against Nicoventures and Investments concerning prototype examples or production samples of certain 'glo' tobacco heating devices. PMP are seeking an injunction, an order for delivery up or a destruction upon oath of all infringing articles, and either an account of profits or damages on commercial sales (and interest thereon). On 12 June 2020, Nicoventures and Investments filed their defence to the counterclaim. The trial of this action took place between 18-25 May 2021. On 14 July 2021 the England and Wales High Court (Patents Court) handed down its judgment finding that all four divisional patents were invalid for lack of an inventive step and consequently, that PMP's counterclaim failed. On 2 November 2021, PMP filed a request for permission to appeal.\n\n- 90. On 28 May 2020 Altria Client Services LLC and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC commenced proceedings against RJR Vapor before the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina against the vapour products Vuse Vibe and Vuse Alto, and the tin used in the modern oral product Velo. Nine patents in total were asserted: two against Vibe, four against Alto and three against Velo. On 5 January 2021, Altria filed an Amended Complaint adding Modoral Brands Inc. as a defendant with respect to the Velo product claims. The plaintiffs have sought damages but have not to date sought preliminary or permanent injunctions. RJR Vapor has responded to the complaint. The parties conducted a one-day mediation session in August 2021, but were unable to resolve the dispute. A claim construction hearing was held on 28 April 2021, and the court issued its claim construction ruling on 12 May 2021. Fact discovery, expert discovery, and summary judgment briefings are completed. No date has been set for a summary judgment hearing, and no trial date has been set.\n- 91.  On 9 April 2020, RAI Strategic Holdings, Inc. and RJR Vapor commenced an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Altria Client Services LLC, Philip Morris USA, Inc., Altria Group, Inc., Philip Morris International, Inc., and Philip Morris Products S.A. (collectively, Philip Morris) for infringement of six patents based on the importation and commercialization within the United States of IQOS. On 8 May 2020 and 12 June 2020, Philip Morris filed Inter Partes Review (IPR) petitions in the U.S. Patent Office challenging the validity of each of the six patents asserted. On 29 June 2020, Philip Morris asserted counterclaims alleging that RJR Vapor infringes five patents. On 24 November 2020, the court issued a claim construction order that determined that each disputed term would have its plain and ordinary meaning. On 4 December 2020, the magistrate judge issued an order staying RJR Vapor and Philip Morris's patent claims pending a decision by the U.S. Patent Office regarding whether to proceed with the IPRs. At the time of the stay, fact and expert discovery was ongoing and was scheduled to conclude 26 January 2021. The court lifted the stay, and the parties have substantially completed discovery. On 6 August 2021, the court denied all summary judgment motions. Trial on the Altria and Philip Morris patents was scheduled to have begun on 4 April 2022, but the court postponed the trial and set a new trial date of 6 June 2022; the RJR Vapor offensive patent case remains stayed pending (i) an appeal by Philip Morris to the Federal Circuit in relation an exclusion order granted against Philip Morris by the International Trade Commission based on the relevant patents, and (ii) the decisions in IPRs commenced by Philip Morris against the relevant patents at the U.S. Patent Office.",

On 27 November 2020 Philip Morris filed a complaint before the Regional Court Mannheim in Germany against British American Tobacco (Germany) GmbH (BAT Germany) alleging that the sale, offer for sale and importation of Vype ePod products infringes a patent. Philip Morris is seeking an injunction, a recall of product from commercial customers and a declaratory judgment for damages. The trials of this action took place on 15 June 2021 and 9 November 2021. A decision on the matter was promulgated on 30 November 2021. The decision dismissed the complaint in its entirety. On 28 December 2021, Philip Morris lodged an appeal against this decision before the Higher Regional Court Karlsruhe.\n- 93. On 11 December 2020 Philip Morris filed a complaint before the Regional Court Dusseldorf in Germany against BAT Germany alleging that the sale, offer for sale and importation of the glo TABAK HEATER and neo STICK products infringe a patent. Philip Morris is seeking an injunction, a recall of product from commercial customers and a declaratory judgment for damages. The trial of this action took place on 30 November 2021. The court promulgated its decision on 21 December 2021 and decided that the above-mentioned products infringe the patent. The decision is not final and was appealed by BAT Germany on 21 December 2021 to the Higher Regional Court Dusseldorf. On 31 December 2021, BAT Germany also lodged a formal request with the appeal court to suspend the injunction order against the neo STICK products. On 24 January 2022, the appeal court granted this request, subject to providing a security and indicating that the neo STICK products are only suitable for new glo TABAK HEATER devices. BAT Germany is no longer marketing the glo TABAK HEATER, but rather a new glo TABAK HEATER marketed as glo Hyper + New Heating Technology, which is not subject to the patent infringement proceedings. Because the trial court decision only contains a declaratory obligation for BAT Germany to pay damages, Philip Morris would have to file a new separate action for the actual payment of damages, stating the precise amount that is being claimed.\n- 94. On 14 December 2020, Modoral Brands Inc. (Modoral) filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Pinkerton Tobacco Co., LP, Swedish Match North America LLC, and NYZ AB (collectively Swedish Match) seeking a declaratory judgment that the importation, manufacture, use, and/or sale of Modoral's Velo product does not infringe U.S. Patent No. 9,161,908 (the '908 Patent) or any of Swedish Match's trade secrets. On 3 June 2021, the case was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. On 13 July 2021, Swedish Match and Helix Innovations GmbH filed counterclaims against Modoral for infringement of the '908 patent and misappropriation of trade secrets arising out of the manufacture, use, and sale of Modoral's Velo product. On 15 December 2021, the court entered a Markman Order finding that the '908 patent distinguishes a nicotine complex from the claimed 'nicotine salt,' and more specifically, affirmatively excluding the nicotine polacrilex complex used in the accused Velo product from the claimed invention because it is 'not a nicotine salt'. Swedish Match agreed to a joint stipulation and request for entry of judgment of noninfringement for all of the asserted claims of the '908 patent, which the Court granted on 19 January 2022. Modoral filed a motion to stay Swedish Match's remaining trade secret misappropriation claims in light of Swedish Match's intent to appeal the Markman Order to the Federal Circuit. Modoral also filed a Rule 54(b) motion for partial final judgment of the infringement claims. Both motions are scheduled for argument on 4 March 2022.\n\n## Mozambican IP Litigation\n\n- 95. On 19 April 2017, Sociedade Agr\u00edcola de Tabacos, Limitada (SAT) (a BAT Group company in Mozambique) filed a complaint to the National Inspectorate for Economic Activities (INAE), the government body under the Ministry of Industry and Trade, regarding alleged infringements of its registered trademark (GT) by GS Tobacco SA (GST). INAE subsequently seized the allegedly infringing products (GS cigarettes) and fined and ordered GST to discontinue manufacturing products that could infringe SAT's intellectual property rights. Following INAE's decision, in July 2017 and March 2018, SAT sought damages via the Judicial Court of Nampula, from GST in the amount of and equivalent to \u00a3573,000 as well as a permanent restraint order in connection with the manufacturing and selling of the allegedly infringing products. The Judicial Court of Nampula (Tribunal Judicial de Nampula) granted the order on an interim basis on 7 August 2017. After hearing the parties, on 5 September 2017, the court found that no alleged infringement by GST had occurred and removed the interim restraint order, this decision was appealed by SAT and is currently pending a decision. GST filed an application for review against INAE's initial decision directly to the Minister of Trade and Industry, which reversed the decision of INAE. On 31 December 2018, SAT was notified of GST's counterclaim against SAT at the Judicial Court of Nampula for damages allegedly sustained as a result of SAT's complaint to INAE (and INAE's decision). GST is seeking damages in the amount equivalent to \u00a3190 million. On 31 January 2019 SAT filed a formal response to the counterclaim. GST was notified on 28 February 2019 to file a response to our formal response to the counterclaim and the judge scheduled the preliminary hearing for 14 March 2019. This hearing was adjourned and was held on 2 April 2019, when the court heard arguments on the validity of SAT's counterclaim. On 2 September 2019, SAT received notification of an order which provided that (i) SAT's claim had been dismissed by the court; and (ii) the GST counterclaim would proceed to trial. On 9 September 2019 SAT responded to the order by appealing the dismissal of the SAT claim. Additionally, SAT made an interlocutory application in the counterclaim proceedings to challenge certain questions posed by the judge, on the basis that the responses may be used as evidence at trial. SAT was notified in December 2021 that the trial of the counterclaim is to take place on 24 February 2022. SAT subsequently submitted a complaint related to that trial to the court, on the basis that prior to any further step being taken in relation to the trial the process should be submitted to the superior court for analysis, as per the appeals previously submitted in the proceedings. SAT's complaint has not yet been determined.\n\n## Malawi Group Action\n\n- 96. In December 2020, the Company and British American Tobacco (GLP) Limited (GLP) were named as defendants in a claim made in the English High Court by around 7,500 Malawian tobacco farmers and their family members. The claim also names Imperial Brands plc and five affiliates as defendants. The claimants allege they were subjected to unlawful and exploitative working conditions on tobacco farms from which it is alleged that the defendants indirectly acquire tobacco. They seek unquantified damages (including aggravated and exemplary damages) for the torts of negligence and conversion and unquantified personal and proprietary remedies for restitution of unjust enrichment. They also seek an injunction to restrain the commission of further torts of conversion or negligence by the defendants. The defendants had an application to strike out the claims dismissed in a judgment dated 25 June 2021. In January 2022, the Company and GLP were served with a similar claim by around a further 3,500 claimants. The Company and GLP intend vigorously to defend the claims.",

On 12 November 2020, British American Tobacco Middle East W.L.L (formerly British American Tobacco Middle East SPC) (BAT ME), along with its distributor in Qatar, Ali Bin Ali Establishment (ABA), filed a case before the Qatar Court of First Instance which challenges a decision of Qatar General Authority of Customs dated 16 August 2020 ordering ABA to pay two amounts arising from unrelated circumstances, one of which totalled QAR 160,531,588 (approximately \u00a332.6 million) in customs duties and penalties in relation to 27 consignments of cigarettes imported into Qatar by ABA. On 14 February 2021, the General Authority of Customs issued a new order that repeated (and addressed only) its demand that ABA pay QAR 160,531,588 in customs duties and penalties in relation to the same 27 consignments of cigarettes imported into Qatar by ABA. On 19 May 2021, BAT ME and ABA filed a second case before the Qatar Court of First Instance which challenges the decision of Qatar's General Authority of Customs dated 14 February 2021. On 28 October 2021, the Court of First Instance dismissed both cases filed by BAT ME and ABA on the grounds the cases were not timely filed. In December 2021, BAT ME and ABA appealed the decisions of the Court of First Instance in both cases. It is possible that the two appeals filed by BAT ME and ABA will be consolidated into a single case. In any event, ABA can only have liability under one case not both, so its maximum liability is QAR 160,531,588, not twice that amount. BAT ME's potential liability in respect of the foregoing amount arises from certain contractual arrangements with ABA. BAT ME and ABA strongly assert that the additional customs duty and penalties imposed by the Qatar Customs Authority are inconsistent with applicable law.\n\n## Saudi Arabia Customs Claim\n\n98. On 25 January 2021, Walid Ahmed Mohammed Al Naghi for Trading Establishment (Al Naghi), a former distributor for the Group's operating companies in the Middle East, filed a claim in the Commercial Court in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, seeking SAR 2,105,356,121 (approximately \u00a3414 million) for reimbursement of funds allegedly due under contract. Al Naghi did not formally name any Group entity as a defendant in the claim. The claim was dismissed orally by the Court on 9 February 2021. On 20 April 2021, Al Naghi filed a new claim in the Jeddah Commercial Court against BAT UKE demanding that BAT UKE reimburse Al Naghi in the amount of SAR 2,105,356,121 allegedly paid by Al Naghi to the customs authorities in customs dues. BAT UKE submitted a response on 27 May 2021 requesting dismissal of the claim on the ground that BAT UKE lacks legal capacity to be sued as it was not a party to any relevant agreement with Al Naghi. On 16 June 2021, the Court of First Instance issued a judgment dismissing the claim against BAT UKE and ruling that BAT UKE lacks legal standing to be named defendant in the proceedings. On 22 August 2021, Al Naghi filed an appeal against the Court of First Instance judgement. BAT UKE was not given an opportunity to respond to Al Naghi's allegations on appeal. On 15 November 2021, the Appellate Court issued an oral ruling cancelling the Court First Instance judgement and remanding the case to the lower court for further deliberation. In its written judgement dated 12 December 2021, the Appellate Court stated that it was remanding the case in order for the Court of First Instance to join to the proceedings BAT entities in Bahrain and UAE, which Al Naghi had wrongly claimed on appeal to be branches of BAT UKE. The Court of First Instance held a hearing on 19 January 2022 to re-consider the case in light of the Appellate Court judgement.\n\nAt that hearing, the Court of First Instance set a timetable for the parties to file written submissions setting out their arguments with regard to the legal status of the BAT entities in Bahrain and UAE. A further hearing was held on 2 February 2022. The court is seeking further information from the BAT entities in Bahrain and UAE ahead of a further hearing on 23 February 2022.\n\n## Asbestos Litigation\n\n99. On 15 January 2021, plaintiffs in an individual asbestos personal injury action (Rentko), originally filed 5 October 2020 in the New York City Asbestos Litigation court, filed an amended complaint, which named as defendants the Company, BATUS Holdings, Inc., British American Tobacco (Brands) Inc., and RJRT, along with various other defendants. The amended complaint was served 20 January 2021 on BATUS Holdings, Inc. and British American Tobacco (Brands) Inc., and served 22 January 2021 on RJRT. The amended complaint alleges that one of the plaintiffs was exposed to the defendants' asbestos and asbestoscontaminated talcum powder products, which allegedly caused her to develop mesothelioma, and asserts claims under state law, including for negligence, breach of warranty, product liability, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and civil conspiracy. A further amended complaint was filed on 27 January 2021, which named Reynolds American as a defendant as an alleged successor in interest to the Company, and which was served on Reynolds American on 5 February 2021. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages jointly and severally against the defendants. Reynolds American and RJRT moved to dismiss the amended complaint on 26 March 2021. A notice of discontinuance was filed on 31 March 2021 discontinuing the litigation without prejudice as against the Company, BATUS Holdings, Inc. and British American Tobacco (Brands) Inc. A stipulation of discontinuance was filed on 6 April 2021 discontinuing the litigation without prejudice as against Reynolds American and RJRT.\n\n100. On 23 April 2021, plaintiff in an asbestos personal injury action (Smoltino), originally filed 25 August 2020 in the New York City Asbestos Litigation court, filed an amended complaint, which named as defendants the Company, BATUS Holdings, Inc., British American Tobacco (Brands) Inc., Reynolds American and RJRT, along with various other defendants. The amended complaint was served on BATUS Holdings, Inc., British American Tobacco (Brands) Inc. and RJRT on 23 April 2021 and served on Reynolds American on 26 April 2021. The amended complaint alleged that plaintiff's decedent was exposed to the defendants' asbestos and asbestos-contaminated talcum powder products, which allegedly caused her to develop mesothelioma, and asserted claims under state law, including for negligence, breach of warranty, product liability, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, wrongful death and civil conspiracy. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages jointly and severally against the defendants. A notice of discontinuance was filed on 19 May 2021 discontinuing the litigation without prejudice as against the Company, BATUS Holdings, Inc. and British American Tobacco (Brands) Inc. Reynolds American and RJRT moved to dismiss the amended complaint on 10 May 2021. A stipulation of discontinuance was filed on 24 May 2021 discontinuing the litigation without prejudice as against Reynolds American and RJRT.",

On 11 May 2021, plaintiff in an asbestos personal injury action (Gilbride) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey Law Division - Middlesex County, which named as defendants R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, individually and as successor-by-merger to British American Cosmetics, along with various other defendants. The complaint was served on RJRT on 26 May 2021. The complaint alleged that plaintiff was exposed to asbestos-containing cosmetic talcum powder products sold and supplied by the Defendants (and/or their predecessors in interest), which allegedly caused her to develop mesothelioma, and asserted claims under state law, including for negligence, breach of warranty, strict liability in tort, marketing an ultra-hazardous product, failure to warn, product liability, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and civil conspiracy. Plaintiff seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages jointly and severally against the defendants. A stipulation for voluntary dismissal was filed with the court on 7 July 2021.\n\n## Fox River\n\n## Background to environmental liabilities arising out of contamination of the Fox River:\n\n- 102. In Wisconsin, the authorities have identified potentially responsible parties (PRPs) to fund the clean-up of river sediments in the lower Fox River. The pollution was caused by discharges of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) from paper mills and other facilities operating close to the river. Among the PRPs is NCR Corporation (NCR).\n- 103. In NCR's Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2014, the total clean-up costs for the Fox River were estimated at US$825 million (approximately \u00a3609.1 million). This estimate is subject to uncertainties and does not include natural resource damages (NRDs). Total NRDs may range from US$0 to US$246 million (approximately \u00a30 to \u00a3181.6 million).\n- 104. Industries' involvement with the environmental liabilities arises out of indemnity arrangements which it became party to due to a series of transactions that took place from the late-1970s onwards and subsequent litigation brought by NCR against Industries and Appvion Inc. (Appvion) (a former Group subsidiary) in relation to those arrangements which was ultimately settled. U.S. authorities have never identified Industries as a PRP.\n- 105. There has been a substantial amount of litigation in the United States involving NCR and Appvion regarding the responsibility for the costs of the clean-up operations. The U.S. Government also brought enforcement proceedings against NCR and Appvion to ensure compliance with regulatory orders made in relation to the Fox River clean-up. This litigation has been settled through agreements with other PRPs and a form of settlement known as a Consent Decree with the U.S. Government, approved by the District Court of Wisconsin on 23 August 2017.\n- 106. The principal terms of that Consent Decree, in summary, are as follows:\n- a. NCR is obliged to perform and fund all of the remaining Fox River remediation work by itself.\n- b. The U.S. Government enforcement proceedings were settled, with NCR having no liability to meet the U.S. Government's claim for costs it had incurred in relation to the clean-up to date, a secondary responsibility to meet certain future costs, and no liability to the U.S. Government for NRDs.\n- c. NCR ceased to pursue its contribution claims against the other PRPs and in return received contribution protection preventing other PRPs from pursuing their contribution claims against NCR and existing claims for contribution being dismissed by order of the Court. NCR does, however, have the right to reinstate its contribution claims if the other PRPs decide to continue to pursue certain contractual claims against NCR.\n- d. Appvion also agreed to cease pursuance of claims against the other PRPs, subject to retention of the right to reinstate its claims if the other PRPs decide to continue to pursue certain claims against Appvion.\n- 107.  A Consent Decree between the U.S. Government, P.H. Glatfelter and Georgia Pacific settling the allocation of costs on the Fox River was approved by the District Court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin on 14 March 2019. This Consent Decree concludes all existing litigation on the Fox River, following P.H. Glatfelter's withdrawal of its appeal against the issuance of the Consent Decree as a term of the settlement.\n- 108. In NCR's Form 10-K Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 NCR disclosed that, in November 2019, an arbitral tribunal had awarded approximately US$10 million (approximately \u00a37.4 million) to a remediation general contractor engaged by the LLC formed by NCR and Appvion to perform the clean-up operation of the Fox River. NCR further stated that its indemnitors and co-obligors were responsible for the majority of the award, with its own share being approximately 25% of the award.\n\n## Industries' involvement with environmental liabilities arising out of the contamination of the Fox River:\n\n- 109. NCR has taken the position that, under the terms of a 1998 Settlement Agreement between it, Appvion and Industries, and a 2005 arbitration award, Industries and Appvion generally had a joint and several obligation to bear 60% of the Fox River environmental remediation costs imposed on NCR and of any amounts NCR has to pay in respect of other PRPs' contribution claims. BAT has not acknowledged any such liability to NCR and has defences to such claims. Further, under the terms of the Funding Agreement (described below), any dispute between Industries and NCR as to the final amount of any NCR claim against Industries in respect of the Fox River (if any) can only be determined at the later of (i) the completion of Fox River remediation works or (ii) the final resolution and exhaustion of all possible appeals in proceedings brought against Sequana, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and other former advisers.\n- 110.  Until May 2012, Appvion and Windward Prospects Limited (Windward) (another former Group subsidiary) had paid a 60% share of the clean-up costs incurred by NCR. Industries was never required to contribute. Around that time, Appvion refused to continue to pay clean-up costs, leading to NCR demanding that Industries pay a 60% share of those costs.\n- 111.    Industries commenced proceedings against Windward and Appvion in December 2011 seeking indemnification in respect of any liability it might have to NCR (the English Indemnity Proceedings) pursuant to a 1990 de-merger agreement between those parties.",

        "page_content": "## 31 Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments Continued\n\n## Funding Agreement of 30 September 2014\n\n- 112.  On 30 September 2014, Industries entered into a Funding Agreement with Windward, Appvion, NCR and BTI 2014 LLC (BTI) (a wholly owned subsidiary of Industries). Pursuant to the Funding Agreement, the English Indemnity Proceedings and a counterclaim Appvion had brought in those proceedings, as well as an NCR-Appvion arbitration concerning Appvion's indemnity to NCR, were discontinued as part of an overall agreement between the parties providing a framework through which they would together fund the ongoing costs of the Fox River clean-up. Under the agreement, NCR has agreed to accept funding by Industries at the lower level of 50% of the ongoing clean-up related costs of the Fox River (rather than the 60% referenced above). This remains subject to an ability to litigate at a later stage the extent of Industries' liability (if any) in relation to Fox River clean-up related costs (including in respect of the 50% of costs that Industries has paid under the Funding Agreement to date). In addition, Windward has contributed US$10 million (approximately \u00a37.4 million) of funding and Appvion has contributed US$25 million (approximately \u00a318.5 million) for Fox River and agreed to contribute US$25 million (approximately \u00a318.5 million) for the Kalamazoo River (see further below). Appvion entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 1 October 2017.\n- 113.  The parties also agreed to cooperate in order to maximise recoveries from certain claims made against third parties, including (i) a claim commenced by Windward in the High Court of England & Wales (the High Court) against Sequana and the former Windward directors (the Windward Dividend Claim). That claim was assigned to BTI under the Funding Agreement, and relates to dividend payments made by Windward to Sequana of around \u20ac443 million (approximately \u00a3372 million) in 2008 and \u20ac135 million (approximately \u00a3113.4 million) in 2009 (the Dividend Payments) and (ii) a claim commenced by Industries directly against Sequana to recover the value of the Dividend Payments alleging that the dividends were paid for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of Windward's creditors (including Industries) (the BAT section 423 Claim) (together, the Sequana Proceedings).\n- 114.  The Windward Dividend Claim and BAT section 423 Claim were heard together in the High Court, with judgment handed down on 11 July 2016. The court upheld the BAT section 423 Claim and, by way of a consequentials judgment dated 10 February 2017, ordered that Sequana pay to BTI an amount up to the full value of the 2009 Dividend plus interest, which equates to around US$185 million (approximately \u00a3136.6 million). The Court dismissed the Windward Dividend Claim.\n- 115.  The parties pursued cross appeals on the judgment, during which time Sequana was granted a stay in respect of the above payments. That stay was lifted in May 2017, three months after Sequana had entered into an insolvency process in France seeking court protection (the Sauvegarde). On 15 May 2019, the Nanterre Commercial Court made an order placing Sequana into formal liquidation proceedings ( liquidation judiciaire ). To date, Industries has not received any payments from Sequana.\n\n- 116.  On 6 February 2019 the Court of Appeal gave judgment upholding the High Court's findings, with one immaterial change to the method of calculating the damages awarded. Sequana therefore remains liable to pay approximately US$185 million (approximately \u00a3136.6 million). Because of Sequana's ongoing insolvency process, execution of that judgment is stayed. The Court of Appeal dismissed BTI's appeal in relation to the Windward Dividend Claim. The Court of Appeal also dismissed Sequana's application for permission to appeal the High Court's costs order in favour of Industries. Sequana therefore remains liable to pay around \u00a310 million in costs to Industries.\n- 117.   All parties to the appeal sought permission from the Court of Appeal for a further appeal to the UK Supreme Court. On 31 July 2019, BTI was granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. On the same day, the Supreme Court refused Sequana permission to appeal. The hearing of BTI's appeal took place before the UK Supreme Court on 4 and 5 May 2021 and the judgment is awaited.\n- 118.  BTI has brought claims against certain of Windward's former advisers, including Windward's auditors at the time of the dividend payments, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) (which claims were also assigned to BTI under the Funding Agreement). The claim had been stayed pending the outcome of the Sequana Proceedings. Once that stay was lifted, PwC applied to strike-out BTI's claim. A hearing of this application took place in October 2019. On 15 November 2019, the court dismissed PwC's application. The court granted PwC permission to appeal in respect of part of its dismissal of the application and the hearing of that appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal on 27 and 28 October 2020. On 11 January 2021, the Court of Appeal handed down judgment dismissing PwC's appeal. The Court of Appeal also refused PwC's application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court and made an order requiring PwC to file its Defence within two months of 11 January 2021. This deadline was subsequently extended. PwC subsequently applied directly to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision. PwC's application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court has yet to be determined. In the meantime, BTI's claim against PwC is progressing in the High Court. PwC served its Defence on 22 April 2021 and filed it with the Court on 26 April 2021. A Case Management Conference has been listed in a window between 2 March 2022 and 4 March 2022 (inclusive).\n- 119.   An agreed stay is in place in respect of BTI's separate assigned claim against Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer.\n- 120. The sums Industries has paid under the Funding Agreement are subject to the reservation as set out in paragraph 112 above and ongoing adjustment. Clean-up costs can only be estimated in advance of the work being carried out and certain sums payable are the subject of ongoing U.S. litigation. In 2019, Industries paid \u00a332 million in respect of clean-up costs. In 2020, Industries paid \u00a32 million in respect of clean-up costs. In 2021, Industries paid a further \u00a31.8 million in respect of clean-up costs. Industries is potentially liable for further costs associated with the clean-up. Industries has a provision of \u00a362.3 million which represents the current best estimate of its exposure - see note 24.",

NCR is also being pursued by Georgia-Pacific, a designated PRP in respect of the Kalamazoo River in Michigan, in relation to remediation costs caused by PCBs released into that river.\n- 122.   On 26 September 2013, the Michigan Court held that NCR was liable as a PRP on the basis that it had arranged for the disposal of hazardous material for the purposes of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).\n- 123. The second phase of the Kalamazoo trial to determine the apportionment of liability amongst PRPs took place between September and December 2015. On 29 March 2018, Judge Jonker ordered that NCR pay 40% of Georgia-Pacific past costs (around US$22 million (approximately \u00a316.2 million)). The question of future remediation costs was not determined.\n- 124. The parties commenced appeal proceedings against the judgment in July 2018. NCR also agreed an appeal bond with Georgia-Pacific to prevent enforcement of the judgment while it remained subject to appeal.\n- 125.   On 11 December 2019, NCR announced that it had entered into a Consent Decree with the U.S. Government and the State of Michigan, pursuant to which it assumed liability for certain remediation work at the Kalamazoo River. This Consent Decree was approved by the District Court for the Western District of Michigan on 2 December 2020. The payments to be made on the face of the Consent Decree in respect of such work total approximately US$245 million (approximately \u00a3181 million). The Consent Decree also provides for the withdrawal of NCR's appeal against Georgia-Pacific, and payment by NCR of the outstanding judgment against it of approximately US$20 million (approximately \u00a314.8 million) to Georgia-Pacific.\n- 126. The quantum of the clean-up costs for the Kalamazoo River is presently unclear. It may well exceed the amounts which are payable on the face of the Consent Decree.\n- 127.   It is anticipated that NCR will look to Industries to pay 60% of any sums NCR becomes liable to pay pursuant to the Consent Decree on the basis, it would be asserted, that the river constitutes a 'Future Site' for the purposes of the Settlement Agreement. The Funding Agreement described above does not resolve any such claims, but does provide an agreed mechanism pursuant to which any surplus from the valuable recoveries of any third-party claims that remains after all Fox River-related clean-up costs have been paid and Industries and NCR have been made whole may be applied towards Kalamazoo clean-up costs, in the event that NCR were to be successful in any claim for a portion of them from Industries or Appvion (subject to Appvion's cap, described below). Industries has defences to any claims made by NCR in relation to the Kalamazoo River. No such claims have been made against Industries.\n- 128. Industries also anticipates that NCR may seek to recover from Appvion (subject to a cap of US$25 million (approximately \u00a318.5 million)) for 'Future Sites' under the Funding Agreement. The basis of the recovery would be the same as any demand NCR may make on Industries. Appvion entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 1 October 2017. The effect of the Chapter 11 proceedings on Appvion's liability for Future Sites payments under the Funding Agreement is currently uncertain.\n- 129. As detailed above, Industries is taking active steps to protect its interests, including seeking to procure the repayment of the Windward dividends, pursuing the other valuable claims that are now within its control, and working with the other parties to the Funding Agreement to maximise recoveries from third parties with a view to ensuring that amounts funded towards clean-up related costs are later recouped under the agreed repayment mechanisms under the Funding Agreement.\n\n## Other environmental matters\n\n- 130. Reynolds American and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Such laws and regulations provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property or facility knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances. In the past, RJRT has been named a PRP with third parties under CERCLA with respect to several superfund sites. Reynolds American and its subsidiaries are not aware of any current environmental matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial position of Reynolds American or its subsidiaries.\n\n## Criminal investigations\n\n- 131.   From time to time, the Group investigates, and becomes aware of governmental authorities' investigations into, allegations of misconduct against Group companies. The Group cooperates with the authorities' investigations, where appropriate, including with the DOJ and OFAC in the United States, which are conducting an investigation into suspicions of breach of sanctions.\n- 132. Potential fines, penalties or other consequences cannot currently be assessed. As the investigations are ongoing, it is not possible to identify the timescale in which these matters might be resolved.",

While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, the Group believes that the defences of the Group's companies to all these various claims are meritorious on both the law and the facts, and a vigorous defence is being made everywhere.\n\n- 135. As indicated above, on 1 March 2019 the Quebec Court of Appeal released its appeal judgment. The trial judgment was largely upheld by a unanimous decision of the five-member panel including the requirement that the defendants deposit the initial deposits in their solicitors' trust accounts within 60 days. This is the only executory aspect of the judgment. In these circumstances we are of the view that it is more likely than not that there will be an outlay and it is reasonably estimable at CAD $758 million (approximately \u00a3443 million), the amount of the initial deposit paid into court. If further adverse judgments are entered against any of the Group's companies in any case, avenues of appeal will be pursued. Such appeals could require the appellants to post appeal bonds or substitute security (as has been necessary in Quebec) in amounts which could in some cases equal or exceed the amount of the judgment. At least in the aggregate, and despite the quality of defences available to the Group, it is not impossible that the Group's results of operations or cash flows in any particular period could be materially adversely affected by the impact of a significant increase in litigation, difficulties in obtaining the bonding required to stay execution of judgments on appeal, or any final outcome of any particular litigation.\n\n136. Having regard to all these matters, with the exception of the Quebec Class Actions, Fox River and certain Engle progeny cases identified above, the Group does not consider it appropriate to make any provision in respect of any pending litigation because the likelihood of any resulting material loss, on an individual case basis, is not considered probable and/or the amount of any such loss cannot be reasonably estimated. Notwithstanding the negative decision in the Quebec Class Actions, the Group does not believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will significantly impair the Group's financial condition. If the facts and circumstances change and result in further unfavourable outcomes in the pending litigation, then there could be a material impact on the financial statements of the Group.\n\n## Other contingencies\n\n- 137. JTI Indemnities. By a purchase agreement dated 9 March 1999, amended and restated as of 11 May 1999, referred to as the 1999 Purchase Agreement, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, Inc. (RJR) and RJRT sold their international tobacco business to JTI. Under the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJRT retained certain liabilities relating to the international tobacco business sold to JTI, and agreed to indemnify JTI against: (i) any liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of the imposition or assessment of any tax with respect to the international tobacco business arising prior to the sale, other than as reflected on the closing balance sheet; (ii) any liabilities, costs and expenses that JTI or any of its affiliates, including the acquired entities, may incur after the sale with respect to any of RJR's or RJRT's employee benefit and welfare plans; and (iii) any liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by JTI or any of its affiliates arising out of certain activities of Northern Brands.\n\n138. RJRT has received claims for indemnification from JTI, and several of these have been resolved. Although RJR and RJRT recognise that, under certain circumstances, they may have other unresolved indemnification obligations to JTI under the 1999 Purchase Agreement, RJR and RJRT disagree what circumstances described in such claims give rise to any indemnification obligations by RJR and RJRT and the nature and extent of any such obligation. RJR and RJRT have conveyed their position to JTI, and the parties have agreed to resolve their differences at a later date.",

In the Divestiture, Reynolds American agreed to defend and indemnify, subject to certain conditions and limitations, ITG in connection with claims relating to the purchase or use of one or more of the Winston, Kool, Salem or Maverick cigarette brands on or before 12 June 2015, as well as in actions filed before 13 June 2023, relating to the purchase or use of one or more of the Winston, Kool, Salem or Maverick cigarette brands. In the purchase agreement relating to the Divestiture, ITG agreed to defend and indemnify, subject to certain conditions and limitations, Reynolds American and its affiliates in connection with claims relating to the purchase or use of 'blu' brand e-cigarettes. ITG also agreed to defend and indemnify, subject to certain conditions and limitations, Reynolds American and its affiliates in actions filed after 12 June 2023, relating to the purchase or use of one or more of the Winston, Kool, Salem or Maverick cigarette brands after 12 June 2015. ITG has tendered a number of actions to Reynolds American under the terms of this indemnity, and Reynolds American has, subject to a reservation of rights, agreed to defend and indemnify ITG pursuant to the terms of the indemnity. Reynolds American has tendered an action to ITG under the terms of this indemnity, and ITG has, subject to a reservation of rights, agreed to defend and indemnify Reynolds American and its affiliates pursuant to the terms of the indemnity. These claims are substantially similar in nature and extent to claims asserted directly against RJRT in similar actions.\n- 140. Loews Indemnity . In 2008, Loews Corporation (Loews), entered into an agreement with Lorillard Inc., Lorillard Tobacco, and certain of their affiliates, which agreement is referred to as the 'Separation Agreement'. In the Separation Agreement, Lorillard agreed to indemnify Loews and its officers, directors, employees and agents against all costs and expenses arising out of third-party claims (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, interest, penalties and costs of investigation or preparation of defence), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities, taxes, demands, assessments, and amounts paid in settlement based on, arising out of or resulting from, among other things, Loews' ownership of or the operation of Lorillard and its assets and properties, and its operation or conduct of its businesses at any time prior to or following the separation of Lorillard and Loews (including with respect to any product liability claims). Loews is a defendant in three pending product liability actions, each of which is a putative class action. Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Lorillard is required to indemnify Loews for the amount of any losses and any legal or other fees with respect to such cases. Following the closing of the Lorillard merger, RJRT assumed Lorillard's obligations under the Separation Agreement as was required under the Separation Agreement.\n\n141. SFRTI Indemnity. In connection with the 13 January 2016 sale by Reynolds American of the international rights to the Natural American Spirit brand name and associated trademarks, along with SFR Tobacco International GmbH (SFRTI) and other international companies that distributed and marketed the brand outside the United States, to JT International Holding BV (JTI Holding), each of SFNTC, R. J. Reynolds Global Products, Inc., and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco B.V. agreed to indemnify JTI Holding against, among other things, any liabilities, costs, and expenses relating to actions (i) commenced on or\n\nbefore (a) 13 January 2019, to the extent relating to alleged personal injuries, and (b) in all other cases, 13 January 2021; (ii) brought by (a) a governmental authority to enforce legislation implementing European Union Directive 2001/37/ EC or European Directive 2014/40/EU or (b) consumers or a consumer association; and (iii) arising out of any statement or claim (a) made on or before 13 January 2016, (b) by any company sold to JTI Holding in the transaction, (c) concerning Natural American Spirit brand products consumed or intended to be consumed outside of the United States and (d) that the Natural American Spirit brand product is natural, organic, or additive-free. Under the terms of this indemnity, JTI has requested indemnification from Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company Germany GmbH (SFNTCG) in connection with an audit of SFNTCG relating to transfer pricing for the tax years 2007 to 2010 and 2012 to 2015. SFNTCG contests the audit results. The amount in dispute is approximately \u20ac21 million plus interest (approximately \u00a317.6 million).\n\n- 142. Indemnification of Distributors and Retailers. RJRT, Lorillard Tobacco, SFNTC, American Snuff Co. and RJR Vapor have entered into agreements to indemnify certain distributors and retailers from liability and related defence costs arising out of the sale or distribution of their products. Additionally, SFNTC has entered into an agreement to indemnify a supplier from liability and related defence costs arising out of the sale or use of SFNTC's products. The cost has been, and is expected to be, insignificant. RJRT, SFNTC, American Snuff Co. and RJR Vapor believe that the indemnified claims are substantially similar in nature and extent to the claims that they are already exposed to by virtue of their having manufactured those products.\n- 143. Except as otherwise noted above, Reynolds American is not able to estimate the maximum potential of future payments, if any, related to these indemnification obligations.\n\n144. Competition Investigations. There are instances where Group companies are cooperating with relevant national competition authorities in relation to ongoing competition law investigations and/or engaged in legal proceedings at the appellate level, including (amongst others) in the Netherlands.\n\n## Tax disputes\n\nThe Group has exposures in respect of the payment or recovery of a number of taxes. The Group is and has been subject to a number of tax audits covering, amongst others, excise tax, value added taxes, sales taxes, corporate taxes, withholding taxes and payroll taxes.\n\nThe estimated costs of known tax obligations have been provided in these accounts in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. In some countries, tax law requires that full or part payment of disputed tax assessments be made pending resolution of the dispute. To the extent that such payments exceed the estimated obligation, they would not be recognised as an expense. While the amounts that may be payable or receivable in relation to tax disputes could be material to the results or cash flows of the Group in the period in which they are recognised, the Board does not expect these amounts to have a material effect on the Group's financial condition.",

        "page_content": "## 31 Contingent Liabilities and Financial Commitments Continued\n\nThe following matters are in or may proceed to litigation:\n\n## Corporate taxes\n\n## Brazil\n\nThe Brazilian Federal Tax Authority has filed claims against Souza Cruz seeking to reassess the profits of overseas subsidiaries to corporate income tax and social contribution tax. The reassessments are for the years 2004 until and including 2012 for a total amount of BRL1,813 million (\u00a3240 million) to cover tax, interest and penalties.\n\nSouza Cruz appealed all reassessments. Regarding the first assessments (2004-2006), Souza Cruz's appeals were rejected by the ultimate Administrative Court after which Souza Cruz filed two lawsuits with the Judicial Court to appeal the reassessments. The judgment in respect of the reassessment of corporate income tax has been decided in favour of Souza Cruz by the first level of the Judicial Court and Souza Cruz is waiting to see whether the Brazilian Tax Authorities will appeal the judgment. The lawsuit appealing the social contribution tax is pending judgment in the first level of the Judicial Court. The appeal against the second assessments (2007 and 2008) was upheld at the second tier tribunal and was closed. In 2015, a further reassessment for the same period (2007 and 2008) was raised after the five-year statute of limitation which has been appealed against.\n\nSouza Cruz received further reassessments in 2014 for the 2009 calendar year and in 2015 an assessment for the 2010 calendar year. Souza Cruz appealed both the reassessments in full. In December 2016, assessments were received for the calendar years 2011 and 2012 which have also been appealed.\n\n## Netherlands\n\nThe Dutch tax authority has issued a number of assessments on various issues across the years 2003-2016 in relation to various intra-group transactions. The assessments amount to an aggregate net liability across these periods of \u00a31,146 million covering tax, interest and penalties. The Group has appealed against the assessments in full.\n\nThe Group believes that its companies have meritorious defences in law and fact in each of the above matters and intends to pursue each dispute through the judicial system as necessary. The Group does not consider it appropriate to make provision for these amounts nor for any potential further amounts which may be assessed in relation to these matters in subsequent years.\n\n## Indirect and other taxes\n\n## Bangladesh\n\nOn 25 July 2018, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has reversed the decision of the High Court Division against British American Tobacco Bangladesh Company Limited (BATB) in respect of the retrospective demands for VAT and Supplementary Duty amounting to approximately \u00a3154 million. On 3 February 2020, the certified Court Order was received. The Government filed a Review Petition on 25 March 2020 in the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh against the judgment. On 9 December 2021, the review petitions were heard and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh dismissed the review petitions filed by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) which resulted in BATB wining the cases against the NBR.\n\nIn addition, in 2017, NBR passed a discriminatory special order fixing BDT 27 for local brands and BDT 35 for foreign brand cigarettes. After NBR passed the special order, it was highlighted to the Government that it was against the principles of foreign direct investment and against WTO practice. Subsequently, the Finance Minister directed that no action should be taken in this regard until the different issues raised were finalised. Later in 2018, the special order itself was repealed. AKTC (a local Bangladeshi tobacco manufacturer) filed a case against NBR to get a direction from the Court to implement the special order and reserve low segment for local industries. The judgment in the AKTC case was passed by the High Court Division verbally on 21 September 2020. The judgment revived the discriminatory regime of VAT and Supplementary Duty (SD) between local and international/imported brands for the fiscal year 2017 - 2018. In light of the judgment, the Large Taxpayers' Unit (LTU) of National Board of Revenue by a notice asked BATB to show cause as to why BATB believed it should not be liable to pay \u00a3210 million as unpaid VAT and SD. Challenging the judgment, BATB filed and moved an appeal (known as the Civil Miscellaneous Petition for Leave to Appeal) before the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. On a preliminary hearing on 4 October 2020, the Appellate Division Judge in Chamber stayed operation of the judgment for eight weeks as an interim measure.\n\nSince the judgment has been stayed, the operation of the show cause notice shall also be deemed to have been stayed. BATB has formally notified LTU of this on 12 October 2020. In the meantime, the judgment will remain stayed.\n\nOn 20 December 2020, BATB filed a Civil Petition for Leave to Appeal as directed by the Appellate Division Judge in Chamber. The judgment passed by the High Court Division will continue to remain stayed while the appeal remains pending at the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. So far, the appeal has not been listed for hearing.\n\n## Egypt\n\nBritish American Tobacco Egypt LLC (BAT Egypt) is subject to two ongoing civil cases concerning the imposition of sales tax on low-price category brands brought by the Egyptian tax authority for \u00a388 million. Management believes that the tax claims are unfounded and has appealed the tax claims. These cases are under review by the Council of State. During hearings in August 2020, the courts decided, in both cases, to transfer the files to court appointed experts. One case (pertaining to the period from May 2008 to February 2009) was referred to a court-appointed expert who filed a report in January 2022. A hearing date has not yet been set. In the other case (pertaining to the period from March 2009 to June 2010), the expert has concluded his report and filed it with the court. In May 2021, a judgment was issued which acquitted BAT Egypt from all amounts related only to the period from March 2009 to October 2009. An appeal has been submitted to the Supreme Administrative Court to extend the acquittal to the rest of the disputed period. The appeal process is expected to take approximately two years.",

This resulted in the recognition of a KRW 80.7 billion (approximately \u00a350 million) charge by Group subsidiaries, BAT Korea Ltd., Rothmans Far East B.V. Korea Branch Office and BAT Korea Manufacturing Ltd. Management deems the tax and penalties to be unfounded and has appealed to the tax tribunal against the assessment. On grounds of materiality and the likelihood of the tax and penalties being reversed in future, the Group classified the tax and penalties charge as an adjusting item in 2016.\n\nOn 23 August 2019, the trial court ruled in favour of Rothmans Far East B.V. Korea Branch Office on KRW 6.7 billion (approximately \u00a34 million), the VAT portion of the assessment; appeals on the other elements of the assessment are still pending at Appeals Court. The Korean government appealed the ruling on 16 September 2019. On 16 April 2021 the Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling of the Trial Court. The government immediately appealed to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court also affirmed the ruling of the Appeals Court on 26 August 2021. On 16 September 2021, Rothmans Far East B.V. Korea Branch Office duly received the amount litigated (VAT portion) including statutory interests (note 6).\n\n## Turkey\n\nIn Turkey, British American Tobacco Tutun Mamulleri Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim Sirketi (BAT Tutun) was subject to a series of tax audits mainly on inventory movements for the years 2015, 2016 and 2019. The final audit reports sought retrospective payment of additional tax with interest and penalties mostly based on alleged illegitimate intra-group forestalling relating to finished goods giving rise to further excise tax. In 2020 and 2021, BAT Tutun received a total tax assessment amounting to TRY 2.7 billion (approximately \u00a3151 million), of which, TRY 2.1 billion (approximately \u00a3120 million) related to tax and penalties and TRY 0.6 billion (approximately \u00a331 million) related to late payment interest. In August 2021, BAT Tutun applied under the relevant tax amnesty law to settle its retrospective tax assessments. Based on the settlement through the tax amnesty procedure, BAT Tutun agreed to pay \u00a347 million in 18 instalments from 1 November 2021 until 31 July 2024.\n\n## Brazil\n\nOn 15 March 2017, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that for all taxpayers VAT (ICMS) should not be included in the calculation of social contribution taxes (PIS/Cofins) which are levied based on revenue. On 13 May 2021, the Supreme Court modulated the effects of the first decision handed down in 2017, stating that the taxpayers who filed a lawsuit by 15 March 2017 will be able to recover credits from the past five years.\n\nThe Group's Brazilian subsidiary, Souza Cruz, had filed an individual lawsuit to establish that it had overpaid taxes to the government. Based on favourable court decisions in 2020 and 2019 the Group has recognised \u00a35 million in 2021 (2020: \u00a358 million; 2019: \u00a386 million) in other income representing management's best estimate of the amounts likely to be recovered at this time with the potential for further amounts in future periods.\n\nIf the ruling were to be enacted retrospectively for a period of five years, the potential asset is estimated to be around \u00a3480 million. During 2021, \u00a3130 million of the unrecognised contingent asset was sold to financial institutions for \u00a345 million.\n\n## Commitments in relation to service contracts, non-capitalised leases\n\nThe total future minimum payments under non-cancellable service contracts based on when payments fall due:\n\n|                            | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Service contracts          |           |           |\n| Within one year            | 41        | 63        |\n| Between one and five years | 81        | 17        |\n| Beyond five years          | 5         | 6         |\n|                            | 127       | 86        |\n\nFinancial commitments arising from short-term leases and leases of low-value assets that are not capitalised under IFRS 16 Leases are \u00a37 million (2020: \u00a36 million) for property and \u00a319 million (2020: \u00a33 million) for plant, equipment and other assets.",

In 2011, the Group sold 984 million shares, representing approximately 14% of Bentoel's share capital, for the purposes of fulfilling certain obligations pursuant to Bapepam LK (Indonesia) takeover regulations. The Group simultaneously entered into a total return swap on 971 million of the shares. In June 2016, the Group and other investors participated in a rights issue by Bentoel, with the Group increasing its stake in Bentoel to 92%. Simultaneously, the Group amended the total return swap to take account of an additional 1,684 million shares with the shares subject to the total return swap representing 7% of Bentoel's issued capital. While the Group did not have legal ownership of these shares, it retained the risks and rewards associated with them which resulted in the Group continuing to recognise an effective interest in 99% of Bentoel's net assets and results. As explained in note 30, on 5 October 2021, Bentoel announced its intention to delist from the Indonesia Stock Exchange and go private by conducting a Voluntary Tender Offer (VTO). As part of this process, the Group terminated the total return swap, with legal ownership of the shares being reacquired by the Group. The process is on-going and is expected to conclude in the early part of 2022, with no material impact to the Group.\n\nRefer to note 14 for information on the Group's 42% investment in Tisak d.d.\n\n## 33 Summarised Financial Information\n\nThe following summarised financial information is required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and has been prepared as a requirement of the Regulation S-X 3-10 in respect of the guarantees of:\n\nThe financial information relates to the guarantees of:\n\n- - US$12.35 billion of outstanding bonds issued by B.A.T Capital Corporation (BATCAP) in connection with the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc.

A full list of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures and joint operations as defined by IFRS (showing the country of incorporation, effective percentage of equity shares held and full registered office addresses) as at 31 December 2021 is disclosed below.\n\nThe subsidiary undertakings that are held directly by British American Tobacco p.l.c. (the ultimate Parent Company) are indicated thus*; all others are held by sub-holding companies.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, the equity shares held are in the form of ordinary shares or common stock, except for those indicated thus # , which include preference shares. The effective percentage of equity shares held in subsidiary undertakings is 100% unless otherwise stated. Further, where the effective percentage of equity shares held by the sub-holding company is different from that held by British American Tobacco p.l.c., the percentage of equity shares held by British American Tobacco p.l.c. is indicated thus^ and is shown after the percentage interest held by the sub-holding company.\n\nThe results of a number of these subsidiary undertakings principally affect the financial statements of the Group. These principal subsidiary undertakings are highlighted in grey and are considered to be the main corporate entities in those countries which, in aggregate, contributed 89% of the Group revenue and 100% of profit from operations.\n\n## Subsidiary Undertakings\n\n| Albania                                                                                                   |                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Rruga e Kavajes, Ish Kombinati Ushqimor, Tirana, Albania                                                  |                                            |\n| British American Tobacco - Albania SH.P.K.                                                                |                                            |\n| Algeria                                                                                                   |                                            |\n| Zone d'activit\u00e9 El Omran, Route de Ouled Fayet, Ilot 789- Lot 04,  Cheraga, Alger, Algeri\u00e9                |                                            |\n| British American Tobacco (Alg\u00e9rie) S.P.A.

        "page_content": "## Financial Statements\n\n## Notes to the Accounts @\n\n## 1 Accounting Policies\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 ('the Act') and in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework ('FRS 101').\n\nIn preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Act and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken, including those relating to:\n\n- - a cash flow statement and related notes;\n- - comparative period reconciliations;\n- - disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly owned subsidiaries;\n- - disclosures in respect of capital management;\n- - the effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and\n- - disclosures in respect of the compensation of key management personnel.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements of the Group include equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available in respect of disclosures under IFRS 2 related to group settled share-based payments.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention except as described in the accounting policy below on financial instruments. After reviewing the annual budget, plans and financing arrangements, the Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing the financial statements, and that it is therefore appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the Directors to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. The key estimates and assumptions are set out in the accounting policies below, together with the related Notes on the Accounts.\n\nThe critical accounting judgements include determination as to whether the issue of perpetual hybrid bonds should be classified as equity instead of borrowings (see note 4) and the determination as to whether to recognise provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities (see note 7). Judgement is necessary to assess the likelihood that a pending claim is probable (more likely than not to succeed), possible or remote.\n\nThere are no critical accounting estimates which would have a significant risk of a material adjustment within the next financial year.\n\nAs permitted by Section 408 of the Act, the profit and loss of the Company has not been presented in these financial statements.\n\nThe Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK. In addition, the Company's shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange in the form of American Depository Shares (ADSs).\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of the Company is sterling. Transactions arising in currencies other than sterling are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than sterling are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. All exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year. Amounts recognised in equity are not retranslated.\n\n## Income\n\nIncome consists of dividend income from Group undertakings, fee income from financial guarantees and interest income. These are included in the profit and loss account when all contractual or other applicable conditions for recognition have been met. Dividend income is recognised at the same time as the paying company recognises the liability to pay a dividend.\n\n## Taxation\n\nTaxation is that chargeable on the profits for the period, together with deferred taxation. Income tax charges, where applicable, are calculated on the basis of tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or deferred tax liability is settled. As required under IAS 12 Income Taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\n## Investments in Group companies\n\nInvestments in Group companies are stated at cost, together with subsequent net capital contributions, less provisions for any impairment in value, where appropriate.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Company recognises the interim dividend as an appropriation of reserves in the period in which it is paid.\n\n## Repurchase of share capital\n\nWhen share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares which are not cancelled, or shares purchased for the employee share ownership trusts, are classified as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from total equity.\n\n## Related parties\n\nThe Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 101 from disclosing transactions with related parties that are whollyowned subsidiaries of British American Tobacco p.l.c. Group.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nInstruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that cannot be settled in the Company's own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received, net of issuance costs.",

        "page_content": "## 1 Accounting Policies Continued\n\nOn 27 September 2021, the Company issued two \u20ac1 billion perpetual hybrid bonds. As the Company has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these bonds, they are classified as equity instruments in the financial statements.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions. Such assets and liabilities are classified as current if they are expected to be realised or settled within 12 months after the balance sheet date. If not, they are classified as non-current.\n\nFinancial instruments are initially recognised at fair value.\n\nThe Company's non-derivative financial assets, including debtors, are held in order to collect contractual cash flows and are subsequently carried at amortised cost. Non-derivative financial liabilities, including creditors, are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Financial guarantees are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently carried at this fair value less accumulated amortisation within other creditors. Fees receivable in respect of these guarantees are carried at discounted present value.\n\nDerivative financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, and subsequently measured, at fair value, which includes accrued interest receivable and payable where relevant. Changes in their fair values are recognised in profit and loss.\n\nThe Company has accounted for the application of replacement benchmark rates in accordance with the Amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in 2019 (phase 1) and 2020 (phase 2) .\n\n## Impairment of financial assets held at amortised cost\n\nLoss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets which are held at amortised cost are recognised on the initial recognition of the underlying asset. Allowances in respect of loans and other receivables (debtors) are initially recognised at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses. Where the credit risk on the receivables has increased significantly since initial recognition, allowances are measured at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit loss.\n\n## 2 Investments in Group Companies\n\nThe Company's directly-owned subsidiaries are British American Tobacco (1998) Limited, B.A.T. International Finance p.l.c. and BATMark Limited. A full list of indirect subsidiaries and other undertakings as required by Section 409 of the Companies Act 2006 is shown on pages 282 to 291 of the Group's financial statements.\n\nMovements in investments relate to Group share-scheme costs net of recharges to subsidiaries as well as amounts recognised in relation to financial guarantees issued by the Company on behalf of Group subsidiaries.\n\nThe Directors are of the opinion that the individual investments in the subsidiary undertakings have a value not less than the amount at which they are shown in the Balance Sheet.\n\n## Shareholdings at cost less provisions and other fixed asset investments\n\n2021\n\n|             | \u00a3m     | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------|--------|-----------|\n| 1 January   | 27,995 | 27,908    |\n| Movements   | (186)  | 87        |\n| 31 December | 27,809 | 27,995    |\n\n- @ Denotes section, including accompanying text and tables, that does not form part of BAT's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Company has equity-settled share-based compensation plans in respect of Group employees.\n\nEquity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed over the vesting period, based on the Group's estimate of awards that will eventually vest. For plans where vesting conditions are based on total shareholder returns, the fair value at date of grant reflects these conditions, whereas earnings per share vesting conditions are reflected in the calculation of awards that will eventually vest over the vesting period.\n\nFair value is measured by the use of the Black-Scholes option pricing model, except where vesting is dependent on market conditions when the Monte-Carlo option pricing model is used. The expected life used in the models has been adjusted, based on management's best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.\n\nThe cost of these awards, less any direct recharges made to Group companies, are recognised as capital contributions to investments in subsidiaries.\n\nHistorically, the Company has used the British American Tobacco Group Employee Trust (BATGET), which operates as an extension of the Company, as the vehicle to obtain shares on market and hold them in trust to satisfy outstanding awards. In addition, from March 2020 the Company has utilised treasury shares acquired in the share buy-back programme to satisfy shared-based payment awards made to certain employees.",

The receivable falls under the standard lending agreements within the Group which were revised to take account of global benchmark interest rate reform. Prior to 1 August 2021 the applicable rate was based on the London InterBank Interest Rate (LIBOR) and with effect from this date it is based on the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA). Management consider the replacement rates in the revised intercompany agreement to be economically equivalent to those used previously. The impact of the change in rates was not significant to the Company.\n\nAmounts due from Group undertakings include \u00a31,291 million (2020: \u00a31,386 million) representing the discounted value of the fees receivable from the parental guarantees issued by the Company, of which \u00a3183 million (2020: \u00a3183 million) is due within one year and \u00a31,108 million (2020: \u00a31,204 million) is due after more than one year.\n\nOther amounts due from Group undertakings include:\n\n- - a balance of \u00a3841 million (2020: \u00a3nil) which is unsecured, interest bearing and repayable in 2026, with an interest rate based on SONIA + 1.070%; and\n- - a balance of \u00a3841 million (2020: \u00a3nil) which is unsecured, interest bearing and repayable in 2029, with an interest rate based on SONIA + 1.340%.\n\nAll other amounts owed by Group undertakings are unsecured, interest free and repayable on demand.\n\n## 4 Total Equity\n\n## (a) Called up Share Capital\n\nOrdinary Shares of 25p\n\n| Called up Share Capital                        | each Number of shares                         | \u00a3m     |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Allotted and fully paid                        |                                               |        |\n| 1 January 2021                                 | 2,456,591,597                                 | 614.14 |\n| Changes during the year - share option schemes | 26,191                                        | 0.01   |\n| 31 December 2021                               | 2,456,617,788                                 | 614.15 |\n| Called up Share Capital                        | Ordinary Shares of 25p each  Number of shares | \u00a3m     |\n| Allotted and fully paid                        |                                               |        |\n| 1 January 2020                                 | 2,456,520,738                                 | 614.12 |\n| Changes during the year - share option schemes | 70,859                                        | 0.02   |\n| 31 December 2020                               | 2,456,591,597                                 | 614.14 |",

        "page_content": "## 4 Total Equity Continued\n\nThe Company's ordinary shares are fully paid and no further contribution of capital may be required by the Company from the shareholders. All ordinary shares rank equally with regard to participation in dividends and to share in the proceeds of the Company's residual assets upon a winding up of the Company. Shareholders may, by ordinary resolution, declare final dividends, but not in excess of the amount recommended by the Directors. Holders of ordinary shares have no pre-emptive rights.\n\nOn a show of hands every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting is entitled to one vote regardless of the number of shares held by the shareholder, unless a poll is demanded. On a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every share held by the shareholder. The Company's Annual General Meeting voting is undertaken by way of a poll. All rights attached to the Company's shares held by the Group as Treasury shares are suspended until those shares are reissued.\n\nPlease refer to page 373 for further detail of the provisions contained within the Articles of Association.\n\n## (b) Share premium account, capital redemption reserves and merger reserves\n\n|                  |   Share premium  account \u00a3m |   Capital   redemption  reserves \u00a3m | Merger   reserves \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------|\n| 31 December 2021 |                         108 |                                 101 | 23,116                 | 23,325     |\n| 31 December 2020 |                         104 |                                 101 | 23,116                 | 23,321     |\n| 31 December 2019 |                          95 |                                 101 | 23,116                 | 23,312     |\n\n## Share premium\n\nThe share premium increase includes \u00a3nil in 2021 (2020: \u00a32 million) in respect of ordinary shares issued under the Company's share option schemes. These schemes are described in the Remuneration Report. A further \u00a34 million (2020: \u00a37 million) increase in share premium is related to shares repurchased and not cancelled that have been transferred from the Company to other Group undertakings, to be granted to employees on vesting of awards, and represents the excess of transfer price of the shares over the original weighted average cost of shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nOn the purchase of own shares, as part of the share buy-back programme for shares which are cancelled, a transfer is made from retained earnings to the capital redemption reserve equivalent to the nominal value of the shares purchased. The Company suspended its previous share buy-back programme from 30 July 2014. On 10 February 2022 the Board approved a \u00a32 billion share repurchase program for 2022.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nIn 2017, the Company announced the completion of the acquisition of the remaining 57.8% of Reynolds American Inc. it did not already own. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Company, on behalf of its indirect subsidiary BATUS Holdings Inc ('BATUS'), agreed to issue new shares, represented by American Depositary Shares, for the benefit of Reynolds American Inc. shareholders. In consideration for the Company issuing new shares, BATUS agreed to issue to the Company an assignable obligation owed by BATUS to issue shares to the holder of that obligation. As a consequence, the Company issued 429,045,762 new shares with a nominal value of \u00a3107,261,441.\n\nIn accordance with Section 612 of the Companies Act 2006, the excess of the fair value of the shares issued over the nominal value of the shares has been treated as a merger reserve.\n\n## (c) Other reserves\n\nAs part consideration for the acquisition of Rothmans International BV in 1999, convertible redeemable preference shares were issued by the Company. The discount on these shares was amortised by crediting other reserves and charging retained earnings. The balance of \u00a390 million in other reserves comprises the accumulated balance in respect of the preference shares converted during 2004.\n\n## (d) Profit and loss account\n\nAs permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss of the Company has not been presented in these Financial Statements. The profit for the year ended 31 December 2021 was \u00a36,250 million (2020: \u00a35,304 million).\n\nDividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are recognised in the period in which these are paid. The Company makes four interim quarterly dividend payments.\n\nDetails of Directors' remuneration, share options and retirement benefits are given in the Remuneration Report in the Group Annual Report and Accounts. Details of key management compensation are included in note 30 of the Group financial statements. The Company had two employees at 31 December 2021 (2020: two). These two employees are Jack Bowles and Tadeu Marroco. The details of their remuneration are shown on page 136 of the Group's Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021. The costs of these employees are borne by another Group company.\n\nShareholders' funds are stated after deducting the cost of treasury shares which include \u00a34,823 million (2020: \u00a34,836 million) for shares repurchased and not cancelled and \u00a3290 million (2020: \u00a3302 million) in respect of the cost of own shares held in Employee Share Ownership Trusts. In 2021, the value of shares repurchased and not cancelled has decreased by \u00a313 million as compared to the previous year, representing the value of shares that have been transferred from the Company to other Group undertakings to be granted to employees on vesting of awards.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 treasury shares include 5,995,678 (2020: 5,787,154) of shares held in trust and 161,930,217 (2020:162,347,246) of shares repurchased and not cancelled as part of the Company's share buy-back programme (which was suspended in 2014). From March 2020, the Company has utilised shares acquired in the share buy-back programme to satisfy share-based payment awards made to certain employees. Other movements in shareholders' funds relate to the recognition of share-based payments and the release of treasury shares as a result of the exercise of share options.",

Issuance costs of these bonds, amounting to \u20ac26 million (\u00a322 million), have been recognised in equity, net of tax of \u00a34 million. These bonds include redemption options exercisable at the Company's discretion from September 2026 to December 2026 (the 3% perpetual hybrid bond) and June 2029 to September 2029 (the 3.75% perpetual hybrid bond), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue.\n\nThe coupons associated with these perpetual bonds are fixed at 3% until 2026 and 3.75% until 2029, respectively, and would reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. The bonds are perpetual in nature and do not have maturity dates for the repayment of principal. The contractual terms of the perpetual hybrid bonds allow the Company to defer coupon payments, however certain contingent events could trigger mandatory payments of such deferred coupons, including the payment of dividends on and repurchase of ordinary shares, subject to certain exceptions in each case. As the Company has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these bonds, they are classified as equity instruments in these financial statements. During the year, the Company did not defer any eligible coupon payments and in December 2021 paid a coupon of \u00a36 million on the 3% December 2026 bond which has been recognised within equity. The fair value of these bonds at 31 December 2021 was \u00a31,651 million.\n\n## 5 Creditors\n\n|                                   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Amounts due to Group undertakings | 8         | 11        |\n| Loans due to Group undertakings   | 1,571     | 1,571     |\n| Other creditors                   | 1,244     | 1,495     |\n| Deferred income                   | 8         | 8         |\n|                                   | 2,831     | 3,085     |\n| Current                           | 1,746     | 202       |\n| Non-current                       | 1,085     | 2,883     |\n|                                   | 2,831     | 3,085     |\n\nAmounts due to Group undertaking of \u00a38 million (2020: \u00a311 million) are unsecured, interest free and repayable on demand. Loans due to Group undertakings of \u00a31,571 million (2020: \u00a31,571 million) are unsecured, bear interest at rates based on LIBOR between 1.47% and 1.50% (2020: 1.51% and 2.19%), and are repayable in 2022. Any new loans drawn down in 2022 are expected to bear interest at rates based on SONIA. Included in other creditors is a provision of \u00a31,211 million (2020: \u00a31,453 million) in respect of subsidiary undertaking borrowings guaranteed by the Company. Out of this amount, a total of \u00a3134 million (2020: \u00a3150 million) represents amounts to be settled within one year.\n\n## 6 Audit Fees\n\n|                                               | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Fees payable to KPMG                          |         |         |\n| - Audit fees (borne by another Group Company) | \u00a330,000 | \u00a330,000 |\n\n## 7 Contingent Liabilities\n\nBritish American Tobacco p.l.c. has guaranteed borrowings by subsidiary undertakings of \u00a336.6 billion (2020: \u00a343.1 billion) and total borrowing facilities of \u00a350.9 billion (2020: \u00a358.4 billion).\n\nThe Company has cross-guaranteed the funding commitments in respect of, and the liabilities of, the British American Tobacco UK Pension Fund ('Fund'). The last full triennial actuarial valuation of this Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2020 by a qualified independent actuary. The valuation showed that the fund had a surplus of \u00a3139 million on a Technical Provisions basis, in accordance with the statutory funding objective. The Trustee of the Fund also has a Long-Term Funding Target to be fully funded on a Solvency Liabilities basis by 2026, and on this basis the Fund had a surplus of \u00a37 million at the valuation date. On an IAS 19 basis, the Fund had a surplus at 31 December 2021 of \u00a3293 million (2020: \u00a3389 million). Contributions by the principal employer to the Fund in accordance with the agreed schedule of contributions are expected to be \u00a318 million in each of 2022 and 2023. In addition, there are contingent liabilities in respect of litigation in various countries (note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts).\n\n## 8 Post Balance Sheet Events\n\nOn 9 February 2022, the fourth quarterly interim dividend of 53.9p (\u00a31,236 million) declared by the Directors in February 2021, and reconfirmed to the market prior to 31 December 2021, was paid to shareholders. The impact of this on the Company was to reduce the level of profit and loss reserve from \u00a310,596 million to \u00a39,360 million.\n\nOn 10 February 2022, the Board declared an interim dividend of 217.8p per ordinary share of 25p for the year ended 31 December 2021, payable in four equal quarterly instalments of 54.45p per ordinary share in May 2022, August 2022, November 2022 and February 2023. These payments will be recognised as appropriations from reserves in 2022 and 2023. The total amount payable is estimated to be \u00a35,003 million based on the number of shares outstanding at the date of these accounts. In addition, on 10 February 2022 the Board approved a \u00a32 billion share repurchase program for 2022 as part of a new longer-term active capital allocation framework.",

According to the Group's internal estimates, the BAT Group is a market leader by volume in more than 50 countries, producing the cigarette chosen by one in eight of the world's one billion smokers.\n\nThe Group, excluding the Group's associated undertakings, is organised into four regions:\n\n- - the United States (U.S. - Reynolds American Inc.);\n- - Asia-Pacific and the Middle East (APME);\n- - Americas and Sub-Saharan Africa (AmSSA); and\n- - Europe and North Africa (ENA).\n\nThe Group's range of combustible products covers all segments, from value-for-money to premium with a portfolio of international, regional and local tobacco brands to meet a broad array of adult tobacco consumer preferences wherever the Group operates. The Group is investing in building a portfolio of potentially less harmful tobacco and nicotine products alongside its traditional tobacco business - including vapour products, tobacco heating products (THPs) and Modern Oral products, which are collectively termed the New Categories, as well as Traditional Oral products.\n\nThe Group manages a globally-integrated supply chain and its products are distributed to retail outlets worldwide.\n\n## History and development of BAT\n\nThe Group has had a significant global presence in the tobacco industry for over 100 years. BAT Ltd. was incorporated in 1902, when the Imperial Tobacco Company and the American Tobacco Company agreed to form a joint venture company. BAT Ltd. inherited companies and quickly expanded into major markets, including India and Ceylon, Egypt, Malaya, Northern Europe and East Africa. In 1927, BAT Ltd. expanded into the U.S. market through its acquisition of B&W.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the Group diversified its business under the umbrella of B.A.T Industries p.l.c., with acquisitions in the paper, cosmetics, retail and financial services industries, among others. Various business reorganisations followed as the business was eventually refocused on the Group's core cigarette, cigars and tobacco products businesses with BAT becoming a separately listed entity on the LSE in 1998.\n\nThe following is a summary of the significant mergers, acquisitions and disposals undertaken since 1998:\n\n- - 1999 - global merger with Rothmans International;\n- - 2000 - acquisition of Imperial Tobacco Canada;\n- - 2003 - acquisition of Ente Tabacchi Italiani S.p.A., Italy's stateowned tobacco company, Tabacalera Nacional in Peru and Duvanska Industrija Vranje in Serbia;\n- - 2004 - the U.S. assets, liabilities and operations, other than certain specified assets and liabilities, of BAT's wholly-owned subsidiary, B&W, were combined with RJR Tobacco Company to form Reynolds American Inc. As a result of the B&W business combination, B&W acquired beneficial ownership of approximately 42% of the Reynolds American Inc. shares;\n- - 2008 - acquisition of Tekel, the Turkish state-owned tobacco company and the cigarette and snus business of Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni A/S;\n- - 2009 - acquisition of an effective 99% interest in Bentoel in Indonesia;\n- - 2011 - acquisition of Protabaco in Colombia;\n- - 2012 - acquisition of CN Creative Limited in the UK;\n- - 2013 - entered into joint operations in China;\n- - 2015 - acquisition of the shares not already owned by the Group in Souza Cruz in Brazil, the acquisition of the CHIC Group in Poland, the acquisition of TDR d.o.o., a cigarette manufacturer in Central Europe. Also in 2015, the Group increased its investment in Reynolds American Inc. by US$4.7 billion to maintain the Group's approximate 42% equity position following Reynolds American Inc.'s purchase of Lorillard Inc.;\n- - 2016 - acquisition of Ten Motives in the UK;\n- - 2017 - acquisition of the remaining 57.8% of Reynolds American Inc. the Group did not already own. Following completion of the acquisition, Reynolds American Inc. became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of BAT and is no longer a publicly-held corporation. In 2017, the Group also acquired certain tobacco assets from Bulgartabac Holding AD in Bulgaria and Fabrika Duhana Sarajevo (FDS) in Bosnia, acquired Winnington Holdings AB in Sweden and acquired certain assets from Must Have Limited in the UK, including the electronic cigarette brand ViP.\n- - 2018 - acquisition of Quantus Beteiligungs-und Beratungsgesellschaft mbH in Germany;\n- - 2019 - acquisition of the Twisp Propriety Limited in South African and 60% of VapeWild Holdings LLC in the US;\n- - 2020 - acquisition of the nicotine pouch product assets of Dryft Sciences, LLC (Dryft) in the U.S. and the acquisition of Eastern Tobacco Company for Trading in Saudi Arabia;\n- - 2021 - entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Organigram Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of publicly-traded Organigram Holdings Inc., as part of which a Group subsidiary acquired a 19.9% equity stake in Organigram Holdings Inc., being a company focused on research and product development activities of next generation adult cannabis products, with an initial focus on cannabidiol; and\n- - 2021 - disposed of BAT Pars Company PJSC, the Group's Iranian subsidiary.\n\nBritish American Tobacco p.l.c. was incorporated in July 1997 under the laws of England and Wales as a public limited company and is domiciled in the United Kingdom.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nThe Group's business segments are not significantly affected by seasonality although in certain markets cigarette consumption trends rise during summer months due to longer daylight time and tourism.\n\n## Patents and trademarks\n\nOur trademarks, which include the brand names under which our products are sold, are key assets which we consider, in the aggregate, to be important to the business as a whole. As well as protecting our brand names by way of trademark registration, we also protect our innovations by means of patents and designs in key global jurisdictions.\n\n## Board oversight of M&A transactions\n\nThe Company's Board has strategic oversight of significant M&A transactions (determined by value or strategic nature of transaction), which are referred to it for noting under the Group Statement of Delegated Authorities (SoDA).\n\nOther M&A transactions are referred for strategic oversight to the Management Board or other applicable senior forum or persons, under the Group SoDA. Those referral requirements under the Group SoDA apply alongside any requirement for corporate approval of M&A transactions by or within a Group company.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Non-Financial Measures\n\n## Volume\n\nVolume is defined as the number of units sold. Units may vary between categories. This can be summarised for the principal metrics as follows:\n\n- - Factory made cigarettes (FMC) - sticks, regardless of weight or dimensions;\n- - Roll-Your-Own/Make-Your-Own - kilos, converted to a stick equivalent based upon 0.8 grams (per stick equivalent) for Roll-Your-Own and between 0.5 and 0.7 grams (per stick equivalent) for Make-Your-Own;\n- - Traditional oral - pouches (being 1:1 conversion to stick equivalent) and kilos, converted to a stick equivalent based upon 2.8 grams (per stick equivalent) for Moist Snuff, 2.0 grams (per stick equivalent) for Dry Snuff and 7.1 grams (per stick equivalent) for other oral;\n- - Modern Oral - pouches, being 1:1 conversion to stick equivalent;\n- - Tobacco Heat sticks - sticks, being 1:1 conversion to stick equivalent; and\n- - Vapour - pods and 10 millilitre bottles. There is no conversion to a stick equivalent.\n\nVolume is recognised in line with IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, based upon transfer of control. It is assumed that there is no material difference, in line with the Group's recognition of revenue, between the transfer of control and shipment date.\n\nVolume is used by management and investors to assess the relative performance of the Group and its brands within categories, given volume is a principal determinant of revenue.\n\n## Volume Share\n\nVolume share is the number of units bought by consumers of a specific brand or combination of brands, as a proportion of the total units bought by consumers in the industry, category or other sub-categorisation. Sub-categories include, but are not limited to, the total nicotine category, modern oral, vapour, traditional oral, total oral or cigarette. Except when referencing particular markets, volume share is based on our key markets (representing around 85% of the Group's cigarette and THP volume).\n\nWhere possible, the Group utilises data provided by third-party organisations, including AC Nielsen, based upon retail audit of sales to consumers. In certain markets, where such data is not available, other measures are employed which assess volume share based upon other movements within the supply chain, such as sales to retailers. This may depend on the provision of data to the industry by the customers including distributors/wholesalers.\n\nVolume share is used by management to assess the relative performance to the Group and its brands against the performance of its competitors in the categories and geographies in which the Group operates. This measure is also useful to understand the Group's performance when seeking to grow scale within a market or category from which future financial returns can be realised. The Group's management believes that this measure is useful to investors to understand the relative performance of the Group and its brands against the performance of its competitors in the categories and geographies in which the Group operates.\n\nVolume share in each year compares the average volume share in the year with the average volume share in the prior year. This is a more robust measure of performance, removing short-term volatility that may arise at a point in time.\n\nHowever, in certain circumstances, related to periods of introduction to a market, in order to illustrate the latest performance, data may be provided as at the end of the period rather than the average in that period. In these instances the Group states these are at a specific date (for instance, December 2021).\n\n## Value Share\n\nValue share is the retail value of units bought by consumers of a particular brand or combination of brands, as a proportion of the total retail value of units bought by consumers in the industry, category or other sub-categorisation in discussion. Except when referencing particular markets, value share is based on our key markets (representing around 90% of the Group's cigarette and THP value).\n\nWhere possible, the Group utilises data provided by third-party organisations, including AC Nielsen, based upon retail audit of sales to consumers. In certain markets, where such data is not available, other measures are employed which assess value share based upon other movements within the supply chain, such as sales to retailers. This may depend on the provision of data to the industry by the customers (including distributors and wholesalers).\n\nValue share is used by management to assess the relative performance of the Group and its brands against the performance of its competitors in the categories and geographies in which the Group operates, specifically indicating the Group's ability to realise value relative to the market. The measure is particularly useful when the Group's products and/or the relevant category in the market in which they are sold has developed or achieved scale from which value can be realised. The Group's management believes that this measure is useful to investors to apprehend the relative performance of the Group and its brands against the performance of its competitors in the categories and geographies in which the Group operates, specifically indicating the Group's ability to realise value relative to the market.\n\nValue share in each year compares the average value share in the year with the average value share in the prior period. This is a more robust measure of performance, removing short-term volatility that may arise at a point of time. However, in certain circumstances, related to periods of introduction to a market, in order to illustrate the latest performance, data may be provided that is as at the end of the period rather than the average in that period.

        "page_content": "## Price Mix\n\nPrice mix is a term used by management and investors to explain the movement in revenue between periods. Revenue is affected by the volume (how many units are sold) and the value (how much is each unit sold for). Price mix is used to explain the value component of the sales as the Group sells each unit for a value (price) but may also achieve a movement in revenue due to the relative proportions of higher value volume sold compared to lower value volume sold (mix).\n\nThis term is used to explain the Group's relative performance between periods only. It is calculated as the difference between the movement in revenue (between periods) and volume (between periods). For instance, the growth in combustibles revenue (excluding translational foreign exchange movements) of 4.0% in 2021, with a decline in combustibles volume of 0.3% in 2021, leads to a price mix of 4.3% in 2021. No assumptions underlie this metric as it utilises the Group's own data.\n\n## Non-Combustible Consumers\n\nThe number of consumers of Non-Combustible products is defined as the estimated number of Legal Age (minimum 18 years) consumers of the Group's Non-Combustible products. In markets where regular consumer tracking is in place, this estimate is obtained from adult consumer tracking studies conducted by third parties (including Kantar). In markets where regular consumer tracking is not in place, the number of consumers of Non-Combustible products is derived from volume sales of consumables and devices in such markets, using consumption patterns obtained from other similar markets with consumer tracking (utilising studies conducted by third parties including Kantar).\n\nThe number of Non-Combustible products consumers is used by management to assess the number of consumers regularly using the Group's New Categories products as the increase in Non-Combustible products is a key pillar of the Group's ESG Ambition and is integral to the sustainability of our business.\n\nThe Group's management believes that this measure is useful to investors given the Group's ESG ambition and alignment to the sustainability of the business with respect to the Non-Combustibles portfolio.\n\n## Total weight of unnecessary single use plastics in our packaging\n\nThis measure covers packaging for all Group products. We use the definition developed by the UK Plastics Pact for unnecessary singleuse plastics: 'items where consumption could be avoided through elimination, reuse or replacement and items that, post-consumption, commonly do not enter recycling and composting systems, or where they do, are not recycled due to their format, composition or size'. We began reporting on this metric in 2020, so 2019 data is not available.\n\n## % of operations sites at zero waste to landfill\n\nOperations sites refers to all BAT-owned cigarette manufacturing factories, sites manufacturing other tobacco products, Snus, Modern Oral and liquids and green leaf threshing (GLT) tobacco processing sites. We began reporting on this metric in 2020, so 2019 data is not available.\n\n## % of farms monitored for child labour; % of farms with incidents of child labour identified; Number of child labour incidents identified; % reported as resolved by end of the growing season\n\nData for these measures are collected for our contracted farmers by BAT field technicians (FTs) based on farmer and worker interviews and observations during monthly farm visits. These are recorded and tracked in our FSM system. All child labour data refers to hazardous child labour as defined by the ILO Convention No. 138 on Minimum Age and ILO Convention No. 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. For child labour incidents identified, our leaf operations and third-party suppliers work with the farmer to implement a remediation plan that considers the individual circumstances. Wherever possible, this plan involves local community or school support. Remediation is verified in follow-up visits to the farm. If there is a repeat instance, a formal written warning is given to the farmer. In a small number of cases, where there is persistent non-compliance, the farmer's contract is not renewed for the next growing season.",

The Group's management regularly reviews the measures used to assess and present the financial performance of the Group and, as relevant, its geographic segments.\n\n## Changes to Non-GAAP measures in 2021\n\nAs reported in 2020, Change in Revenue from Strategic Portfolio at constant rates of exchange ceased to be a KPI and has accordingly been removed as a non-GAAP measure. This was replaced as a KPI by Revenue from New Categories at constant rates of exchange, which has already been provided as a non-GAAP measure in previous reports.\n\n## Adjusted Revenue\n\n## Definition - revenue before the impact of adjusting items.\n\nTo supplement BAT's revenue presented in accordance with IFRS, the Group's Management Board, as the chief operating decision-maker, reviews adjusted revenue to evaluate the underlying business performance of the Group and its geographic segments. The Group's Management Board defines adjusted revenue as revenue before the impact of adjusting items (specifically the excise on bought-in goods that the Group acquired and sold which, for the period 2017 to 2019, has been recorded in accordance with IFRS as a cost of sale and within revenue, with a dilutive effect on operating margin).\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, as the short-term arrangements ceased or were immaterial, the goods are manufactured by the Group, and the excise, in accordance with Group policy, is not included in cost of sales or revenue. In 2019, this excise included in revenue led to a reduction in revenue and improvement in operating margin that did not represent the underlying performance of the Group. As such, the excise on bought-in goods in 2019 met the Group's definition of an adjusting item, as defined in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.\n\nThe Group's Management Board also believes that adjusted revenue provides information that enables investors to better compare the Group's business performance across periods. Adjusted revenue has limitations as an analytical tool. The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted revenue is revenue. Adjusted revenue is not a presentation made in accordance with IFRS, and is not a measure of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to revenue as determined in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted revenue is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider this performance measure in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BAT's results as determined in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe table below reconciles the Group's revenue to adjusted revenue for the periods presented and to adjusted revenue at constant rates based on a re-translation of adjusted revenue for each year at the previous year's exchange rates. Refer to note 2 in the Notes on the Accounts for further discussion of the segmental results and for the reconciliation of adjusted revenue at current and constant rates of exchange to segmental revenue and to Group revenue for the years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n|                                                                            | For the year ended 31 December (\u00a3m)   | For the year ended 31 December (\u00a3m)   | For the year ended 31 December (\u00a3m)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                                            | 2021                                  | 2020                                  | 2019                                  |\n| Revenue                                                                    | 25,684                                | 25,776                                | 25,877                                |\n| Less: Excise on goods bought-in on short-term arrangements                 | -                                     | -                                     | (50)                                  |\n| Adjusted revenue                                                           | 25,684                                | 25,776                                | 25,827                                |\n| Impact of translational foreign exchange                                   | 1,877                                 | 894                                   | (144)                                 |\n| 2021 adjusted revenue re-translated at 2020 exchange rates                 | 27,561                                |                                       |                                       |\n| 2020 adjusted revenue re-translated at 2019 exchange rates                 |                                       | 26,670                                |                                       |\n| 2019 adjusted revenue re-translated at 2018 exchange rates                 |                                       |                                       | 25,683                                |\n| Change in adjusted revenue at prior year's exchange rates (constant rates) | +6.9%                                 | +3.3%                                 | +5.6%                                 |",

The Group also presents adjusted operating margin, which is defined as adjusted profit from operations as a percentage of adjusted revenue, as defined previously. Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin are not measures defined by IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure to adjusted profit from operations is profit from operations.\n\nAdjusting items, as identified in accordance with the Group's accounting policies, represent certain items of income and expense which the Group considers distinctive based on their size, nature or incidence. In identifying and quantifying adjusting items, the Group consistently applies a policy that defines criteria that are required to be met for an item to be classified as adjusting and provides details of items that are specifically excluded from being classified as adjusting items. Adjusting items in profit from operations include restructuring and integration costs, amortisation of trademarks and similar intangibles, impairment of goodwill and charges in respect of certain litigation. The definition of adjusting items is explained in note 1 in the Notes on the Accounts.\n\nThe Group's Management Board believes that these additional measures are useful to investors and are used by the Group's Management Board as described above, because they exclude the impact of adjusting items which have less bearing on the routine ongoing operating activities of the Group, thereby enhancing users' understanding of underlying business performance. The Group's Management Board also believes that adjusted profit from operations provides information that enables investors to better compare the Group's business performance across periods. Additionally, the Group's Management Board believes that similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to the Group, many of which present an adjusted operating profit-related performance measure when reporting their results. Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin have limitations as analytical tools. They are not presentations made in accordance with IFRS, are not measures of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to profit for the year, profit from operations or operating margin as determined in accordance with IFRS. Adjusted profit from operations and adjusted operating margin are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, you should not consider these performance measures in isolation from, or as a substitute analysis for, BAT's results of operations as determined in accordance with IFRS.\n\nThe table below reconciles the Group's profit from operations to adjusted profit from operations, and to adjusted profit from operations at constant rates based on a re-translation of adjusted profit from operations for each year, at the previous year's exchange rates, and provides adjusted operating margin for the periods presented. Refer to note 2 in the Notes on the Accounts for further discussion of the segmental results and for the reconciliation of adjusted profit from operations at current and constant rates of exchange to segmental profit from operations and to Group profit for the years ended 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December (\u00a3m)\n\n|                                                                                           | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Profit from operations                                                                    | 10,234 | 9,962  | 9,016  |\n| Add:                                                                                      |        |        |        |\n| Restructuring and integration costs                                                       | 150    | 408    | 565    |\n| Amortisation and impairment of trademarks and similar intangibles                         | 306    | 339    | 481    |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                                                    | 57     | 209    | 194    |\n| (Income)/charge in respect of an excise tax dispute in Russia                             | -      | (40)   | 202    |\n| Charge in respect of Canada class action                                                  | -      | -      | 436    |\n| Charge in respect of MSA liabilities related to brands sold to a third party              | -      | 400    | -      |\n| Credit in respect of the partial buy-out of the pension fund in the U.S.                  | (35)   | -      | -      |\n| Charge in respect of the sale of the Group's operations in Iran                           | 358    | -      | -      |\n| Other, including litigation                                                               | 80     | 87     | 236    |\n| Adjusted profit from operations                                                           | 11,150 | 11,365 | 11,130 |\n| Operating margin                                                                          | 39.8%  | 38.6%  | 34.8%  |\n| Adjusted operating margin*                                                                | 43.4%  | 44.1%  | 43.1%  |\n| Impact of translational foreign exchange                                                  | 802    | 296    | (98)   |\n| 2021 adjusted profit from operations re-translated at 2020 exchange rates                 | 11,952 |        |        |\n| 2020 adjusted profit from operations re-translated at 2019 exchange rates                 |        | 11,661 |        |\n| 2019 adjusted profit from operations re-translated at 2018 exchange rates                 |        |        | 11,032 |\n| Change in adjusted profit from operations at prior year's exchange rates (constant rates) | +5.2%  | +4.8%  | +6.6%  |",

The Group's Management Board reviews certain of its results, including adjusted revenue, revenue growth from New Categories, adjusted profit from operations and adjusted diluted earnings per share, at constant rates of exchange. The Group calculates these financial measures at constant rates of exchange based on a re-translation, at prior year exchange rates, of the current year's results of the Group and, where applicable, its geographic segments. The Group does not adjust for the normal transactional gains and losses in profit from operations that are generated by exchange movements. Although the Group does not believe that these measures are a substitute for IFRS measures, the Group's Management Board does believe that such results excluding the impact of currency fluctuations year-on-year provide additional useful information to investors regarding the Group's operating performance on a local currency basis. Accordingly, the constant rates of exchange financial measures appearing in the discussion of the Group results of operations (beginning on page 74) should be read in conjunction with the information provided in note 2 in the Notes on the Accounts.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, results were affected by translational exchange rate movements. In 2021, at the prevailing exchange rates, adjusted revenue declined by 0.4%, revenue growth from New Categories increased 42.4% and adjusted profit from operations declined by 1.9% versus 2020. At constant rates of exchange, adjusted revenue would have increased by 6.9%, revenue from New Categories would have increased by 50.9% and adjusted profit from operations would have increased by 5.2%. This lower growth rate at prevailing exchange rates reflects the negative translational impact as a result of the relative strengthening of the pound sterling. In 2020, at the prevailing exchange rates, adjusted revenue declined by 0.4%, adjusted profit from operations increased by 2.1%, adjusted revenue from the strategic portfolio increased by 4.0% and adjusted revenue from New Categories increased by 14.9% versus 2019. At constant rates of exchange, adjusted revenue would have increased by 3.3%, adjusted profit from operations would have increased by 4.8%, adjusted revenue from the strategic portfolio would have increased by 7.0% and adjusted revenue from New Categories would have increased by 15.4%. This lower growth rate at prevailing exchange rates reflects the negative translational impact as a result of the relative strengthening of the pound sterling.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, adjusted diluted earnings per share was affected by translational exchange rate movements. In 2021, the adjusted diluted earnings per share of 329.0p, a decrease of 0.8%, would, when translated at 2020 exchange rates, have been 353.5p, an increase of 6.6%. This lower growth rate, in 2021, at prevailing exchange rates, reflects the negative translational impact as a result of the relative strength of the pound sterling. In 2020, the adjusted diluted earnings per share of 331.7p, an increase of 2.4%, would, when translated at 2019 exchange rates, have been 341.4p, an increase of 5.5%. This lower growth rate, in 2020, at prevailing exchange rates, reflects the negative translational impact as a result of the relative strength of the pound sterling.",

        "page_content": "## Additional Disclosures on Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Group's cash inflows derive principally from its operating activities. They are supplemented when required by cash flows from financing activities, typically to support general corporate requirements but also, from time to time, to support acquisitions. The principal sources of liquidity for the Group are cash flows generated from the operating business and proceeds from issuances of debt securities described below under 'capital resources'.\n\nThe Board reviews and agrees the overall treasury policies and procedures, delegating appropriate oversight to the Finance and Transformation Director and the treasury function. The treasury policies include a set of financing principles and key performance indicators. The Group's treasury position is monitored by a Corporate Finance Committee chaired by the Finance and Transformation Director. Treasury operations are subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.\n\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, all contractual borrowing covenants were met and none are expected to inhibit the Group's operations or funding plans. In 2020, the Group's financial covenant (interest cover) was removed from the terms of the revolving credit facility and syndicated term loan.\n\n## Capital Expenditure\n\nGross capital expenditures include purchases of property, plant and equipment and purchases of certain intangibles. The Group's gross capital expenditures for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were \u00a3664 million, \u00a3648 million and \u00a3807 million, respectively, representing investment in the Group's global operational infrastructure (including, but not limited to, the manufacturing network, trade marketing and IT systems). The Group expects gross capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately \u00a3750 million, representing the ongoing investment in the Group's operational infrastructure, including the continued investment into New Categories. This is expected to be funded by the Group's cash flows and existing facilities.\n\n## Hedging Instruments\n\nAs discussed in note 23 in the Notes on the Accounts, the Group hedges its exposure to interest rate movements and currency movements. BAT's cash flow hedges are principally in respect of sales or purchases of inventory and certain debt instruments. A certain number of forward foreign currency contracts were used to manage the currency profile of external borrowings. Interest rate swaps have been used to manage the interest rate profile of external borrowings, while cross-currency swaps have been used to manage the currency profile of external borrowings.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\n## Policy\n\nThe Group utilises cash pooling and zero balancing bank account structures in addition to intercompany loans and borrowings to ensure that there is the maximum mobilisation of cash within the Group. The key objectives of treasury in respect of cash and cash equivalents are to protect the principal value of the Group's cash and cash equivalents, to concentrate cash at the centre to minimise the required long-term debt issuance, including perpetual hybrid debt treated as an equity instrument, and to optimise the yield earned. The amount of debt the Group issues is determined by forecasting the net debt requirement after the mobilisation of cash. Subsidiary companies are funded by share capital and retained earnings, loans from the central finance companies on commercial terms or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies. All contractual borrowing covenants have been met and none are expected to inhibit the Group's operations or funding plans.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nThe following table sets out the Group's long- and short-term borrowings as of the dates indicated:\n\n1\n\nAs of 31 December (\u00a3m)\n\n|                                                                                | Currency          | Maturity dates   | Interest rates at 31 December 2021   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Eurobonds 2                                                                    | Euro              | 2022 to 2045     | 0.9% to 3.1%                         | 7,316  | 8,875  | 7, 591     |\n|                                                                                | Euro              | 2021             | 3m EURIBOR +50bps                    | -      | 984    | 931        |\n|                                                                                | UK pound sterling | 2022 to 2055     | 2.1% to 7.3%                         | 4,086  | 4,590  | 4,161      |\n|                                                                                | Swiss franc       | 2026             | 1.4%                                 | 203    | 540    | 510        |\n| Bonds issued pursuant  to rules under the  U.S. Securities Act (as  amended) 2 | US dollar         | 2022 to 2050     | 1.7% to 8.1%                         | 25,625 | 25,461 | 23,805     |\n|                                                                                | US dollar         | 2022             | USD 3m LIBOR + 88bps                 | 554    | 548    | 1,325      |\n| Commercial Paper 2                                                             |                   |                  |                                      | 269    | -      | 1,056      |\n| Other loans                                                                    |                   |                  |                                      | 500    | 1,929  | 4,624      |\n| Bank loans                                                                     |                   |                  |                                      | 313    | 317    | 293        |\n| Bank overdrafts                                                                |                   |                  |                                      | 346    | 249    | 491        |\n| Finance leases                                                                 |                   |                  |                                      | 446    | 475    |            |\n| Total                                                                          |                   |                  |                                      | 39,658 | 43,968 | 579 45,366 |\n\n## Notes :\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Group Risk Factors\n\n## Business Execution and Supply Chain Risks\n\n## Risk: Competition from illicit trade.\n\n## Description\n\nIllicit trade, illegal products and tobacco trafficking in the form of counterfeit products, smuggled genuine products (product diversion), and locally manufactured products, which do not comply with applicable regulations and/or in which applicable taxes are evaded, represent a significant and growing threat to the legitimate tobacco industry and New Categories products. Factors such as increasing levels of taxation, price increases, economic downturn, lack of law enforcement, appropriate penalties and weak border control are encouraging more adult tobacco and New Categories consumers to switch to illegal cheaper tobacco and New Categories products and are providing greater rewards for counterfeiters and smugglers. Regulatory restrictions such as plain packaging or graphic health warnings, display bans, flavour or ingredient restrictions and increased compliance costs further disadvantage legitimate industry participants by providing competitive advantages to illicit manufacturers and distributors of illicit tobacco and New Categories products.\n\nIn addition, third parties may seek to divert product when there is an arbitrage opportunity for them between lower and higher excise countries.\n\n## Impact\n\nIllicit trade has an adverse effect on the Group's overall sales volume and may restrict the ability to increase selling prices. Illicit trade can also damage brand equity and reputation, which could undermine the Group's investment in Trade Marketing and Distribution. Operational costs (e.g. track and trace costs) can increase and the product may become commoditised.\n\nThese factors in turn could reduce profits and have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial conditions and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans. Further, counterfeit products (especially New Categories) and other illicit products could harm consumers, damaging goodwill and/or the category (with lower volumes and reduced profits), and potentially leading to misplaced claims against BAT and further regulation and also lead to a failure to deliver our corporate harm reduction objective. In addition, as the Group has contractual and legislative obligations to prevent the diversion of our products into illicit channels, actual and perceived breaches of the obligations to prevent product diversion into illicit channels can lead to substantial fines in the forms of seizure payments and legislative penalties (including financial penalties), as well as the risk of reputational damage (including negative perceptions of our governance and our ESG credentials) from Group products being found in illicit channels.\n\n## Risk: Geopolitical tensions that have the potential to disrupt the Group's business in multiple markets.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group's operations and financial condition are influenced by the economic and political situations in the markets and regions in which it has operations, which are often unpredictable and outside of its control. Some markets in which the Group operates face the threat of civil unrest and can be subject to frequent changes in regime. In others, there is a risk of terrorism, conflict, global health crisis, war, organised crime or other criminal activity. The Group is also exposed to economic policy changes in jurisdictions in which it operates. In addition, some markets maintain trade barriers or adopt policies that favour domestic producers, preventing or restricting the Group's sales.\n\n## Impact\n\nDeterioration of socio-economic or political conditions could lead to injury or loss of life, restricted mobility, loss of assets and/or denial of access to BAT sites that reduce the Group's access to particular markets or may disrupt the Group's operations, such as supply chain, or manufacturing or distribution capabilities. Such disruption may result in increased taxes and/or other costs due to the need for more complex supply chain and security arrangements, to build new facilities or to maintain inefficient facilities, or in a reduction of the Group's sales volume. Further, there may be reputational damage, including negative perceptions of our governance and protection of our people and our ESG credentials.\n\nRisk: Disruption to the Group's data and information technology systems, including by cyber attack or the malicious manipulation or disclosure of confidential or sensitive information.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group increasingly relies on data and information technology systems for its daily business operations, internal communications, controls, reporting and relations with customers and suppliers. Some of these systems are managed by third-party service providers. A significant disruption of the Group's systems, including those managed by third-party service providers, due to computer viruses, cyber threats, malicious intrusions or unintended or malicious behaviour by employees, contractors or services providers could affect the Group's communications and operations. Computer viruses and cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated. In addition, such disruption may compromise the integrity of information and result in the inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, or may lead to false or misleading statements being made about the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Risk: Disruption to the Group's data and information technology systems, including by cyber attack or the malicious manipulation or disclosure of confidential or sensitive information continued.\n\n## Impact\n\nAny disruption to technology systems related to the Group's operations could adversely affect its business and result in financial and reputational losses. Any delays or failure to rapidly detect or respond to attempts to gain unauthorised access to the Group's information technology systems through a cyber attack can lead to a loss of access to systems or information being corrupted or lost, resulting in significantly increased costs for remediation and reputational consequences. Any delay in response will also impact the outcome.\n\nSecurity breaches and the loss of data or operational capacity may disrupt relationships throughout the supply chain, expose the Group or our consumers to a risk of loss or misuse of information, which could further expose the Group to liability, impact the Group's reputation and lead to increased costs.\n\nThe disclosure of trade secrets or other commercially sensitive information may provide competitors with a competitive advantage resulting in competitive or operational damage to the Group. The disclosure of confidential and sensitive information about the Group's employees, customers, consumers, suppliers or other third parties could compromise data privacy and expose the Group to liability.\n\nFailure to effectively prevent or respond to a major breach or cyber attack may also subject the Group to significant reputational damage.\n\n## Risk: Failure to meet current or future New Categories demand.\n\n## Description\n\nThe New Categories supply chain is a multi-tiered and complex environment with reliance on multiple factors, such as third-party suppliers' ability to upscale production in order to meet demand while maintaining product quality, dependency on single suppliers at various points in the chain and the Group's ability to build adequate consumables production capacity in line with product demand. The geographical spread of suppliers and customers exposes the Group to political and economic conflicts such as Brexit and trade wars which may compromise the New Categories supply chain. Given the developing nature of the New Categories portfolio, there is also an enhanced risk that some products may not meet product quality and safety standards or may be subject to regulatory changes, leading to product recalls, which we have experienced in the past, or bans of certain ingredients or products. In addition, the New Categories supply chain may be vulnerable to changes in local legislation related to liquid nicotine that could increase import duties. Furthermore, the New Categories supply chain includes the development of sensitive trade secrets jointly with external design partners, which carries the risk of exposure of innovations to competitors.\n\n## Impact\n\nVulnerabilities in the New Categories supply chain may impact the Group's ability to maintain supply and meet the current and future demand requirements across the New Categories portfolio, potentially resulting in significant reputational harm and financial impact that may negatively affect the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans. Over-forecasting may also lead to write-off and negatively impact working capital. The design of New Categories devices may also prevent the scaling of commercial manufacturing, which will either restrict supply or increase the costs of production.\n\nFurther, there may be loss of investors' confidence in ESG performance, including failure to deliver our corporate purpose of harm reduction.\n\nIn addition, changes in local legislation related to liquid nicotine import duties may increase New Categories production costs, which may increase end market pricing and reduce demand. Furthermore, the exposure of sensitive trade secrets can lead to competitive disadvantages and further negatively impact the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\n## Risk: Failure of a financial counterparty.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group relies on transactions with a variety of financial counterparties to manage the Group's business and financial risks. In the event that any of these counterparties fails, payments due from such counterparties, such as under hedging or insurance contracts, may not be recovered. In addition, failure of a transactional banking party may lead to the loss of cash balances and disruption to payment systems involving such counterparty.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe inability to recover payments due from one or more failed financial counterparties or the loss of cash balances may cause significant financial loss and have an adverse impact on the Group's results of operations, financial condition and financial risk profile. In addition, the loss of cash balances or a disruption to payment systems may cause disruption to the Group's ongoing operations and ability to pay its creditors and suppliers.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Group Risk Factors\n\n## Continued\n\n## Business Execution and Supply Chain Risks Continued\n\n## Risk: Exposure to unavailability of, and price volatility, in raw materials and increased costs of employment.\n\n## Description\n\nThe availability and price of various commodities required in the manufacture of the Group's products fluctuate. Raw materials and other inputs used in the Group's business, such as wood pulp and energy, are commodities that are subject to price volatility caused by numerous factors, including political influence, market fluctuations and natural disasters.\n\nSimilarly, the Group is exposed to the risk of an increase above inflation in employment costs, including due to governmental action to introduce or increase minimum wages. Employment and health care law changes may also increase the cost of provided health care and other employment benefits expenses.\n\n## Impact\n\nRestricted availability and price volatility of commodities may result in supply shortages and unexpected increases in costs for raw materials and packaging for the Group's products, which may affect the Group's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nSimilarly, the Group's profitability may be affected by increases in overall employment costs.\n\nThe Group may not be able to increase prices to offset increased costs without suffering reduced sales volume and revenue. In the absence of compensating for increased costs through pricing, significant increases in raw material, packaging and employment costs above inflation will impact product margins, leading to lower profits and negatively affecting the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\n## Risk: Failure to retain key personnel or to attract and retain skilled talent.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group relies on a number of highly experienced employees with detailed knowledge of the tobacco industry, other areas of focus for the Group (including New Categories and Beyond Nicotine) and the Group's business. Similarly, the Group is dependent on its ability to identify, attract, develop and retain such qualified personnel in the future. The Group is also dependent on external hires to ensure that there are the right new business critical capabilities and knowledge to accelerate transformation. BAT anticipates that this trend will continue and therefore the ability to continue to build awareness, increase reach and ultimately attract the new target audience remains a primary focus.\n\nThe shift in career development expectations from new hires are leading to shorter tenures. Although the Group is increasing its effort on retaining critical capabilities and knowledge, following any departure of new external hires, there can be no assurance that this effort will be successful. Furthermore, broader economic and ESG trends may impact the Group's ability to retain key employees and may increase competition for highly talented employees, potentially resulting in the loss of experienced employees.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf the Group is unable to retain its existing key employees or to attract and retain skilled talent in the future, critical positions may be left vacant, which could adversely impact the delivery of strategic objectives, which could ultimately impact the Group's results of operations, financial condition and achieving its ESG related ambitions.\n\nHigh voluntary employee turnover may also reduce organisational performance and productivity, which may have a further adverse impact on the Group's results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Risk: Disruption to the supply chain and distribution channels.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group has an increasingly global approach to managing its supply chain and distribution channels and is exposed to the risk of disruption to any aspect of the Group's supply chain, to suppliers' operations or to distribution channels, and the deterioration in the financial condition of a trading partner. This is especially so in our New Categories Supply Chain which is a multi-tiered and complex environment.\n\nSuch disruption may be caused by a cyber event, global health crisis, major fire, violent weather conditions or other natural disasters that affect manufacturing or other facilities of the Group's operating subsidiaries or those of their suppliers and distributors. In certain geographic areas where the Group operates, insurance coverage may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Coverage may be subject to limitations or the Group may be unable to recover damages from its insurers.\n\nDisruption may also be caused by spread of infectious disease (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or by a deterioration/shortage in labour or union relations, disputes or work stoppages or other labour-related developments within the Group or its suppliers and distributors.\n\nIn addition, the Group's operating subsidiaries may not be able to establish or maintain relationships on favourable commercial terms with their suppliers and distributors. In some markets, distribution of the Group's products is through third-party monopoly channels, often licensed by governments. The Group may be unable to renew these third-party supplier and distribution agreements on satisfactory terms for numerous reasons, including government regulations or ESG considerations.\n\nFurthermore, there are some product categories for which the Group does not have spare production capacity or where substitution between different production plants is very difficult. Consolidation of global suppliers and certain distributors that control large geographies may reduce the Group's availability of alternatives and negatively impact the Group's negotiating power with key suppliers and distributors.\n\nThese risks are particularly relevant in jurisdictions where the Group's manufacturing facilities are more concentrated or for certain product categories where production is more centralised.",

Digital transformation and innovation are key drivers of the Group's ethos and Quest, which includes new and modern categories of products, increased interaction with customers, data-driven decision making and cost optimisation efforts driven by automated and modernised processes. Examples of the Group's ambitions that depend on digital transformation include:\n\n- - the ability to leverage our data assets to generate insights and foresights as a key driver of revenue growth;\n- - the expansion and flexibility of technology solutions to streamline the market realisation of new products and marketing campaigns; and\n- - the ability to build new solutions and the flexibility to react to market disruptions.\n\nThe Group must effectively implement new ways of working and supporting technologies to fully develop the digital agenda defined by the Board (e.g. digital channels, data and analytics, automation, etc.).\n\nThe Group may see stalled progress in the pace of digital transformation and hampered strategy goals realisation if the necessary information and digital technology is not ready to support the business implementation of global functional transformations (e.g. direct relationship with consumers, integrated planning, demand forecasting and revenue growth management). The unavailability of the necessary digital technology may be due to missing technology capabilities, lack of scalability or poor data quality. Shortage of skills and ineffective ways of working may slow down the pace of the Group's digital transformation and hamper its value realisation processes. In addition, sub-optimal design of the global digital platforms implemented by BAT may lead to the fragmentation and under-utilisation of such platforms and slow down the Group's digital transformation.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Group's multi-category strategy requires dealing with different consumer needs and behaviours as well as complying with various regulations, which increasingly require the expansion and flexibility of technology solutions. This may lead to the fragmentation and under-utilisation of existing and future technology solutions. Similarly, increased control and centralisation of the technology solutions and delivery mechanisms may slow down the effective delivery of the Group's digital transformation and innovation.\n\nThe Group's inability to adapt to the ever-changing digital space and fully exploit the value expected from digital transformation may have an adverse impact on its competitive edge, market share and profitability, and may prevent the Group from reaching its medium and longterm financial targets.\n\n## Risk: Exposure to product contamination.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group may experience product contamination, whether by accident or deliberate malicious intent, during supply chain or manufacturing processes, or may otherwise fail to comply with the Group's quality standards. The Group may also receive threats of malicious tampering.\n\n## Impact\n\nProduct contamination or threats of contamination may expose the Group to significant costs associated with recalling products from the market or temporarily ceasing production. In addition, adult tobacco consumers may lose confidence in the specific brand affected by the contamination, resulting in reputational damage and a loss of sales volume and market share. The Group could be subject to liability and costs associated with civil and criminal actions as well as regulatory sanctions brought in connection with a contamination of the Group's products. Each of these results may in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations, financial condition and reputation and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Group Risk Factors\n\n## Continued\n\n## Business Execution and Supply Chain Risks Continued\n\n## Risk: Inability to obtain adequate supplies of tobacco leaf.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group purchases significant volumes of packed leaf each year. Tobacco leaf supplies are impacted by a variety of factors, including weather conditions, drought, flood and other natural disasters, growing conditions, diseases causing crop failure, climate change and local planting decisions. Tobacco production in certain countries is also subject to a variety of controls, including regulation affecting farming and production control programmes, and competition for land use from other agriculture products. Such controls and competition can further constrain the production of tobacco leaf, raising prices and reducing supply.\n\nHuman rights issues may arise in connection with our tobacco leaf supply chain. Due to the large number of casual and temporary workers, the use of family labour in small-scale farming and high levels of rural poverty, the agricultural sector as a whole is vulnerable to human rights issues. The Group recognises that child labour is a risk to our tobacco leaf supply chain. The aforementioned issues could also threaten the next generation of farmers as young people move away from the rural areas to the cities.\n\n## Impact\n\nRestricted availability of tobacco leaf may impact the quality of the Group's products to a level that may prevent the Group accessing sufficient tobacco leaf that meets volume, quality and the Group's ESG compliance impacting the Group's ability to deliver on consumer needs. Accordingly, the reduction of tobacco leaf supply may impact supply and demand of the Group's products and have a negative impact on results of operations. The Group's commitment to ESG may result in higher tobacco leaf prices. Higher tobacco leaf prices may also increase the Group's costs for raw materials and have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. The Group may also experience reputation damage from failing to manage human rights issues in our leaf supply chain, which may impact availability of suppliers willing to do business with us.\n\n## Risk: Failure to successfully design, implement and sustain an integrated operating model.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group aims to improve profitability and productivity through supply chain improvements and the implementation of an integrated operating model and organisational structure, including standardisation of processes, centralised back-office services and a common IT platform. The Group undertakes transformation initiatives periodically which aim to simplify the organisation and facilitate growth. The Group's efforts to achieve these goals are driven and enabled through use of our TaO (central SAP ERP system) global template - a standardised process used by all BAT entities globally with the use of a central SAP instance common for BAT subsidiaries (excluding Reynolds American Inc. and its subsidiaries). These processes include, among others, core back-office global processes, procurement, warehouse management, accounting and controlling.\n\n## Impact\n\nFailure by the Group to successfully design, implement and sustain the integrated operating model, organisational structure and transformation initiatives could lead to the failure to realise anticipated benefits, increased costs, disruption to operations, decreased trading performance, disgruntled employees, loss of institutional knowledge and reduced market share. These results could in turn reduce profitability and funds available for investment by the Group in long-term growth opportunities. Lack of adherence to the TaO template, as well as template degradation over time, may result in the failure to maintain achieved productivity gains and capture additional productivity gains which may in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\n## Risk: Failure to uphold the high standard of ESG management.\n\n## Description\n\nStakeholder expectations of Group's ESG performance are continually evolving. The Group may fail to have the appropriate internal standards, strategic plans and governance, monitoring and reporting mechanisms in place to ensure it can identify emerging issues, meet external expectations and align with recognised international standards.\n\n## Impact\n\nFailure to uphold high standards of ESG management or provide transparent and consistent reporting could seriously impact Group reputation and reduce investor confidence. In addition, poor performance across any aspect of ESG, such as a failure to address climate change or human rights impacts across the Group's business and supply chain, could result in increased regulation, difficulty in attracting and retaining talent, criminal or civil prosecution, or decreases in consumer demand for our products. As well as resulting in our failure to deliver our ESG targets.",

        "page_content": "## Risk: Failure to manage the Group's climate change risk\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group is currently exposed to violent weather conditions or other natural disasters in locations across the Group, further climate changes may lead to acute risks such as more frequent and severe weather events or chronic risks such as events relating to longerterm shifts in climate patterns and higher temperatures, which, among other things, could lead to reductions in the supply and quality of tobacco leaf and other supplies and cause other disruptions in our supply chains.\n\nThe Group will also experience transitional risks associated to low carbon economy. The TCFD was introduced by the Financial Sustainability Board (FSB) for companies, investors and other financial stakeholders to disclose climate-related financial risk. As climate change legislation is evolving rapidly, companies are required to adapt quickly to identify, assess, monitor and mitigate climate change related transitional risks, failure to adapt could lead to BAT scoring lower in sustainability benchmarking indices, such as CDP and DJSI.\n\nAs consumer behaviours and expectations evolve, the Group may fail to adapt its product portfolio and marketing strategy in response to stakeholders' increasing environmental expectations. Factors such as emerging climate-change, product sustainability and circularity related aspects of the products may result in the potential rejection of the Group's products as well as reputational risk in relation to business performance and sustainability in comparison to peers.\n\n## Impact\n\nAny disruption to the Group's supply chain (including agricultural supply chain) and distribution channels could have an adverse effect on the results of operations and financial conditions of the Group through failures to meet shipment demand, contract disputes, increased costs, reduced production capacity and loss of market share.\n\nConsumer behaviours and expectations related to environmental issues and the Group's sustainability credentials are rapidly starting to influence their purchasing choices which may lead to consumers seeking alternative sustainable products. The inability to timely develop and roll out sustainable innovations or products in line with consumer demand, including any failure to predict changes in consumer and societal behaviour and expectations and to fill gaps in the product portfolio, as well as the risk of poor product quality, could lead to missed opportunities, under- or over-supply, loss of competitive advantage, loss of market share, unrecoverable costs and/or the erosion of the Group's consumer base or brand equity. There are also further financial implications from having to fund Extended Producer Responsibility schemes.\n\nLower ESG rating by investors, investor-owned platforms or other commonly used indices (e.g. CDP, DJSI) may impact perceived business resilience, sustainability and share price. Investors are becoming increasingly interested in the environmental sustainability of listed companies and their resilience in overall ESG matters is influencing their investment decisions.\n\nEmployees are also becoming increasingly aware of the climate change impact and have higher expectations of the effect that the Group has on the environment which has bearings on employee retention and the Group's attractiveness to future employees.\n\nNon-compliance with the TCFD could reduce BAT's ability to attract investors and result in reputational damage and potentially other sanctions.",

The consequences of COVID-19 may include significant logistical challenges for staff and their ability to perform their duties, potential loss of lives or significant level of illness in the workforce, inability to deliver revenue stream and market share targets impacting profits and cash flows, disruption to supply chain and third parties unable to deliver contractual goods and services. In addition, some countries in which the Group operates have adopted regulations restricting the ability to manufacture, distribute, market and sell products.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the Group's results of operations and financial condition is uncertain and cannot be predicted as the pandemic evolves.\n\nThe long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Group's business will depend on a range of factors which we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the geographies impacted, the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and the nature and severity of measures adopted by governments. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\n- - Reductions or volatility in consumer demand for one or more of our products due to illness, retail closures, quarantine or other travel restrictions, health consciousness (quitting use of tobacco and nicotine products), government restrictions, the deterioration of socioeconomic conditions, economic hardship and customer-downtrading (switching to a cheaper brand), which may impact the Group's market share.\n- - Disruptions to the Group's operations, such as its supply chain, or manufacturing or distribution capabilities, which may result in increased costs due to the need for more complex supply chain arrangements, to expand existing facilities or to maintain inefficient facilities, a reduction of the Group's sales volumes or an increase in bad debts from customers.\n- - Disruption to the Group's operations resulting from a significant number of the Group's employees, including employees performing key functions, working remotely for extended periods of time or becoming ill, which may reduce the employees' efficiency and productivity and cause product development delays, hamper new product innovation and have other adverse effects on the Group's business.\n- - Significant volatility in financial markets (including exchange rate volatility) and measures adopted by governments and central banks that further restrict liquidity, which may limit the Group's access to funds, lead to shortages of cash and cash equivalents needed to operate the Group's business, and impact the Group's ability to refinance its existing debt.\n- - Regulations restricting the ability to manufacture, distribute, market and sell products, and potentially increasing illicit trade.\n- - Governments seeking to increase revenues through increased corporate taxes and excise in combustible and/or New Category products, increasing the cost and prices of our products - which could reduce volumes and margins, and/or increase illicit trade.\n\nAll of these factors may have material adverse effects on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.",

Such restrictions are introduced by legislation, regulations and/or voluntary agreements. Most tobacco and nicotine control measures can be categorised as follows:\n\n- - Category Bans: including regulations that ban the sale, import, possession, or use of certain product categories, entirely (e.g. New Categories);\n- - Place: including regulations restricting consumption in private and public spaces (e.g. public place smoking or vaping bans, including restaurants and bars);\n- - Product: including regulations on the use of or testing for ingredients, product design and attributes (e.g. tar/ nicotine / carbon monoxide ceilings) flavours bans (including menthol); product safety (e.g. reduced cigarette ignition propensity standards); product disclosure (e.g. ingredients and emissions) and environmental impact (e.g. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) requirements for cigarette filters);\n- - Packaging and labelling: including regulations on health warnings and other government-mandated messages; restrictions on the use of certain descriptors and brand names; requirements on pack shape, size, weight and colour; and mandatory plain packaging;\n- - Advertising, promotion and sponsorship: including partial or total bans on advertising , promotions and sponsorship, and online and direct engagement communication;\n- - Purchase: including regulations on where the products are sold, such as type of outlet (e.g. supermarkets and vending machines), radius or distance restrictions (e.g. 300 meters from a school), online sales bans, regulation regarding how they are sold and displayed (e.g. above the counter or under the counter) and minimum purchase age and increases thereto; and\n- - Price: including regulations that have implications on prices and margins (e.g. excise taxes, minimum prices and import/export duties).\n\nThe Group believes that further tobacco control and nicotine regulation is expected over the medium term in many of the Group's markets. Irresponsible behaviour or marketing practices of competitors (for example where there is a lack of appropriate regulation) or actions contrary to the regulations in certain markets, may cause reputational harm to the industry as a whole and may result in additional regulation or bans. Further, there is pressure on governments from international organisations and agencies, tobacco control NGOs, vanguard regulators and the private sector (including philanthropists, pharmaceutical and security technology companies and social justice groups) to pursue regulatory policies and implement tobacco or nicotine product-related regulation which is not science or evidence based and is aimed at increasing the complexity and cost burden on the tobacco or nicotine industry, limiting the commercial viability of tobacco and nicotine products or prohibiting the products completely. Regulators may be lacking in understanding of New Categories products and their role in tobacco harm reduction due to their novelty. These factors can lead to a lack of adequate or existing regulatory regimes or clear and appropriate product classifications.\n\nIn addition, the Group may fail to implement the right level of control measures or to maintain adequate standards of compliance with regulatory measures. For example, the Group's marketing activities may fail to comply with the relevant law and regulations or with the Group's International Marketing Principles.\n\nInsufficient information, instruction and training in the relevant areas and a lack of knowledge of the existence and/or requirements of relevant regulations including tobacco and nicotine as well as other relevant regulations, such as battery regulation, or a failure to monitor, assess and implement the requirements of new or modified regulation, may increase these risks.\n\nThere may also be negative and disproportionate societal responses to consumer abuse or misuse of tobacco and/or nicotine products (e.g. in New Categories) or to certain categories of products.\n\n## Traditional Tobacco Products\n\nWith respect to tobacco and combustible products, many of the measures outlined in the FCTC have been or are in the process of being implemented through national legislation in many markets in which the Group operates, including recommendations for plain packaging and flavour bans (e.g. menthol bans - in effect in the European Union since 20 May 2020). In April 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA')announced that it will issue proposed product standards to ban menthol as a characterising flavour in cigarettes in the U.S. In December 2021, a regulatory agenda released in the U.S. confirmed the FDA's plans to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a menthol cigarette ban in April 2022. Further, various national or international regulatory regimes may seek to require the reduction of nicotine levels in tobacco products.\n\nIn March 2018, the FDA published its Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled 'Tobacco Product Standard for Nicotine Level of Combusted Cigarettes' and invited interested parties to submit comments on, among other issues, maximum nicotine limits and whether any maximum nicotine level should apply to combustible tobacco products. In October 2019, the FDA withdrew the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking without explanation.\n\nIn the U.S., manufacturers of all tobacco products deemed to be under the authority of the FDA as of 2016 (which includes vapour and Modern Oral products that contain or can be used with tobacco-derived nicotine) must submit information to the FDA seeking formal marketing authorisation of such products.\n\nIn 2021, New Zealand published its Smokefree 2025 Action Plan, considering the implementation of drastic measures, such as a ban on tobacco sales to those born after a certain date and very low nicotine cigarettes.\n\nFinally, the FCTC COP10 and the EU Tobacco Product Directive 2, post-implementation review which is currently ongoing, are likely to result in calls for further regulation for tobacco products.",

Some regulators have applied or are considering applying combustible tobacco products' restrictive regulatory framework to New Categories. Some jurisdictions have banned or are considering banning certain New Category products altogether.\n\nFollowing reports of individuals experiencing acute respiratory injury in suspected association with vaping certain e-liquids (EVALI) and reports regarding vaping youth usage in the U.S., stricter regulatory views gained momentum and were publicly supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) which continues to call on countries to ban or regulate novel nicotine products as tobacco. The U.S., the EU and Canada are playing a leading role across all identified regulatory risks, including: bans on flavours, sales channel bans, advertising restrictions and nicotine limits, among others.\n\nThe U.S. is expected to issue additional decisions on the marketing authorisation of BAT and competitor vapour products in the near-term, which could result in further restrictions on our ability to offer flavoured vapour products, including menthol.\n\nThe FDA granted marketing authorisation for the Vuse Solo device and its tobacco ('original') flavour in October 2021, but denied authorisation for Vuse Solo flavours other than menthol (which were not on the market). That denial is being appealed with the FDA. The FDA has not issued a decision on the authorisation of the Vuse Solo menthol flavour, which remains on the market pending FDA decision. There can be no assurance that the Vuse Solo menthol authorisation will be granted, or that the other flavours appeal will succeed. Additionally, the continued marketing authorisation of Vuse Solo original flavour is contingent on continued compliance with regulatory requirements ; the marketing authorisation may be suspended or withdrawn if the FDA determines that the continued marketing of the product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health. The FDA has not issued marketing authorisations for Vuse Alto and its associated flavours, including menthol, with FDA decisions still pending. Although the Vuse Alto menthol and tobacco flavoured products remain on the market pending FDA decisions there can be no assurance that these authorisations (or the other Vuse Alto flavours) will be granted. Similarly, the Group's Velo products remain on the market in the U.S., again pending FDA decisions on their marketing authorisations, and there can be no assurance these will be granted. If the FDA denies a marketing authorisation then the relevant product(s) would need to be withdrawn from the market (unless a court or the FDA intervenes).\n\nWith respect to Modern Oral and other New Categories, regulatory frameworks currently follow divergent approaches. In certain markets, where there is an absence of adequate regulation, actions of irresponsible competitors may cause reputational harm to the category and result in outright bans or adverse regulation, as has been the case with Modern Oral in Russia with allegations regarding youth usage. In markets where there is a likelihood of tobacco, pharmaceutical or food regulatory classification, the category can be at risk of severe regulation or total ban.\n\nThe Group believes that Tobacco Heated Products are likely to be regulated as traditional tobacco products, driven by the decision of WHO's 7th Conference of Parties to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and Reports from the WHO submitted to the COP9 for Noting, to apply tobacco control regulations to these products including recommendations for plain packaging and flavour bans.\n\n## Beyond Nicotine\n\nAs the Group also looks to Beyond Nicotine products including CBD (in connection with its investment in Organigram), it may be subject to additional regulation and these products might not be scalable on a global basis given varying degrees of regulation.\n\nPlease refer to pages 340 to 344 for details of tobacco and nicotine regulatory regimes under which the Group's businesses operate.",

In addition, new (and changes to existing) regulation could lead to greater complexity, as well as higher production and compliance costs.\n\nAs an example, through the acquisition of Reynolds American Inc., the Group acquired the Newport brand, the leading menthol cigarette brand in the U.S., the Group's largest single market. The sales of Newport, together with the other menthol brands of the Group's operating subsidiaries, represent a significant portion of the Group's total net sales. Any action by the FDA or any other governmental authority banning or materially restricting the use of menthol in tobacco products could have a significant negative impact on sales volumes which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on the results of operations and financial position of the Group.\n\nRegulations can also have an adverse impact on the Group's ability to compete within the legitimate tobacco, nicotine or New Categories industry and with illicit traders or legal operators exploiting legal and regulatory loop holes. Regulations could also lead to reduced consumer acceptability of new product specifications, leading to consumers seeking alternatives in illicit markets.\n\nUnclear or inadequate regulations can lead to legal uncertainty, impacting the Group's position in the marketplace.\n\nIn the specific case of New Categories, our corporate harm reduction ambition, including of revenue of \u00a35 billion by 2025 and 50 million New Categories consumers of non-combustible products by 2030 could be at risk if stricter regulatory views are imposed at a global scale, or if appropriate regulation is lacking or there is a lack of acceptance of tobacco harm reduction as a tobacco control policy (preventing a balanced regulatory framework for New Categories). Any action by the FDA or any government authority restricting the use of New Category products could also have an adverse effect on the operation and financial position of the Group and the possible failure of the Group's harm reduction objective and loss of confidence in the Group's ESG performance.\n\nAs a reflection of the real or perceived impact of stricter regulation in our business, the Group's share price has also experienced, and could in the future experience, shocks upon the announcement, rumour of or enactment of restrictive regulation. All these effects may have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial conditions and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\nIn addition, considering the significant number of regulations that may apply to the Group's businesses across the world, the Group is and may in the future be subject to claims for breach of such regulations. Government authorities (such as the FDA), organisations or even individuals may allege that our marketing activities do not comply with the relevant law s and regulations, or with our International Marketing Principles. As such, the Group could be subject to liability and costs associated with civil and criminal actions as well as regulatory sanctions, fines and penalties brought in connection with these allegations. Even when proven untrue, there are often financial costs and reputational impacts in defending against such claims and allegations (including potential adverse impact on the treatment by the FDA of the Group 's PMTAs in the U.S.). Each of these results may in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.",

The Cellulose Acetate in our filters is defined as a single-use plastic under the Directive and, as such, the Directive will have an impact on the Group's cigarettes, filters for other tobacco products and consumables for THPs.\n\nUnder the Directive, the Group will be subject to (and in some cases already is subject to) Extended Producer Responsibility ('EPR') schemes, requiring the Group to cover the costs of collecting, transporting, treating and cleaning-up of filters containing plastic. The Directive also imposes on tobacco manufacturers the obligation to finance consumer awareness campaigns and to place environmental markings on packs of products with filters containing plastic.\n\nPrior to the anticipated implementation deadline for EPR schemes on 5 January 2023, the European Commission is expected to issue guidelines on the criteria for the costs of cleaning up litter in the first half of 2022. In addition, in December 2020 the European Commission adopted and published an Implementing Act harmonising specifications for required product markings with a compliance deadline of July 2021. When transposing the Directive into national law, EU member states could decide to expand the scope of EPR systems under their respective national laws, which may expose the Group to additional regulations and financial obligations. This is the case in France, where EPR implementation has already occurred with an expansion of the scope to include non-plastic filters for RYO products. Although Sweden's government has abandoned plans to extend its national EPR system to Snus and modern oral pouches, other markets are still at risk of extension, such as in Spain (tobacco manufacturers would be mandated to financially contribute to the cost of cleaning of parts of the general sewage system), the Czech Republic (tobacco manufacturers would be mandated to contribute to the cost of managing household waste costs), and Poland and Romania (manufacturers' financial contribution would also cover paper filters, although they are not plastic items). Proposed regulations are still being discussed in these countries.\n\nIt is noted that there is a growing level of scrutiny on the use of single-use plastic across the world and a number of other markets in which the Group operates are considering ways to restrict (or ban) the use of filters made of plastic and/or introduce EPR schemes covering other plastic elements in our products beyond filters for traditional products and/or New Categories products.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe financial implications of existing and future EPR schemes will increase administrative burdens and operating costs and may have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans. If significant space is appropriated on the packaging of some of the Group's products, this may also be an impediment to maintaining or building brand equity of the Group's products which may, in turn, have a negative impact on the Group's sales volume.\n\n## Risk: Exposure to litigation on tobacco, nicotine, New Categories and other issues.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group is involved in litigation related to its tobacco and nicotine products, including legal, regulatory and patent actions, proceedings and claims, brought against it in a number of jurisdictions. Claims brought against the Group may be based on personal injury (both individual claims and class actions), economic loss arising from the treatment of smoking and health-related diseases (such as medical recoupment claims brought by local governments), patent infringement (please refer to the risk factor under 'Product pipeline, commercialisation and Intellectual Property risks, Exposure to risks associated with intellectual property rights, including the failure to identify, protect and prevent infringement of the Group's intellectual property rights and potential infringement of, or the failure to retain licences to use, third-party intellectual property rights' below), negligence, strict tort liability, design defect, failure to warn, fraud, misrepresentation, deceptive/unfair trade practices, conspiracy, medical monitoring and violations of antitrust/racketeering laws.\n\nCertain actions, such as those in the U.S. and Canada, involve claims in the tens or hundreds of billions of pounds sterling. The Group is also involved in proceedings that are not directly related to its tobacco and nicotine products, including proceedings based on environmental pollution claims.\n\nAdditional legal and regulatory actions, proceedings and claims may be brought against the Group in the future.",

The Group could be exposed to substantial liability, which may take the form of ongoing payments. Whether successful or not, the costs of the Group's involvement in litigation could materially increase due to costs associated with bringing proceedings and defending claims, which may also cause operational and strategic disruption by diverting management time away from business matters. Liabilities and costs in connection with litigation could result in bankruptcy of one or more Group entities, which, in turn, could cause a material reduction in the Group's sales volume and profits. Any negative publicity resulting from these claims may also adversely affect the Group's reputation.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above effects could in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\nPlease refer to note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts for details of contingent liabilities applicable to the Group.\n\n## Risk: Significant and/or unexpected increases or structural changes in tobacco and nicotine-related taxes.\n\n## Description\n\nTobacco and nicotine products are subject to high levels of taxation, including excise taxes, sales taxes, import duties and levies in most markets in which the Group operates. In many of these markets, taxes are generally increasing, but the rate of increase varies between markets and between different types of tobacco and nicotine products. Increases in, or the introduction of new, tobacco and nicotinerelated taxes may be caused by a number of factors, including fiscal pressures, health policy objectives and increased lobbying pressure from anti-tobacco advocates.\n\nWith respect to New Categories, although a common framework for regulation and taxation has yet to emerge, the manufacture, sale, packaging and advertising of such products are increasingly being regulated and taxed.\n\n## Impact\n\nSignificant or unexpected increases in, or the introduction of new, tobacco-related taxes or minimum retail selling prices, changes in relative tax rates for different tobacco and nicotine products or adjustments to excise have in the past resulted, and may in the future result in, the need for the Group to absorb such tax increases due to limits in its ability to increase prices, an alteration in the sales mix in favour of value-for-money brands or products, or growth in illicit trade, each of which could impact pricing, sales volume and profit for the Group's products. Significant or unexpected increases of tobacco-related taxes could also impact BAT's ability to deliver the corporate purpose of harm reduction.\n\n## Risk: Failure to comply with health and safety and environmental laws.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group is subject to a variety of laws, regulations and operational standards relating to health and safety and the environment.\n\nThe Group may fail to assess certain risks and implement the right level of control measures or to maintain adequate standards of health and safety or environmental compliance, which could cause injury, ill health , disability or loss of life to employees, contractors or members of the public, or harm to the natural environment and local communities in which the Group operates. As a result of the outcomes of the recent COP26, further future regulation is anticipated as governments look to meet their climate change ambitions.\n\nInsufficient information, instruction and training in the relevant areas and a lack of knowledge of the existence and/or requirements of relevant regulations, or a failure to monitor, assess and implement the requirements of new or modified legislation, may increase these risks.\n\n## Impact\n\nAny failure by the Group to comply with applicable health and safety or environmental laws, or the exposure to the consequences of a perceived failure, could result in business disruption, reputational damage, difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff, increased insurance costs, consequential losses, the obligation to install or upgrade costly pollution control equipment, loss of value of the Group's assets, remedial costs and damages, fines and penalties as well as civil or criminal liability.

The Group's interpretation and application of the tax laws could differ from those of the relevant tax authority, which may subject the Group to claims for breach of such laws, including for late or incorrect filings or for misinterpretation of rules. Tax authorities in a variety of jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands and Russia, have assessed, and may in the future assess, the Group for historical tax claims, including interest and penalties, arising from disputed areas of tax law. The Group is currently party to tax disputes in a number of jurisdictions, some of which involve claims for amounts in the hundreds of millions of pounds sterling.\n\nPlease refer to note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts for details of contingent liabilities applicable to the Group.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Group's failure to comply with the relevant tax authority's interpretation and application of the tax laws could result in significant financial and legal penalties, including the payment of additional taxes, fines and interest in the event of an unfavourable ruling by a tax authority in a disputed area, as well as the payment of dispute costs. Disruption to the business could occur as a result of management's time being diverted away from business matters. Each of these results could negatively affect the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\n## Risk: Unexpected legislative changes to corporate income tax laws.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group is subject to corporate income tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates.

The Group has had antitrust infringement decisions against it in the past and is subject to ongoing investigations (please refer to note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts for details of contingent liabilities applicable to the Group). The Group may fail to comply with competition or antitrust laws and may be subject to investigation and/or litigation for alleged abuse of its position in markets in which it has significant market share or for alleged collusion/anti-competitive arrangements with other market participants. Competition / antitrust laws continue to evolve globally with increasingly aggressive enforcement.\n\n## Impact\n\nFailure by the Group to comply with competition or antitrust laws and investigations (and/or litigation) for violation of such laws may result in significant legal liability, fines, penalties and/or damages actions; criminal sanctions against the Group, its officers and employees; increased costs, prohibitions on conduct of the Group's business; forced changes in business practices, forced divestment of brands and businesses (or parts of businesses) to competitors or other buyers; director disqualifications; commercial agreements being held void; and operational and strategic disruption (including by diverting management time away from business matters). The Group may face increased public scrutiny and the investigation or imposition of sanctions by antitrust regulation agencies and/or courts for violations of competition regimes which may subject the Group to reputational damage and loss of goodwill, including negative perceptions of the Group's governance and our ESG credentials.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above effects could in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.",

These include U.S. securities, corporate governance and compliance laws and regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which applies to the Group's worldwide activities. While the Group continuously seeks to improve its systems of internal controls and to remedy any weaknesses identified, there can be no assurance that the policies and procedures will be followed at all times or effectively detect and prevent violations of applicable laws. In addition, the Group is subject to increasingly stringent reporting obligations under UK corporate reporting regulations.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe increased scope and complexity of applicable regulations to which the Group is subject may lead to higher costs for compliance. Failure to comply with laws and regulations may result in significant legal liability, fines, penalties, and/or damages actions, criminal sanctions against the Group, its officers and employees, and damage to the Group's reputation. Non-compliance with such regulations could also lead to a loss of the Group's listing on one or more stock exchanges or a loss of investor confidence with a subsequent reduction in share price.\n\n## Risk: Loss of confidential information, including through manipulation of data by employees and system failure.\n\n## Description\n\nUnintended or inappropriate behaviour by employees, contractors, service providers and others using or managing the Group's confidential information especially given the increased use of third parties (including sensitive or confidential information of third parties) or personal data (including sensitive consumer personal data) may affect the Group's communications and operations which may result in the unauthorised disclosure of such information. Increased remote working has and may increase this risk.\n\nIn addition, flaws in our IT systems and/or those of our suppliers, a lack of infrastructure or application resilience, slow or insufficient disaster recovery service levels or the installation of new systems may increase the possibility that data, including confidential, personal or other sensitive information, stored or communicated by IT systems may be corrupted, lost or disclosed. There may be malicious 'bad actor' activity (e.g. cyber attack) or 'insider threat' (e.g. activists or disgruntled employees).\n\n## Impact\n\nThe loss of confidential information may result in civil or criminal legal liability and prosecution by enforcement bodies and/or claims from third parties, which may subject the Group to the imposition of material fines, damages and/or penalties and the costs associated with defending these claims. It could also lead to a competitive disadvantage through the loss of trade secrets.

This includes uncertainty over product classifications and restrictions on advertising. In particular with respect to the developing category of New Categories, which has grown in size and complexity in a relatively short period of time, a consensus framework for the interpretation and application of existing regulation, such as the rules concerning nicotinecontaining liquids used in vapour products, has yet to emerge.\n\nThe continuously changing and evolving landscape of regulation concerning the Group's products contributes to the uncertainty surrounding interpretation and application and creates a risk that the Group may misinterpret or fail to comply with developing regulations in the various jurisdictions in which it operates, or becomes subject to enforcement actions from regulators. With the continuous changing of product cycle plans and expansion to new markets and innovations, there is a risk that such changes and launches fail to comply with the relevant regulations, including pre-approval and/or pre-registration requirements. For example, some governments have intentionally banned or are seeking to ban novel tobacco products and products containing nicotine, while others would need to amend their existing legislation to permit their sale. Even in countries where the sale of such products is currently permitted, some governments have adopted, or are seeking to adopt, bans on New Categories or restrictions on certain flavours.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe significant number of emerging regulations and the uncertainty surrounding their interpretation and application may subject the Group to claims for breach of such regulations. Financial costs of such enforcement actions include financial penalties, product recalls and litigation costs, and entail a significant risk of adverse publicity and damage to the Group's reputation and goodwill.\n\n## Risk: Failure to uphold high standards of corporate behaviour, including through unintended or malicious breach of anti-bribery and anti-corruption and other anti-financial crime laws.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group is subject to various anti-corruption laws and regulations and other anti-financial crime laws including but not limited to failure to prevent facilitation of tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing (Anti-Corruption Laws). All employees of BAT, its subsidiaries and joint ventures which it controls are expected to uphold a high standard of corporate behaviour and comply with the Group Standards of Business Conduct (SoBC) which includes a requirement to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws. Employees, associates, suppliers, distributors and agents are prohibited from engaging in improper conduct to obtain or retain business or to improperly influence (directly or indirectly) a person working in an official capacity to decide in the Group's favour. The Group's employees, contractors and service providers may fail to comply with our SoBC and/or may violate applicable Anti-Corruption Laws.\n\nFrom time-to-time, the Group investigates, and becomes aware of governmental authorities' investigations into, allegations of misconduct against Group companies. The Group cooperates with the authorities' investigations, where appropriate, including with the DOJ and OFAC in the United States, which are conducting an investigation into suspicions of breach of sanctions. Potential fines, penalties or other consequences cannot currently be assessed. As the investigations are ongoing, it is not possible to identify the timescale in which these matters might be resolved.\n\nPlease refer to note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts for details of contingent liabilities applicable to the Group.\n\n## Impact\n\nFailure of the Group to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or to deploy and maintain robust internal policies, procedures and controls could result in significant fines and penalties (reducing the Group's ability to reinvest in the future), a share price impact, criminal and/ or civil sanctions against the Group and its officers and employees, increased costs, prohibitions or other limitations or requirements (e.g. compliance requirements) on the conduct of the Group's business and reputational harm (including negative perceptions of the Group's governance and our ESG credentials), it may subject the Group to claims for breach of such regulations and it could in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\nEven when proven untrue, there are often financial costs, time demands and reputational impacts associated with investigating and defending against such claims.",

There may be unintended or malicious breaches of sanctions due to inappropriate or negligent behaviour by BAT employees, contractors, customers, suppliers or service providers.\n\nIn particular, the Group has operations in a number of territories that are subject to various sanctions, including Cuba and Belarus. Operations in these territories expose the Group to the risk of significant financial costs and disruption in operations that may be difficult or impossible to predict or avoid or the activities could become commercially and/or operationally unviable. Sanctions can be imposed quickly (as happened recently in Belarus) with the possibility of further territories the Group operates in becoming subject to sanctions at short notice.\n\nNational, international and supra-national sanctions regimes may also affect third parties with which the Group has commercial relationships (including possible risk aversion to being associated with a sanctioned territory) and could lead to supply and payment chain disruptions.\n\nFrom time-to-time, the Group investigates, and becomes aware of governmental authorities' investigations into, allegations of misconduct against Group companies. The Group cooperates with the authorities' investigations, where appropriate, including with the DOJ and OFAC in the United States, which are conducting an investigation into suspicions of breach of sanctions.

The Group may also experience difficulty in sourcing materials or importing products, repatriating currency from a sanctioned country and finding financial institutions willing to transact with it, any of which may expose the Group to increased costs. In addition, the costs of complying with sanctions may increase as a result of new, or changes to existing, sanctions regimes.\n\nAny failure to comply with sanctions regimes or similar international, regional, or national or supra-national measures may result in significant legal liability, fines (reducing the Group's ability to reinvest in the future) and/or penalties, criminal and/or civil sanctions against the Group, its officers and employees, damage to commercial or banking relationships and reputational harm. Reputational harm (including negative perceptions of the Group's governance and our ESG credentials) may result regardless of whether the Group complies with imposed sanctions.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above effects could in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.",

Breaches of data privacy laws include misuse of information which may not be confidential in nature. These include, for example, unsolicited marketing calls to a publicly available number, or using an individual's personal data in a way which was not authorised or in a way that the individual did not reasonably expect through technologies such as online tracking or monitoring.\n\nVarious privacy laws, including the European General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR'), UK Data Protection Act 2018 ('UKDPA') and e-Privacy Directive ('e-Privacy Laws') / EU Regulatory guidances, govern the way in which organisations (comprising employees, contractors, service providers and other authorised persons) handle individuals' personal data including how such organisations, including the Group, track or monitor their online behaviour.\n\nUnintended or malicious breaches of data privacy laws may occur through inappropriate or negligent behaviour by BAT employees, contractors, service providers or others. In particular:\n\n- - in the event of:\n- - an unauthorised disclosure of personal data as a result of a bad actor (e.g. cyber attack); or\n- - flaws in our IT systems, or application resilience, slow or insufficient disaster recovery service levels or the installation failure of a new system (which result in personal data stored or communicated by IT systems being corrupted, lost or disclosed).\n- - Depending on the risk to the individuals concerned, such personal data breaches (including mass personal data unavailability) must be reported to the local data protection supervisory authority which could subject Group companies to not only regulatory scrutiny but also individual claims or even class action suits; and\n- - ePrivacy Laws state that any misuse of consumer personal data or lack of transparency provided to consumers on how we use their data or track their online behaviours are subject to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nLegal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. Following the entry into force of the GDPR in May 2018, other jurisdictions in which the Group operates have enacted similar local legislation such as the California Consumer Privacy Act U.S. and the 'LGPD' in Brazil which further increases the risks surrounding the processing of personal data especially in the consumer space. As part of the Group's digital transformation initiative, it has an enhanced focus on consumer data, especially regarding New Categories, which increases these risks.\n\n## Impact\n\nFailure to comply with existing or future e-Privacy Laws and privacy legislation governing the processing of personal data may adversely impact the Group's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nLoss or misuse of personal data may result in civil or criminal legal liability and prosecution by enforcement bodies, which may subject the Group to the imposition of material fines (currently up to 4% of Group worldwide turnover in the context of GDPR) and/or penalties and/ or claims and costs associated with defending these claims (which could include class action suits brought by consumers). The Group's officers and employees may also be subject to personal criminal sanctions.\n\nReputational damage could also potentially cause significant harm to the Group, including negative perceptions of the Group's governance and our ESG credentials.\n\nRelevant data protection supervisory authority could also order certain Group legal entities to cease processing activities, which could result in a significant operational disruption. Regulatory interest may also prompt interest from other compliance authorities/ governments, leading to further regulation or proceedings.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above effects could in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\n## Risk: Failure to uphold New Categories marketing practices.\n\n## Description\n\nThe regulatory landscape is constantly evolving with marketing practices being different in key New Categories markets. The Group's marketing activities may be alleged to be non-compliant with laws and regulations, or with the International Marketing Principles ('IMPs') on the marketing and sale of tobacco products to consumers such as age verification measures with allegations of this in the media. Online activities can also be wrongly considered to be aimed at consumers in a country where such activities are not permitted.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe Group is and may in the future be subject to claims for breach of marketing practices. In particular, national authorities (such as the FDA), organisations or even individuals may allege that our marketing activities do not comply with the relevant laws and regulations, or with our IMPs. As such, the Group could be subject to liability and costs as well as regulatory sanctions, fines and penalties brought in connection with these allegations. Even when proven untrue, there are often financial costs and reputational impacts in defending against such claims and allegations.\n\nFuture breaches may lead to a loss of investor confidence in ESG performance and inability to meet our responsible marketing focus area if our IMPs are not followed, impacting our corporate purpose of delivering harm reduction.",

        "page_content": "## Economic and Financial Risks\n\n## Risk: Foreign exchange rate exposures.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group's reporting currency is the pound sterling. The Group is exposed to the risk of fluctuations in exchange rates affecting the translation of net assets and earned profits of overseas subsidiaries into the Group's reporting currency. These translational exposures are not normally hedged.\n\nExposures also arise from the foreign currency denominated trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries and dividend flows. Where not offset by opposing flows, these exposures are generally hedged according to internal policies, but hedging of exposure to certain currencies might not be possible due to exchange controls, limited currency availability or prohibitive costs, and errors in hedging may occur. Fiscal policy divergence in relation to interest rates between key markets may also increase these risks.\n\n## Impact\n\nDuring periods of exchange rate volatility, the impact of exchange rates on the Group's results of operations and financial condition can be significant. Fluctuations in exchange rates of key currencies against the pound sterling may result in volatility in the Group's reported earnings per share, cash flow and balance sheet. Furthermore, the dividend paid by the Group may be impacted if the payout ratio is not adjusted. Differences in translation between earnings and net debt may also affect key ratios used by credit rating agencies, which may have an adverse effect on the Group's credit ratings.\n\nIn addition, volatility and/or increased costs in the Group's business due to transactional foreign exchange rate exposures may adversely affect operating margins and profitability and attempts to increase prices to offset such increases could adversely impact sales volumes.\n\n## Risk: Inability to obtain price increases and exposure to risks from excessive price increases and value chain erosion.\n\n## Description\n\nAnnual price increases by the Group are among the key drivers in increasing market profitability. However, the Group has in the past been, and may in the future be, unable to obtain such price increases as a result of increased regulation; increased competition from illicit trade; stretched consumer affordability arising from deteriorating political and economic conditions and rising prices; sharp increases or changes in excise structures; and competitors' pricing.\n\nAs the New Category market continues to develop, the Group may face erosion in the value chain for New Categories through lower market prices, excise taxes, high retail trade margins or high production costs that make New Categories less competitive versus combustible tobacco products. As an example, excise on Tobacco Heated Products in Japan is increasing and will align closer to FMC following a five year (2018-2022) phased excise plan.\n\nIn addition, the Group faces the risk that price increases it has conducted in the past, and may conduct in the future, may be excessive and not find adequate adult tobacco consumer acceptance.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf the Group is unable to obtain price increases or is adversely affected by impacts of excessive price increases, it may be unable to achieve its strategic growth metrics, have fewer funds to invest in growth opportunities, and, in the case of excessive price increases, be faced with quicker reductions in sales volumes than anticipated due to accelerated market decline, down-trading (switching to a cheaper brand) and increased illicit trade. These in turn impact the Group's market share, results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\nIn addition, erosion in the value chain for New Categories could have a negative impact on the Group's sales volume or pricing for these products. High excise could dampen demand for New Categories or result in lower profit margins. Lower market prices, high retail trade margins or increases in production costs could also negatively impact profit margins or lead to uncompetitive pricing.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Group Risk Factors\n\n## Continued\n\n## Economic and Financial Risks Continued\n\n## Risk: Effects of declining consumption of legitimate tobacco products and a tough competitive environment.\n\n## Description\n\nEvidence of market contraction and the growth of illicit trade of tobacco products is apparent in several key global markets in which the Group operates. This decline is due to multiple factors, including increases in excise taxes leading to continuous above-inflation price rises, changes in the regulatory environment, the continuing difficult economic environment in many countries impacting consumers' disposable incomes, the increase in the trade of illicit tobacco products, rising health concerns, a decline in the social acceptability of smoking and an increase in New Category uptake.\n\nThe Group competes based on the strength of its strategic brand portfolio, product quality and taste, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, innovation, packaging, service, marketing, advertising and price. The Group is subject to highly competitive environments in all aspects of its business, and its competitive position can be significantly influenced by the prevailing economic climate, consumers' disposable income, regulation, competitors' introduction of lower-price or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher absolute prices, governmental action to increase minimum wages, employment costs, interest rates and increase in raw material costs.\n\nFurthermore, the Group is subject to substantial payment obligations under the State Settlement Agreements, which adversely affect the ability of the Group to compete in the U.S. with manufacturers of deep-discount cigarettes that are not subject to such substantial obligations.\n\n## Impact\n\nAny future decline in the demand for legitimate tobacco products could have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial conditions and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\nIn a tough competitive environment, factors such as market size reduction, customer down-trading, illicit trade and competitors aggressively taking market share through price re-positioning or price wars generally reduce the overall profit pool of the market and may impact delivery of the Group's profits. This may also lead to a decline in sales volume, loss of market share, impact delivery of the Group's ESG agenda, erosion of its portfolio mix and reduction of funds available for investment in growth opportunities.\n\n## Risk: Funding, liquidity and interest rate risks.\n\n## Description\n\nThe Group cannot be certain that it will have access to bank financing or to the debt and equity capital markets at all times and is therefore subject to funding and liquidity risks. In addition, the Group's access to funding may be affected by restrictive covenants to which it is subject under some of its credit facilities. Furthermore, broader ESG trends may impact the Group's access to funding.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to increases in interest rates in connection with both existing floating rate debt and future debt refinancings. The current economic environment, with historically low interest rates, increases the likelihood of higher interest rates in the future. The phaseout of LIBOR and uncertainty regarding the appropriate benchmark replacement similarly increases uncertainty with respect to the interest rates applicable to the Group's floating rate debt.\n\nFurthermore, the Group operates in several markets closely regulated by governmental bodies that intervene in foreign exchange markets by imposing limitations on the ability to transfer local currency into foreign currency and introducing other currency controls that expose cash balances to devaluation risks or that increase costs to obtain hard currency. As a result, the Group's operational entities in these markets may be restricted from using end-market cash resources to pay for imported goods, dividend remittances, interest payments and royalties. The inability to access end-market cash resources in certain markets contributes to the Group's funding and liquidity risks.\n\n## Impact\n\nAdverse developments in the Group's funding, liquidity and interest rate environment may lead to shortages of cash and cash equivalents needed to operate the Group's business and to refinance its existing debt. Inability to fund the business under the Group's current capital structure, failure to access funding and foreign exchange or increases in interest rates may also have an adverse effect on the Group's credit rating, which would in turn result in further increased funding costs and may require the Group to issue equity or seek new sources of capital. Non-compliance with the Group's covenants under certain credit facilities could lead to an acceleration of its debt. The phaseout of LIBOR may result in the Group being subject to higher or uncertain interest rates with respect to future floating rate debt.\n\nAll these factors may have material adverse effects on the Group's results of operations and financial conditions and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans. These conditions could also lead to underperforming bond prices and increased yields.\n\nIn the case of funding or liquidity constraints, the Group may also suffer reputational damage due to its perceived failure to manage the financial risk profile of its business, which may result in an erosion of shareholder value reflected in an underperforming share price, and/ or underperforming bond prices and higher yields. In addition, the Group's ability to finance strategic opportunities or respond to threats may be impacted by limited access to funds.",

The Group may not be able to deliver strategic objectives and revenue improvements from business combinations, successfully integrate businesses it acquires or establishes, or obtain appropriate regulatory approvals for business combinations. Risks from integration of businesses also include the risk that the integration may divert the Group's focus and resources from its other strategic goals.\n\nAdditionally, the Group could be exposed to financial, legal or reputational risks if it fails to appropriately consider any compliance, antitrust or ESG aspects of a transaction. Further, the Group has certain uncapped indemnification obligations in connection with divestitures and could incur similar obligations in the future.\n\n## Impact\n\nAny of the foregoing risks could result in increased costs, decreased revenues or a loss of opportunities and have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition, and in the case of a breach of compliance or antitrust regulation, could lead to reputational damage, fines and potentially criminal sanctions.\n\nThe Group may become liable for claims arising in respect of conduct prior to any merger or acquisition of businesses if deemed to be a successor to the liabilities of the acquired company or indemnification claims relating to divestitures, and any resulting adverse judgment against the Group may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\nPlease refer to note 31 in the Notes on the Accounts for details of contingent liabilities applicable to the Group.\n\n## Risk: Unforeseen underperformance in key global markets.\n\n## Description\n\nA substantial majority of the Group's profit from operations is based on its operations in certain key markets, including the US.

In a competitive market, the Group believes that innovation is key to growth. The Group considers that one of its key challenges in the medium and long term is to provide adult tobacco and nicotine consumers with high-quality products that take into account their changing preferences and expectations, including those in relation to ESG, while complying with evolving regulation.\n\nThe Group continues to develop and roll-out its New Category portfolio which requires significant investment. The Group may be unsuccessful in developing and launching innovative products or maintaining and improving the quality of existing products across Combustibles, New Categories and Beyond Nicotine that offer consumers meaningful value-added differentiation. The Group may fail to keep pace with innovation in its sector or changes in consumer expectations and is also exposed to the risk of an inability to build a strong enough brand equity through social media and other technological tools to compete with its competitors. There are potential bans and restrictions in key markets when using social media to advertise and communicate. Competitors may be more successful in predicting changing consumer behaviour, developing and rolling out consumer-relevant products and may be able to do so more quickly and at a lower cost.\n\nIn addition, the Group devotes considerable resources to the research and development of innovative products that may have the potential to reduce the risks of smoking-related diseases. The complex nature of research and development programmes necessary to satisfy emerging regulatory and scientific requirements creates a substantial risk that these programmes will fail to demonstrate health-related claims regarding New Categories and Beyond Nicotine or to achieve adult tobacco consumer, regulatory and scientific acceptance.\n\nFurthermore, the regulatory environment impacting non-combustible tobacco products, vapour products and other non-tobacco nicotine products and Beyond Nicotine, including classification of products for regulatory and excise purposes, is still developing and it cannot be predicted whether regulations will permit the marketing of such products in any given market in the future. Categorisation as medicines, for example, and restrictions on advertising could stifle innovation, increase complexity and costs and significantly undermine the commercial viability of these products.\n\nAlternatively, categorisation of any New Categories, as tobacco products for instance, could result in the application of onerous regulation, which could further stifle uptake.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe inability to timely develop and roll out innovations or products in line with consumer demand, including any failure to predict changes in adult tobacco consumer and societal behaviour and expectations and to fill gaps in the product portfolio, as well as the risk of poor product quality, could lead to missed opportunities, under- or over-supply, loss of competitive advantage, unrecoverable costs and/or the erosion of the Group's consumer base or brand equity.\n\nRestrictions on packaging and labelling or on promotion and advertising could impact the Group's ability to communicate its innovations and product differences to adult tobacco consumers, leading to unsuccessful product launches. An inability to provide robust scientific results sufficient to substantiate health-related product claims poses a significant threat to the ability to launch innovative products and comply with emerging regulatory and legal regimes.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above effects could in turn have an adverse effect on the Group's results of operations and financial condition and cause the Group to fail to deliver on its strategic growth plans.\n\nIn addition, there may be loss of investors' confidence in ESG performance, including failure to deliver our corporate purpose of harm reduction.",

The brand names under which the Group's products are sold are key assets of its business. The protection and maintenance of these brand names and of the reputation of these brands is important to the Group's success. Protection of intellectual property rights is also important in connection with the Group's innovative products, including New Categories.\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of infringements of its intellectual property rights by third parties due to limitations in judicial protection, failure to identify, protect and register its innovations and/or inadequate enforceability of these rights in some markets in which the Group operates.\n\nThe Group currently is involved in various patent infringement litigation proceedings in several countries related to the Group's New Category inventions and products. This litigation involves both claims by the Group that competitors are infringing the Group's patents and claims by competitors that the Group is infringing competitors' patents.

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Regulation of the Group's Business\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group's businesses operate under increasingly stringent regulatory regimes worldwide. The tobacco industry is one of the most highly regulated in the world, with manufacturers required to comply with a variety of different regulatory regimes across the globe. The Group continues to respond to these regimes and engages with governments and other regulatory bodies to find solutions to changing regulatory landscapes. Restrictions on the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco and non-tobacco nicotine products are in place in nearly all countries and markets.\n\nRegulation can typically be categorised as follows:\n\nPlace: including regulations restricting smoking in private, public and work places (e.g. public place smoking bans);\n\nProduct : including regulations on the use of ingredients, product design and attributes (e.g. ceilings regarding tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields, as well as restrictions on flavours); product safety regulations (e.g. the EU's General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EC), electrical safety regulations and reduced ignition propensity standards for cigarettes); regulatory product disclosure requirements (e.g. in relation to ingredients and emissions); and bans of entire product categories (e.g. bans on the manufacture, import, export, sale, and advertisement of novel tobacco products or non-tobacco nicotine products);\n\nPackaging and labelling: including regulations on health warnings and other government-mandated messages (e.g. in respect of content, positioning, size and rotation); restrictions on the use of certain descriptors and brand names; requirements on pack shape, size, weight and colour and mandatory plain packaging;\n\nSponsorship, promotion and advertising: including partial or total bans on tobacco and/or non-tobacco nicotine product advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorship and restrictions on brand sharing and stretching (the latter refers to the creation of an association between a tobacco product and a non-tobacco product by the use of tobacco branding on the non-tobacco product);\n\nPurchase: including regulations on the manner in which tobacco products and non-tobacco nicotine products are sold, such as type of outlet (e.g. supermarkets and vending machines) and how they are sold (e.g. above-the-counter versus beneath-the-counter);\n\nPrice: including regulations which have implications for the prices that manufacturers can charge for their tobacco products and non-tobacco nicotine products (e.g. excise taxes and minimum prices); and\n\nResponsibility: including regulations introducing Extended Producer Responsibility schemes on cigarette manufacturers to cover the cost to clean up cigarette waste (see Single Use Plastics Directive (EU) 2019/904).\n\nIn addition, the Group operates a number of global policies, and in some cases its businesses have also entered into voluntary agreements, which may impose more onerous obligations or standards than those imposed by local legislation.\n\n## World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control\n\nMuch of the recent development in regulation at a global level has been driven by the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The FCTC came into force in 2005 and contains provisions aimed at, among other things, reducing tobacco consumption and toxicity. The original treaty is supplemented by protocols and guidelines. While the guidelines are not legally binding, they provide a framework of recommendations for parties to the guidelines.\n\nTo date, the FCTC has been ratified by 182 countries, not including the U.S. The FCTC has led to increased efforts by tobacco-control advocates and public health organisations to reduce the supply of, and demand for, tobacco products, and to encourage governments to further regulate the tobacco industry. As national regulations increasingly reflect global influences, the scope of areas regulated will likely further expand. The guidelines on advertising, promotion and sponsorship, for example, seek to broaden the definition of tobacco advertising to include product display, the use of vending machines as well as the design of the pack itself. Where adopted by contracting parties, a number of the measures referred to in the guidelines may result in either additional costs for the tobacco industry or restrictions on a manufacturer's ability to differentiate its products and communicate those differences to adult smokers. The World Health Organization and other public health organisations have recently focused their efforts on attempting to widen the scope of the FCTC to include Reduced Risk Products (RRPs), mostly indirectly by adopting decisions and working groups concerning these products. Given that these organisations are reluctant to acknowledge the harm reduction properties of RRPs, this approach risks to result in a further push for stricter regulations of RRPs or the application of existing tobacco regulations to RRPs. All engagement efforts of the tobacco industry are being closely monitored by these organisations and often (incorrectly) labelled as unlawful industry interference. In turn, this has an impact on the willingness of Parties to engage with the industry, which limits the opportunity of the industry to mitigate these risks.\n\nThe biannual session of the Conference of the Parties to the FCTC took place in November 2021 (COP9). Due to the virtual nature of the meetings most substantive discussions have however been postponed to COP10, which will take place in 2023 in Panama.\n\n## EU Tobacco and Related Products Directive (2014/40/EU)\n\nOther developments in regulation have been driven by tobacco control activities undertaken outside the FCTC process. For example, the EU Tobacco Products Directive (2001/37/EC), referred to as TPD1, was adopted by the EU in May 2001 for transposition into EU member states' laws by September 2002. TPD1 included provisions that set maximum tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields, introduced larger health warnings and banned descriptors such as 'light' and 'mild'.\n\nA revised TPD1, the EU Tobacco and Related Products Directive (2014/40/EU), referred to as TPD2, was adopted in April 2014 for transposition into EU member states' law by May 2016. Provisions of TPD2 include: larger combined pictorial and textual health warnings covering 65% of the two main pack surfaces (front and back) for cigarettes; restrictions on pack shape and size, including minimum pack sizes of 20 sticks for cigarettes and 30g for roll-your-own and make-your-own tobacco; increased ingredients reporting; 'tracking and tracing' requirements; and for e-cigarettes: nicotine limits, pre-market notification, ingredients reporting and advertising bans. Among other things, TPD2 bans the sale of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with a characterising flavour. Menthol-flavoured cigarettes were exempted from the ban until May 2020, which has since been applied also to menthol cigarettes. (See 'The U.S.' for information pertaining to the regulation of menthol in that market).",

        "page_content": "TPD2 also purports to leave open to EU Member States the possibility of further standardising the packaging of tobacco products and to apply some of its provisions in different ways. For example, it provides, among other things, that the labelling, packaging and the tobacco product itself shall not include any element or feature that suggests that a particular tobacco product has vitalising, energetic, healing, rejuvenating, natural or organic properties or has other health or lifestyle benefits. On 26 April 2019, Belgium adopted a Royal Decree that allows the Minister of Health to establish a procedure to put brands on a prohibited list and to draw up such a list. To date, such a procedure has not yet been established by the Belgian Minister of Health. BAT's request for annulment is still pending.\n\nThe European Commission published its Article 28 report on the application of TPD2 on 20 May 2021. The report concluded that TPD2 helped decrease smoking rates and tobacco use but that more efforts are needed, particularly in relation to enforcement at national level and new market developments, such as novel tobacco products. Currently, the preparations of a revised TPD2 are progressing, with estimated adoption in 2025. TPD2 might be replaced with a directly applicable regulation instead of a directive, following which transposition in Member States would no longer be required. It is anticipated that this new regulation will include the following provisions: plain packaging for combustibles; more regulation of ingredients, including menthol ban, for combustibles at EU level; regulation of flavours and nicotinefree liquids for e-cigarettes at EU level; tightening of advertising restrictions for e-cigarettes; stricter regulations for THPs; regulation of modern oral at EU level.\n\n## Single-Use Plastics\n\nThe Single Use Plastics Directive (EU) 2019/904 (the SUP Directive) entered into force on 2 July 2019. The Directive requires that EU Member States introduce Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes covering the cost to clean up litter and the application of on-pack marking requirements for tobacco product filters. Member States must transpose the SUP Directive into national law by 3 July 2021, with an implementation deadline of 3 July 2021 for pack marking requirements and of 5 January 2023 for EPR schemes. France was the only Member State to not await this deadline and already implemented in December 2020 and February 2021 EPR schemes for, among others, cigarette manufacturers. These regulations are currently being challenged before the French Council of State. Other governments have passed or are considering similar legislation including Canada, Russia, South Korea and various levels of government in the U.S.\n\n## Restrictions on Smoking in Private, Public and Workplaces\n\nThe Group operates in a number of markets which have in place restrictions on smoking in certain private, public and work places, including restaurants, bars and nightclubs. While these restrictions vary in scope and severity, extensive public and work place smoking bans have been enacted in markets including the U.S., Canada, the UK, Spain, New Zealand and Australia. Restrictions on smoking in private have also been adopted or proposed, and typically take the form of prohibitions on smoking in cars or residential homes when children are present, or smoking within a certain distance from specified public places (such as primary schools).\n\n## Regulation of Ingredients, Including Flavoured Tobacco Products\n\nA number of countries have restricted, and others are seeking to restrict or ban, the use of certain flavours or ingredients in cigarettes and other tobacco products, on the basis that such products are alleged to appeal disproportionally to minors, act as a catalyst for young people taking up smoking and/or increase the addictiveness or toxicity of the relevant product. To the extent flavours are permitted, this is often restricted to tobacco and/or menthol flavours only.\n\nSuch restrictions have been enacted in markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia, Turkey and Iran. An ingredients ban in Brazil, which would ban the use of certain ingredients with flavouring or aromatic properties, including menthol, is not currently in force due to ongoing legal challenges. TPD2 similarly bans in the EU the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and roll-your-own tobacco with a characterising flavour other than tobacco. A number of the above regulations are subject to ongoing legal challenges (See 'The U.S.' for information pertaining to the regulation of menthol in that market).\n\nCurrently, European regulators are increasingly seeking to restrict, and even ban, the use of flavours or ingredients in vapour products and other RRPs (see 'Reduced Risk Products'). For example, Hungary, Finland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Norway have adopted, or are considering to adopt, bills banning flavours in vapour products. This is partially based on a scientific opinion on e-cigarettes commissioned by the EU (the SCHEER report), which was published on 16 April 2021 and which alleges that flavours have a relevant contribution for attractiveness of use of electronic cigarettes. Legal challenges are expected to be filed against these new regulations, which will be supported by credible and contrary scientific evidence.\n\nFurther legislation on ingredients, both for FMCs and RRPs, is to be expected. The Conference of Parties to the FCTC has tasked a working group to further elaborate the partial guidelines on the regulation of the contents of tobacco products and tobacco product disclosures. The substantive discussions by the Conference of Parties to the FCTC on this report have been postponed to COP10 (see 'World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control'). Furthermore, certain industry players have avoided the menthol characterising flavour ban that came into force in the EU on 20 May 2020 by introducing several low menthol/WS3 products. This has resulted in several regulators in Member States taking action to ban these products from the market. In Belgium, the regulator has on this basis banned all cigarettes and other tobacco products that include components with cooling and/or analgesic effects. This movement is spurred forward by the EU JATC Report on priority additives that was published on 3 December 2020. According to this report, even a small amount of menthol, when added to cigarettes, allegedly facilitates inhalation or nicotine uptake. Many reputable public and private scientific agencies, however, have concluded the opposite.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Regulation of the Group's Business Continued\n\n## Plain and Standardised Packaging\n\nPlain (or 'standardised') packaging generally refers to a ban on the use of trademarks, logos and colours on packaging other than the use of a single colour and the presentation of brand name and variant in a specified font and location(s). The presentation of individual cigarettes may be similarly restricted. Plain packaging is high on the agenda of tobacco control groups, and the non-binding FCTC guidelines recommend that contracting parties consider introducing plain packaging. To date, 22 countries (including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Ireland, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Turkey, and the UK) have adopted plain packaging legislation, with the measure being implemented in 18 of those countries. Countries, territories and states that are currently considering adopting plain packaging legislation include, but are not limited to Argentina, India, Ecuador, Panama, Brazil, Chile, Spain and South Africa. Others, such as South Korea, Ukraine and Colombia, are considering implementing increased graphic health warnings. Also RRPs are increasingly facing plain packaging regulations (see 'Reduced Risk Products'), such as in Denmark where a bill was adopted on 15 December 2020, which introduces plain packaging for vapour products and THPs.\n\n## Product Display Bans at Point of Sale and Licensing Regimes\n\nProduct display bans at point of sale and licensing regimes have become relatively commonplace and have been implemented for several years in a number of countries both at national and state levels, including in Norway, Iceland, Finland, New Zealand, Thailand, Canada, Australia, and the UK. The Danish bill (referenced above) also introduces a product display ban for RRPs. A large number of countries, such as Hungary, Finland and Spain, have also sought to restrict the supply of tobacco products, including through the adoption of licensing regimes limiting the number of retail outlets from which it is possible to purchase tobacco products and/or by prohibiting the sale of tobacco products within a certain distance of specified public places.\n\n## Illicit Trade\n\nThe illegal market for tobacco products is an increasingly important issue for governments and the industry across the world.\n\nEuromonitor International estimates that approximately 400 billion cigarettes per year are smuggled, manufactured illegally or counterfeited. A number of governments, regulators and organisations have or are considering adopting regulation to support anti-illicit trade activities. Among other forms, such regulation may comprise mandatory 'tracking and tracing' requirements, enabling regulators to identify the point at which any seized product left the legal supply chain, security features to combat counterfeiting and inspection and authentication obligations in respect of seized product. The TPD2, for example, requires that all unit packets of tobacco are marked with a unique and irremovable identifier, which when scanned provides various information about that product's route-to-market.\n\nIn November 2012, the FCTC adopted the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products which includes a raft of supply chain control measures, including the implementation of 'tracking and tracing' technologies. The Protocol entered into force on 25 September 2018 and was considered at the first session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol in October 2018. As at 1 January 2021, 62 parties have ratified the Protocol. The second session of the Meeting of the Parties to the Protocol in took place in November 2021.\n\n## Reduced Risk Products ('RRPs')\n\nMore recently, significant debate has been generated regarding the appropriate regulation of vapour products, including regulation of the nicotine liquids used in them. As the nascent vapour category has grown in size and complexity in a relatively short period of time, a consensus framework for regulation and taxation has yet to emerge. The TPD2, for example, establishes frameworks for the regulation of novel tobacco products and e-cigarettes, introducing nicotine limits, health warnings requirements, advertising bans and pre-market notification and post-market disclosure obligations. The Conference of the Parties to the FCTC is also contemplating to redefine the scope of the FCTC to include novel tobacco products and products containing nicotine.\n\nIn countries where the sale of vapour products is permitted, governments are seeking to more strictly regulate these products, including by adopting or seeking to adopt bans on vaping in public places, bans or restrictions on flavours or other restrictions such as plain packaging and retail display and advertising bans. Conversely, some governments have intentionally banned or are seeking to ban novel tobacco products and products containing nicotine, such as Hong Kong , while others would need to amend their existing legislation in order to permit their sale. For example, in Australia nicotine is currently classified as poison, meaning that the importation of vaping products or nicotine refill liquids is illegal in every state and territory, as is the possession and use of these products. While Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration re-classified nicotine as a prescription-only medication as of 1 October 2021, the effect will be that a doctor's prescription will be required to legally access nicotine vapour products and liquid nicotine. Recent reports in North America of individuals experiencing acute respiratory injury in suspected association with vaping certain e-liquids (EVALI) and youth usage have led to an increase in scrutiny of vapour products, especially at State and Provincial levels in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nAlso, other RRPs, such as nicotine pouches and THPs, are facing increasing scrutiny by regulators. In countries such as Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, modern oral products have sought to be classified as food stuff or medicinal products to ban these products from the market. In Germany and Hungary, THPs have faced being classified in the same way as traditional tobacco products, with the potential consequence of facing the same restrictions or excise categories. These might be temporary measures until the countries have amended their existing tobacco legislation to include these products under its scope.\n\n## The U.S.\n\nThrough the RAI subsidiaries, the Group is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (FSPTCA), which was enacted in 2009, grants the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products but at the outset limited the agency's authority to cigarettes, smokeless tobacco products, cigarette tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco products. Key elements of the FSPTCA include: filing of facility registrations, product listing, constituent testing and ingredient information; obtaining FDA clearance for all new products and product modifications; banning all characterising flavours other than tobacco or menthol in cigarettes; establishing 'user fees' to fund the FDA's regulation of tobacco products; increasing the health warning size on cigarette packs with the option to introduce pictorial health warnings; implementing good manufacturing practices; revising the labelling and advertising requirements for smokeless tobacco products; and requiring the study of menthol. The U.S. Congress did limit the FDA's authority in two areas, prohibiting it from:\n\n- - banning categories of tobacco products; and\n- - requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero.",

        "page_content": "On 10 May 2016, the FDA issued a final regulation, referred to as the Deeming Rule, deeming all remaining products that are 'made or derived from tobacco' to be subject to the FDA's regulatory authority under the FSPTCA. The Final Rule became effective as of 8 August 2016, though each requirement of the Final Rule had its own compliance date. Such 'deemed' tobacco products subject to the FSPTCA include, among others, electronic nicotine delivery systems (including e-cigarettes, e-hookah, e-cigars, vape pens, advanced refillable personal vapourisers, electronic pipes and e-liquids mixed in vape shops), certain dissolvable tobacco products, cigars and pipe tobacco.\n\nThe 'grandfathered' date under the Final Rule for newly deemed products remained the same as the 'grandfathered' date for those tobacco products already subject to the FSPTCA - 15 February 2007. Any tobacco product that was not legally marketed as of 15 February 2007 is considered a new tobacco product subject to premarket review by the FDA. The FDA has recognised that few, if any, e-cigarettes were on the market as of 15 February 2007, but thousands of such products (including R. J. Reynolds Vapor Company's Vuse products) subsequently have entered into commerce. To address this issue, the FDA established a compliance policy regarding the premarket review requirements for all newly deemed tobacco products that are not grandfathered products but were on the market as of 8 August 2016. The FDA allowed such products to remain on the market so long as the manufacturer filed the appropriate Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) by a specific deadline.\n\nThe Final Rule established staggered initial compliance periods based on the expected complexity of the applications to be submitted. On 28 July 2017, as part of the FDA's announcement of a comprehensive regulatory plan for nicotine and tobacco, the FDA extended the deadline for submission of PMTAs for newly deemed products by several years (for e-cigarettes, the new deadline was August 2022). However, as a result of legal action, in July 2019 a federal court ultimately brought forward the filing deadline for non-combustible products to 12 May 2020. In October 2019, R. J. Reynolds Vapour Company filed PMTAs for Vuse Solo. Based upon requirements of the FSPTCA that must be addressed in PMTAs, and the FDA's Guidance regarding the type of evidence required for such applications, the costs of preparing a PMTA are significant.\n\nIn January 2020, the FDA reinforced the filing deadline of 12 May 2020 in its Guidance related to vapour but reversed its previous compliance policy that allowed products to remain on the market pending the submission of a PMTA. The Guidance announced the agency's intent to enforce (as of February 2020) the PMTA requirements on certain products as follows: 1) Flavoured, cartridge-based vapour products except for tobacco- or mentholflavoured products; 2) All other vapour products for which the manufacturer has failed to take (or is failing to take) adequate measures to prevent minors' access; 3) Any vapour products that targets or whose marketing is likely to promote use by minors; and 4) Any vapour product that is offered for sale in the U.S. after 12 May 2020, and for which the manufacturer has not submitted a premarket application. Flavoured disposable vapour products and flavoured open systems would remain available for sale unless 1) the manufacturer has failed to take adequate measures to prevent minors' access, 2) product that targets or whose marketing is likely to promote use by minors, or 3) fails to file a PMTA by 12 May 2020.\n\nIn April 2020, the federal court extended the PMTA deadline by 120 days to 9 September 2020 to address the FDA's concerns regarding delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. R. J. Reynolds Vapor Company filed PMTAs for the remaining Vuse products (Vibe, Ciro, and Alto) and the Velo products (pouch and lozenge) by the September 2020 deadline. Certain additional data from ongoing research relevant to the Alto and Velo applications were submitted as amendments to the PMTAs during the FDA review process.\n\nThe FDA granted marketing authorisation for the Vuse Solo device and its tobacco ('original') flavour in October 2021, but denied authorisation for Vuse Solo flavours other than menthol (which were not on the market). That denial is being appealed with the FDA. The FDA has not issued a decision on the authorisation of the Vuse Solo menthol flavour, which remains on the market pending FDA decision. There can be no assurance that the Vuse Solo menthol authorisation will be granted, or that the other flavours appeal will succeed.\n\nAdditionally, the continued marketing authorisation of Vuse Solo original flavour is contingent on continued compliance with regulatory requirements; the marketing authorisation may be suspended or withdrawn if the FDA determines that the continued marketing of the product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health. The FDA has not issued marketing authorisations for Vuse Alto and its associated flavours, including menthol, with FDA decisions still pending. Although the Vuse Alto menthol and tobacco flavoured products remain on the market pending FDA decisions there can be no assurance that these authorisations (or the other Vuse Alto flavours) will be granted. Similarly, the Group's Velo products remain on the market in the U.S., again pending FDA decisions on their marketing authorisations and there can be no assurance these will be granted. If the FDA denies a marketing authorisation then the relevant product(s) would need to be withdrawn from the market (unless a court intervenes).\n\n## Comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation\n\nOn 28 July 2017, the FDA announced its intent to develop a comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation that recognises the continuum of risk for nicotine delivery. As part of that plan, the FDA planned to publish an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to seek public input regarding the potential health benefits and possible adverse effects of lowering the level of nicotine in combustible cigarettes.\n\nThe ANPRM would request comments from interested stakeholders regarding the potential impact of a nicotine product standard on, among other things:\n\n- - the likelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using cigarettes;\n- - the likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using such products; and\n- - the illicit trade of cigarettes containing nicotine at levels higher than a non-addictive nicotine threshold.\n\nIn addition, the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), which was established within the FDA in 2009, will coordinate with the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research regarding medicinal nicotine and other therapeutic products as part of an agency-wide nicotine framework. As part of the comprehensive plan, the FDA also announced its intent to issue ANPRMs requesting public stakeholder input on the impact of flavours (including menthol) in increased initiation among youth and young adults as well as assisting adult smokers to switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery, and the patterns of use and public health impact of premium cigars.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Regulation of the Group's Business Continued\n\nThis follows on from the FDA's decision to issue its own preliminary scientific evaluation regarding menthol cigarettes in 2013, which concluded that menthol cigarettes adversely affect initiation, addiction and cessation compared to non-menthol cigarettes. In 2018, the FDA took several steps to further this plan. Firstly, in January 2018, the FDA held a public hearing to obtain input from a broad group of stakeholders on ways to streamline the regulatory process for the issuance of therapeutic claims for nicotine products. Secondly, in March 2018, the agency issued three ANPRMs, seeking information on (1) the lowering of nicotine levels to non-addictive or minimally addictive levels, (2) the impact of flavours (including menthol) in increased initiation among youth and young adults as well as assisting adult smokers to switch to potentially less harmful forms of nicotine delivery, and (3) the patterns of use and public health impact of premium cigars. In April 2021, the FDA announced that it will issue proposed product standards to ban menthol as a characterising flavour in cigarettes in the U.S. In December 2021, a regulatory agenda released in the U.S. confirmed the FDA's plans to publish a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a menthol cigarette ban in April 2022.\n\n## Additional regulation\n\nIn addition to the ANPRMs on reduced nicotine products and flavours, the FDA, in April 2019, issued a proposed rule on the format and content of reports to demonstrate substantial equivalence. This follows on the FDA's previous statements regarding the development of foundational rules so as to provide clarity and predictability to the tobacco product submission process, including not only substantial equivalence applications but new product applications as well as MRTP applications. In September 2019, FDA published a proposed rule on the format and content of PMTAs. The final foundations rules for substantial equivalence and PMTAs were published on 5 October 2021 and became effective on 4 November 2021. Notably, in each rule, FDA changed the term 'grandfathered tobacco product' to 'Pre-Existing Tobacco Product,' indicating that the latter term more appropriately describes those products that were commercially marketed in the U.S. as of 15 February 2007. The FDA has not yet promulgated its proposed rule for MRTP applications, though the most recent FDA semi-annual regulatory agenda - which details the regulatory activities that the FDA expects to undertake in the foreseeable future - targeted November 2021 for the issuance of a proposed rule.\n\nUnder the FSPTCA, for a manufacturer to launch a new tobacco product or modify an existing tobacco product after 22 March 2011, the manufacturer must obtain an order from the FDA allowing the new or modified product to be marketed. Similarly, a manufacturer that introduced a cigarette or smokeless tobacco product between 15 February 2007 and 22 March 2011 was required to file a substantial equivalence report with the FDA demonstrating either (1) that the new or modified product had the same characteristics as a product commercially available as at 15 February 2007, referred to as a predicate product, or (2) if the new or modified product had different characteristics than the predicate product, that it did not raise different questions of public health. A product subject to such report is referred to as a provisional product. A manufacturer may continue to market a provisional product unless and until the FDA issues an order that the provisional product is not substantially equivalent (NSE), in which case the FDA could then require the manufacturer to remove the provisional product from the market. Many of the RAI subsidiaries' cigarette and smokeless tobacco products currently on the market are provisional products.\n\nIn January 2017, the FDA issued its first proposed product standard just prior to President Trump's inauguration whereby the agency would require the reduction, over a three-year period, of the levels of N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) contained in smokeless tobacco products.\n\nSince issuing this proposal, the agency has simply stated that it is evaluating submitted comments. The FDA's semi-annual regulatory agenda has not listed the NNN proposal since its publication. Thus, it is not known whether or when this proposed rule will be finalised, and, if adopted, whether the final rule will be the same as or similar to the proposed rule. On 18 December 2017, the FDA accepted for review MRTP applications for six Camel Snus smokeless tobacco products. In 2018, the FDA began its review of these applications, which included facility inspections and a public meeting held 13-14 September 2018 before the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee to obtain its review and recommendation. The FDA is completing its independent review of the applications with no announced deadline for completion.\n\nOn 18 March 2020, FDA issued a rule mandating the incorporation on cigarettes packages of graphic health warnings. The rule requires eleven new textual warnings, each accompanied by a specific graphic image, on the top 50% of the front and back of all cigarette packages, on the left 50% of the front and back of cigarette cartons, and the top 20% of all cigarette advertising, beginning 18 June 2021. On 3 April 2020, RAI subsidiaries R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, in conjunction with several cigarette manufacturers and retailers, filed a lawsuit seeking to permanently enjoin implementation of the rule. The court has on multiple occasions entered orders delaying the implementation of the rule, which currently is delayed until 9 January 2023. All briefing and oral argument in the case has been completed, and the parties await a ruling from the court as to whether the final rule will be enjoined permanently. Irrespective of the court's decision, once issued it is expected to be appealed to the federal court of appeals. If the industry challenge is unsuccessful, the RAI companies are prepared to implement the rule's requirements by the January 2023 deadline, having created compliant packaging and obtained approval from the FDA for the required warning rotation plans.\n\nCigarettes and other tobacco products are subject to substantial taxes in the U.S. All states and the District of Columbia currently impose cigarette excise taxes. Certain city and county governments, such as those of New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, also impose substantial excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions. Also, all states and the District of Columbia currently subject smokeless tobacco products to excise taxes. Various states and the District of Columbia impose a tax on vapour products, such as e-cigarettes, and many other states have proposed taxes on vapour products. Currently, there is no federal tax on vapour products.\n\nState and local governments also consider and implement other legislation and regulation regarding the sale of tobacco products. Measures include, among others, limiting or prohibiting the sale of flavours in tobacco products, restricting where tobacco products may be sold and increasing the minimum age to purchase tobacco products. The Group believes that, as a responsible business, it can contribute through information, ideas and practical steps, to help regulators address the key issues regarding its products, including underage access, illicit trade, product information, product design, involuntary exposure to smoke and the development of potentially less harmful products, while maintaining a competitive market that accommodates the significant percentage of adults who choose to be tobacco consumers. The Group is committed to working with national governments and multilateral organisations and welcomes opportunities to participate in good faith to achieve sensible and balanced regulation of traditional tobacco and potentially reducedrisk products.",

Section 13(r) requires an issuer to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with designated natural persons or entities sanctioned under programmes relating to terrorism or the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the U.S. by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.\n\nAs of the date of this report, BAT is not aware of any activity, transaction or dealing by the Group or any of its affiliates during the financial year ended 31 December 2021 that is disclosable under Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below. This information is to the best of BAT's knowledge.\n\nUntil 6 August 2021, BAT had a local operation in Iran, established on 18 October 2003, through its wholly-owned non-U.S. subsidiary, B.A.T. Pars Company (Private Joint Stock) (BAT Pars). BAT Pars produced its products, which include Kent, Pall Mall and Montana brands, in its own factory in Eshtehard, which is in the Alborz province of Iran. As at 6 August 2021, BAT Pars distributed its product via 54 subagents with national and provincial distribution licences, who sell products to wholesalers and retailers with the support of BAT Pars' sales representatives. BAT Pars had 326 direct employees and an additional 1,192 contract workers supplied by a private company.\n\nOn 25 June 2021, the Group agreed to dispose of BAT Pars to DTM ME FZE LLC. Consideration is subject to the completion accounts process, with payment deferred until September 2022. The transaction was subject to the approval by State Centre of Tobacco Planning and Supervision of the Ministry of Industry of Iran and was successfully completed on 6 August 2021.\n\nConcerning the business of BAT Pars during its period of ownership within the Group, various elements such as income tax, payroll, social security, other taxes, excise, monopoly fees, duties and other fees, including for utilities, licences and judicial fees to commence litigation, were payable to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities regarding BAT Pars' operation. BAT Pars maintained bank accounts in Iran with various banks to facilitate its operations in the country and to make any required payments, as described above, to the Government of Iran and affiliated entities regarding its operations.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2021, BAT did not have any gross revenues or net profits derived from transactions with the Government of Iran or affiliated entities.\n\nBAT maintains policies and procedures designed to ensure that its former activities in Iran and elsewhere comply in all material aspects with the applicable and relevant trade sanctions laws and regulations, including U.S. and other international trade sanctions and/or embargoes. BAT's sanctions policies and procedures have been designed to be as robust as possible. However, there can be no absolute assurance that these policies and procedures will be effective. Were they to be ineffective, penalties or sanctions could be imposed against BAT, which could be material. Following completion of the disposal of BAT Pars, the above-described activities in Iran have ceased.",

Reynolds Tobacco Company, Lorillard and Brown & Williamson, businesses which are now part of Reynolds American) entered into the Master Settlement Agreement ('MSA') with attorneys general representing most U.S. states and territories. The MSA imposes a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on the major US cigarette manufacturers. The amounts of money that the participating manufacturers are required to annually contribute are based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold and market share (based on cigarette shipments in that year).\n\nDuring 2012, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, various other tobacco manufacturers, 17 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico reached a final agreement related to Reynolds American's 2003 MSA activities, and three more states joined the agreement in 2013. Under this agreement, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has received credits of more than US$1 billion in respect of its NonParticipating Manufacturer ('NPM') Adjustment claims related to the period from 2003 to 2012. These credits have been applied against the company's MSA payments over a period of five years from 2013, subject to, and dependent upon, meeting the various ongoing performance obligations. During 2014, two additional states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2003 to 2012. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company received US$170 million in credits, which have been applied over a five-year period from 2014. During 2015, another state agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2014. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company received US$285 million in credits, which have been applied over a four-year period from 2016. During 2016, no additional states agreed to settle NPM disputes. During 2017, two more states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2014. It is estimated that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will receive US$61 million in credits, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2017. During 2018, nine more states agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2019, with an option through 2022, subject to certain conditions. It is estimated that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will receive US$182 million in credits for settled periods through 2017, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2018. Also in 2018, a 10th additional state agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2004 to 2024, subject to certain conditions. It is estimated that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company will receive US$205 million in credits for settled periods through 2017, which will be applied over a five-year period from 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, certain conditions set forth in the 2018 agreements were met for those 10 states. In addition, in August 2020, 24 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico agreed to settle NPM disputes related to claims for the period 2018-2022. Credits in respect of future years' payments and the NPM Adjustment claims would be accounted for in the applicable year and will not be treated as adjusting items. Only credits in respect of prior year payments are included as adjusting items.\n\nThe BAT Group is subject to substantial payment obligations under the MSA and the state settlement agreements with the states of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (such settlement agreements, collectively 'State Settlement Agreements'). Reynolds American Inc.'s operating subsidiaries' expenses and payments under the MSA and the State Settlement Agreements for 2021 amounted to US$3,420 million in respect of settlement expenses and US$3,744 million in respect of settlement cash payments. Reynolds American Inc.'s operating subsidiaries' expenses and payments under the MSA and the State Settlement Agreements for 2020 amounted to US$3,572 million in respect of settlement expenses and US$2,848 million in respect of settlement cash payments. Reynolds American Inc.'s operating subsidiaries' expenses and payments under the MSA and the State Settlement Agreements for 2019 amounted to US$2,762 million in respect of settlement expenses and US$2,918 million in respect of settlement cash payments.\n\nR.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company divested certain brands to Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG) in 2015. In 2020, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recognised additional expenses, included above, under the state settlement agreements in the states of Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota related to these divested brands. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recognised US$241 million of expense for payment obligations to the state of Florida for the ITG acquired brands from the date of divestiture, 12 June 2015, as a result of an unfavourable judgment. In addition, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recognised US$264 million related to the resolution of claims against it in the states of Texas, Minnesota and Mississippi for payment obligations to those states for the ITG acquired brands from the date of divestiture. Finally, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company settled certain related claims with Phillip Morris USA under the state settlement agreements in the states of Mississippi, Texas and Minnesota for US$8 million.\n\n## Reynolds American Inc.: Transfer of Pension Obligations\n\nOn October 7 2021, Reynolds American Inc. entered into a 'buy out' transaction with Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company to transfer $1.9 billion of pension obligations (and eliminating all further legal or constructive obligation to the pension scheme or to the sponsoring employer) through the purchase of annuities for retirees receiving benefit payments of less than a threshold amount per month. The transaction was funded with plan assets (see note 15 in the Notes on the Accounts on page 215).",

The Group can produce many different pack formats (e.g., the number of cigarettes per packet) and configurations (e.g., bevel edge, round corner, international) to suit marketing and consumer requirements. New technology machines are sourced from the leading machinery suppliers to the industry. Close cooperation with these organisations helps the Group support its marketing strategy by driving its product innovations, which are brought to the market on a regular basis.\n\nThe Group utilises quality standards, processes and procedures covering the entire end-to-end value chain to help to ensure quality products are provided to its customers and adult tobacco consumers according to the Group's requirements and end market regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group has several improvement initiatives which it is currently managing. For example, the Group is continuing to realise the benefits of its Integrated Work System Programme launched in 2014, which is centrally led with an aim to improve the performance of the Group's factories globally by focusing on manufacturing standards, continuous improvement, assessment and benchmarking, and organisational development. The Group also utilises a survey process in the factories with an aim to improve factory productivity and reduce costs in the manufacturing environment. This process, known as 'Bulls Eye', has been in existence for a number of years and highlights productivity opportunities by benchmarking.\n\nIn 2021, the Group manufactured cigarettes in 42 cigarette factories in 40 countries. These plants and properties are owned or leased and operated by the Group's subsidiaries. The Group's factory outputs and establishments vary significantly in size and production capacity.\n\nAlso in 2021, the Group used third-party manufacturers to manufacture the components required, including the devices, related to New Categories. The Group also used third-party manufacturers to supplement the Group's own production facilities in the US and Poland to bottle the liquids used in the vapour products.\n\nFor more information on property, plant and equipment, see note 13 in the Notes on the Accounts.\n\n## Raw Materials\n\nWhile the Group does not own tobacco farms or directly employ farmers, it sources tobacco leaf directly from over 75,000 contracted farmers and through third-party suppliers mainly in developing countries and emerging markets. In respect of farmers we contract, we continually strive to improve farmer sustainability and viability with a focus on improved quality and resistance of seed, tailored mechanisation to reduce costs of production and increased yield, with similar expectation on our third-party suppliers in respect of their farmer contracts. We review our contracts on an annual basis considering Group requirements over the medium term (2-3 years) to promote the stability of demand and supply on production volumes. The Group also purchases a small amount of tobacco leaf from India where the tobacco is bought over an auction floor. The price of tobacco in US dollars varies from year-to-year driven by domestic inflationary pressures, economic and political factors, as well as climatic conditions which impact supply, demand and quality of tobacco grown.\n\nWhile COVID-19 impacted tobacco supply chains across most markets and required process enhancements to minimise transmission risks within communities, prices and availability of tobacco were not significantly impacted. The Group believes there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy its current and anticipated production requirements.\n\nWe also source a number of other materials required as part of our production requirements, covering areas that include wrapping materials and filters for our combustibles business and liquids and batteries for our New Categories products. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure a robust supply chain, with contingency sourcing in place. Contracts and sourcing agreements are reviewed regularly, to ensure competitive trading terms while recognising that prices may be impacted by external factors that affect our third-party supply partners. COVID-19 has led to some short-term disruption in the supply of certain materials (due to local lockdowns and travel restrictions), yet this has been proactively managed to mitigate the impact.",

        "page_content": "## US Corporate Governance Practices\n\n## Principles\n\nIn the U.S., ADSs of the Company are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The significant differences between the Company's corporate governance practices as a UK company and those required by NYSE listing standards for U.S. companies are discussed below.\n\nThe Company has applied a robust set of board governance principles, which reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and its principles-based approach to corporate governance. NYSE rules require U.S. companies to adopt and disclose on their websites corporate governance guidelines. The Company complies with UK requirements, including a statement in this report of how the Company has applied the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and that the Company has complied with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Company's Board governance principles require that all Non-Executive Directors be determined by the Board to be independent in character and judgement and free from any business or other relationships that could interfere materially with, or appear to affect, their judgement. The Board also has formal procedures for managing conflicts of interest. The Board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the Non-Executive Directors are independent. In doing so, the Board has taken into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards and considers these to be met by the Chairman and all of its Non-Executive Directors.\n\n## Committees\n\nThe Company has a number of Board Committees that are broadly comparable in purpose and composition to those required by NYSE rules for domestic U.S. companies. For instance, the Company has a Nominations (rather than nominating/corporate governance) Committee and a Remuneration (rather than compensation) Committee. The Company also has an Audit Committee, which NYSE rules require for both US companies and foreign private issuers.\n\nThese Committees are composed solely of Non-Executive Directors and, in the case of the Nominations Committee, the Chairman whom the Board has determined to be independent in the manner described above.\n\nEach Board Committee has its own terms of reference, which prescribe the composition, main tasks and requirements of each of the Committees (see the Board Committee reports on pages 116, 120 and 128).\n\nUnder U.S. securities law and the listing standards of the NYSE, the Company is required to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Company's Audit Committee complies with these requirements. The Company's Audit Committee does not have direct responsibility for the appointment, reappointment or removal of the independent auditors. Instead, it follows the UK Companies Act 2006 by making recommendations to the Board on these matters for it to put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM.\n\nOne of the NYSE's additional requirements for the audit committee states that at least one member of the audit committee is to have 'accounting or related financial management expertise'. The Board has determined that Holly Keller Koeppel and Darrell Thomas possess such expertise and also possess the financial and audit committee experiences set forth in both the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and SEC rules (see the Audit Committee report on page 120). Ms Keller Koeppel and Mr Thomas have also each been designated as an Audit Committee financial expert as defined in Item 16.A. of Form 20-F. The Board has also determined that each Audit Committee member meets the financial literacy requirements applicable under NYSE listing standards.\n\n## Shareholder Approval of Equity Compensation Plans\n\nThe NYSE rules for U.S. companies require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions to those plans. The Company complies with UK requirements that are similar to the NYSE rules. The Board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed definition of what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics\n\nThe NYSE rules require US companies to adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for all directors, officers and employees and promptly disclose any waivers of the code for directors or executive officers. The Group Standards of Business Conduct (the 'SoBC') described on pages 56 and 57 apply to all staff in the Group, including senior management and the Board, and satisfy the NYSE requirements. All Group companies have adopted the SoBC (or localised versions). The SoBC also set out the Group's whistleblowing policy, enabling staff, in confidence and anonymously, to raise concerns without fear of reprisal, including concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. The SoBC is available at bat.com/sobc.\n\nThe Company has also adopted a code of ethics for its Chief Executive, Finance and Transformation Director, Group Financial Controller and Group Chief Accountant as required by the provisions of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules issued by the SEC. No waivers or exceptions to the Code of Ethics were granted in 2021. The Code of Ethics includes requirements in relation to confidentiality, conflicts of interest and corporate opportunities, and obligations for those senior financial officers to act with honesty and integrity in the performance of their duties and to promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosures in all reports and other documents submitted to the SEC, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, and any other regulatory agency.\n\nThe Company considers that these codes and policies address the matters specified in the NYSE rules for U.S. companies.\n\n## Independent Director Contact\n\nInterested parties may communicate directly with the independent directors, individually or as a group, by sending written correspondence addressed to the independent director(s) to the attention of the Company Secretary at the following address: c/o Paul McCrory, Company Secretary, British American Tobacco p.l.c., Globe House, 4 Temple Place, London WC2R 2PG.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Controls and Procedures\n\n## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group maintains 'disclosure controls and procedures' (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the Group files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarised and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive and Finance and Transformation Director, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including the Chief Executive and Finance and Transformation Director, recognise that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Group have been detected. The Group's disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards.\n\nManagement, with the participation of the Chief Executive and Finance and Transformation Director, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Group disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive and Finance and Transformation Director have concluded that the Group disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement, under the oversight of the Chief Executive and the Finance and Transformation Director, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Group. The Group's internal control over financial reporting consists of processes which are designed to: provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Group's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and UK-adopted international accounting standards; provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditure are made only in accordance with the authorisation of management; and provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of any unauthorised acquisition, use or disposal of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has assessed the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13(a)-13(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934) based on the updated Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013). Based on that assessment, management has determined that the Group's internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 31 December 2021.\n\nAny internal control framework, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or because the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\u00bbKPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, who also audit the Group's consolidated financial statements, has audited the effectiveness of the Group's internal control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2021, which is included in this document.\u00bb\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Group's internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Statements Regarding Competitive Position\n\nStatements referring to the competitive position of BAT and its subsidiaries are based on the Group's belief and best estimates. In certain cases, such statements and figures rely on a range of sources, including investment analyst reports, independent market surveys, and the Group's own internal assessments of market share.",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Shareholder Taxation Information\n\nThe following discussion summarises material US federal income tax consequences and UK taxation consequences to US holders of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, this information is accurate as at 18 January 2022. This discussion does not address any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, local or foreign jurisdiction or under any US federal laws other than those pertaining to income tax. This discussion is based upon the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the 'US Tax Code'), the Treasury regulations promulgated under the US Tax Code and court and administrative rulings and decisions, all as in effect on the date hereof. These laws may change, possibly retroactively, and any change could affect the accuracy of the statements and conclusions set forth in this discussion.\n\nThis discussion addresses only those US holders of ordinary shares or ADSs who hold such equity interests as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the US Tax Code. Further, this discussion does not address all aspects of US federal income taxation that may be relevant to US holders in light of their particular circumstances or that may be applicable to them if they are subject to special treatment under the US federal income tax laws, including, without limitation:\n\n- - a bank or other financial institution;\n- - a tax-exempt organisation;\n- - an S corporation or other pass-through entity and an investor therein;\n- - an insurance company;\n- - a mutual fund;\n- - a regulated investment company or real estate investment trust;\n- - a dealer or broker in stocks and securities, or currencies;\n- - a trader in securities that elects mark-to-market treatment;\n- - a US holder subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the US Tax Code;\n- - a US holder that received ordinary shares or ADSs through the exercise of an employee stock option, pursuant to a tax qualified retirement plan or otherwise as compensation;\n- - a US holder that is a tax-qualified retirement plan or a participant or a beneficiary under such a plan;\n- - a person that is not a US holder (as defined below);\n- - a person that has a functional currency other than the US dollar;\n- - a person required to recognise any item of gross income as a result of such income being recognised on an applicable financial statement;\n- - a US holder of ordinary shares or ADSs that holds such equity interest as part of a hedge, straddle, constructive sale, conversion or other integrated transaction;\n- - a US holder that owns (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of ordinary shares or ADSs by vote or by value; or\n- - a US expatriate.\n\nThe determination of the actual tax consequences to a US holder will depend on the US holder's specific situation. US holders of ordinary shares or ADSs should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, in each case, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, foreign or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, the term US holder means a beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs (as the case may be) that:\n\n- - is for US federal income tax purposes: (i) an individual citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation, including any entity treated as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes, created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) a trust if a US court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust or it has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a US person; or (iv) an estate that is subject to US federal income tax on its income regardless of its source; and\n- - is not resident in the UK for UK tax purposes.\n\nThe US federal income tax consequences to a partner in an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes that holds ordinary shares or ADSs generally will depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners in a partnership holding any such equity interest should consult their own tax advisers.\n\n## Material US Federal Income Tax Consequences Relating to the Ownership and Disposition of Ordinary Shares or ADSs\n\nThe following is a discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition by US holders of ordinary shares or ADSs. This discussion assumes that BAT is not, and will not become, a passive foreign investment company for US federal income tax purposes, as described below.\n\n## ADSs\n\nA US holder of ADSs, for US federal income tax purposes, generally will be treated as the owner of the underlying ordinary shares that are represented by such ADSs. Accordingly, deposits or withdrawals of ordinary shares for or from ADSs will not be subject to US federal income tax.\n\n## Taxation of Dividends\n\nThe gross amount of distributions on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be taxable as dividends to the extent paid out of BAT's current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under US federal income tax principles. Such income will be includable in a US holder's gross income as ordinary income on the day actually or constructively received by the US holder. Such dividends will be treated as foreign source income and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under the US Tax Code.",

        "page_content": "With respect to non-corporate US investors, certain dividends received from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that the Treasury determines to be satisfactory for these purposes and that includes an exchange of information provision. The Treasury has determined that the treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom meets these requirements, and BAT believes that it is eligible for the benefits of the treaty. However, non-corporate holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as 'investment income' pursuant to Section 163(d)(4) of the US Tax Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation. In addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period has been met. US holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the application of these rules to their particular circumstances.\n\nThe amount of any dividend paid by BAT in \u00a3 sterling (including any such amount in respect of ADSs that is converted into US dollars by the depositary bank) will equal the US dollar value of the \u00a3 sterling actually or constructively received, calculated by reference to the exchange rate in effect on the date the dividend is so received by the US holder, regardless of whether the \u00a3 sterling are converted into US dollars. If the \u00a3 sterling received as a dividend are converted into US dollars on the date received, the US holder generally will not be required to recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss in respect of the dividend income. If the \u00a3 sterling received as a dividend are not converted into US dollars on the date of receipt, the US holder will have a basis in \u00a3 sterling equal to their US dollar value on the date of receipt. Any gain or loss realised on a subsequent conversion or other disposition of \u00a3 sterling will be treated as US source ordinary income or loss. US holders of ADSs should consult their own tax advisers regarding the application of these rules to the amount of any dividend paid by BAT in \u00a3 sterling that is converted into US dollars by the depositary bank.\n\nTo the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds BAT's current and accumulated earnings and profits for a taxable year, as determined under US federal income tax principles, the distribution will first be treated as a tax-free return of capital, causing a reduction in the US holder's adjusted basis of the ordinary shares or ADSs, and to the extent the amount of the distribution exceeds the US holder's tax basis, the excess will be taxed as capital gain recognised on a sale or exchange, as described below. BAT does not expect to determine earnings and profits in accordance with US federal income tax principles. Therefore, notwithstanding the foregoing, US holders should expect that distributions generally will be reported as dividend income for US information reporting purposes.\n\nDistributions by BAT of additional ordinary shares (which may be distributed by the depositary bank to a holder of ADSs in the form of ADSs) to a US holder that is made as part of a pro rata distribution to all holders of ordinary shares and ADSs in respect of their ordinary shares or ADSs, and for which there is no option to receive other property (not including ADSs), generally will not be subject to US federal income tax. The basis of any new ordinary shares (or ADSs representing new ordinary shares) so received will be determined by allocating the US holder's basis in the previously held ordinary shares or ADSs between the previously held ordinary shares or ADSs and the new ordinary shares or ADSs, based on their relative fair market values on the date of distribution.\n\n## Passive foreign investment company\n\nA passive foreign investment company ('PFIC'), is any foreign corporation if, after the application of certain 'look-through' rules: (1) at least 75% of its gross income is 'passive income' as that term is defined in the relevant provisions of the US Tax Code; or (2) at least 50% of the average value of its assets produce 'passive income' or are held for the production of 'passive income.' The determination as to PFIC status is made annually.\n\nBAT does not believe that it is, for US federal income tax purposes, a PFIC, and BAT expects to operate in such a manner so as not to become a PFIC. If, however, BAT is or becomes a PFIC, US holders could be subject to additional US federal income taxes on gain recognised with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs and on certain distributions, plus an interest charge on certain taxes treated as having been deferred under the PFIC rules. Non-corporate US holders will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividends received from BAT if it is a PFIC in the taxable year in which such dividends are paid or in the preceding taxable year. BAT's US counsel expresses no opinion with respect to BAT's PFIC status.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\nUpon a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs, a US holder will generally recognise capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised on the disposition and the US holder's adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs as determined in US dollars. Such gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the US holder has held the ordinary shares or ADSs for more than one year. Certain non-corporate US holders may be eligible for preferential rates of US federal income tax in respect of net long-term capital gains. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nThe amount realised on a sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of ordinary shares for an amount in foreign currency will be the US dollar value of that amount on the date of sale or disposition. On the settlement date, the US holder will recognise US source foreign currency exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss) equal to the difference (if any) between the US dollar value of the amount received based on the exchange rates in effect on the date of sale, exchange or other disposition and the settlement date. However, in the case of ordinary shares traded on an established securities market that are sold by a cash-basis US holder (or an accrualbasis US holder that so elects), the amount realised will be based on the exchange rate in effect on the settlement date for the sale, and no foreign currency exchange gain or loss will be recognised at that time.\n\nA US holder's tax basis in ordinary shares or ADSs will generally equal the US dollar cost of the ordinary shares or ADSs. The US dollar cost of ordinary shares purchased with foreign currency will generally be the US dollar value of the purchase price on the date of purchase, or the settlement date for the purchase in the case of ordinary shares traded on an established securities market that are purchased by a cash-basis US holder (or an accrual-basis US holder that so elects).",

        "page_content": "## Other Information\n\n## Shareholder Taxation Information Continued\n\n## Information with respect to foreign financial assets\n\nIndividuals and certain entities that own 'specified foreign financial assets' with an aggregate value in excess of US$50,000 are generally required to file information reports with respect to such assets with their US federal income tax returns. Depending on the individual's circumstances, higher threshold amounts may apply. Specified foreign financial assets include any financial accounts maintained by foreign financial institutions, as well as any of the following, but only if they are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions: (1) stocks and securities issued by non-US persons; (2) financial instruments and contracts held for investment that have non-US issuers or counterparties; and (3) interests in non-US entities. If a US holder is subject to this information reporting regime, the failure to file information reports may subject the US holder to penalties. US holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding their obligations to file information reports with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs.\n\n## Medicare net investment tax\n\nCertain persons who are individuals (other than non-resident aliens), estates or trusts are required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on the lesser of (1) their 'net investment income' (in the case of individuals) or 'undistributed net investment income' (in the case of estates and trusts) (which includes dividend income in respect of, and gain recognised on the disposition of, ordinary shares or ADSs) for the relevant taxable year; and (2) the excess of their modified adjusted gross income (in the case of individuals) or adjusted gross income (in the case of estates and trusts) for the taxable year over specified dollar amounts. US holders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the applicability of this provision to their ownership of ordinary shares or ADSs.\n\n## Credits or deductions for UK taxes\n\nAs indicated under 'Material UK tax consequences' below, dividends in respect of, and gains on the disposition of, ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to UK taxation in certain circumstances. A US holder may be eligible to claim a credit or deduction in respect of UK taxes attributable to such income or gain for purposes of computing the US holder's US federal income tax liability, subject to certain limitations. The US foreign tax credit rules are complex, and US holders should consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of US foreign tax credits and the application of the US foreign tax credit rules to their particular situation.\n\n## Information reporting and backup withholding\n\nInformation reporting and backup withholding may apply to dividend payments and proceeds from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs. Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a US holder that: (1) furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number (TIN), certifies that such holder is not subject to backup withholding on Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or appropriate successor form) and otherwise complies with all applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules; or (2) provides proof that such holder is otherwise exempt from backup withholding. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be refunded or credited against a holder's US federal income tax liability, if any, provided that such holder furnishes the required information to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner. The Internal Revenue Service may impose a penalty upon any taxpayer that fails to provide the correct TIN.\n\nThis summary of material US federal income tax consequences is not tax advice. The determination of the actual tax consequences for a US holder will depend on the US holder's specific situation. US holders of ordinary shares or ADSs, in each case, should consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares or ADSs, including the applicability and effect of the alternative minimum tax and any state, local, foreign or other tax laws and of changes in those laws.\n\n## Material UK Tax Consequences\n\nThe following paragraphs summarise material aspects of the UK tax treatment of US holders of ordinary shares or ADSs and do not purport to be either a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to holding ordinary shares or ADSs or an analysis of the tax position of BAT. They are based on current UK legislation and what is understood to be current HMRC practice, both of which are subject to change, possibly with retrospective effect.\n\nThe comments are intended as a general guide and (otherwise than where expressly stated to the contrary) apply only to US holders of ordinary shares or ADSs (other than under a personal equity plan or individual savings account) and who are the absolute beneficial owners of such shares. These comments do not deal with certain types of shareholders such as charities, dealers in securities, persons holding or acquiring shares in the course of a trade, persons who have or could be treated for tax purposes as having acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs by reason of their employment, collective investment schemes, persons subject to UK tax on the remittance basis and insurance companies. You are encouraged to consult an appropriate independent professional tax adviser with respect to your tax position.\n\n## Tax on chargeable gains as a result of disposals of ordinary shares or ADSs\n\nSubject to the below, US holders will not generally be subject to UK tax on chargeable gains on a disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs provided that they do not carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in connection with which the ordinary shares or ADSs are held.\n\nA US holder who is an individual, who has ceased to be resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom for a period of less than five years and who disposes of ordinary shares or ADSs during that period may be liable for UK tax on capital gains (in the absence of any available exemptions or reliefs). If applicable, the tax charge will arise in the tax year that the individual returns to the United Kingdom.",

        "page_content": "## Tax on dividends\n\nBAT is not required to withhold UK tax at source from dividends paid on ordinary shares or ADSs.\n\nUS holders will not generally be subject to UK tax on dividends received from BAT provided that they do not carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in connection with which the ordinary shares or ADSs are held.\n\n## Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax (SDRT)\n\nBased on current published HMRC practice and recent case law, transfers of ADSs should not be subject to SDRT or stamp duty. The transfer of an underlying ordinary share to the ADS holder in exchange for the cancellation of an ADS should also not give rise to a stamp duty or SDRT charge.\n\nTransfers of ordinary shares outside of the depositary bank, including the repurchase of ordinary shares by BAT, will generally be subject to stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration given, except as described above in connection with the cancellation of an ADS. If ordinary shares are redeposited into a clearance service or depositary system, the redeposit will attract stamp duty or SDRT at the higher rate of 1.5%.\n\nThe purchaser or the transferee of the ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be responsible for paying any stamp duty or SDRT payable. Where stamp duty or SDRT is payable, it is payable regardless of the residence position of the purchaser.\n\n## Inheritance tax\n\nA gift or settlement of ordinary shares or ADSs by, or on the death of, an individual shareholder may give rise to a liability to UK inheritance tax even if the shareholder is not a resident of, or domiciled in, the United Kingdom.\n\nA charge to inheritance tax may arise in certain circumstances where ordinary shares or ADSs are held by close companies and trustees of settlements.\n\nHowever, pursuant to the Estate and Gift Tax Treaty 1980 (the 'Treaty') entered into between the United Kingdom and the United States, a gift or settlement of ordinary shares or ADSs by shareholders who are domiciled in the United States for the purposes of the Treaty may be exempt from any liability to UK inheritance tax.",

LTIP: grants or awards of ordinary shares under the LTIP are for nil consideration. The number of options shown is the maximum that may be exercised subject to the completion of the applicable performance period and conditions under the rules of the LTIP. The number of options which may vest and become exercisable may be less than the number of ordinary shares shown in the table.\n- 2. Sharesave Scheme: grants of options under the Sharesave Scheme are: (a) normally granted at a discount of 20% to the market price of ordinary shares at the time of invitation, as permitted by the rules of the Sharesave Scheme; and (b) are exercisable at the end of a three-year or five-year savings contract up to a monthly limit of \u00a3500.\n- 3. Each of the LTIP and Sharesave Scheme contains provisions which permit the Board of Directors or a duly authorised committee of the Board of Directors to establish further plans for the benefit of overseas employees based on the relevant share plan but modified as necessary or desirable to take account of overseas tax, exchange control or applicable securities laws. Any new ordinary shares issued under such plans would not count towards any applicable plan limits under the LTIP or the Sharesave Scheme.\n\n## Restricted Share Awards\n\n- 4. DSBS: a portion of annual bonus is deferred into a grant of ordinary shares which vests after a three year period. No further performance conditions apply in that period. Participants have no ownership over the shares until vesting and the shares carry no rights to vote in that period. Dividend equivalent payments are paid quarterly during the vesting period.\n- 5. SIP: the SIP is an all-employee plan which includes the SRS under which eligible employees receive an award of ordinary shares (Free Shares) in April of each year in which the plan operates in respect of performance in the previous financial year. The Free Shares are held in a UK-based trust from the date of the award for a minimum period of three years. During that time the SIP participant is entitled to receive dividends on those ordinary shares which are re-invested by such trust to buy further ordinary shares (Dividend Shares) on behalf of the SIP participant. The Dividend Shares are also held in the trust from the date of acquisition for a minimum period of three years. During the three-year holding periods, the SIP participant may not remove the Free Shares or the Dividend Shares from the trust, but may direct the trust to exercise its voting rights in accordance with his or her instructions. In addition to the Free Shares and Dividend Shares, participants in the SIP are also eligible to purchase additional ordinary shares from their pre-tax salary up to an annual statutory limit (Partnership Shares). The SIP also provides that BAT has the right to offer additional ordinary shares to a participant at no cost for each Partnership Share the participant purchases, at a ratio of two such ordinary shares for each Partnership Share purchased (Matching Shares). BAT does not currently provide any Matching Shares.\n- 6. BAT has established similar plans to the SIP for non-UK employees and specific plans for employees in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Each of these plans has been modified to take account of overseas tax, exchange control and applicable securities laws.\n- 7. Restricted Share Plan: grant of ordinary shares which vests after a three year period. No performance conditions apply in that period. Participants have no ownership over the shares until vesting and the shares carry no rights to vote in that period. Dividend equivalent payments are paid on shares vesting.",

(Citibank) was appointed as the depositary bank (the 'Depositary') for BAT's ADS programme pursuant to the Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement dated 1 December 2008 and amended as of 14 February 2017 and 14 June 2017 between BAT, the Depositary and the owners and holders of ADSs (the 'Deposit Agreement'). Citibank was reappointed as the Depositary pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement dated 26 November 2018 (the 'Restated Deposit Agreement').\n\nThe Restated Deposit Agreement provides that ADS holders may be required to pay various fees to the Depositary, and the Depositary may refuse to provide any service for which a fee is assessed until the applicable fee has been paid.\n\nService\n\nFees\n\n| Issuance of ADSs upon deposit of ordinary shares (excluding  issuances as a result of distributions of shares described below)                       | Up to US$0.05 per ADS issued 1      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Cancellation of ADSs                                                                                                                                 | Up to US$0.05 per ADS surrendered 1 |\n| Distribution of cash dividends or other cash distributions (i.e., sale  of rights and other entitlements)                                            | Up to US$0.05 per ADS held 2        |\n| Distribution of ADSs pursuant to: (1) stock dividends or other free  stock distributions; or (2) exercise of rights to purchase additional  BAT ADSs | Up to US$0.05 per ADS held          |\n| Distribution of securities other than ADSs or rights to purchase  additional ADSs (i.e., spinoff shares)                                             | Up to US$0.05 per ADS held          |\n| Depositary bank services                                                                                                                             | Up to US$0.05 per ADS held          |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1.  Under the terms of a separate agreement between BAT and the Depositary, the Depositary has agreed to waive the fees that would otherwise be payable in connection with the issuance of ADSs upon deposit of ordinary shares and the cancellation of ADSs and corresponding withdrawal of ordinary shares, in each case by BAT or any of its affiliates, officers, directors or employees. The terms of this separate agreement may be amended at any time by BAT and the Depositary.\n- 2. While under the Restated Deposit Agreement cash dividends paid in respect of ADSs are subject to a fee of up to US$0.05 per ADS payable to the Depositary, under the terms of the separate agreement between BAT and the Depositary referred to above, such dividends are instead subject to a fee of up to US$0.02 per ADS per year (a fee of US$0.005 per dividend based on the distribution of four quarterly cash dividends per year). Under the separate agreement, this dividend fee may not be varied by the Depositary without the consent of BAT.\n\n## Contact details for Citibank Shareholder Services are on page 377.\n\nIn addition, ADS holders may be required under the Restated Deposit Agreement to pay the Depositary: (a) taxes (including applicable interest and penalties) and other governmental charges; (b) registration fees; (c) certain cable, telex and facsimile transmission and delivery expenses; (d) the expenses and charges incurred by the Depositary in the conversion of foreign currency; (e) such fees and expenses as are incurred by the Depositary in connection with compliance with applicable exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements; and (f) the fees and expenses incurred by the Depositary, the custodian or any nominee in connection with the servicing or delivery of deposited securities. The Depositary may: (a) withhold dividends or other distributions or sell for the account of any ADS holder any or all of the shares underlying the ADSs in order to satisfy any tax or governmental charge; and (b) deduct from any cash distribution the applicable fees and charges of, and expenses incurred by, the Depositary and any taxes, duties or other governmental charges on account.\n\n## Fees and Payments Made by the Depositary to BAT\n\nUnder the terms of the contractual arrangements set out in the separate agreement between BAT and the Depositary referred to above, BAT received a total of approximately US$6.1 million from the Depositary, comprising fees charged in respect of dividends and a contribution to BAT's ADS programme administration costs for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nIn 2021, these programme administration costs principally included those associated with AGM proxy mailings, exchange listing and regulatory fees, foreign private issuer analysis, legal fees, share registration fees and other expenses incurred by BAT in relation to the ADS programme.\n\nUnder these contractual arrangements, the Depositary has also agreed to waive certain standard fees associated with the administration of the ADS programme.",
