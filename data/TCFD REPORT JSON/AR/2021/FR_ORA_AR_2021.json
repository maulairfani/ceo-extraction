The acquisition of Groupama Banque, now Orange Bank, in 2016, which launched its new banking offer in November 2017, illustrates the goal of diversifying into the mobile financial services sector.\n\nIn  2006,  Orange  became  the  Group's  main  brand  for  Internet, television and mobile telephony services in the majority of countries where it operated, most importantly France and Spain. In 2013, the  Company adopted the Orange name, offering the full range of  its  telephony  services  in  France  under  the  Orange  brand. This policy continued with the adoption of the Orange brand by Telekomunikacja Polska in 2013, by Mobinil in Egypt, Mobistar in Belgium and M\u00e9ditel in Morocco in 2016, and by several of the Group's subsidiaries in Africa in 2017. Corporate services in the world  are  offered  primarily  under  the  brand  Orange  Business Services.\n\nIn  December  2019,  the  Group  presented  its  new  'Engage 2025' strategic plan, which, guided by social and environmental accountability,  aims  to  reinvent  its  operator  model.  For  more information on Orange's strategic plan and its business model, see Section 1.2 Business model, market and strategy.\n\n- / Africa and Middle East\n\n## Cross-cutting divisions\n\n- / Orange Business Services\n- / Cyberdefense\n- / Wholesale and International Networks\n- / Orange  Content\n- / Mobile Financial Services\n- / Totem\n\n## 1.1.3 History\n\nOrange,  formerly  France  Telecom,  is  France's  incumbent telecommunications  operator.  The  Group  has  its  origins  in  the Ministry for Mail, Telegraphs and Telephone. It was renamed France Telecom in 1991 and became a soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme (limited company) on December 31, 1996. In October 1997, France Telecom shares were listed on the Paris and New York stock exchanges, allowing the French government the disposal of 25% of its shares to the public  and  Group  employees.  Subsequently,  the  public  sector gradually  reduced  its  holding  to  53%.  Between  2004  and  2008 the public sector sold a further 26% of the capital, and then again 4% in 2014 and 2015. On December 31, 2021, the French State retained 22.95% of the share capital, held either directly or jointly with Bpifrance Participations.\n\nFrance Telecom's area of activity and its regulatory and competitive environment have undergone significant changes since the 1990s. In a context of increased deregulation and competition, the Group has, over that period, undertaken several strategic investments, in particular the acquisition of the mobile operator Orange Plc and its brand created in 1994, and the acquisition of a controlling stake in Poland's incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja Polska.\n\nSince  2005,  the  Group  has  expanded  strategically  in  Spain  by acquiring the mobile operator Amena, then in 2015 the fixed-line operator Jazztel.\n\nOver  the  last  fifteen  years,  the  Group  has  pursued  a  policy  of selective,  value-creating  acquisitions  by  concentrating  on  the markets  in  which  it  is  already  present.  Mainly  targeting  the emerging markets of Africa and the Middle East where the Group is  historically  present  (in  particular  Cameroon,  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire, Guinea, Jordan, Mali and Senegal), this strategy was implemented through the acquisition of Mobinil in Egypt (2010) and of M\u00e9ditel in Morocco (2015) and more recently by the acquisition of a number of African operators (in Liberia, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) (2016).",

        "page_content": "## 1.2 Business model, market and strategy\n\n## 1.2.1 Our business model\n\n'As a trusted partner, Orange gives everyone the keys to a responsible digital world.' Such is our purpose, which frames everything we do and runs through our entire business model, enabling us to continuously create value we can share.\n\n## Rolling out digital infrastructure\n\nOrange is one of the world's leading telecommunications operators. We design, deploy and operate the infrastructure that's essential for today's digital world. Our priority is to develop high-performance, secure, intelligent networks that are also energy efficient to ensure our  industrial  strategy  is  sustainable,  in  line  with  our  climate commitments.\n\nThe fixed and mobile access networks we operate reach individuals in  26  countries  in  Europe,  Africa  and  the  Middle  East,  and businesses in almost 220 countries and regions. We own a total of 40,000 mobile towers in Europe and own or co-own 450,000 km of  submarine  cables.  Our  customers-including  people  living  in remote  areas-can  access  very  high-speed  broadband  using satellite technology.\n\nCommitted to continuing to deploy fiber, Orange teamed up with long-term investors to create two FiberCos in Europe. In 2021, the Group  also  launched  TOTEM,  its  European  TowerCo,  providing mutualized  solutions  for  operators  to  facilitate  passive  mobile infrastructure sharing, derive higher value from mobile towers and optimize the way in which they are managed.\n\n## Connecting as many people as possible\n\nThe trends accelerated by the pandemic-the growth in the number of  Internet  users,  progress made in terms of enhancing regional coverage, digital transformations within companies and widespread use of online services-signal a growing need for reliable, inclusive and secure connectivity everywhere.\n\nOur response involves continuing to roll out fiber, 4G and 5G, greatly increasing  the  capacity  of  our  infrastructure.  Our  infrastructure provides  enhanced  connectivity  for  our  entire  customer  base, comprising retail, business and wholesale customers (operators in France and abroad, content and Internet service providers, etc.).\n\n## Developing new, trustworthy services\n\nOur networks are the foundation for developing innovative services relating  to  finance,  business  IT  support,  cybersecurity,  content, e-health, remote surveillance, energy, and more.\n\nThe trust people place in our brand and a strong regional network help  Orange  Bank  to  develop  in-house  banking  services  that are mobile-native and work in synergy with our broader telecom activities.  Over  25  million  active  Orange  Money  customers  in\n\nAfrica and the Middle East use the service to complete financial transactions quickly and easily on the move.\n\nThrough Orange Business Services, our unique expertise as both a network operator and digital services integrator means we combine the full range of skills required to support businesses all along the digital value chain, with on-demand networks, multi-cloud services, data analysis, artificial intelligence and smart mobility services. We are constantly developing innovative services to help businesses leverage new uses and face major changes in their sectors. Our solutions can also help them reduce their environmental footprint.\n\nWhat's  more,  through  Orange  Cyberdefense,  we  provide cybersecurity services across all stages of the threat life cycle.\n\n## Sharing the value we create\n\nIn line with our purpose and Engage 2025 strategic plan, our aim is to create value for our shareholders, employees, customers and, ultimately, society as a whole.\n\nThe  strong  level  of  engagement  among  our  employees  is  our biggest asset when it comes to our role as an essential operator. Orange invests in skills development, supports the introduction of new ways of working and promotes gender diversity in all areas of the business.\n\nIn 2021, Orange continued to invest in upgrading its networks to bring more and more customers the best possible connectivity. Furthermore,  the  Group  complies  with  exacting  responsible procurement criteria and fosters entrepreneurship in all its operating regions.  As  a  network  operator  and  digital  services  integrator, we  ensure  digital  technology  plays  a  key  part  in  transforming businesses. Our financial solidity enables us to maintain the trust of our lenders, investors and shareholders, reaching 7.5% employee share ownership through our Together 2021 internal shareholding plan.\n\nWe firmly  believe  that  digital  technology  can  facilitate  inclusion, which  is  why  we  support  a  growing  number  of  people  through nine Orange Digital Centers, dedicated learning hubs to develop people's digital skills. We have pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2040-10 years earlier than the objectives set by the GSMA global telecoms industry body-by making our networks, buildings and transportation systems more energy efficient, making greater use of electricity from renewable sources and engaging with the circular economy.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## 1.2.2 Key changes in the telecoms services market\n\n## Network development and growth in telecommunication uses\n\nThanks  to  the  increased  capacity  of  existing  network  (fiber and  4G/5G)  and  the  penetration  of  smartphones,  the  take-up of  new  uses  has  accelerated,  impacted  also  by  the  multiplicity of  screens  (computers,  smartphones,  tablets,  connected  TV, augmented  reality  glasses  and  headphones).  The  development of 5G technology has prompted the emergence of new uses for businesses  (optimization  of  production  time,  remote  control  of machines, predictive maintenance, etc.), and for the general public (immersive videos, Cloud gaming, Metaverse, live 360 transmission with several HD cameras).\n\nIn  Africa  and  in  the  Middle  East,  Internet  access  networks  are developing primarily through the rollout of 4G mobile networks, and fiber is taking off in targeted zones in large cities. In Europe, network investments are focused on very high-speed broadband access, with the development of fiber in the fixed-line segment, improved performance  of  4G  mobile  networks  and  commercial  launches of 5G. At the same time, operators are constantly upgrading their networks in a bid to make them more agile and easier to manage (through the virtualization of network functions and automation), and to optimize their value through pooling.\n\n## New consumer and business expectations\n\nThe health crisis made the need for connectivity a vital issue for individuals  -  to  work,  access  healthcare  and  maintain  social connection,  and  for  businesses  to  secure  their  growth  or  their survival  (teleworking,  e-commerce,  etc.).  This  acceleration  of digitalization has made cybersecurity necessary for all: individuals, businesses and States.\n\nMore than ever customers count on networks being reliable and resilient  and  the  protection  of  their  personal  data,  prompting awareness of the importance of a relationship of trust with their operator.\n\n## 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy\n\nThe  Engage  2025  strategic  plan,  which  combines  growth  and responsibility, is based on an environmental and social commitment and four ambitions :\n\n- 1. Reinventing Orange's operator model ;\n- 2. Accelerating in growth areas ;\n- 3. Placing data and AI at the heart of the innovation model ;\n- 4. Co-creating a future-facing company.\n\nIn this plan for 2025, launched in December 2019, for the first time Orange made the clear and committed choice to place its social responsibility at the heart of its strategic vision. With Engage 2025, the Group aims to play its part in building a more sustainable and inclusive world by focusing its CSR initiatives on two main areas: the fight against global warming and for digital inclusion.\n\nThe  context  of  the  economic  and  health  crisis  has  aggravated unequal access to digital solutions. At the same time, there have been an increasing number of extreme weather events. Faced with this  dual  phenomenon, society as a whole increasingly expects greater  transparency  from  companies,  more  commitment  in respect of major environmental and social issues, but also a greater presence in regional towns and communities.\n\n## Transformation of the telecoms industry\n\nAgainst  this  new  backdrop,  the  transformation  of  the  telecoms industry has gathered pace.\n\nThe major US digital players (GAFAM (1) )  have  continued to grow more powerful: smartphones manufacturers and digital services providers are challenging the capacity of operators to stand out, while Over-The-Top (OTT) service providers are now focused on the  substitution  of  voice  in  B2B  and  International  Wholesale. Thanks to the size of their domestic market - sufficient to generate the means required to innovate globally, Chinese suppliers have become key players in networks and smartphones, thereby raising the question of the dependence of European telcos (supply chain in particular). Lastly, the supremacy of these giants looms over the digital economy and could generate security and sovereignty risks at the European level.\n\nThe major digital players are also speeding up the development of  their  proprietary  infrastructures  by  building  new  Data  centers and international networks that they are promoting in the B2B and wholesale markets.\n\nTo  face  the  increasingly  steady  growth  of  uses  (video,  data), European  operators  must  continue  to  invest  in  tomorrow's  very high-speed broadband, fixed (fiber) and mobile (4G/5G) networks. At the same time, they are facing very fierce competition (low cost, price  war)  and  more  severe  regulatory  requirements  (imposed rates ). To address the resulting high financial constraint, operators are pooling and sharing their networks, some have transferred all or  part  of  their  infrastructures  to  financial  funds  or  infrastructure companies (see sections 1.3 Significant events and 2.1 Risk factors).\n\n## A strong commitment guided by social and environmental responsibility\n\nThe Group has adopted a business model that is committed and accountable to its employees, its customers and the Society as a whole.\n\n## Commitment to inclusion\n\nIn a crisis context that has aggravated unequal access to digital solutions,  Orange  trains  and  supports  the  digitally  excluded. Nine  Orange  Digital  Centers  were  thus  opened  in  the  MEA region (Middle-East and Africa) (2) to  foster  entrepreneurship and employability of young people by developing their digital skills. The Group also offers solutions to low-income households in Europe, such as Tarifa social in Spain (improved to adapt to the growing connectivity needs of households), and affordable smartphones. In  December, it launched Neva Leaf, the first \u00abeco-responsible\u00bb smartphone  which  combines  durability  and  inclusion:  reduced carbon footprint (20% of recycled plastic), easily repairable (shell, screen, battery), upgradable for a very affordable price.",

        "page_content": "## Environmental commitment\n\nIn  response to the challenge of climate change, Orange has set itself the goal of bringing forward the GSMA objectives by 10 years, reaching Net Zero Carbon by 2040, despite the surge in network data, compounded by the health crisis (teleworking, digitalization). In 2021, the group met 36,3% of its electricity needs by using power from renewable sources (with a goal of at least 50% in 2025).\n\nIn 2021, the Group signed several renewable energy power purchase agreements in France, Spain and Poland, with Engie, Boralex and TotalEnergies. In the MEA zone, it sped up its solar-related projects and has partnered with Engie to use solar energy to power GOS (Groupement Orange Services), the main Orange Data Center in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. It is continuously reducing its energy consumption (networks,  buildings,  vehicles)  and  increasingly  active  in  the circular economy: eco-designed products, second-hand network equipment with Nokia and BuyIn (1) ,  reconditioned terminals and/ or fixed in stores, first SIM card made of 100% recycled plastic in Belgium. Lastly, to physically capture its incompressible residual carbon emissions, Orange has chosen to finance natural carbon sinks, notably through the creation of Orange Nature, an innovative carbon  fund  launched  in  December  2021  (See  sections  1.3 Significant events and 1.6.3 Capital investment).\n\nSince 2015, the Group has reduced its CO2 emissions by 12.4%, with a goal of a 30% reduction in 2025. For more information, see section 4.2.2 Control of energy and climate impacts.\n\n## Four bold ambitions to tackle a changing ecosystem\n\n## Reinventing its operator model by capitalizing on its leading position in networks\n\nThe group seeks to grow its core business, connectivity, thanks to enhanced connectivity and more open and higher valued network infrastructures.\n\n## Faster digital development for regional communities\n\nDespite the health crisis, the Group continued to accelerate the rollout of its high-speed and mobile networks in 2021.\n\nOn  the  fixed-line  segment,  56.5  million  households  worldwide became  eligible  for  fiber  to  the  home  (FTTH)  at  year-end  2021 (+19.7% over one year) with an acceleration of the rollout in France, where Orange reached 6 million customers on the fiber network in January 2022. With 70% of its territory covered, largely thanks to Orange, France is the country with the highest fiber connections in Europe. Orange continues to optimize its copper network in France while  supporting all network users in their transition to fiber.\n\nWhether through its  own  infrastructure  or  the  use  of  third-party networks,  Orange  is  the  European  leader  on  fiber  and  aims  to market its FTTH offers in more than 65 million homes in Europe by 2023.\n\nOn the Mobile segment, 5G has been launched in six European countries:  France,  Spain,  Poland,  Romania,  Luxembourg  and Slovakia, and is scheduled for launch in the MEA region in Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, Senegal and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. The Group develops its new uses through its nine Orange 5G Labs: Seven in France and two abroad. (https://5glab.orange.com/fr/).\n\nAt the end of 2021, Orange was ranked by Arcep as the best mobile network in mainland France for the 11th consecutive year on all networks (4G, 5G, speed of receipt of text messages and web page display).\n\nLastly, the Group is intensifying its investments to develop national and  international  networks  and  extract  value  from  them  on  the wholesale market. In October, Orange's International Carriers was voted as the \u00abBest Wholesale Operator\u00bb at the World Communication Awards 2021 in London, for having the most extensive solutions\n\ncatalog on the market, capable of fully addressing the needs of its operator and content provider customers.\n\nIn  Africa,  Orange  continues  to  invest  massively  in  international connectivity projects with more than 40 undersea cables worldwide, including the 2Africa consortium, the AMITIE transatlantic cable, PEACE and Djoliba which connects  eight West African countries. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\nThe Group strengthened its digital infrastructures with partners: in October, Orange signed a network sharing partnership for the entire  African  continent  with Liquid Intelligent Technologies,  the leading pan-African digital infrastructure provider with a network of 100,000 km; and launched with Oracle a project to speed up Cloud-based digital  transformation  in  West  Africa  (local  hosting of  client  data  in  Senegal  and  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  joint  promotion  of health solutions, etc.). It continued the digital coverage of isolated communities throughout the MEA region: At end-2021, 17 of the 18 countries were covered by 4G, 6,000 mobile sites powered by solar energy provide rural coverage and 98,000 solar kits provide access to energy for individuals in nine countries.\n\n## More open and better valued network infrastructures thanks to the operational launch of its FiberCo and TowerCo solutions\n\nAnnounced  in  January  2021  in  France,  Orange  Concessions is  now  up  and  running.  It  brings  together  24  Public  Initiative Networks (R\u00e9seaux d'Initiative Publique),  governed  by  contracts with  local  authorities,  ultimately  representing  nearly  4.5  million fiber connections, which makes Orange Concessions the leading infrastructure  operator  in  French  rural  areas.  This  new  company was valued at 2.7 billion euros, confirming the value of Orange's investments  and  the  relevance  of  its  strategy  in  optical  fiber.  In Poland, Orange also launched its FiberCo, by signing an agreement with APG in April 2021 to roll out 1.7 million FTTH connections. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\nTOTEM, Orange's European TowerCo launched in February 2021 in France and in Spain, has become a first-class European passive mobile infrastructure platform. The Group seeks to make TOTEM a European leader on the TowerCos market and to keep this strategic asset  in  a  long-term  industrial  perspective.  See  Section  1.3 Significant events.\n\nLastly,  the  group  has  consolidated  its  convergence  leadership in  Europe  through  two  acquisitions:  a  54%  stake  in  the  second fixed  operator  in  Romania,  Telekom  Romania  Communications, completed  in  September  and  a  75%  stake  in  VOO  in  Belgium, holder of the cable network in Wallonia and Brussels, signed in December. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\n## Accelerating its development in three growth areas: Africa and the Middle East, B2B services and financial services, that differentiate it from its competitors\n\n## Making Orange the benchmark digital operator in Africa and the Middle East\n\nOrange is one of the few businesses that made the strategic choice of  Africa  and  the  Middle  East  more  than  20  years  ago.  With  its operational headquarters based in Casablanca, Morocco, Orange MEA is now one of the Group's main growth engines. The African continent, with a population of 1.5 billion people, is booming and has a strong potential  for  innovation  thanks  to  its  large  youthful population, who will be the users of tomorrow's digital services. Orange has 135 million customers in 16 consolidated countries in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nI n the MEA region, the Group primarily relies on the growth of mobile data driven by the increase in the penetration rate of smartphones, 4G and soon 5G and fiber rollouts  in  densely  populated  areas, and network sharing agreements or adapted solutions to extend its  coverage  in  rural  areas.  Despite  the  increasingly  intense competition, particularly on Orange Money, in 2021, Orange Middle\n\nO\n\n- 1\n\n1",

The aim is for these services to account for 20% of MEA revenue by 2025.\n\n## Accelerating the development of IT services for B2B customers and scaling up cybersecurity\n\nWith  the  inherent  opportunities  that  it  conveys,  the  digital transformation  of  businesses  was  further  strengthened  in  2021. Businesses are implementing end-to-end digitalization (cooperation with providers, internal processes and customer experience) and migrating their IT environment to the Cloud to become more agile and reduce costs. Orange supports them in this transformation through  Orange  Business  Services  (OBS)  and  continues  its transition  from  a  B2B  telecommunication  operator  to  a  digital services company.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  maintained  its  leadership  in  connectivity  by focusing on network virtualization (SD WAN), fiber and 5G. At the same time, it continued its development in integration services to give its  customers the benefit of a complete IT ecosystem (data analytics, Cloud services, IoT, etc.) and of course in cybersecurity, where  it  seeks  to  gain  leadership  in  Europe  in  2023  under  the Orange Cyberdefense (OCD) brand.\n\nIn 2025, more than 55% of OBS and OCDs revenues is expected to  be  generated  by  digital,  IT  services  and  new  connectivity services  (5G  private  networks  in  particular  in  the  4.0  industry, software-defined  wide-area  networks  -  SD-WAN),  compared  to 43% at the end of 2021 (including 41% for IT & integration services alone).\n\nIn the shorter term, the accelerated transition from historical highmargin activities to our new growth drivers is impacting profitability. In this context, EBITDAaL 2022 is still expected to be slightly down and  the  objective  of  OBS'  future  senior  management  will  be  to return to growth from 2023.\n\nUnder  the  Orange  Cyberdefense  (OCD)  brand,  the  Group  has become  a  reference  cybersecurity  player  unparalleled  by  other telecom operators.  With  2,500  experts  in  160  countries  and  32 threat-detection  centers,  OCD  provides  support  to  more  than 8,000 customers worldwide. In September, Orange Cyberdefense obtained the  ANSSI security  Visa  for  its  PRIS  qualification,  one of  the  most  demanding  distinctions  on  the  market  in  terms of  cybersecurity,  as  it  covers  the  company,  its  staff  and  the implementation of missions. In 2021, OCD posted revenues of 838 million euros, up 14% compared to 2020, and aims to exceed 1 billion euros of revenues on an annual basis in Europe by end-2023. The Group seeks double-digit revenue growth for OCD, exceeding that  of  the  market  and  a  medium-term  EBITDAaL  rate  that  is approximately two times higher than that of today.\n\n## Continuing its expansion in financial services across its footprint\n\nThe  Engage  2025  strategic  plan  underscores  Orange's determination to accelerate its growth in financial services.\n\nFour years after its launch, Orange Bank continues its development by capitalizing on the success of bank and telecoms crossed offers (cashback in stores; financing of devices), and its upgrading strategy (marketing of new insurance products, launch of premium bank card). In October 2021 Orange has decided to buy out the shares of its historical partner Groupama and is now a 100% shareholder in Orange Bank. In addition, a capital increase of 230 million euros gives Orange Bank the means to accelerate its growth projects. With  1.7  million  customers  in  France  and  in  Spain  at  end-2021, Orange Bank currently ranks among the top five online banks in France. Almost all of its  new  customers in France sign up for a paying offer, while online banks mostly maintain a free offer model.\n\nThrough Orange Money, Orange is a key player in ensuring financial inclusion in Africa and in the Middle East for customers without access to a bank. With Orange Bank Africa, the Group seeks to capitalize on the success of Orange Money in countries with limited access to a bank where demand is very strong. Launched in July 2020 in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Orange Bank Africa proposes pico-credit and insurance offers. At end-2021, the bank had 0.7 million customers and had granted over one million loans totaling FCFA 52 billion.\n\nGiven its evolution towards a strategy focused primarily on value, Mobile Financial Services is now fully mobilized to reach break-even in terms of EBITDAaL by the end of 2024.\n\n## Crossing a new milestone in its digital transformation by placing AI and data at the heart of its innovation model\n\nTo support its growth ambition by 2025, Orange is reinventing itself and adapting to a deeply changing world. The Group resorts to artificial  intelligence  and  data  to  improve  customer  experience, make its networks smarter and the entire business more agile.\n\n## Smarter networks and improved operational efficiency\n\nOrange has expanded the use of AI/Data for smarter networks and better quality of service: optimization of the roll-out of new mobile sites  and  fiber,  maintenance  of  networks,  cost  reduction  and improvement of service quality.\n\nNew  AI/Data  services  are  developing  within  the  Group:  virtual assistants,  predictive  behavioral  analysis  to  better  anticipate customer needs, DataScience4Business offer to raise its knowledge of customers, points of sale and products.\n\n## A reinvented customer experience with artificial intelligence and Data for more customization, prevention, support, security and control.\n\nNew technologies (chatbots, Robotic Process Automation, data targeting)  are  enabling  Orange  to  improve  customer  experience by  combining  the  best  of  digital  and  human  intervention.  The fluidity of the digital channel and the ease of access to the human touch via the network of stores or the customer service generate both  better  customer  satisfaction  and  commercial  efficiency. Text  and  voice  interfaces  are  enhanced  thanks  to  chatbots: 25 million conversations were handled by chatbots in 2021, 65% of which were entirely handled by the chatbot (without any human intervention). This resulted in a 25% reduction in incoming calls to Call Centers in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, My Orange app  had  30  million  users.  18%  of  sales  in Europe are made through the digital channel. The goal is to reach 30% by 2025.\n\nThanks to smoother customer journeys and better customer insight, the Group is aiming to have 9 out of 10 customers recommend Orange in all its countries by 2025. By the end of 2021, this figure reached 8.8 out of 10 customers.",

        "page_content": "## Signing of several strategic partnerships\n\nAfter  signing  a  strategic  partnership  in  July  2020  with  Google Cloud  to  accelerate  Orange's  IT  and  digital  transformation  and develop new cloud services, especially in Edge computing, Orange announced in May 2021 that it had partnered with Capgemini to create  BLEU,  a  new  company  that  will  provide  an  independent 'Cloud de Confiance'. Designed to address the sovereignty needs of the French government, public administrations and businesses with  critical  infrastructures,  this  French  cloud de confiance will operate  under  French  and  European  laws.  In  addition,  Orange participates  in  the  \u00abEuropean  Alliance  For  Industrial  Data,  Edge and  Cloud\u00bb  alliance,  launched  in  July  2021  by  the  European Commission,  which  promotes  the  development  of  the  next generation of European Clouds: secure, interoperable and operated by a European operator.\n\nWith Capgemini, Sanofi and Generali, Orange also announced in June 2021 the creation of a joint venture Future4care, a startup accelerator  program  with  the  ambition  of  developing  rapid e-healthcare solutions.\n\nLastly,  in  March  2021,  Orange  created  its  Data  and  IA  Ethics Council, to strengthen its bond with customers, employees and stakeholders - in connection with its Purpose. This advisory and independent body supports the implementation by the business of the ethical principles governing the use of these technologies.\n\nOrange is currently one of the leading private players involved in digital  research  in  France  and  a  player  engaged  in  upcoming transformations (see section 1.6 Research and development). After the reorganization of its research and innovation activities in 2020, Orange Innovation thus inaugurated in Lannion in September, the Padus Lab to experiment future networks and different energy efficiency technologies: free cooling, solar energy solutions, very high  efficiency  power  supply  architectures;  and  in  Chatillon  in November its Open RAN Integration Center (Open Radio Access Networks),  the  1 st test and integration laboratory in France to accelerate the development of this benchmark technology based on virtualization and automation for future mobile networks.\n\nTo accelerate the development of new 5G services, Orange supports the next immersive technologies revolution aimed at creating new personal and professional uses in entertainment, 4.0 industry, medical research, training, etc. In March 2021, via its Orange Digital Investment holding, the Group invested in the American venture capital  fund,  Venture  Reality  Fund  II,  dedicated  to  immersive technologies and a major player in the XR (eXtended Reality) sector, which  combines  Augmented  Reality,  Virtual  and  Mixed  Reality. Furthermore,  in  May  and  December  2021,  respectively,  Orange launched  the  Orange  Ventures  Impact  investment  vehicle  and created the Orange Nature fund (see section 1.3 Significant events).\n\n## Co-creating a future-facing company\n\nFor Orange, this entails meeting the skills challenge in the continuity of its 'digital and human' employer promise, by supporting all its employees as best as possible and by enhancing the company's attractiveness.\n\nThe company continues its shift by becoming more international and  more  geared  toward  B2B  and  new  technologies.  After establishing  the  operational  head  office  of  Orange  MEA  in Casablanca (Morocco) in 2020, the Group unveiled Bridge, its new\n\nheadquarters in Issy-les-Moulineaux, in  September 2021, which houses 3,000 corporate and operational employees.\n\nTo strike a balance between generations and functions inside the company, and to cope with the evolution of its economic model, Orange signed on December 17 in France a new intergenerational agreement for the 2022-2024 period with three union organizations, which combines measures to promote youth insertion and support for  employees  in  the  middle  or  at  the  end  of  their  careers  (see section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nThe  Group  has  invested  over  1.5  billion  euros  in  an  ambitious upskilling and professional retraining plan, open to all employees. It  seeks  to  help  its  employees  develop  their  soft  as  well  as technological (Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud, Cybersecurity) skills.  In  May  2021,  the  first  class  of  cybersecurity  engineers graduated from the Orange Cybersecurity Campus in France. The class was made up of Group's employees and young people on work/study  programs,  via  a  distance  learning  structure  (CNAM) while still working in their operational entity.\n\nThe  Group's  challenge  to  rank  among  the  most  attractive employers is reinforced by the scarcity of tech profiles on the job market. In 2021, Orange was ranked in France 8th in the Universum study conducted with IT students and 7th among experienced IT engineers. The Group is also in 7th position in the new Universum CSR ranking of the CAC 40 groups \u00abthe most committed according to  the  Master's  degree level students\u00bb and 4th according to the students of the Grandes Ecoles (January 2022). Finally, it is N\u00b01 in the LinkedIn Top Companies 2021 ranking of the 25 companies offering the best career prospects in France.\n\nIn the new context of the health crisis, the Group has facilitated the use of telework and continues to implement in-house actions to ensure inclusion and quality of life at work. Furthermore, Orange is a reference company with respect to professional gender equality: women account for 35,9% of the Group's overall workforce, and 31,6%  of  the  network  of  managers  and  senior  executives  are women. In France, Orange employs 4,400 people with disabilities, who are supported from their integration into the company to the accessibility of their work environment.\n\nLastly, Orange aims to ensure long-term employee engagement in  the  Group's  development  and  the  success  of  its  strategy. In November 2021, 64,000 employees in 37 countries enrolled in Together  2021,  the  Group  employee  shareholding  program  (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\n## A growth ambition accompanied by an operational efficiency program\n\nAt the launch of the Engage 2025 plan at the end of 2019, the Group committed to achieving net savings of one billion euros between 2019  and  2023  on  a  defined  scope  of  indirect  costs  of  nearly 14 billion euros.\n\nThe Scale Up operational efficiency program is based on a portfolio of  some  twenty  initiatives  to  support  the  operating  entities  in achieving  their  objectives,  grouped  into  four  main  categories: industrial  choices,  pooling  of  resources,  changes  in  working methods and expenses optimization.\n\nBy the end of 2021, cumulative net savings of more than 300 million euros  were  achieved  within  the  defined  scope  compared  with end-2019 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nO\n\n- 1\n\n1",

The Orange Board of Directors met on January 28, 2022 and appointed Christel Heydemann as the Chief Executive Officer of Orange as from April 4, 2022. For more information, see Chapter 5 Corporate governance.\n\n## Optimization, development and enhancement of FTTH and mobile infrastructures\n\nTo reinvent its operator model in the context of the Engage 2025 strategic  plan,  Orange  seeks  to  optimize,  develop  and  further enhance its infrastructures, while keeping control over its strategic assets.\n\n## Disposal of 50% of Orange Concessions (FiberCo in France)\n\nAnnounced  in  January  2021,  Orange  Concessions,  the  new FiberCo in France, has been operational since November 2021.\n\nOn November 3, 2021, after obtaining the necessary agreements, Orange group transferred 50% of the capital of Orange Concessions to the consortium made up of La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations), CNP Assurances and EDF Invest for a cash inflow of 758 million euros (net of tax and cash transferred) on the basis of an enterprise value of 2,675 million euros for 100% of the capital. The profit recognized in 2021 as a gain on disposal amounted to 2,124 million euros. The transaction also includes a call option for the acquisition of an additional 1%, exercisable by Orange during the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 through 2027 (see Notes 3.2, 11 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nOrange Concessions brings together 24 Public Initiative Networks (R\u00e9seaux d'Initiative Publique)  governed  by  contracts  with  local authorities, in mainland France and in French overseas territories, ultimately representing nearly 4.5 million FTTH connections built or  to  be  built,  which  makes  Orange  Concessions  the  leading infrastructure operator in French rural areas.\n\nAssisting local authorities in the digital planning of their territory, Orange  Concessions  oversees  the  design,  construction  and operation of fiber networks by relying on Orange as the leading industrial  partner  and  handles  the  marketing  to  all  commercial operators  (ISP)  in  order  to  offer  fiber  to  their  end  customers.  In accordance with the ambitions of the Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange Concessions continues to roll  out  fiber  in  rural  areas  in France while sharing the investment effort with its shareholders, La Banque des Territoires, CNP Assurances and EDF lnvest.\n\nAs a result of this disposal, Orange Concessions is jointly controlled by Orange and by the consortium (each holding 50% ownership). Due to the loss of exclusive control of this entity by Orange, Orange Concessions  has  been  recognized  as  an  equity  affiliate  in  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of  the  Orange  group  since November 3, 2021.\n\n## Disposal of 50% of \u015awiat\u0142ow\u00f3d Inwestycje (FiberCo in Poland)\n\nOn August  31,  2021,  Orange  Polska  transferred  50%  of  capital from  its  \u015awiat\u0142ow\u00f3d  Inwestycje  (the  Polish FiberCo)  to  the  APG\n\ngroup for a cash inflow, in 2021, of 132 million euros (net of tax and  transferred  cash)  on  the  basis  of  an  enterprise  value  of approximately 600 million euros for 100% of the capital. The profit recognized in 2021 as a gain on disposal amounted to 340 million euros. The transaction also includes a call option for approximately 1% of the additional holding in \u015awiat\u0142ow\u00f3d Inwestycje, exercisable by Orange Polska in fiscal years 2027 through 2029 (see Notes 3.2, 11 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe Polish FiberCo brings fiber to areas where demand has not been satisfied and there is little or no competition. Orange is mostly in charge of the construction and maintenance of existing lines as well as an additional 1.7 million FTTH connections that will be built in the next five years, in total representing approximately 2.4 million lines. In this context, the Polish FiberCo was granted a credit facility of 3.1 billion Polish zlotys to finance its fiber deployment plan.\n\nFollowing this disposal, \u015awiat\u0142ow\u00f3d Inwestycje is 50% owned by Orange Polska and 50% owned by the APG group which jointly control this entity. Due to the loss of exclusive control of this entity by Orange, the Polish FiberCo has been recognized as an equity affiliate in the Consolidated Financial Statements of Orange since August 31, 2021.\n\n## Operational launch of TOTEM (TowerCo in Europe)\n\nAnnounced  in  February  2021,  TOTEM,  the  European  TowerCo that  is  100%  owned  by  Orange  has  been  operational  since end-2021.  Orange  has  transferred  to  TOTEM  all  the  key  assets of its passive mobile infrastructure (sites, land, leases and rental agreements to third parties) in France and Spain. The creation of this independently managed entity allows Orange to strengthen its position as a manager and operator of passive mobile infrastructure and to benefit from new growth drivers.\n\nTOTEM  seeks  to  become  a  European  leader  on  the  TowerCo market  (i)  by  operating  first-class  passive  mobile  infrastructure assets, (ii) by focusing on revenue growth and the optimization of operational efficiency, and (iii) by fostering both organic and external growth.\n\nAt the end of 2021, TOTEM's passive mobile infrastructure portfolio thus  included  more  than  26,000  sites  in  France  and  Spain,  the two largest countries in which Orange operates. TOTEM France manages 18,500 macro-sites comprised of 58% of masts, 30% of flat rooftops and 12% of other installations. TOTEM Spain manages 7,900  macro-sites,  equally  distributed  between  masts  and  flat rooftops. After France and Spain, TOTEM will study the possibility of integrating the Orange group's other European passive mobile infrastructure assets that could create value.\n\nDue  to  the  entry  into  the  operational  phase  of  TOTEM,  the presentation of segment information will change from 2022 (see Note 1.10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Telecommunication networks\n\n## Fixed access networks\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  Engage  2025  strategic  plan,  Orange announced at end-2019 its ambition to market its FTTH offers in more than 65 million homes in Europe by 2023 (whether through its own infrastructure or the use of third-party networks), in order to confirm its European leadership in fiber.",

        "page_content": "In  accordance  with  this  objective,  Orange  continued  to  steadily roll  out  its  optical  fiber  network  in  2021.  As  such,  the  Group connected 9.3 million additional homes to FTTH year-on-year and had 56.5 million households connectable to FTTH worldwide at December 31, 2021, up 19.7% year on year, including 28.8 million in France, 15.7 million in Spain, 9.7 million in Other European countries and 2.4 million in Africa & Middle East. France is the country with the highest fiber connections in Europe, with 70% of France covered, largely thanks to Orange. The Group thus deployed fiber for 63% of the 29 million premises connectable to FTTH in France, using its own funds or in partnership with local authorities.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, a total number of 57.5 million households were  connectable  to  all  very  high-speed  broadband  networks combined (i.e. FTTH and cabled networks).\n\nFurthermore,  every  year,  Orange  devotes  significant  resources to maintaining its copper network in France in spite of the fall in the number of customers who are switching to the fiber network. In May 2021, the Group announced the launch of an action plan with the aim of improving the quality of the entire copper network. Orange also undertakes to maintain in its catalog until 2023 the offers that were part of the universal service until the end of 2020.\n\n## Mobile access networks\n\nIn  November  2021,  the  results  of  the  Arcep  annual  survey  on the  quality  of  the  mobile  services  of  French  telecom  operators, confirmed for the 11th consecutive year that Orange has the best mobile network in mainland France (i.e. excluding French overseas territories). Orange remains the leader for the quality of its mobile services, being ranked 1st or joint 1st on 366 of the 403 criteria measured.  This  leadership  is  the  result  of  intensive  investment by Orange in all networks. The study also highlights the fact that Orange specifically offers the best speeds to users equipped with 5G-capable  cell  phones  and  phone  plans.  This  1st  place  was obtained thanks to the strategic choice of Orange to prioritize 5G performance by mostly deploying 3.5 GHz antennas.\n\nDuring  2021,  the  Group  continued  to  roll  out  its  5G  network  in France and internationally. In France, Orange started to roll out the 5G network in Paris and in Le Havre in March 2021. As of early January 2022, Orange had 1,000 municipalities with 5G coverage in France. Internationally, Orange also launched the roll-out of the 5G network in Slovakia in the first half of 2021, following the acquisition of the required frequencies in 2020. In Spain, Orange acquired new 5G licenses in 2021 for a total amount of 611 million euros, thus consolidating its position as the operator with the largest quantity of  spectrum in the two priority bands for the deployment of 5G technology.\n\nFurthermore, in 2021 Orange opened nine Orange 5G Labs, seven of which are in France, one in Romania and the other in Belgium. The Orange 5G Lab is a system that seeks to help economic players to better understand the opportunities, value and usefulness of 5G. These players can test their current solutions in the Lab and think about new uses while benefiting from Orange's technical expertise and an ecosystem to innovate.\n\nIn  June  2021,  following  the  technical  incident  that  affected  the routing  of  some  calls  to  emergency  numbers  in  France,  the French national agency for IT systems security (Agence nationale de la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 des syst\u00e8mes d'information - ANSSI) was tasked with verifying the security and integrity of Orange's network and services. ANSSI published its findings in a report on July 19, 2021. Meanwhile,  in  June  2021  Orange  presented  the  first  findings  of the  internal  investigation  commissioned  to  identify  the  specific causes of the incident and the lessons to be learned from it. The investigation recognized the immediate involvement and the strong mobilization of technical players as soon as the first disruptions occurred and the collaboration with the authorities to restore normal operations. It nevertheless noted the need to improve the speed at\n\nwhich information had been shared with the different stakeholders in the crisis, i.e. the public authorities, the emergency services and the media. This rare event underlined the crucial and essential role played by the networks.\n\n## Transmission networks\n\nTo support the increasing uses of its fixed, mobile, business and wholesale customers, Orange regularly increases the capacity of its domestic and international transmission networks (both land and submarine).\n\nIn  2021,  the  2Africa  consortium,  of  which  Orange  is  a  member, announced the extension of the 2Africa cable to several African regions (Seychelles, Comores, Angola, southern Nigeria, Canary Islands),  then  to  the  Persian  Gulf,  India  and  Pakistan  with  the 2Africa PEARLS segment. The latter extension will raise the total length of the 2Africa cable system to more than 45,000 kilometers, which makes it the longest submarine cable system ever deployed. 2Africa will provide a faster and more reliable Internet connection to each country served.\n\nIn September 2021, Orange announced the landing of AMITIE near Bordeaux in France, the new transatlantic submarine cable of which it  is  a partner. This is a next-generation cable. It is scheduled for commissioning in early 2022. The 6,800 kilometer-long cable will provide  a  connection  between  the  US  State  of  Massachusetts, France and England. In October 2021, Orange also announced the landing in  Marseilles  of  the  PEACE  submarine cable. This cable will  connect  Europe  to  Asia  through  East  Africa.  It  is  scheduled for  commissioning  in  2022.  Lastly,  in  February  2022,  Orange announced its participation in the SEA-ME-WE 6 (Southeast AsiaMiddle East-Western Europe 6) consortium, for the construction of an 'express' submarine system which will directly connect France, from Marseilles, to Singapore.\n\n## Mobile Financial Services\n\n## Capital increase and acquisition of 21.7% of Orange Bank\n\nOn  September  30,  2021,  Orange  entered  into  an  agreement with Groupama to acquire the 21.7% stake held by Groupama in Orange Bank. Groupama will remain a major commercial partner by extending up to 2028 the exclusive agreement granted to Orange Bank on retail banking and consumer credit. This acquisition does not change the nature of the control that Orange holds on Orange Bank and its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, Orange owned 100% of Orange Bank.\n\nFurthermore, in order to strengthen the development of Orange Bank and accelerate its ongoing growth projects, Orange subscribed to a capital increase of 300 million euros of Orange Bank in 2021 (see Note 1.8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Acquisition of Anytime and partnership with Younited\n\nIn  January  2021,  Orange  Bank  announced  the  acquisition  of Anytime, a neobank dedicated to independent professionals and small businesses. This acquisition allows Orange to offer financial support and digital management tools to its millions of customers who are independent professionals. In addition, in order to offer its loans to the largest number of customers possible, in June 2021 Orange Bank signed a partnership with Younited to accelerate its presence on the consumer credit market. This agreement allows Orange  Bank  to  benefit  from  the  experience  of  a  recognized player, to improve customer experience (with simplified and shorter processes), and to monitor loans and propose its personal loan offering to a larger customer base.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Mobile Financial Services had 1.7 million customers in France and Spain (including nearly 1.4 million individual customers  and  more  than  350,000  independent  professional customers or businesses) and 0.7 million customers in Africa.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\n## Orange, a people-oriented digital employer\n\n## New intergenerational agreement for the 2022 to 2024 period\n\nIn  December  2021,  Orange  signed  a  new  intergenerational agreement with three union organizations in France covering the 2022 to 2024 period, proposing measures to help young people find employment, as well as support for employees in the middle or at the end of their careers. In line with the trajectories of the Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange undertakes to hire at least 8,000 people on permanent contracts in France for the 2022 to 2024 period. The Group also proposes an attractive new arrangement, the French part-time for seniors plans ('Temps Partiel S\u00e9niors'- TPS) open to employees in 2022 to allow them to rearrange their working time over a period of 18 to 60 months prior to their retirement.\n\nThe  expense  related  to  the  new  intergenerational  agreement, recognized  in  specific  labor  expenses  in  the  consolidated income statement,  amounted  to  1,225  million  euros  in  2021.  At December  31,  2021,  the  Group  estimates  that  approximately 11,900 employees are currently benefiting from or will eventually benefit from the different TPS arrangements (see Note 6.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThis new intergenerational agreement illustrates the ability of Orange to come up with innovative solutions for its employees in order to address the major challenges faced by the Group. Orange intends to address these challenges while dealing with the changes in its economic model and continuing its investment in next-generation networks.\n\n## Employee shareholding program Together 2021\n\nIn  September  2021,  Orange  launched  an  Employee  Offering, Together  2021,  for  approximately  1%  of  the  capital.  The  aim  of this  operation  is  to  ensure  long-term  employee  engagement  in the  Group's  development  and  the  success  of  the  Engage  2025 strategic  plan,  while  also  strengthening  employee  shareholding, which is a stabilizing factor in the company's governance.\n\nThe offer covered a maximum of 260 million euros of subscriptions, including  an  employer's  contribution  (expressed  in  reference price before discount). It was carried out through the disposal of existing shares previously repurchased by Orange under its share Buyback program. 64,000 employees in 37 countries subscribed to the offer. Thanks to this wide participation, 7.38% of Orange's capital was held by employee shareholders at December 31, 2021. Ultimately, Orange seeks to reach 10% of employee shareholding. The expense recognized as share-based compensation amounted to  172  million  euros  for  fiscal  year  2021  (see  Note  6.3  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe  employee  shareholding  program  Together  2021  follows  the receipt  by  Orange  at  end-2020  of  a  2.2  billion  euro  tax  income related to the favorable decision of the French Council of State in the settlement of a tax dispute in France for fiscal years 2005 to 2006 (see Note 10.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Social and environmental accountability\n\nDuring 2021, Orange took a series of initiatives in line with its social and environmental policy that guides its commitment under the Engage 2025 strategic plan. The main purpose of these initiatives is  to  ensure that the Group is able to meet 50% of its electricity requirements from renewable sources in 2025 and to achieve 'Net Zero Carbon' at Group level by 2040.\n\n## Increased use of renewable energy\n\nIn  February 2021, Orange partnered with ENGIE to implement a comprehensive renewable energy supply solution in France. The 15-year electrical power purchase agreement signed by Orange and ENGIE will enable the development of two new solar projects totaling  51  Megawatt-peak  (MWp).  In  March  2021,  Orange  also\n\nsigned  a  renewable  electrical  power  purchase  agreement  with TotalEnergies  for  the  supply  of  100  GigaWattHours  per  year, renewable over a period of 20 years. By 2024, TotalEnergies will develop ten or more solar plants distributed throughout France to address this demand.\n\nNumerous sites in the Africa & Middle East region are not connected to the mains power grid or suffer from insufficient grid quality, and are therefore sometimes forced to use fuel-oil powered generators. I n May 2021, Orange announced that it was the leader in the number of solar panels deployed in five Africa & Middle East countries, with 5,400 telecom sites equipped with solar panels, leading to annual savings of 55 million liters of fuel oil.\n\n## Launch of Orange Nature (carbon fund)\n\nIn  December  2021,  Orange  announced  the  creation  of  Orange Nature, an innovative carbon fund intended to finance reforestation projects and the restoration of natural ecosystems. The fund will invest  in  different  carbon  sequestration  projects  worldwide  (in the  form  of  either  mangroves  or  agroforestry  projects).  Special i mportance will be given to the economic and social development of the territories and populations concerned by the projects, as well as their positive impacts on biodiversity. Orange will be remunerated solely by the high-quality carbon credits generated by the financed projects. Orange Nature is endowed with an investment capacity of  50  million  euros  and  will  produce  sufficient  carbon  credits to capture a significant portion of the residual carbon emissions produced by the Group by 2040.\n\nOrange has already deployed several carbon sinks: reforestation of pine forests in Spain, mangrove plantations in Senegal and the  acquisition  of  a  stake  in  Livelihoods  Carbon  Fund  3.  In October 2021, Orange signed an agreement with Alliance For\u00eats Bois to finance reforestation projects of approximately 175 hectares of forests in France.\n\n## Launch of Orange Venture Impact (investment vehicle)\n\nIn May 2021, Orange announced the launch of Orange Ventures Impact,  a  30  million  euros  investment  vehicle  dedicated  to  the financing  of  socially  committed  start-ups.  Such  start-ups  are expected  to  contribute  to  the  emergence  of  new  responsible economic  models  with  a  positive  impact  on  the  environment, social  inclusion  or  CareTech.  Orange  Ventures  Impact  is  part  of the Engage 2025 strategic plan and enhances the overall strategy of Orange Ventures, the Orange venture capital subsidiary which manages 350 million euros of funds, 30 million euros of which will therefore be allocated to this new vehicle.\n\n## Progress of the Scale Up operational efficiency program\n\nTo  ensure  that  it  achieves  its  financial  objectives,  in  late  2019, Orange committed to net savings of 1 billion euros by 2023 on a defined scope of indirect costs of 13.8 billion euros at end-2019. These correspond to the Group's indirect costs (i) excluding Africa &  Middle  East  and  Mobile  Financial  Services,  and  (ii)  excluding labor expenses and other network expenses and IT expenses of Enterprise IT & integration services. To that end, Orange launched the Scale Up operational efficiency program.\n\nCumulatively over fiscal years 2020 and 2021, more than 300 million euros of net savings were achieved on this scope of costs compared with  end-2019.  The  savings  mainly  stem  from  the  structural reduction in the number of employees and the transformation of ways  of  working  accelerated  by  the  health  crisis,  with  positive impacts on our cost base.\n\nAgainst a background of inflation and strong pressure on energy prices,  the  Group  seeks  to  achieve,  on  this  scope  of  costs, cumulative  net  savings  of  approximately  600  million  euros  by end-2022,  a  step  toward  reaching  its  goal  of  1  billion  euros  by end-2023.",

The Romanian State continues to hold 46% of the remaining capital (see Note 3.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThanks to this acquisition, Orange, the country's leading mobile operator, will rely on the strength of TKR's fixed network and on its subscriber base to create a fully convergent operator.\n\n## Acquisition of 23.94% of Orange Belgium (conditional voluntary takeover bid)\n\nIn the first half of 2021, Orange launched a conditional voluntary takeover  bid  for  46.97%  of  the  capital  of  Orange  Belgium, corresponding  to  the  remaining  shares  not  held  directly  and i ndirectly. As a result of the offer, Orange SA acquired 23.94% of the share capital of Orange Belgium and owned directly and indirectly, 76.97% of the share capital of Orange Belgium. The total acquisition cost  of  these  shares  amounts  to  316  million  euros.  This  share Buyback offer does not change the Orange group's pre-existing control of Orange Belgium and its subsidiaries (see Note 3.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## 1.4 Operating  activities\n\nOrange provides consumers, businesses and other telecommunication  operators  with  a  wide  range  of  services including fixed and mobile telecommunications, data transmission and other value-added services, including mobile financial services. The Group is present as an operator in 26 countries. In addition to its role as a supplier of connectivity, the Group provides business services, primarily solutions in the fields of digital work, security and improving business line processes.\n\nFor consistency with the segment information in the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group's activities are presented below by  operating  segment:  France,  Europe,  Africa  and  Middle  East, Enterprise, International Carriers & Shared Services, and Mobile Financial  Services.  Following  the  implementation  of  the  Group Executive Committee's new organization on September 1, 2020,\n\n## 1.4.1 France\n\nOrange  is  France's  incumbent  telecommunication  operator (see Section 1.1.3 History). The bulk of its business is carried by Orange SA, which is also the parent company of the Orange group.\n\nThe  France  business  segment  includes  all  fixed  and  mobile communication services to consumers and companies with fewer\n\nThis  operation  henceforth  equips  the  Group  with  the  means  to improve  the  financial  flexibility  of  Orange  Belgium,  to  deploy  its l ong-term value creation strategy more effectively and to improve its ability to address the major transformations of the Belgian market.\n\n## Agreement by Orange Belgium to acquire approximately 75% of VOO\n\nOn  December  24,  2021,  Orange  Belgium  signed  an  agreement with Nethys to acquire 75% of the capital minus one share of cable operator VOO on the basis of an enterprise value of 1.8 billion euros for 100% of the capital. Present in the Wallonia region and in part of the Brussels region, VOO offers a portfolio of fixed and mobile telephony, very high-speed Internet and television services. The acquisition of VOO will provide Orange Belgium with access to a very  high-speed  network  in  Wallonia  and  parts  of  Brussels  and enable it to consolidate the deployment of its convergent strategy throughout Belgium.\n\nCompletion of the transaction is subject to the customary conditions precedent, including  the  approval  of  the  European  Commission expected  in  2022  (see  Note  3.2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements).\n\n## Acquisition of 21.7% of Orange Bank\n\nConcerning the acquisition of 21.7% of Orange Bank, see Mobile Financial Services above.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill in Spain\n\nIn Spain, the business plan has been significantly revised downward since December 31, 2020, in view of (i) a deteriorating competitive environment  despite  market  consolidation  operations  (affected by the erosion of average revenue per user) and (ii) uncertainties surrounding  the  continuation  of  the  health  crisis  (delay  in  the forecasts for economic recovery).\n\nThe revision of the business plan in Spain has led to the recognition during  the  first  semester  of  3,702  million  euros  impairment  of goodwill (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nSpain  has  joined  the  Europe  aggregate  and  the  Orange  Bank business segment has been renamed Mobile Financial Services to take into account the gradual integration of new activities into that segment (see Section 3.3, Note 1.9 Definition of business segments and performance indicators).\n\nThe results of Orange's activities in 2021 and its principal operating indicators in its various business segments are set out in Section 3.1 Review of the Group's financial position and results.

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nIn  2021,  the  France  business  segment  generated  41.1%  of  the Group's consolidated revenue.\n\n## The market\n\nAfter a year in 2020 that was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis,  the  revenues  of  telecoms  operators  regained  momentum after ten years of decline. In the first half of 2021, revenues were up 3% on an annual basis (Source: Arcep, Q3 2021).\n\nWhile  fixed  narrowband  telephony  revenues  continued  their downward trend as a result of the steady decline in the number of  copper  network  lines,  fixed  broadband  telephony  revenues continued to grow due to the increasing number of accesses. This growth was driven by the rapid development of Fiber To The Home (FTTH). At the end of Q3 2021, 13.4 million accesses were active on the fiber network, which represents growth of 4.2 million year on year (Source: Arcep, Q3 2021).\n\nRevenues from mobile services on the retail market also rose by 5% between the second half of 2020 and the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe French broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet market is  dominated by four main operators, which account for 96,5%  of  broadband  customers.  Orange  maintained  its  market share in 2021 (39.8% in Q3 2021 versus 39.9% in Q3 2020) and remains the leader on this market ahead of Free, Altice-SFR and Bouygues Telecom (ranked second, third and fourth, respectively, by number of customers) (1) .\n\nThe French mobile market is dominated by the same four operators as the fixed market, which account for 89% of mobile customers (excluding M2M). With market share of 34.1% in Q3 2021, compared with 34.7% in Q3 2020, Orange also remains the leader on this segment,  ahead  of  competitors  Altice-SFR,  Free  Mobile  and Bouygues Telecom (ranked second, third and fourth, respectively, by number of mobile customers excluding M2M) and all MVNOs (2) .\n\n## Orange's business activities\n\nWith  the  ongoing  Covid-19  health  crisis  throughout  2021, Orange's  priorities  were  the  same  as  in  2020,  to  ensure  the safety of its employees and to support its customers by providing telecommunication services, which have become more essential than ever.\n\nOrange France's core business involves the provision of fixed-line telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet and mobile telephony services for the B2C and Pro-SME markets. Its strategy is based on improving speeds in fixed (fiber) and mobile networks (4G and 5G), promoting the take-up of new services and conquering  new  areas  of  growth,  while  continuing  to  propel  its customer relations to a new level of excellence (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\n## Mobile\n\nIn  the  B2C  mobile  market,  Orange  segments  its  offers  into  four main ranges covering all customers, from those looking for just the essentials in terms of communications or Internet connectivity to those wanting the best smartphones and who have very intense connectivity uses in France and internationally. In October 2021, the Group overhauled its range of mobile phone plans for customers on the retail market of mainland France. Now, the Orange brand\n\nhas only seven mobile offers, three of which are compatible with 5G technology.\n\nOrange  is  present  on  all  market  segments,  including  on  the entry-level market. In addition to the Orange brand, Orange France also  proposes  under  the  Sosh  brand  several  types  of  mobile subscriptions  at  attractive  prices,  only  available  on  the  Internet, with no commitment and without a terminal device. At the end of December 2021, Sosh had 4.5 million mobile customers.\n\nSince 2015, all the offers sold by Orange are at least 4G compatible, i ncluding market entry-level offers. Since 2020, some of these offers are  also  5G  compatible.  Orange  is  continuing  its  family-focused strategy with the development of multi-line plans through its flagship Open offer. Open mobile offers are available in the same ranges as conventional mobile offers and include the same levels of service.\n\nSegmenting offers on the B2C and Pro-SME markets allows Orange to continue to grow its subscriber base while the decline in prepaid offers  continues.  See  Section  3.1.3.1.5  Additional information France. At the same time, the MVNO customer base hosted on the Orange network increased slightly between 2020 and 2021.\n\n## Fixed telephony and Internet\n\nIn the B2C broadband Internet market, Orange segments its offers into two main categories: Livebox, aimed at customers looking for Internet and TV essentials, and Livebox Up, which meets the needs of those wanting the best speeds and a premium TV experience. In terms of equipment, in October 2019 Orange launched the new Livebox 5, designed to have a lower carbon footprint and vastly improved  speeds  to  meet  customers'  growing  needs,  and  to incorporate the fact that many households share bandwidth.\n\nSosh  has  also  been  present  on  the  broadband  Internet  market since 2018, with affordable offers, available exclusively online and with no commitment.\n\nThe  Orange  and  Sosh  broadband  Internet  access  offers  are marketed using FTTH technology in eligible areas,  or  otherwise ADSL. Orange is the market leader in terms of the number of FTTH accesses sold with a total of more than 5.9 million subscribers at end-2021 over a scope including B2C, professionals and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nWith the steady growth in full unbundling, as well as the wholesale of contracts and naked ADSL access to third-party Internet service providers,  the  decline  in  revenue  generated  by  the  conventional telephony service business continues.\n\nAt the time of presentation of its strategic plan, the Group announced the launch of a first copper decommissioning experimental phase. On  January  31,  2022,  Orange  submitted  its  copper  network switch-off plan to Arcep. Arcep has published the plan for public consultation from February 7 to April 4, 2022. Under the plan, the transition phase which began in 2020 will continue until 2025, when the fiber network will be fully rolled out in France. During this first phase, copper connection sales will be interrupted on a case by case basis insofar as the four telecom operators have deployed fiber up to the base point. In March 2022, sales were discontinued on  15  million  copper  connections.  This  phase  also  includes switch-off experiments on a few hundred thousand premises. From 2026, Orange will no longer sell new ADSL subscriptions and the large-scale switch-off of the copper network will begin. By 2030, it will concern the entire network.",

        "page_content": "Since  November  27,  2020,  Orange  is  no  longer  the  operator responsible for providing universal services including connection to  a  fixed  network  and  telephone  service.  See  Section  1.7.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet.\n\nOrange  also  pursues  advertising  network  activities  through  its websites, which have nearly 28.7 million unique visitors each month (source:  M\u00e9diam\u00e9trie  -  Overall  Internet  Audience  in  France  in November 2021, January 2022).\n\n## Wholesale\n\nFurthermore,  Orange  has  a  wholesale  activity  that  includes  the interconnection  of  competitive  operators,  wholesale  services (ADSL and fiber) regulated by Arcep (see Section 1.7.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet - Price framework for access to the copper local loop) and construction and marketing of very high-speed fiber optic networks.\n\nConcerning  the  unbundling  of  access  to  the  copper  network, revenues from services to operators have declined structurally.\n\nWith respect to the fiber network, it is marketed to rival operators according  to  two  methods:  leasing  or  co-financing  of  lines. Co-financing requires a basic investment for third-party operators, plus recurring maintenance fees. After having increased significantly in  2020,  revenues  from  co-financing  dropped  sharply  in  2021. These  contrasted  trends  show  that  the  timing  of  co-financing payments to be received by Orange is highly dependent on the purchasing strategies of third-party operators in connection with the development of fiber and the investment policies of financing vehicles. According to Orange's estimates, co-financing revenues will be spread mainly until 2025.\n\nLastly,  since  2011,  Orange  has  been  providing  Free  Mobile  with a  nationwide  roaming  service  on  its  2G  and  3G  networks.  That service was extended until the end of 2022 by amendment signed in February 2020. See Section 1.7.2.2 Regulation of mobile telephony - Infrastructure sharing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nSince 2020 and the Covid-19 health crisis, the sales channel mix has been deeply disrupted.\n\nOrange  France  is  pressing  ahead  with  its  digital  development strategy, with a fully digital customer experience in Orange online stores (available  on  Orange.fr)  and  Sosh  (via  Sosh.fr),  with  Sosh offers only available on the digital channel. In 2021, the number of sales made through the digital channel rose by 23% compared to 2019 (pre-crisis year) and 2% compared to 2020, and represent one  third  of  the  total  number  of  sales.  My Orange,  the  Orange contract management mobile app, continues to attract new users. The  application  shows  a  monthly  average  of  3.64  million  single visitors per month (compared to 3.59 million in 2020).\n\nThe dedicated customer call centers, based on the type of services marketed,  account  for  22%  of  sales.  Their  number  is  up  8% compared to 2019 and 5% compared to 2020.\n\n## 1.4.2 Europe\n\nOutside France, the Group operates in seven countries in Europe, where it is implementing its convergence strategy based on the local context and drawing on the strengths of its subsidiaries:\n\nThe  network  of  retail  stores  spread  across  France  continues  to roll  out the Smart Store concept. At end-2021, this network was comprised of 323 stores owned by Orange (including 304 Smart Stores,  18  of  which  are  megastores)  and  220  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de T\u00e9l\u00e9phone  stores  (including  204  Smart  Stores).  Retail  stores accounted for 38% of sales in 2021. The volume of sales was down 32% compared to 2019 due to the health crisis.\n\nLastly, the number of sales made through other channels, such as direct marketing, door-to-door and the multi-operator network, increased 75% compared to 2019 and 28% compared to 2020. They account for 5.7% of all sales.\n\n## The network\n\nOrange's commercial leadership is built partly on its leadership in fixed and mobile networks.\n\nOrange continued to  roll  out  its  fiber  network  at  a  steady  pace in  2021.  In  France,  the  Group  connected  5.9  million  additional households to FTTH year on year (after 6.6 million in 2020) and had 28.8 million households connectable to FTTH at December 31, 2021,  up  25.8%  year  on  year  (including  through  Orange's  own infrastructure and third-party networks). 57% of homes connected in France are deployed by Orange (source: Arcep, Q3 2021).\n\nIn November 2021, Orange finalized the disposal of 50% of Orange Concessions  to  the  consortium  made  up  of  La  Banque  des Territoires, CNP Assurances and EDF Invest. Orange Concessions brings  together  24  Public  Initiative  Networks  (PIN),  governed  by contracts  with  local  governments,  ultimately  representing  more than  4.5  million  FTTH  connections,  which  makes  it  the  leading infrastructure  operator  in  French  rural  areas  (see  Section  1.3 Significant events).\n\nFor  the  mobile  network,  the  rollout  of  4G  continued,  with  an unchanged coverage rate of 99% of the French population, still the  best  4G  rate  in  the  country  (source:  Orange  estimates).  At January 1, 2022, Orange had deployed 27,337 4G sites in France (1) (source: Observatoire ANFr, January 4, 2022).\n\nFor the eleventh consecutive year, Orange's mobile network was ranked number one by Arcep in 2021 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nIn November 2021, Orange announced the operational launch of TOTEM, its fully owned TowerCo. Orange transferred all the key assets of its passive mobile infrastructure (sites, land, leases and third-party lease agreements) to TOTEM. The creation of TOTEM enables the Group to strengthen its position as a manager and operator of passive mobile infrastructure and to benefit from new growth drivers.\n\nConcerning 5G, the pace of on-site deployments accelerated in 2021. At January 1, 2022, France had 31,650 5G sites authorized by ANFr (versus 18,039 on January 7, 2021), of which 9,185 sites technically  operational  in  3.5Ghz  frequencies.  Orange  operates 2,699 of these sites (Source: Observatoire ANFr, January 4, 2022). Since November 2016, the frequency managers of the European Union Member States have recommended the use of the 3.5 GHz band as the primary band for the introduction of 5G.\n\n- -i n Spain, where the Group is number two in the fixed and mobile markets, and operates a multi-brand strategy;\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Initially operating in the fixed telephony market,  it  acquired  mobile  telephony  operator  Amena  in  2005 before  adopting  the  Orange  brand  in  2006.  The  acquisition  of fixed  telephony  operator  Jazztel  in  2015  enabled  Orange  to consolidate its position in terms of convergence thanks to Jazztel's fiber coverage. The Group also strengthened its presence in the low-cost market with the acquisitions of MVNOs Simyo in 2012 and Rep\u00fablica M\u00f3vil in 2018, thereby continuing a multi-brand strategy designed to cover all market segments. En 2021, Orange Espagne consolidated its brand portfolio to focus on Orange, Jazztel and Simyo.  In  2021,  the  Group  generated  11.0%  of  its  consolidated revenue in Spain.\n\n## The market\n\nSince the consolidation that started in 2014, four operators have dominated the telecom market: Telef\u00f3nica, the incumbent, which acquired  D+  in  2014  and  operates  under  the  Movistar  brand; Orange; Vodafone, which acquired ONO in 2014; and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil Ibercom, initially an MVNO, which acquired Yoigo in 2016 and then signed a commercial agreement for access to Orange's fixed and mobile networks before acquiring Euskaltel in 2021.\n\nIn addition to competing in the B2B and B2C segments through their  main  brands,  these  four  operators  also  compete  via  other brands in  the  low-cost  market:  Orange  with  Jazztel  and  Simyo; Telef\u00f3nica with Tuenti and O2; Vodafone with Lowi; and M\u00e1sM\u00f3vil with Pepephone and Euskaltel.\n\nTogether, the four convergent operators have a combined market share of over 90%, with Telef\u00f3nica ranked first, followed by Orange ( whose market share in October 2021 reached 24.2% for broadband Internet and 23.1% for mobile), then Vodafone (source: CNMC).\n\nIn  2021,  the  Spanish  market,  which  was  in  decline  in  2020, continued this trend due to the health crisis and a highly competitive environment. Development on the Spanish market is marked by a shift towards low-cost offers accompanying the growth of this market segment and the proliferation of new brands.\n\n## Orange's activities in Spain\n\nIn 2021, Orange Espagne set up its 'Back to Growth' transformation plan, to deal with the difficult context of the Spanish market. This plan  is  structured  around  three  key  areas:  focus  on  the  core activities  and  their  implementation,  make  the  entire  business customer-oriented  and  focus  on  'frontline'  relations  and  lastly, simplify Orange offers and processes.\n\nIn the Spanish B2C market, Orange is pursuing a multi-brand and multi-service strategy aimed at offering quality services at the best price, including for entry-level offers. In 2021, Orange fine-tuned its  offers  to  meet  growing  demand  for  data  and  services,  and developed a multi-service approach to differentiate itself from its competitors and create value. Within this strategy, in 2021 Orange:\n\n- -simplified its brands, by finalizing the migration of its Republica Movil customers to Simyo, and Amena to Orange. In this way, Orange Espagne consolidated its brand portfolio focused on Orange (premium), Jazztel (mid-market), and Simyo (entry-level);\n- -transformed its distribution channels into a more efficient and sustainable model, by paying particular attention to the growth of  a  digital  channel,  multi-channel  experience,  and  better segmentation of its brands;\n- -launched a 10Gbits/s (XGSPON technology) fiber offer optic for its B2C customers in five Spanish cities, and improved Wi-Fi customer experience by including WiFi6 in all its Love offers. 5G and XGSPON are key elements for differentiating a premium network;\n- -continued  to  improve  its  operational  efficiency,  through simplification and digitization, in order to improve the customer experience.\n\nOn  the  B2B  market,  Orange  is  implementing  its  transformation plan, by reviewing all customer paths and processes. The Group has rolled out a portfolio of offers that are more affordable, simpler and bring more value to customers, with faster connections and more data, the inclusion of WiFi6 in all tariffs, and the addition of a 10Gbps fiber option. In 2021, Orange launched Orange Digital Empresas, a range of digital  services  to  help  businesses  in  the successful completion of their digital transformation, with solutions for  all  categories  eligible  for  the  'Digital  Kit'  program  launched by the Spanish government. Orange also supported the Spanish 5G plan by participating in the implementation of 5G use cases to  promote  the  digital  transformation  of  the  economy  in  various sectors.\n\nIn line with the Group's strategy, in 2020, Orange Spain was the first operator to launch a subsidized offer known as Tarifa Social de Orange,  the  first  rate  for  convergent  offers  adapted  to  the needs and financial capacity of low-income households in Spain. In 2021, Orange increased the speed including in this price range to 500Mbit/s and set up numerous other digital inclusion initiatives.\n\n## The network\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  continued  to  roll  out  its  fiber  optic  network  by connecting nearly 0.8 million additional households to FTTH over one year. At the end of 2021, Orange was able to offer an FTTH connection to nearly 16 million Spanish households.\n\nNew  agreements  and  the  improvement  of  existing  agreements have  given  Orange  one  of  the  market's  most  efficient  and profitable networks thanks to the optimization of its infrastructure, and prepared it for the launch of 5G on mobile devices, and the deployment of XGSPON technology on fiber which makes it possible to reach 10Gbit/s. At the end of 2021, the company had rolled out 5G in 840 cities, i.e. a coverage of 58.6% of the population, beyond i ts coverage goal of 50%. Concerning 4G, in 2021, Orange Espagne continued to expand its network, reaching coverage of 98% of the population at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2021, Orange launched the TowerCo TOTEM in France and in Spain. Its creation will enable Orange to strengthen its position as a manager and operator of passive mobile infrastructures and benefit from new growth drivers (see Section 1.3 Significant events).",

        "page_content": "## Poland\n\nThe  Group  has  been  present  in  Poland  since  2000,  when  it acquired an interest in the incumbent operator, Telekomunikacja Polska  (renamed  Orange  Polska).  In  2006,  Orange  became  the single brand for mobile activities, in accordance with the Group's brand policy. In 2012, it also became the single brand for all fixed telephony services offered by the Group in Poland. Orange owns 50.67%  of  the  shares  of  Orange  Polska,  which  is  listed  on  the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In 2021, the Group generated 6.1% of its consolidated revenue in Poland.\n\nPoland has four main mobile telephony operators: Orange, T-Mobile (owned by Deutsche Telekom), Polkomtel (operating under the Plus brand, owned by the Cyfrowy Polsat group) and P4 (held by Iliad since  end-2020,  operating  under  the  Play  brand).  At  the  end  of 2021, these four mobile telephony operators accounted for 98% of the total number of SIM cards in Poland, and Orange was the leading operator with market share of 28.8% (1) .\n\nIn the broadband Internet market, Orange ranks first, with market share  of  28.0%  at  end-2021 (2) .  Its  principal  competition  comes from cable TV operators (mainly UPC Polska and Vectra), as well as from Netia (part of the Cyfrowy Polsat group), a conventional telecommunication operator.\n\nThe Polish telecommunication market remains fragmented, despite recent consolidation. The Cyfrowy Polsat group acquired Netia in 2018.  In  2020,  Vectra  acquired  Multimedia  Polska,  creating  the country's leader in the cable market, Play completed the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, Poland's biggest MVNO, and Iliad completed the acquisition of Play.\n\nIn 2021, Play announced the purchase of UPC Polska from Liberty Global. This transaction is subject to the approval of the European Commission.  It  confirms  the  trend  observed  among  a  growing number of operators that have opted to adopt a convergent offer strategy in the B2C market. While these developments underscore the merits of Orange's convergent strategy in Poland, they are likely to boost competition. Furthermore, Play and Cyfrowy Polsat have both sold their mobile infrastructure to Cellnex, which thus enters the Polish TowerCo market: Play by selling 60% of the company that owns its passive infrastructure, and Cyfrowy Polsat by selling both its passive and active infrastructures.\n\nOnce  again,  the  long-awaited  5G  auctions  have  been  delayed as the government continues to work on a cybersecurity law. All operators continued to market 5G on their existing spectrum using dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology; all of them except Plus have included 5G in their premium offers.\n\n## Orange's activities in Poland\n\nIn 2021, Orange Polska announced its new strategic plan, Grow, for the 2021-2024 period. Grow applies a scalable strategy, in line with Orange's previous strategy. Financially, Orange has committed to  faster  and  more  sustainable  growth  marked  by  accelerated EBITDAaL  growth,  with  the  main  engine  being  revenue  growth fueled by commercial activity, rather than the cost control that was the key element of the previous strategy.\n\nConvergence  remains  a  key  growth  driver,  enabling  the  Group to gain and maintain customer trust and loyalty. In 2021, Orange continued to focus its efforts on its Love convergent offer. Love is a package that includes both fixed and mobile services in its basic formula at an affordable price. It can be extended for higher fixed broadband speed, additional SIM cards, enhanced TV content and other value-added services.\n\nThe number of convergent customers continued to rise in 2021, reaching  1.55  million  and  now  accounting  for  67%  of  the  total number of fixed broadband access. This growth was supported by strong sales for the fiber offer, with fiber customers accounting for 34% of the customer base at end-2021, an increase of 7 points compared with 2020. This good performance was driven by strong demand for fixed broadband, as well as the continued rollout of the FTTH network, particularly in small and medium-sized towns and cities, where competition from cable operators is more muted.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  Polska  continued  its  'more  for  more'  business strategy, increasing rates for mobile packages and prepaid offers in the B2C market, and redesigning its convergent offers to make it easier for customers to migrate to abundance offers. The higher rates apply only to new plans, while the terms of existing contracts remain unchanged.\n\nIn  the  B2B  market,  Orange  Polska  continued  to  strengthen  its position as the preferred partner for the digital transformation of its  customers.  IT  and  Integration  Services  continued  to  enjoy robust  growth,  benefiting  from  the  acquisition  of  Craftware  in December 2020 and the organic growth of these activities.\n\nThe number of fixed voice lines continued to decline in 2021, with a net loss of 0.2 million voice customers (conventional PSTN or VoIP) due to structural demographic factors, as well as the growing appeal of mobile telephony services offering unlimited calls across all networks.\n\n## The network\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  Polska  continued  to  roll  out  its  FTTH  network, reaching 5.9 million connectable households by the end of the year, with 3.7 million on its own networks and 2.2 million via partnerships with other operators.\n\nIn August 2021, Orange Polska completed the disposal of 50% of its FiberCo to the APG Group. The joint venture expects to connect approximately 1.7 million Polish households to fiber, mainly in areas without fixed broadband infrastructure (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nWith regard to the 4G network, Orange is responding to strong growth in  traffic  by  increasing  the  spectrum  allocated  to  4G  (to the detriment of that allocated to 2G and 3G) and the number of sites allowing the grouping of spectrum. At end-2021, Orange's 4G network covered 99.9% of the population (3) .\n\n## Belgium & Luxembourg\n\nIn Belgium and Luxembourg, Orange operates via Orange Belgium and its subsidiary Orange Communications Luxembourg. Orange Belgium  is  listed  on  the  Brussels  Stock  Exchange.  Following  a takeover bid, completed on May 4, 2021, the Orange Group now holds 76.97% of the capital of Orange Belgium (see Section 1.3 Significant events). A long-standing player in the mobile segment in  Belgium,  in  2016  Orange  launched  convergent  offers  across the  entire  country  based  on  the  regulation  of  wholesale  access to cable. In 2021, Orange Belgium generated 3.1% of the Group's consolidated revenue.\n\n## Belgium\n\nIn 2021, the telecommunication industry continued to be marked by the Covid-19 health crisis, with the government implementing measures to stem the spread of the pandemic, such as limiting the number of customers in stores, teleworking and other measures throughout  the  year.  As  in  2020,  the  pandemic  impacted  the country's  competitive  environment.  2021  was  characterized  by numerous  promotions,  attractive  subsidies  and  new  product launches.\n\nO\n\n- 1\n\n1",

With a market share of 28.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021, Orange ranks second behind Proximus (1) .\n\nThe competitive structure of the fixed telephony market remained relatively  stable  in  2021,  with  the  predominance  of  incumbent operator Proximus and regional cable operators Telenet and VOO.\n\nThere  were  major  developments  on  the  fixed  market:  Proximus began to roll out a fiber network throughout Belgium, on its own infrastructure and through two joint ventures (Fiberklaar with EQT Infrastructure,  and  Unifiber  with  Eurofiber).  Meanwhile,  Telenet signed a non-binding agreement with Fluvius with the intention of deploying a fiber network in Flanders.\n\nIn December 2021, Orange Belgium announced the signature of an agreement with Nethys to acquire 75% of the capital of VOO SA (less one share). This acquisition would represent major progress in Orange Belgium's national convergent strategy. It will increase investment and competition in the telecommunication sector for the benefit of customers and the competitiveness of the Walloon and Brussels regions (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\n## Orange's activities in Belgium\n\nThroughout  2021,  Orange  continued  its  value  strategy  for  its customers by introducing new offers on the market. In particular, the company:\n\n- -improved its Go Plus offers by raising the included data volume from 8Go to 10Go;\n- -l aunched the 'Orange TV Lite' service, which allows TV viewers to watch up to 20 TV channels on their smartphones, tablets and PCs without a set-top box;\n- -launched hey!, a new 100% digital brand for ultra-connected customers;\n- -transformed GO Unlimited offers into GO Extreme, which now includes 60Go per month.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, Orange Belgium officially inaugurated its first 5G Orange Lab in Antwerp, inviting businesses to discover, test and develop new innovative use cases of the 5G Stand Alone technology network.\n\n## Luxembourg\n\nOrange  started  its  operations  in  Luxembourg  in  2007  via  the acquisition of Voxmobile. The company adopted the Orange brand in 2009.\n\nIn the mobile segment, Orange Communications Luxembourg, with market share of approximately 14%, ranks third behind incumbent operator  Post  Luxembourg,  the  market  leader,  and  Proximus Luxembourg, a subsidiary of Belgian operator Proximus, with its Tango brand (source: ILR, June 2021). Post Luxembourg also has the largest market share in the fixed and Internet market.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  continued  to  adapt  its  portfolio,  in  line  with  its position as challenger, while taking advantage of the 5G launched in  2020,  and  focusing  on  customer  experience,  especially multichannel  via  innovations  such  as  Video  shopping  and  Live shopping.\n\n## Central Europe\n\n## Romania\n\nOrange Romania was founded in 1997 and adopted the Orange brand  in  2002.  A  long-standing  player  in  the  mobile  segment, Orange launched its satellite TV offers in 2013, then its fiber offer in 2016, following a wholesale agreement with Telekom. In 2021, the Group generated 2.9% of its consolidated revenue in Romania.\n\nThe  Romanian  telecommunication  market  is  dominated  by  four operators:  Orange,  Vodafone,  Telekom  (the  incumbent  in  fixed telephony, which also operates in the mobile segment, co-owned by the Romanian government and OTE, itself jointly controlled by Deutsche Telekom and the Greek government) and RCS & RDS (operating under the Digi brand, owned by Digi Communications).\n\nOn September 30, 2021, Orange completed the acquisition of 54% of  Telekom  Romania  Communications  (TKR),  a  fixed  telephony operator (see Section 1.3 Significant events). This transaction gives Orange Romania the means to implement its convergent ambitions in Romania. Relying on the expertise of teams, the pooling of the two telecommunication infrastructures will provide Romanians with future access to a comprehensive offer of fixed, mobile, and TV convergent services.\n\nIn  the  mobile  market,  Orange's  market  share  was  estimated  at 37.7% at the end of the first half of 2021, compared with 38.2% in 2020. Orange maintained its leading position, followed by Vodafone, Telekom and Digi (Source: Ancom, H1 2021).\n\nFollowing the launch of its fixed offers and its own fiber network, Orange's fixed market share continued to grow in 2021, in a market dominated  by  Digi,  followed  by  Telekom,  the  incumbent,  and Vodafone.\n\n## Orange's activities in Romania\n\nIn 2021, Orange Romania focused on the guidelines defined under Engage 2025, the Group's strategic plan, while the second year of the pandemic continued to deeply disrupt the market.\n\nOrange continued to ramp up its 4G operations, the most extensive in  Romania,  with  population  coverage  now  reaching  98.31% nationwide and 99.71% in urban areas (internal estimates).\n\nIn 2021, Orange Romania was once again confirmed as a leader in connectivity following tests carried out by Ookla, including for the performance of its 5G network. A report by Romanian regulator ANCOM, based on user tests, also recognized Orange Romania as the operator with the fastest fixed and mobile network in Romania.\n\nAs  the  Group's  first  country  to  market  5G,  Orange  Romania continued to roll out its 5G network, available in 17 cities by the end of 2021, and continued to innovate, including via the inauguration of the first 5G Lab in Romania, in partnership with the CAMPUS Research  Institute.  In  2021,  Orange  Romania  received  the Innovation Award from CCIFER (French Chamber of Commerce in Romania).\n\nOn  fiber,  Orange  also  rolled  out  connectivity  up  to  10Gbit/s (XGSPON technology), and Orange Romania is the first Romanian operator  to  launch  a  5G  fixed  access  solution,  enabling  B2B customers to enjoy a mobile speed of 1.2Go/s.",

        "page_content": "Throughout  2021,  Orange  Romania  continued  to  transform  its customer journeys, focusing on both digital products and channels, especially in the context of the pandemic. YOXO, the first fully digital no-commitment plan in Romania, continued to record a steady increase  in  active  users.  This  transformation  was  supported  by the successful launch of portability as well as eSIM, enabling an end-to-end digital journey.\n\nIn 2021, Orange Romania also focused on its growth drivers and the IT and Integration Services activities reported better performance than in 2020. Furthermore, Orange Money continued to grow with the January launch of a credit card service; and as of July 2021, its services became available to all customers, regardless of their telecom service provider.\n\n## Slovakia\n\nOrange  Slovensko  started  operating  in  1996  and  adopted  the Orange  brand  in  2002.  A  long-standing  player  in  the  mobile segment, Orange reinforced its position in convergent offers thanks to  the  rollout  of  its  own  fiber  program  and  the  launch  of  fixed solutions via LTE in 2017. In 2020, the Group generated 1.3% of its consolidated revenue in Slovakia.\n\nSlovakia's fixed broadband market is dominated by the incumbent operator Slovak Telekom (owned by the Deutsche Telekom group), which has infrastructure covering the entire country. Orange ranks second, with market share of 17.5% (1) . Nevertheless, the rollout of its proprietary fiber optic network and regulated access to Slovak Telekom's fixed network allow Orange to provide fixed broadband services to a large number of potential customers.\n\nOrange  has  three  main  competitors  in  the  mobile  telephony market: O2 (owned by Czech group PPF), Slovak Telekom (owned by Deutsche Telekom) and Swan (national operator). 4ka began offering mobile services in October 2015, but remains a marginal player. Its services are available in all post offices and mainly focus on the market's entry level. With a market share of 31.8%, Orange remains the market leader (2) . Slovak Telecom ranks second, closely followed by O2.\n\n## Orange's activities in Slovakia\n\nIn 2021, Orange continued to implement its strategy, which consists of strengthening its position in the convergence market, backed up by its substantial market share in mobile telephony combined with growing market share in fixed telephony and TV.\n\nOrange markets a number of innovative offers, particularly its Love convergent  offer.  After  streamlining  its  portfolio  of  mobile  offers in 2020, Orange is now focusing on a portfolio of fixed offers and has enhanced its customer loyalty program. On the B2B segment, Orange has put in place new complex service offers, around virtual data, cyber security, and IoT solutions.\n\n## 1.4.3 Africa and Middle East\n\nThe Orange group is present in 18 countries in Africa and the Middle East, including 16 where it has controlling interests and two (Tunisia and Mauritius) where it has minority interests. Part of the activities are structured into sub-groups (Sonatel and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire). Orange operates in both the mobile and fixed markets.\n\nMobile markets are mainly prepaid markets, largely driven by the accelerated  development  of  voice  and  data  usage.  In  the  fixed broadband market, Orange is speeding up fiber rollout in particular.\n\nOrange is pursuing a 4G rollout strategy in Africa and the Middle East, and is investing in all countries to upgrade and extend their\n\nOrange continued to invest in its network infrastructure in 2021. In  May 2021, Orange launched its 5G network in Bratislava and Banska  Bystrica,  using  the  3.5Ghz  frequency  band.  The  4G network now covers 99% of the Slovakian population and offers the best coverage in the country. The Orange mobile network was recognized  as  the  best  in  Slovakia  for  the  second  consecutive year  and  was  named  the  best  and  fastest  of  the  25  European operators measured by Systemics PAB. Orange also extended its FTTH network, now reaching 695,000 connectable households at end-2021.\n\n## Moldova\n\nOrange Moldova started operating in 1998 and adopted the Orange brand  in  2007.  A  long-standing  player  in  the  mobile  segment, Orange launched its fixed and convergent telephony offers in 2017, following the 2016 acquisition of SUN Communications, Moldova's main  cable  operator.  In  2021,  the  Group  generated  0.3%  of  its consolidated revenue in Moldova.\n\nMoldova's main telecommunication operators are Orange, Moldcell (part of a Nepal-based conglomerate since 2020) and Moldtelecom. Moldtelecom is the incumbent operator; its infrastructure provides both fixed and mobile services. It is the leader in the Internet and fixed telephony, and also operates under the Unite brand in mobile. In  2021,  with  a  market  share  of  52.6%,  Orange  maintained  its number one position in the mobile telephony market, followed by Moldcell and Unite (source: Ancreti Report, Q3 2021).\n\n## Orange's activities in Moldova\n\nIn 2021, in line with its ambition to strengthen its position on fixed broadband, Orange Moldova launched its full migration project to fiber with the objective of reaching a 100% fiber by end 2022, and migrating all cable customers to fiber by 2023.

International carriers also sell wholesale traffic to each other.\n\nWholesale International  Networks  (WIN)  offers  a  broad  range  of solutions on the international market. Its business is structured on a large infrastructure of long-haul networks. Its presence in both the retail and wholesale markets means it can develop solutions that are particularly well adapted to the needs of the retail operators.\n\nThe  Group  is  notable  for  being  heavily  involved  in  the  design, construction and operation of submarine cables. With its ownership or co-ownership of several cable systems, Orange ranks among the world's largest owners of submarine links. This has enabled it to satisfy the increase in transatlantic traffic.\n\nThe Group's wholesale activity is based on:\n\n- -a seamless global network (1) and  an  IPX  protocol  network (2) supporting voice and data with points of presence throughout the world;\n- -a global network of dedicated IP routes with end users in more than  220  countries,  connections  to  more  than  200  Internet service providers, and connectivity in over 100 countries in a single IP network hop;\n- -99.99%  network  availability,  and  centralized  network supervision 24/7.\n\nIn  2021,  IP  data  traffic  increased  by  29%,  very  strong  growth boosted by the health crisis.\n\n## Offers\n\n## Voice services\n\nVoice service solutions enable operators worldwide to transit their customers'  calls  internationally  to  over  1,200  destinations  with 24/7 technical support.\n\n## Services to mobile operators\n\nWith mobile services solutions, Orange offers roaming as a result of direct connections with over 200 mobile operators as well as broad connectivity enabling it to offer messaging services.\n\n## Internet and transmission services\n\nOrange's data and IP network includes terrestrial, submarine and satellite systems which combine to create a vast global network. With  its  Internet  network,  Orange  offers  adjustable  solutions  to meet the needs of Internet service or content providers.\n\n## Convergence services\n\nOrange  provides  operators  with  a  multiservice  offer  to  enable them to manage their voice and mobile data services over a single connection.\n\n## Security and anti-fraud services\n\nTo protect the value of its customers' business, Orange Wholesale International Networks offers solutions covering the protection of i dentity and privacy and that of its networks, mobile traffic and voice traffic.\n\nThe portfolio of anti-fraud and security services relies on voice, Internet and mobile service solutions. These offers include audit, detection  and  protection  functions  as  well  as  the  provision  of analysis reports. The portfolio also contains offers that focus on the  fight  against  the  dangers  of  cybercrime.  Orange  Wholesale\n\nInternational Networks' customers can resell some of these offers to their own customers.\n\n## Orange Marine\n\nOrange Marine is  a  major  player  in  submarine  cables,  from  the early research and engineering stage through to the setting up of intercontinental connections and the maintenance of existing cables. In total, Orange Marine has installed more than 265,000 kilometers of  submarine cables (including over 30,000 kilometers of buried cables)  across  all  oceans  and  carried  out  surveys  on  over 80,000  kilometers  of  seabed.  Its  vessels  carried  out  more  than 850 repairs on defective cables, some of which were performed at a depth of 5,000 meters. Orange Marine has a cable-laying fleet of  seven  vessels  (six  cable  ships  and  one  submarine  research ship). It represents 15% of the global fleet and is one of the most experienced worldwide.\n\nIn 2021, Orange Marine's business recovered strongly. For more information  on  the  announcements  made  by  Orange  regarding submarine cables, see Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\n## 1.4.5.2 Content activities\n\nContent distribution activities (TV, video-on-demand, music, video games) are a key component of Orange's strategy as a multi-service operator, with over 11.8 million households in Europe connected to its TV universe at the end of 2021 (following the acquisition of TKR - see Section 1.3 Significant events). These activities help promote the Group's very high-speed broadband offers.\n\nOrange's  content  strategy  is  primarily  based  on  developing partnerships with rights holders and service publishers. In Europe, Orange  is  aggregating  the  best  entertainment  services  from large  distributors  and  offering  them  to  its  customers  through  its broadband networks. As a result, in September 2021, Orange renewed its framework agreement with Netflix. Throughout the year, the Group also rolled out its partnership with Amazon in Europe (in France, Belgium, Spain and Romania). In Africa and the Middle East, content activities are at the heart of the multi-service strategy and  help  to  cement  Orange  as  a  responsible  local  operator.  In 2021, Orange therefore implemented the partnership it signed with CANAL+ in 2018 to broadcast CANAL+ content in sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, the development of local content production and the rollout of Pay TV are key pillars of the Group's strategy.\n\nIn  France,  Orange  is  also  developing  an  ambitious  policy  of producing and co-producing films and series, and broadcasting them via its Orange Studio subsidiaries and OCS.\n\nAll  OCS programs are available via scheduled programming and on-demand. Most distributors offer OCS and it can be accessed directly online. In 2021, Orange was able to anticipate and support regulatory and competition changes in France by signing a new agreement  with  French  cinema  organizations  that  secures investments  amounting  to  60  million  euros  over  three  years.  At end-2021, OCS had approximately 3 million subscribers.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  Studio's  business  was  significantly  affected  by the health crisis, which caused scheduling issues and a drop in cinema revenue. Nevertheless, Florian Zeller's hit film The Father, coproduced by Orange Studio, won the Academy Awards for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nIn  2022,  Orange  Studio  still  has  to  contend  with  the  problems of  the  post-Covid  cinema  industry  (lower  audience  numbers, people staying at home, etc.). One of its key challenges is to grow international sales of its catalog.",

        "page_content": "## 1.4.6 Mobile Financial Services\n\nMobile financial services are a key component of Orange's Engage 2025 strategy. With the expansion of its multiservice activities on the African continent, B2B and IT services, mobile financial services are one of the Group's three growth drivers. The Mobile Financial Services business segment accordingly includes the activities of Orange Bank and Orange Bank Africa. Orange Money's business continues  to  be  driven  by  geographical  segments,  particularly Africa and the Middle East (see Section 1.4.3).\n\n## The banking market\n\nThe European banking sector is currently undergoing far-reaching change, marked by:\n\n- -the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, and an uncertain economic climate weighing on both revenue and cost of risk;\n- -a lasting environment of low interest rates, which undermines the  profitability  of  banks'  lending  activity  by  narrowing  their margins, despite the European Central Bank's accommodative monetary policy;\n- -the  need  to  adapt  to  regulatory  developments  (DSP2, GDPR, etc.) in the face of more vigilant regulatory authorities (ACPR, CNIL, etc.);\n- -increased  competition  and  fragmentation  of  supply  (online trading, account aggregators, open banking, etc.);\n- -a  boom  in  digital  uses  that  is  reshaping  customer  behavior towards  banks  (autonomous,  distant,  volatile,  demanding) and  prompting  the  integration  of  new  technologies  (instant payment, data and AI, blockchain, etc.) for greater innovation and performance.\n\nThe very intense competition in this market comes from players in several major categories:\n\n- -the large conventional banking networks;\n- -online banks (Boursorama Banque, ING Direct, etc.);\n- -neobanks (such as Orange Bank), which appeared in the 2010s and are based on a mobile application and a simplified customer experience. In competition with online and conventional banks, innovation  is  their  key  means  of  capturing  market  share.  At the end of 2021, Europe had 77 neobanks or payment players and France had a total of 30, targeted at both individuals and professionals;\n- -fintechs (financing platforms, means of payment and account aggregators) whose financing reached record levels in 2021, with 206 fintechs having obtained 'unicorn' status at the end of September 2021 (source: CB insights Fintech report Q3 2021);\n- -tech giants offering mobile payment solutions including Apple Pay,  the  Facebook  Messenger  payment  function,  Samsung Pay, Android Pay, etc.;\n- -large retailers (Leclerc, Fnac-Darty, etc.), which are aiming to become links in the mobile financial services value chain, and new players from all backgrounds that continue to emerge in the banking market (MafrenchBank, Uber Money, Free, Starling Bank).\n\nThe most significant trends in the banking market are as follows:\n\n- -hyper-personalization  of  services,  notably  with  the  rollout  of apps and offers targeted at children, young people and their parents;\n\n- -transformation in payments with the emergence of 'Buy Now Pay  Later'.  Fintechs  aim  to  provide  an  all-in-one  shopping application;\n- -banks'  CSR  commitments  and  a  rise  in  green  neobanks, with  the  promise  of  providing  customers  with  a  way  to  take action through the choice of a player positioned in responsible financing or by adopting responsible shopping habits with the help of digital  tools  to  calculate  the  carbon  footprint  of  their purchases;\n- -a  change  in  usage,  with  a  rise  in  trading  and  cryptoassets: the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) counted 2.5 million individual investors in France in the third quarter of 2021, twice as many as the same period in 2019;\n- -an  evolving  market  for  professionals  with  the  arrival  of  new players  offering  less  extensive  banking  services  compared to  banking  networks,  but  with  customer  experience  and management  services  that  are  highly  valued  by  business customers.\n\nIn the West African Economic and Monetary Union, the monetary situation  shows  a  consolidation  of  economic  financing  with  a 13.6% average increase in domestic receivables over the period 2021-2023. According to the central scenario, the inflation rate is expected to reach 3.2% in 2021, compared to 2.1% in 2020.\n\nThe very intense competition in the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire market comes from:\n\n- -mobile money operators such as Wave or MTN with MomoCash;\n- -aggregators offering interoperable payment solutions (KKiaPay, Intouch, etc.);\n- -conventional banks: all banking institutions are developing their digital channels via mobile applications.\n\n## Mobile Financial Services activities\n\n## Orange Bank\n\nLaunched  in  November  2017,  Orange  Bank,  a  subsidiary  fully owned  by  the  Orange  group,  provides  cutting-edge  banking services natively designed based on the mobile uses of customers and in strong synergy with telecom activities.\n\nAccessible to everyone, the offer is available in France and requires no conditions of income, savings or minimum balance. There are no bank charges attached to accounts and their associated bank cards (subject to certain terms and conditions of use). All basic banking services are offered: bank account, standard and Premium bank card, checkbook, authorized overdraft, savings account, \u00e0 la carte  insurance  and  personal  loans.  Customers  can  perform  all their  banking  operations  on  a  mobile  handset.  Moreover,  when opening a bank account, customers have access to a network of more than 300 Orange stores approved as banking operation and payment service intermediaries.\n\nRelying heavily on telecom functions, Orange Bank's innovations offer  customers  the  ability  to  make  contactless  payments  with credit cards or via mobile handsets using Apple Pay and Google Pay, immediate access to their bank account balance, temporary blocking and unblocking of their credit card from the application, to request and send money by text message, and to even change their bank card code at any time from the application. Customer relationships are managed by a virtual advisor, available 24/7, with the possibility of using the customer relationship center located in France.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nOrange's networks\n\nWith the acquisition of Orange Courtage in 2020, Orange Bank has reached a new milestone in its cross-selling policy with Orange by becoming an insurance broker, while at the same time increasing the scope to assist its customer base with their equipment purchases.\n\nIn  January  2021,  the  bank acquired Anytime , a  neobank specializing in business banking. This acquisition allows Orange to offer financial support and digital management tools to its millions of customers who are independent professionals.\n\nIn  June,  Orange  Bank  chose  Younited  Credit  to  accelerate  its development in the field of consumer credit. It has therefore joined forces with a flagship of French Tech that has seen exponential growth in Europe in recent years. For the bank, this partnership is  synonymous  with  optimizing  the  business  chain,  increasing operational efficiency and better risk management.\n\nIn addition, Orange Bank continues to offer car loans sold in the Groupama network alongside vehicle insurance, and a home loan offer distributed by Groupama and Meilleurtaux.\n\nOn the international stage, Orange Bank was launched in Spain at the end of 2019. This bank, which is 100% mobile, offers Orange customers a selection of savings accounts, checking accounts, Mastercard  credit  cards,  and  group  management  as  well  as numerous discounts on Orange phone bills. Innovations include the Group management function, which enables funds and expenses to be shared or transferred between several people, giving customers the  option  to  manage  joint  subscriptions  such  as  water  bills  or Netflix accounts. Since the summer of 2020, Orange Bank Spain has also been offering consumer credit and a solution for financing purchases of mobile phones in stores.\n\n## 1.5 Orange's  networks\n\nFor  Orange  group,  the  networks  are  a  strategic  asset  and,  as such,  are  subject  to  constant  supervision,  maintenance  and modernization. Orange's strategic plan, Engage 2025, launched in  December  2019,  is  based  on  four  key  ambitions,  including reinventing  its  operator  model  by  capitalizing  on  its  network advances (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\nAt end-2021, the Orange group operated networks in 26 countries to serve its B2C customers and in nearly 200 countries or territories to  serve  its  B2B  customers.  Orange  is  continuing  to  modernize its networks to provide its customers with ever greater and more enhanced connectivity in all its locations.\n\nThe  Group's  investments  in  its  networks,  other  than  those  to maintain their quality (pole, cable and mast replacement, or other equipment that  has  reached  the  end  of  its  life)  are  designed  to improve these networks in a number of respects:\n\n- -the  development  of  very  high-speed  fixed  and  mobile broadband (FTTH and 4G/5G), increased data transfer volumes and reduced connection latency. These investments concern all  networks,  from  the  mobile  radio  network  and  household Internet connectivity to submarine cables;\n- -user migration from old technologies (analog telephony, copper networks, 2G, 3G) to new technologies;\n\nAt  December 31, 2021, Orange Bank had 1.7 million customers in France and Spain. This number includes customers who have opened an account with Orange Bank, as well as customers of credit and mobile insurance offers.\n\n## Orange Bank Africa\n\nI n partnership with NSIA, a leading bancassurance provider, Orange launched Orange Bank Africa's business activities in July 2020 in C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire  after  obtaining  a  banking  license  from  the  Central Bank  of  West  African  States  (BCEAO)  in  2019.  For  populations still  excluded  from  the  conventional  banking  system,  Orange Bank Africa has quickly become one of the most efficient ways of accessing credit and savings 24/7 from their Orange Money mobile account. Orange Bank Africa plans to expand into Senegal, Mali and Burkina Faso.\n\nOrange Bank Africa offers a fully digital micro-credit and savings solution  allowing  users  to  borrow  smaller  amounts  instantly, from 5,000 CFA francs (around 8 euros), with an easy to use and innovative service which uses a scoring tool designed to accelerate decision making and a dedicated artificial intelligence algorithm. It is accessible to everyone, regardless of location, time, mobile phone generation or the level of income or savings.\n\nOrange  Bank  Africa  acquired  713,000  customers  at  the  end  of December 2021, with its pico-credit and savings offers via Orange Money and a new prepaid card offer. More than 1 million loans were granted in a total amount of 50.7 billion CFA francs, thereby contributing  to  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the populations concerned. Orange Bank Africa enables the Group to participate more fully in the economic activity of its host countries and  thus  remains  in  perfect  harmony  with  the  regional  financial inclusion strategy promoted by the BCEAO.\n\n- -gradual virtualization of network control functions ('programmability'  and  'softwarization'  of  networks  so  that they can be adapted more quickly to new services and uses);\n- -automation of network operation, which improves the quality of service for customers.\n\nThe  networks  are  very  extensive.  In  each  country,  they  break down into (i) access networks (fixed or mobile), (ii) IP transmission and  transport  networks  and  (iii)  control  and  service  networks, supplemented by (v) international networks.\n\nAccess networks connect each customer - individual or business customers - and provide a first level of customer data aggregation. IP transmission and transport networks connect access networks with each other and with the networks of other operators in the relevant  country,  as  well  as  with  international  networks.  Service control networks, which drive access, transmission and IP transport networks, provide the connection between people and manage the services (voice, TV, Internet access, data). International terrestrial and submarine networks provide global connectivity for all services, voice and data, for which servers are often located on a different continent.\n\nA  glossary  defining  several  of  the  technical  terms  used  in  this Section may be found in Section 7.2.2 at the end of this Registration Document.",

        "page_content": "A common feature of all these networks is the continual increase in their capacity. Usage continues to expand, and traffic volumes are increasing across all Group networks. To anticipate this growth,\n\n## 1.5.1 Access  networks\n\n## Fixed access networks\n\n## Analog access and ADSL/vDSL broadband access\n\nCopper access is made up of a pair of copper wires that connect each customer to a concentration point and give the latter access, via the distribution and transport network, to a local switch. It is used  to  deliver  analog  voice  services  and  broadband  access services.\n\nOrange operates copper access networks in France and Poland, and in various countries in Africa and the Middle East (C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Jordan, Senegal), to provide analog voice access services and data in the B2C, B2B and wholesale markets.\n\nFixed  broadband  ADSL/vDSL  access  (for  voice  applications, Internet access and television) is available in:\n\n- -France and Poland, with coverage approaching 100% on the incumbent local loop;\n- -countries in the Africa and Middle East region, where Orange is the operator of the copper local loop;\n- -other countries (including Egypt, Spain and Slovakia), where Orange  uses  the  local  loop  of  incumbent  operators,  either unbundled or via bitstream-type offers;\n- -Belgium and Romania, where broadband offers are marketed using the network of third-party operators;\n- -Moldova, where, following the acquisition of Sun Communications, Orange operates a cable network.\n\nNetworks  and  services  based  on  copper  access  are  used  less and less as users move to very high-speed broadband. They are therefore constantly being optimized and, in France, a timetable has been drawn up for the gradual discontinuation of the analog voice telephone service, and the removal of the copper network:\n\n- -since the end of 2018: end of the marketing of new analog voice telephony lines;\n- -from the end of 2023: technical discontinuation of the analog voice telephony service, by geographical area;\n- -phasing out of the copper access network from 2023, with an estimated completion date of 2030 (see section 1.4.1 France).\n\n## Very high-speed broadband fiber optic access\n\nFTTH (Fiber To The Home) network access extends the available broadband  ADSL/vDSL  service  offer  to  include  upstream  and downstream very high-speed broadband (up to 1 Gbit/s and more), with improved performance, in particular in terms of response time.\n\nIn  France,  Orange  has  been  deploying  FTTH  access  for  over ten years using GPON technology, which can pool several very high-speed broadband accesses on a single fiber without impairing the capacity of each access point's capacity to increase speed. The rollout  of  the  FTTH  network  started  in  2007  in  a  few  major French  cities  and  was  then  expanded.  During  the  years  2011 and 2012, Orange entered into sharing arrangements with other telecom operators to speed up fiber optic rollout. In 2021 the rollout continued at a steady pace, and Orange consolidated its leadership in France: a total of 28.8 million homes were connectable to Orange fiber at the end of 2021 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nwhich will continue over the coming years, the Group is investing in its networks to increase their capabilities and performance.\n\nOrange is also rolling out fiber in Spain, where its FTTH network covered 16.1 million connectable households at end-2021. An FTTH fiber network has also been rolled out in Poland, with connectivity offered to some 5.9 million households, as well as in Slovakia, with 700,000 connectable households. The rollout of FTTH networks is also underway in Jordan, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Morocco and Senegal.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  activated  10  Gbit/s  services  on  its  network  in Spain.\n\nOrange shares its fixed access network in its three main countries: In France, Spain and Poland, Orange plans to share some future FTTH rollouts with other operators via FiberCos, potentially involving third  parties.  In  early  2021,  Orange  joined  forces  with  long-term investors to create Orange Concession, which will be the leading operator of FTTH networks deployed and operated on behalf of local authorities in France, with 24 PINs (public initiative networks) representing  nearly  4.5  million  FTTH  connections.  In  Poland, Orange has established the 50%-owned FiberCo, with 2.4 million lines, of which 1.7 million will be deployed over the next five years. See Section 1.3 Significant events.\n\n## Radio and satellite access\n\nIn various African countries and in Eastern Europe, fixed services are provided through 4G/LTE in addition to copper and fiber optic networks.\n\nOther than copper, fiber and radio access, fixed residential access and satellite television services are marketed via space capacity rental.\n\n## Mobile access networks\n\nThe  GSM  (2G),  UMTS  (3G),  LTE  (4G)  and  5G  access  networks support voice and data communication services that reach average speeds of several tens of Mbit/s and up to several hundred in optimal conditions, allowing to easily send and receive voluminous content (audio, photo and video). The Group operates a mobile network in each of the countries where it offers consumer telecommunication services. The network supports GSM, UMTS and LTE technologies in all countries; in Europe, it also supports 5G. Between 2025 and 2030, the Group will gradually phase out its 2G and 3G networks in France and in all European Union countries where it operates. The  shutdown  of  2G  and  3G  will  allow  Orange  to  optimize  the management  of  its  networks  and  to  move  them  towards  more secure, resilient, energy-efficient and modern technologies such as 4G and 5G. Radio frequencies currently used for 2G and 3G will be used to improve capacity and coverage of 4G and 5G networks in both urban and rural areas.\n\n5G  technology  enables  improved  connection  speed  to  mobile services, with average speeds 3 to 4 times faster than 4G thanks to smart antennas installed on existing 4G sites. Orange's 5G is currently  marketed  in  six  countries  in  Europe  (Spain,  France, Luxembourg, Poland, Romania, Slovakia). It is initially being rolled out in urban areas where 4G is in high demand and in areas with high levels of economic activity to ease the load on other networks. Rollouts  will  continue  gradually  in  those  countries  over  the 2022-2023 period, as well as in other countries where the Group operates in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, depending on the availability of spectrum.\n\nO\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nTo reduce its environmental impact and operating costs, Orange shares more than half of its radio sites with a competitor. Sharing can be either 'passive' (confined to masts only), or 'active' (masts and  active  equipment).  Sharing  of  this  nature,  which  previously concerned  2G/3G/4G  technologies,  now  includes  5G.  Passive sharing is in place in almost all of the Group's host countries. Active sharing, which is more effective, has mainly been adopted in the following countries:\n\n- -Poland, for nearly all of the mobile access network;\n- -Spain,  where  the  mobile  access  network  is  shared  outside major cities (those with more than 175,000 inhabitants);\n- -France, for 4G coverage of dead zones including the 2,000 new sites of the New Deal program;\n- -Belgium,  where  an  active  mobile  access  network  sharing agreement was signed with a competitor in 2019. Consolidation work on both networks is taking place over several years and was still in progress at the end of 2021;\n- -Romania, for sites in rural areas.\n\n2021 was marked by:\n\n- -the  creation  of  TOTEM,  a  European TowerCo. At the end of 2021, TOTEM's passive mobile infrastructure portfolio included more  than  26,000  sites  in  France  and  Spain  (See  section 1.3 Significant events);\n- -the commercial launch of 5G in Slovakia and the expansion of 5G coverage in other countries.\n\n## 1.5.2 National transmission and IP transport and control networks\n\nIn  each  country  where  it  has  consumer  customers,  Orange operates a layered network:\n\n- -transmission networks;\n- -IP transport network;\n- -control network;\n- -voice service network.\n\nThe  transmission  network  consists  primarily  of  fiber  optics,  but also radio links, especially for alternative or purely mobile networks in MEA countries. These networks support voice and data traffic, for fixed and mobile retail (B2C and B2B) and wholesale services. Optical links offer bandwidth of up to 400 Gbit/s per wavelength, and Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) technology makes it possible to have up to 80 wavelengths per fiber. Orange is one of the world leaders in the use of advanced optical functions to obtain a more flexible transmission network.\n\nThe IP network consists of routers connected to the transmission network.  In  France,  an  IP  network  dedicated  to  businesses  is also  in  operation,  in  addition  to  the  network  managing  data  for B2C customers. The main purpose of this network is to connect a company's French sites for internal data exchange on a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and provide it with Internet connectivity. It also provides Voice over IP transport for companies.\n\n## 1.5.3 International  networks\n\n## Terrestrial network\n\nThe international terrestrial network comprises four main networks, connected via submarine cables:\n\n- -the  European network, whose rollout began in April 2012 in France, and which has been extended to include services in Frankfurt, London, Barcelona and Madrid, as well as submarine cable stations;\n- -the North American backbone, one of the most strategic routes for Europe since 80% of the Internet traffic generated by Europe is destined for the United States;\n- -the Asian backbone in Singapore served by the SEA-ME-WE3 and SEA-ME-WE4 submarine cables; and\n- -Djoliba, the first  pan-African backbone, brought into service in November 2020. This infrastructure is based on a terrestrial fiber  optic  network  coupled  with  submarine  cables,  thereby offering  secure  international  connectivity  from  West  Africa. The new backbone covers eight countries, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal.\n\nThe control network (also known as the signaling network) manages calls  and  data  connections,  updates  of  location  data  for  mobile phones, roaming and SMS. This network is being upgraded to new standards, for example to manage 5G.\n\nIn the countries in which it has fixed operations, Orange operates a switched telephone network (STN) to deliver analog voice and ISDN digital  services.  These  networks  are  continually  being  optimized because of declining usage. In France, Orange stopped marketing its analog voice services at the end of 2018, and announced the first  zones  where  voice  services  will  only  be  available  using  IP technology from the end of 2023.\n\nOrange  has  also  rolled  out  fixed  VoIP  networks  using  IMS technology (IP Multimedia Subsystem) in many countries for B2C and B2B uses.\n\nUntil  2015, all  mobile voice traffic was managed in switch mode by the mobile network in each country. In 2015, Orange rolled out mobile  IMS  infrastructure  in  European  countries  to  offer  VoLTE services  (VoIP  over  LTE)  and  VoWiFi  (mobile  Voice over WiFi). At end-2021, VoLTE and VoWiFi had been rolled out in all of the Group's  European  networks  and  are  being  rolled  out  in  some countries in the MEA region.\n\n## Satellites\n\nOrange uses satellite communications to provide VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) services to Orange Business Services' terrestrial or maritime B2B customers and to ensure connection with isolated mobile sites in Africa and IP or voice connectivity to other operators. To provide those services, Orange uses rented space capacity from satellite operators (such as Eutelsat, Intelsat, SES and Arabsat).\n\n## Submarine cables\n\nTo address the strong growth in international telecommunication traffic  and  in  a  highly  competitive  market,  Orange  is  maintaining its  level  of  investment  in  submarine  cables  and  is  continuing  to develop its network in order to meet the needs of its customers. Due to the high cost of investments required in the construction of cables, such investments are carried out with the different players involved  (operators,  private  companies,  GAFAM)  and  in  various forms (consortiums, purchase of user rights, transmission-capacity rental, etc.).",

        "page_content": "Orange  is  an  investor  in  more  than  40  submarine  cables  and consortiums  covering  various  routes:  North  Atlantic,  Caribbean, Europe-Asia, Europe-Africa.\n\n2021 was marked by:\n\n- -the commissioning of the Dunant transatlantic cable between the United States and France. Orange will benefit from two pairs of optical fiber with a capacity of up to 30 Tbit/s each, three times the capacity of the previous generation of transatlantic submarine cables;\n- -the deployment of the AMITI\u00c9 transatlantic cable, which will be put into service in 2022 (see section1.3 Significant events).\n\n## 1.5.4 Network  resilience\n\nNetwork resilience ensuring continuity of services is an essential element of Orange's purpose as a trusted operator. Orange's network resilience approach focuses on:\n\n- -anticipation,  by  choosing  architectures  most  likely  to  resist hazards. This includes anticipating future weather conditions and the weather events they will produce;\n- -the assessment of the system's ability to anticipate and absorb potential disruptions, to develop ways to adapt to changes in the system itself (such as the introduction of a new technology, or external changes), and to enhance its ability to withstand disruptions or to recover as quickly as possible after a shock.\n\n## International service control networks\n\nOrange  operates  an  international  control  network  to  manage the  signaling  associated  with  the  voice  traffic,  roaming  and text  messaging of its mobile networks and those of its operator customers. This network is evolving to handle new standards such as 5G.\n\nOrange also operates a network for the supply of voice services for international businesses, based on the international IP MPLS network.\n\nIn  addition,  several  centralized  platforms  were  rolled  out  on  the international  transit  points  to  provide  value-added  services  to mobile operators.\n\nOrange's network resilience is built on:\n\n- -transmission  and  transport  networks  structured  in  loops in order to guarantee a minimum of service in the event of a branch outage;\n- -redundancy at different levels (sites, energy chains, equipment, servers) in order to compensate for failures of individual units;\n- -anticipation and prevention capabilities to detect and implement the  first  redundancy  and  diversity  mechanisms.  Historically, these capabilities referred to the robustness of the network;\n- -absorption  capabilities  with  defense  mechanisms,  including congestion or overload control mechanisms;\n- -adjustment capabilities to reduce the impact of incidents on the services provided to customers;\n- -repair capabilities to restore normal functioning.\n\n## 1.6 Research and innovation\n\nIn  the  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  sector, which  is  undergoing  major  change  in  its  value  chain  with  the increase in the number of players and the creation of new economic models, innovation is a major growth engine for the Orange group.\n\nIn 2021, the Group devoted 620 million euros (i.e. 1.5% of revenue) to  furthering  its  research  and  innovation  activities,  including employee costs and operating and capital expenditure related to research and innovation for new products and services.\n\n## 1.6.1 Strategy and key actions\n\nOrange is currently a leading private player involved in digital research in France. The Group aims to be a committed player in current and future transformations including connectivity, especially with 5G, 6G and fiber, responsible artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things on  a  large  scale,  and  digital  technology  with  low  environmental impact, synonymous with trust and excellence. Orange aims to use research to improve daily life for everyone and to respond to major societal  challenges  through  innovative  and  responsible  uses  of new digital technologies. Bringing together its activities around the creation of strategic innovation, research and the implementation of technical and data policies for the Group, Orange Innovation is the driving force behind this innovation. Against the backdrop of rapid changes in our customers' uses and expectations, Orange Innovation is building competitive and value-creating assets for the Group. Its mission, 'Prepare the future, build the present,' is part of the Group's strategy.\n\nOrange  is  convinced  that  using  data  and  artificial  intelligence (AI)  in  a  responsible,  useful  and  accessible  way  will  open  new prospects for individuals, society and the planet. Its research and\n\ninnovation  teams  support  four  priority  areas:  making  networks smarter, improving operational efficiency, reinventing the customer experience and ensuring that the use of data and AI is sustainable and responsible. Orange established its Data and AI Ethics Council in 2021 with this in mind. The Group also offers its employees a complete range of training  in  AI/Data:  acculturation,  training  for professions and experts. In partnership with DataScientest, Orange offers  certification  programs  for  people  receiving  professional retraining  and  a  Data  Analyst  course  at  the  Orange  Apprentice Training Center. The Group also makes use of platforms such as Coursera and Open Classroom to enable employees to develop their skills independently.\n\nSupplying its customers with the best connectivity is key to Orange's strategy. Several innovations are currently being developed or tested which are likely to provide solutions in the coming years to improve connectivity, achieve the 'Net Zero Carbon by 2040' commitment, develop new services and improve the quality of service provided to our customers.\n\nO\n\n- 1\n\n1",

From 2023, when the new 5G Stand Alone (SA) core networks are installed, Orange will be in a position to  offer  lower  latency  and  network  slicing  by  allocating  certain network slices to cover critical usage or specific needs. In 2021, Orange continued the preparatory tests for the implementation of the 5G SA technical infrastructure in European countries during 2022.\n\nFor the general public, 5G will promote the development of even more  interactive,  immersive  and  contextualized  experiences  for learning,  working,  communicating,  playing  and  improving  daily lives. Its technical performance also makes 5G a lever for business competitiveness and regional development. Combined with other technologies  like  edge  computing,  artificial  intelligence  and  the Internet of Things, 5G will open up a host of opportunities including the optimization of production processes and better support for i solated workers during maintenance operations. Advances are also expected in the health sector, for the management and monitoring of  patients, and in the area of connected mobility. This will offer alternatives to travel, thereby cutting CO2 emissions. In the area of decentralized renewable energies such as wind and solar power, it will make it possible to adapt production to demand in real time and improve remote maintenance of production sites. Through the Orange 5G Lab initiative launched in 2021, Orange is proposing a true mesh of nine sites in Europe to help economic players better understand the opportunities, value and utility of 5G. More than 70 companies have received support in order to test uses.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  continued  the  deployment  of  dedicated  IoT networks in Europe, LoRaWAN \u00ae and LTE-M to best meet customers' connectivity needs. In the B2C market, Orange has enhanced its 'Protected Home' remote surveillance offer in France and launched a service in Spain that allows users to monitor their homes using a high-resolution Wi-Fi camera and a mobile application. In the B2B market, Orange also offers two turnkey solutions, 'smart tracking' and 'smart office,' in order to continue to support companies and local authorities in the democratization of IoT uses.\n\nIn 2021, Orange launched several initiatives to realize its vision for the future of networks. In particular, the Group rolled out Pikeo, an experimental 5G SA network in Lannion, France, which is Cloud native and 100% software-based. This network is also based on the Open RAN technology that Orange is working on. It will serve as a model for the next generation of more efficient and self-adaptive networks that will enable Orange to offer the best quality of service in every situation, thanks to the contributions of AI and data, and to move toward a more autonomous network ('zero touch network,' minimizing human intervention).\n\nOrange  is  also  committed  to  the  rollout  of  Open  RAN:  the  first test  and  integration  center  dedicated  to  this  technology  opened in  November 2021 on its premises in Ch\u00e2tillon (Hauts-de-Seine). Finally, the Group has entered into a partnership agreement with Google Cloud around data, AI, Cloud and edge computing, and will  open,  on  the  same  site  that  opened  in  2021,  the  first  Edge Computing Lab to implement and test end-to-end edge computing services leveraging Orange's 5G performance.\n\nFor the environment, Orange is one of the sector's pioneers, with its green network approach already going back several years. The Green ITN program, which has already reduced the Group's energy consumption linked to network and information system operations (see Section 4.2.2.1 Network energy consumption), continues under the Engage 2025 strategic plan. It relies in particular on the energy efficiency of 5G and the eco-design of Data centers, as well as the use of data and AI, to further reduce energy consumption caused by\n\nnetwork elements. In 2021, Orange opened the Padus Lab, a new generation of lab that addresses the energy efficiency challenges of future networks and Data centers. Orange's commitment to green networks is also reflected in the purchase of renewable energy. In 2021,  Orange  signed  several  new  power  purchase  agreements (PPAs), multi-year contracts for the purchase of electricity produced by solar or wind farms, in France.\n\nFor  sustainable  innovation,  Orange  reduced  the  environmental impact of SIM cards by deploying a new version Group-wide that requires half the volume of plastic backing of previous cards and can accommodate two chips rather than just one. This approach is  further  illustrated  by  the  use  of  fully  recycled  plastic  for  the manufacture  of  Eco-SIM  cards.  All  26  Orange  Group  countries launched  this  new  format  in  2021,  including  Orange  France  at the  end  of  the  year.  In  order  to  encourage  the  reduction  of  the environmental impact of products, together with other European operators, Orange has launched the Eco Rating, a new classification index for cell phones. This labeling helps consumers identify and compare the most environmentally friendly cell phones. The Eco Rating will also encourage suppliers to reduce the environmental impact of their products.\n\nOrange supports and wishes to systematize an eco-design and circular  economy approach as part of its active approach to its CSR commitment throughout the life  cycle  of  its  handsets  and networks.  Neva  leaf,  launched  in  France  in  August  2021,  is  a repairable smartphone, designed to last longer and offered at an affordable  price.  In  networks,  the  OSCAR  program,  which  aims to put the circular economy at the heart of the Group's networks and infrastructures, has taken concrete form with the conclusion of agreements with network equipment vendors to increase the use of reconditioned equipment.\n\nOrange's research and innovation activities are conducted within the framework of an Open Innovation strategy to capture trends, find original solutions and benefit from the Group's partners' skills and contributions.\n\nThis is reflected in a number of developments:\n\n- -Orange signed nearly 78 research contracts with the world's top University research centers between 2019 and 2021, and has also set up three joint laboratories: one with INRIA on the virtualization of network functions, one on antennas with the University  of  Nice  and  one  with  the  University  of  GrenobleAlpes on health. It is also involved in the b<>com Institut de Recherche Technologique, and is contributing to 58 national and  European  cooperative  projects,  including  through  its involvement in seven competitiveness clusters (including the chair of the Images & R\u00e9seaux cluster) as part of a network of more than 158 industrial and academic stakeholders. Orange also  funds  five  research  chairs,  including  one  with  Institut Mines-T\u00e9l\u00e9com on the values and policies of personal data;\n- -Orange is also involved in several research projects in France (Quantum@UCA,  ParisRegionQCI)  and  in  Europe  (EuroQCI) around  quantum  communication  networks  with  numerous academic, industrial and start-up partners;\n- -many  start-ups  benefit  from  Orange's  support  through  a number of schemes, including the Orange Fab program, which offers  programs  to  accelerate  and  internationalize  start-up businesses in 19 countries. The Group also supports women start-up  creators,  with  #FemmesEntrepreuses  and  Women Start (launch of season 3 in 2021), as well as the best positive impact technology projects in Africa and the Middle East with the Orange Prize for Social Entrepreneurship in Africa and the Middle  East  (known  by  its  French  acronym  POESAM).  It  is also part of various global networks and events, including the Business France and French Tech networks;",

It is an asset that sets Orange apart from its academic and industry partners. Its role is also to defend the Group's interests in the event of disputes involving intellectual property.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Orange group had a portfolio of more than 9,000 patents or patent applications in France and abroad protecting its innovations. To maximize their value, some patents are licensed through patent pools for patents pertaining to industry standards  (e.g.  NFC,  MPEG  Audio,  WiFi,  HEVC,  5G).  Value\n\n## 1.6.3 Capital-investissement\n\nAs a keen major financer of innovation in information technology, over the last 15 years the Orange Group has committed more than 750 million  euros  to  this  area  via  two  main  and  complementary channels of investment:\n\n- -Orange Ventures, wholly owned by the Group: at the end of 2020,  Orange  strengthened  its  venture  capital  activity  by creating Orange Ventures, a new company with a budget of 350 million  euros.  That  makes  it  one  of  Europe's  10  largest corporate  venture  capital  funds.  Orange  Ventures  invests  in fast-growing  companies  in  Orange's  established  business areas such as connectivity, cybersecurity, digital enterprise and innovative financial services, as well as in new areas that the Group is exploring, such as e-health.\n\nWith  offices  in  Paris  and  Dakar,  Orange  Ventures  supports start-ups  at  all  stages  of  their  development,  from  the  seed stage in Africa and the Middle East, to more mature phases in Europe and the United States, with unit investments of up to 20 million euros per round of fundraising.\n\nFor Orange, Orange Ventures serves to promote the emergence of future technological champions helping drive the transition to an increasingly digital and responsible world in the service of the greatest number in order to share their innovation capabilities with the Group's 271 million customers worldwide.\n\nTo that end, Orange Ventures innovates by envisioning flexible and optional, but nevertheless highly structured processes for creating  synergies  between  Orange  and  start-ups.  Orange Ventures aims to match the financial performance of the best venture  capitalists,  and  will  make  its  investment  decisions independently. The 20-strong Orange Ventures team has been strengthened with acknowledged experts from the world of venture capital. It has assumed the management of the Orange Digital Ventures portfolio, launched in 2015.\n\n- -Investment  funds  run  by  management  companies  outside Orange. These invest in accordance with investment theses that meet the requirements associated with Orange's strategy and activities. As well as generating a profit, these investments aim to sustain the Group's Open Innovation approach, forge strategic, technological and/or commercial partnerships, and enhance the Group's image within the innovation ecosystem and with its customers and other stakeholders. Since this year, they have also helped respond to new challenges, particularly Orange's commitment to be Net Zero Carbon by 2040. Over the\n\nmaximization also concerns software such as engineering tools for the mobile network.\n\nI n 2021, 204 new inventions were patented, including major technical contributions  to  standardization  (5G,  coding,  video,  etc.).  These inventions  mainly  come  from  the  Group's  Innovation  Research Centers in France and abroad. In France, Orange is ranked 11th in the INPI 2020 ranking, ex-aequo with L'Or\u00e9al* (source: INPI 2021, ranking of the top 50 patent applicants). Orange is the only telecom operator among the largest French filers, and ranks ninth among the top 10 of large French companies.\n\nlast 15 years, the Group has committed more than 400 million euros of investment as follows:\n\n- -the Iris Venture IV and Iris Next funds and the three Orange Publicis Ventures funds (Growth, Global and Early-Stage), created  within  the  framework  of  a  partnership  with  the Publicis group, and managed by Iris Capital Management in which the Group is also involved at governance level,\n- -the Raise Investissement, Raise Ventures and Raise Seed for Good funds, run by the management company of the Raise group, whose philanthropic approach is creating a virtuous ecosystem founded on a benevolent economy,\n- -several  'thematic'  funds,  including  Robolution  Capital, managed by 360 Capital Partners and focused on robotics, Ecomobility Ventures, managed by Idinvest Partners and focused on digital and sustainable mobility, Digital Health 2, managed by LBO France and focused on digital health, Venture Reality Fund 2, managed by VR Fund 2 Partners and  focused  on  augmented  reality,  and  Move  Capital, managed  by  Kepler  Cheuvreux  Invest  and  focused  on European B2B technology companies,\n- -two funds focused mainly on investments in Africa: Partech Africa,  managed  by  Partech  Partners,  and  the  French African Fund (FFA), managed by AfricInvest,\n- -two  seed  capital  funds,  Paris-Saclay  Seed  Fund  and Seedcamp IV,\n- -the  LAC  1  fund  managed  by  Bpifrance,  a  fund  of  listed assets whose main decision-making centers are located in France,\n- -two natural capital funds, partly involving co-investing in the Livelihoods Carbon Fund 3 fund, advised by Livelihoods Venture,  and  partly  involving  the  design  and  creation  of an innovative fund called Orange Nature, in which Orange is  the  sole  investor.  Management  of  Orange  Nature  has been entrusted  to  leading  sustainable  finance  specialist Mirova, a subsidiary of Natixis Investment Managers. Both these investments aim to fund carbon capture and storage projects, with payment in the form of high-quality carbon credits.\n\nIn 2021 and January 2022, there was significant activity with six new investments: the creation of the Orange Nature fund and investment in the Iris Venture IV, Move Capital, Livelihoods Carbon Fund 3, Raise Seed for Good and Venture Reality Fund 2 funds, as described above.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

It is binding on the Member States and must be implemented by the National Regulatory Authorities.\n\nThe  general  legal  framework  of  the  European  Union  has  been amended by the European Electronic Communications Code, which came into force on December 20, 2018. It revises and combines four main directives deriving from the 2002 Telecom Package on:\n\n- -a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services;\n- -the authorization of electronic communications networks and services;\n- -access to and interconnection of electronic communications networks and associated facilities;\n- -universal  service  and  users'  rights  relating  to  electronic communications networks and services.\n\nFurthermore, Regulation (EC) 1211/2009 of November 25, 2009, canceled  and  replaced  by  Regulation  (EU)  2018/1971  of December 11, 2018, implemented the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC).\n\nThis  legal  framework  is  supplemented  by  sector-based  texts (international roaming, open Internet, etc.) as well as broader texts aimed at the European digital ecosystem (protection of privacy, etc.).\n\n## 1.7.1.2 Main community texts in force\n\n## The European Electronic Communications Code\n\nThe  European  Electronic  Communications  Code  (Directive  (EU) 2018/1972) came into force on December 20, 2018. The Member States  then  had  24  months  to  transpose  it  into  national  law. However, due to the health crisis, the transposition has not yet been completed in certain countries, particularly in Orange's European countries.\n\nThe Code includes a regulatory objective to support the deployment and  adoption  of  very  high-connectivity  networks  -  in  line  with Orange's  wish  to  see  regulatory  objectives  redirected  toward support for investment.\n\nIn  addition,  the  rules  governing access  obligations imposed on operators with significant market power have been positively adjusted in relation to the previous framework:\n\n- -access obligations should better target only the relevant fixed access infrastructure so as to address competition issues in the retail market;\n- -the  Code  promotes  co-investment  in  very  high-connectivity networks.  If  an  operator  in  a  dominant  position  makes  a\n\ncommunications markets. Orange also faces specific regulatory constraints in some countries due to its dominant position in the relevant markets. The risks linked to the regulation of the electronic communications sector are described in Section 2.1.2 Legal risks.\n\nco-investment  offer  that  complies  with  certain  provisions,  it could  be  exempted  from  remedies  related  to  its  dominant status. Only co-investors will have access to the full capacity of these networks. The other operators will be able to enjoy the same quality of wholesale access as they did before the rollout of  these  networks.  National  regulators  will  need  to  secure approval from the European Commission for such measures;\n\n- -the  Code  also  favors  the  wholesale  operator  model  -  not present  in  the  retail  market  -  by  exempting  it  from  certain remedies, even in cases of market dominance.\n\nIn  addition,  obligations  for  access  to  fixed  access  infrastructure serving subscribers may be imposed symmetrically on all operators when it is not technically feasible or economically reasonable to replicate such infrastructure. These obligations are subject to a joint veto by the Commission and BEREC.\n\nConcerning the allocation of radio spectrum needed for mobile services, the Code reinforces European rules aimed at improved harmonization  and  cooperation  between  Member  States, including the minimum 20-year visibility of spectrum licenses. The implementation and in particular the allocation of spectral capacity remains a national affair with only light supervision from Europe. Provisions  facilitating  the  deployment  of  'small-area  wireless access points' and the availability schedule of the 5G spectrum were also adopted.\n\nWith  respect  to the  regulation  of  communication  services , most  of  the  obligations  intended  to  protect  end-users  are  for Internet access service and services using public numbering plan resources, independently of the service provider. Other services, such as interpersonal communication services independent of the numbering plan and signal transport services are only subject to a limited number of obligations.\n\nHowever, regulation of the competitive markets for intra-European calls  and  SMS  has  been  introduced  with  the  Code  through Regulation (EU) 2018/1971 of December 11, 2018, imposing a cap of 19 -euro cents/minute and 6 -euro cents/SMS, applicable since May 15, 2019.\n\nConcerning universal service obligations ,  the Code abandons the principle of telephone service provision and calls on Member States  to  ensure  the  availability  of  affordable  Internet  access service,  upholding  the  principle  of  potential  designation  should Member States consider that the market does not provide such services under said conditions, but increasing the burden of proof for Member States. The system of financing the universal service remains in the hands of the Member States, with coverage from public  funds  or  from  a  fund  financed  by  the  sector.  In  addition, the  Code  opens  the  door  to  an  extension  of  universal  service obligations to include the supply of affordable mobile services.",

        "page_content": "The Code and its associated regulation on changes in BEREC's responsibilities and governance do not create a European regulator. However, the Code does adopt the principle of full standardization of the rights of end-users, subject to exceptions, and strengthens the control exercised by the European Commission over access regulation and over the spectrum.\n\nTo help national regulators implement the Code, and as provided for within it, BEREC has put most of its guidelines out for consultation and published some of them in 2020 and 2021.\n\n## Harmonization of analyses of relevant markets\n\nOn December 18, 2020, the European Commission published a new recommendation identifying two relevant product and service markets for which National Regulatory Authorities should carry out market analyses that may lead to the implementation of ex-ante regulation:\n\n- -market 1: wholesale provision of local access at a fixed location (formerly market 3a/2014 of recommendation 2014/710/EC);\n- -market 2: wholesale provision of high-quality access at a fixed location (formerly market 4/2014 of recommendation 2014/710/ EC).\n\n## Call termination rates\n\nThe Code provides that fixed and mobile call termination rates will cease to be determined by National Regulatory Authorities but will be determined by the European Commission for all countries of the European Economic Area. This provision concerns European operators for calls terminating in a European country.\n\nIn  this  context,  on  April  22,  2021  the  European  Commission published  Delegated  Act  2021/654  determining  call  termination rates:\n\n- -fixed call termination is set at 0.07-euro cents per minute.

VAT per minute,\n- -SMS: 0.01 euros excl. VAT per SMS,\n- -data (price excl. VAT): 3.5 euros per GB in 2020, 3.0 euros per GB in 2021 and 2.5 euros per GB until July 1, 2022.\n\nSuppliers of mobile services subject to the regulation on the pricing of intra-European roaming may apply a reasonable usage policy to their customers in terms of the consumption of these services in order to prevent abnormal or excessive use. Despite this option, in  special  and  exceptional  circumstances,  when  the  supply  of intra-European roaming at the national price threatens the viability of the supplier's national pricing model, they can ask the national regulator for authorization to bill additional charges for the use of intra-European roaming, which are limited to the caps on wholesale roaming prices.\n\nOn  February  24,  2021,  the  European  Commission  presented  a draft  new  roaming  regulation  which  envisages  a  further  gradual reduction in wholesale prices until 2032 as well as quality of service obligations.  The  current  regulation,  adopted  in  2017,  expires  on June 30, 2022. An agreement between members of the European Parliament  and  the  Council  Presidency  was  made  public  on December 9, 2021 to  extend  the  'Roam  like  at  home'  scheme by ten years. Under the agreement, wholesale caps will gradually decrease from 2 euros per GB on July 1, 2022 to 1 euro per GB in 2027. The formal adoption of this text by the Parliament is expected i n the first quarter of 2022, with a probable entry into force on July 1, 2022.\n\n## Regulation of the open Internet\n\nThe  TSM  Regulation  has  introduced  rules  to  ensure  an  open Internet within the European Union. Article 3.3 of the TSM states that in the provision of Internet access services, providers shall treat traffic equally and without discrimination, restriction or interference, irrespective  of  sender  and  recipient,  the  content  consulted  or broadcast, the applications or services used or provided, and the terminal equipment used. It is up to the Member States to adapt their national law to comply with this provision.\n\nOn April 30, 2019, the European Commission published a report on the implementation of the net neutrality component of the TSM Regulation. The Commission, in the light of market developments, concluded that the principles of the Regulation are appropriate and\n\nthat they effectively protect end-users by promoting the Internet as a driver of innovation. The Commission pointed out that operators have correctly applied the regulation governing net neutrality and that national regulators have imposed very few fines. It does not propose any amendments to this Regulation.\n\nOn the basis of that report, BEREC published a new version of its guidelines in June 2020, clarifying certain points:\n\n- -the scope of the regulation is limited to the part between the interconnection  and  the  customer-side  network  termination point, thus leaving the terminal equipment outside the scope when it is located beyond that termination point;\n- -the possible compatibility of 5G slicing technologies with the regulation.\n\n## Protecting personal data\n\nThe European Commission wishes to replace the sector directive No.  2002/58/EC  of  July  12,  2002  on  'Privacy  and  Electronic Communications,' known as e-Privacy. The project, which dates from  2017,  establishes  rules  to  protect  the  privacy  of  online communications and the use of electronic communications data (metadata).  It  introduces  a  level  of  fines  that  is  aligned  with  the General  Data  Protection  Regulation  (GDPR),  which  came  into force in 2018 (3) , and maintains the regulatory asymmetry between telecom  operators  and  digital  actors  (OTT  service  providers) regarding metadata collection.\n\nHowever, the e-Privacy regulation project is made less urgent by the fact that the Code has extended the scope of application of the  confidentiality  of  communications  to  OTT  services,  and  that the GDPR has strengthened the methods used to collect consent and the regime of sanctions to which the 2002 Directive refers. Moreover, the lack of political agreement on the new text makes its approval uncertain.\n\n## Regulation of platforms\n\nRegulation  (EU)  2019-1150  promoting  fairness  and  transparency for businesses using online intermediation services was adopted on June 20, 2019 and has been applicable from July 12, 2020. It aims to ensure rules for a fair, transparent and predictable trading environment for businesses and vendors on online platforms. This regulation  is  applicable  to  telecommunication  operators  offering Internet  television  services  (IPTV),  provided  that  conditions  are imposed on the streaming provider.\n\n## Digital Services Act and Digital Market Act\n\nOn December 15, 2020, the European Commission published two pieces  of  legislation:  an  update  of  the  e-Commerce  Directive (4) , known as the Digital Services Act (DSA), and a Regulation to combat the role of large online platforms, known as the Digital Market Act (DMA). These two texts were adopted by the European Parliament on January 20, 2022 and December 15, 2021, respectively.\n\nThe DSA amends and updates the obligations of intermediaries connecting  consumers  with  goods,  services  and  content.  For telecom  operators,  the  DSA  brings  in  very  limited  changes  in relation to the e-Commerce Directive (introduction of a one-stop shop and a limited transparency declaration obligation).",

Telecom operators are outside the scope of the regulation.\n\n## NGA Recommendation\n\nThe European Commission launched a consultation in July 2020 on the revision of two recommendations impacting fiber regulation:\n\n## 1.7.2 France\n\n## 1.7.2.1 Legal and regulatory framework\n\n## Legal framework\n\nThe electronic communications sector is mainly governed under national law by the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code (CPCE), as well as by legal provisions relating to electronic commerce, the information society, consumer protection and the protection  of  personal  data,  which  must  comply  with  European directives.\n\nFrance transposed the European Telecom Package, as amended in 2009, via a government order dated August 24, 2011 and a Decree dated March 12, 2012 for the implementing regulations.\n\nThe  European  Code  was  transposed  by  order  2021-650  of May 26, 2021 and implementing decrees 2021-1136 of August 31, 2021 and 2021-1281 of September 30, 2021, with the exception of the provisions relating to universal service (see below) and the obligations relating to geographical surveys of network coverage, which were transposed by the DDADUE law of December 3, 2020 i mplementing various provisions of the law of the European Union in economic and finance matters. Some provisions on the consumer side are also awaiting final regulations.\n\nThe audiovisual communication services produced or distributed by the Orange group come under the specific regulations governing this sector and are governed by law No. 86/1067 of September 30, 1986 on the Freedom of Communication.\n\n## Regulatory Authorities\n\nThe  Postal,  Electronic  Communications  and  Media  Distribution Regulatory Authority (Arcep) is an independent administrative body created by the law of July 26, 1996 and is in charge of the nationwide regulation of the electronic communications and postal sectors and press  distribution.  Within  the  electronic  communications  sector, Arcep's main missions are to define regulations for operators present\n\nthe  2010  Recommendation (1) on  next  generation  access,  which promotes a consistent approach to access obligations imposed by national regulators operators in dominant positions, and the 2013 Recommendation (2) on cost methodologies and non-discrimination rules  for  wholesale  Next  Generation  Network  access  prices and  economic  replicability  tests.  Some  of  the  content  of  these recommendations is included in the access requirements under the Code.\n\nin the markets in question. It has powers to sanction non-compliant operators and can rule in particular on disputes between operators over  technical  and  pricing  conditions  for  network  access  and interconnection.  Arcep  also  allocates  spectrum  and  numbering resources. Finally, it determines the size of contributions to fund the universal service obligation and oversees the mechanisms for delivering this funding.\n\nThe French Competition Authority is an independent administrative authority responsible for ensuring open market competition and compliance with public economic policy. It has jurisdiction over all  business  segments, including the electronic communications sector.  It  has  sanction  powers  for  anti-competitive  practices,  as well as consultative powers. It is also responsible for overseeing mergers and acquisitions.\n\nThe  ANFr  (Agence nationale des fr\u00e9quences  -  French  national frequency  agency)  is  responsible  for  planning,  managing  and controlling the usage of radio spectrum and for coordinating the establishment of certain radio transmission facilities. The frequency spectrum is divided between eleven controlling authorities: public administrations,  Arcep  and  the  French  Broadcasting  Authority (CSA). Arcep and the CSA are in turn responsible for allotting to users the spectrum they control.\n\nThe CSA (Conseil Sup\u00e9rieur de l'Audiovisuel)  is  an  independent administrative body created by the law of January 17, 1989. It is tasked with protecting the freedom of audiovisual communication in accordance with the law of September 30, 1986. Pursuant to law no. 2021-1382 of October 25, 2021 on the regulation and protection of access to cultural works in the digital age, this authority merged on January 1, 2022 with Hadopi (High Authority for the dissemination of works and the protection of rights on the Internet) created in 2009. The new Authority is called ARCOM (Autorit\u00e9 de r\u00e9gulation de la communication audiovisuelle et num\u00e9rique; 'Regulatory authority for audiovisual and digital communication').\n\n- 1\n\n1",

The  obligations  and  commitments  made  by  the operators beyond 2021 were included into the new authorizations granted in December 2018 (Decision No. 2018-1392) for 10 years from the expiration of the previous authorizations.\n\n## 5G\n\n## 3.4-3.8 GHz band in metropolitan France\n\nAt the end of the procedure for the allocation of 5G spectrum in the 3,490-3,800 MHz band, the frequency use authorizations issued by Arcep came into effect on November 18, 2020. The spectrum allocated to Orange is in the 3710-3800 MHz band, i.e. a block of 90 MHz in time-division duplexing (TDD) mode. The spectrum is allocated for 15 years, with the possibility of a five-year extension if  the  licensee  agrees  to  the  terms  of  the  extension.  The  total price of the spectrum allocated to Orange is 854 million euros. Its payment is spread over 15 years for the 350 million euros for the 50 MHz block obtained at the reserve price in return for optional commitments, and over 4 years in the amount of 504 million euros for the 40 MHz block obtained during the main auction phase.\n\nThe obligations are as follows:\n\n- -the rollout of sites (3,000 sites by the end of 2022, 8,000 by the end of 2024 and 10,500 by the end of 2025), of which 25% of  those rolled out by the end of 2024 and the end of 2025 must be located in rural areas or industrial areas outside of very densely populated areas;\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8 GHz band or another band;\n- -the provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbps per sector from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of sites by the end of 2025, and 100% of sites by the end of 2030;\n\n- -coverage of the main highways by the end of 2025, major roads by the end of 2027;\n- -the provision of differentiated services and the activation of the IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) network protocol.\n\nIn addition, the optional commitments made by Orange became obligations in the authorization issued:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange will have to provide a fixed offer from sites using the 3.5 GHz band and a fixed offer to cover premises that benefit from fixed access radio network services;\n- -Orange will have to meet reasonable requests for the provision of services from private sector companies and public sector structures, provide indoor coverage, offer hosting for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and be transparent about network failures and planned rollouts.\n\n## 26 GHz band\n\nThe government and Arcep called for the creation of experimentation platforms  by  way  of  an  open  window  in  January  2019.  In  this context,  Orange  has  obtained  temporary  authorizations  for  the Chatillon campus and for a project with the SNCF (French Rail) at the Rennes station. In addition, Orange is deploying experiments outside the previous framework, notably in Dijon and at the Orange Velodrome in Marseille, in order to explore the technical and service prospects of this band.\n\n## Allocations overseas\n\nAuction procedures are underway in R\u00e9union and Mayotte. They relate to the 700 MHz and 3.4-3.8 GHz bands in R\u00e9union and the 700 MHz and 900 MHz bands in Mayotte. Arcep has published the results of the main phase. Orange has obtained:\n\n- -100 MHz in the 3.5 GHz band and 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band in R\u00e9union;\n- -10 MHz in the 700 MHz band in Mayotte.\n\nSpectrum  use  authorizations  have  a  term  of  15  years,  with  a possible extension of 5 years.\n\nArcep has published the public consultations on the draft decisions concerning  the  spectrum  allocation  (700  MHz,  900  MHz,  and 3.4-3.8 GHz) in Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint-Martin and SaintBarth\u00e9lemy.\n\nOn  January  10,  2022,  Arcep  published  the  public  consultation on the draft decisions concerning the allocation of 700 MHz and 3.4-3.8 GHz frequencies in Guyana.",

A mobile site sharing contract was signed in July 2019 between the  four  network  operators  for  the  deployment  of  4G  on  sites destined to be actively shared. This agreement is gradually being implemented for the sites of the 'Town center dead zones' program and the new sites to be deployed as part of the New Deal's targeted coverage scheme.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

        "page_content": "1 -\n\nArcep  has  issued  an  opinion  validating  an  amendment  to  the roaming agreement between Free Mobile and Orange in mainland France, which extends the national roaming termination period until December 31, 2022, while maintaining the maximum upload and download speeds that roaming customers can reach at 384 Kbps. On  December  15,  2021,  the  French  Council  of  State  rejected requests  by  SFR  and  Bouygues  Telecom  to  overturn  Arcep's opinion.\n\n## 1.7.2.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, and very high-speed broadband Internet\n\n## Regulatory framework\n\n## Adoption by Arcep of the new fixed broadband and very high-speed broadband market analysis framework for the 2021-2023 period\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Arcep adopted new decisions within the framework of analyses of the fixed broadband and very high-speed broadband markets for the 2021-2023 period.\n\nThey define, on the one hand, the asymmetric regulation (1) of the fixed broadband and very high-speed fixed broadband markets:\n\n- -a separate civil engineering contract;\n- -market '3a,' passive offers;\n- -market '3b' for activated mass market offers;\n- -market '4' for specific activated B2B offers.\n\nArcep  has  also  adopted  a  decision  aimed  at  completing  the framework  for  symmetrical  fiber  regulation  applicable  to  all operators operating FTTH networks, as well as a recommendation clarifying the application of this framework. Lastly, Arcep adopted a decision setting a price framework for access to Orange's local copper loop.\n\nThe  regulatory  changes  focus  on  three  key  objectives:  support the  switch  from  the  existing  copper  network  to  fiber,  continue pro-investment  regulation  to  make  the  FTTH  network  the  new benchmark for fixed infrastructure, and boost the B2B market.\n\n## Existing regulatory framework for the regulation of wholesale offers for the 2021-2023 period\n\n'Civil engineering' market analysis Decision No. 2020/1445 defines a  new  relevant  market  for  all  civil  engineering  infrastructure  for network rollout, and designates Orange as the operator exercising significant  influence.  As  such,  Orange  must  grant  reasonable requests for access to its civil engineering infrastructure (optical local loop offer) and associated resources and services (SAN/OAN hosting offer and LFO offer).\n\n'3a' market analysis Decision No. 2020/1446 redefines the relevant market for access to copper and fiber local loop networks (to take into  account the new 'civil engineering' market) and designates Orange as the operator exercising significant influence. As such, Orange must grant reasonable requests for access to its copper local  loop  network  and  the  associated  resources  and  services (unbundling offer). Orange must also grant, in very dense areas, reasonable  requests  for  connection  to  its  FTTH  network  from companies  located  in  buildings  not  yet  covered  by  FTTH.  This obligation only applies to Orange, unlike the rest of the regulatory framework for the pooling of FTTH networks.\n\n'3b'  market  analysis  Decision  No.  2020/1447  maintains  the relevant market for activated access ('bitstream') to copper and\n\nfiber networks for mass market customers and designates Orange as the operator exercising significant influence. As such, Orange must grant reasonable requests for activated access to its copper network (DSL access and bitstream offer).\n\n'4'  market  analysis  Decision  No.  2020/1448  maintains  the relevant  market  for  high-quality  activated  access  to  copper  and fiber networks for the B2B market and designates Orange as the operator  exercising  significant  influence.  As  such,  Orange  must grant reasonable requests for high-quality activated access to its copper and fiber networks (DSLE offer/FTTO offers).\n\nThese decisions impose on Orange obligations of transparency, non-discrimination,  quality  of  service,  publication  of  reference offers, price control and accounting separation.\n\n## Changes in the current regulatory framework for the regulation of FTTH networks\n\nDecision No. 2020-1432 supplements the symmetrical regulatory framework for the pooling of FTTH networks, notably by extending obligations that until now only applied to Orange to all infrastructure operators. Under the new decision, infrastructure operators must notably offer on their FTTH networks an offer with a recovery time guarantee (RTG) of ten hours and an RTG offer of four hours for the B2B market, possibly including an adapted architecture (FTTE). This new decision also specifies the obligations related to rollout (in particular for new buildings or buildings that can be connected on  request  and  buildings  without  an  address),  reinforces  the non-discrimination obligation (particularly with regard to information systems) and imposes an accounting reporting obligation.\n\nThe recommendation of December 8, 2020 clarifies a few additional points, in particular with regard to FTTE and the conditions for the renewal of co-funded usage rights.\n\n## Other regulatory provisions relating to fixed broadband and very high speed networks\n\nOn  May  27,  2021,  Arcep  ruled  on  a  dispute  resolution  request filed by Altitude concerning the amount of reimbursement for pole reinforcement/replacement operations carried out by third-party operators under the BLO Civil Engineering offer. Arcep arbitrated a  flat  rate  refund  of  300  euros  (replacement  or  reinforcement) applicable from May 28, 2021 for all operators.\n\n## Management of FTTH rollouts\n\n## Commitments made by Orange in the AMII zone under Article L. 33-13\n\nIn  early  2018,  Orange  formalized  its  proposed  FTTH  rollout commitments in nearly 3,000 municipalities under Article L. 33-13 of the French Postal and Electronic Communications Code. Orange proposed  that  it  commits  to  ensuring  that,  within  its  FTTH deployment scope in the AMII area: (i) by the end of 2020, 100% of homes and professional premises would have access to FTTH sales offers (including a maximum 8% of premises connectable on  demand,  excluding  refusals  by  third  parties),  and  (ii)  by  the end of 2022, 100% of homes and professional premises would be made connectable (excluding refusals by third parties). These commitment proposals took into account the agreement reached at the end of May 2018 by Orange and SFR which led to Orange withdrawing from 236 municipalities to SFR's benefit.\n\nCommitments proposed by Orange (and by SFR) were accepted by the French government on July 26, 2018 (2) .",

        "page_content": "## Calls for expressions of local commitments (AMEL) and 'equity' deployments\n\nIn  December 2017, the Government announced the launch of a procedure calling for shows of local commitments (AMEL) through which to identify operators wishing to deploy privately funded FTTH connections beyond the current AMII zone.\n\nOrange proposed to make commitments with respect to Article L.  33-13  under  AMEL  for  the  French  departments  of  Lot-etGaronne,  Vienne,  Deux-S\u00e8vres  and  Haute-Vienne.  Arcep  has issued a favorable opinion on Orange's proposed commitments in these four departments.\n\n## Completeness of FTTH networks\n\nUnder  the  obligation  of  completeness  imposed  in  Decision No.  2010/1312,  all  infrastructure  operators  must  have  made  all housing and professional premises in the rear area of a pooling point connectable (except in cases of refusal) within a reasonable period (between two and five years depending on the reasons for the decision) from the deployment of the pooling point.\n\nAt the end of 2018, and again at the end of 2020 and end of 2021, Arcep  issued  Orange  with  formal  notice  to  comply  within  one year with the completeness obligation for a list of pooling points (PPs) that had been in service for more than five years but had not reached the required completeness rate.\n\n## FTTH connection of premises\n\nThe General Directorate of Enterprises of the Ministry of the Economy and  Finance  launched  a  public  consultation  in  December  2021 relating  to  complex  connections  (civil  engineering  infrastructure necessary on the conveyance segment before connection) in public initiative zones for which the government is considering providing a State subsidy.\n\n## Price framework for access to the copper local loop\n\nOn December 17, 2020, Arcep adopted Decision No. 2020/1493, which defines a price framework for full unbundling and bitstream DSL access for the years 2021 to 2023. It sets maximum rates:\n\n- -for fully unbundled access, the monthly recurring rate is capped at 9.65 euros from 2021 to 2023;\n- -for bitstream DSL access, the monthly recurring rate is capped at 13.13 euros in 2021, 13.37 euros in 2022 and 13.53 euros in 2023.\n\n## Closure of the copper network\n\nArcep's  decision  no.  2020-1493  requires  Orange  to  present its  copper  network  closure  plan  at  least  six  months  before  the announcement of the first commercial closure, and for this plan to  be  subject  to  public  consultation.  In  accordance  with  this decision,  Arcep  has  put  Orange's  copper  closure  plan  out  to public  consultation  from  February  7  2022  to  April  4  2022  (see section 1.4.1 Business activities - France). At the same time, Arcep is consulting on a reduction in the tariff obligation in commercially closed areas, which could lead to an upward revision of the tariff for full unbundling.\n\n## Quality of service of wholesale offers for B2C and B2B markets\n\nFollowing the opening of a sanctions procedure (Article L. 36-11 of the  French  Postal  and  Electronic  Communications  Code)  in September  2018,  Arcep  issued  Orange  with  formal  notice  in December 2018 requiring  it  to  comply,  from  the  first  quarter  of\n\n2019, with certain indicators relating to production processes and after-sales service for all of the following offers:\n\n- -mass market: unbundling, offers activated without a service reinstatement time guarantee (DSL access);\n- -B2B market: LPT, copper access (DSLE, C2E, CELAN), optical access (CE2O, C2E, CELAN).\n\n## Regulation of fixed telephony\n\n## New round of market analysis\n\nAs part of its fifth round of analysis of the relevant fixed markets for  non-residential  customers  for  the  2018-2020  period,  on December  21,  2017,  Arcep  adopted  Decision  No.  2017/1568, which  restricts  the  obligation  to  formalize  a  wholesale  offer  for access to telephone service  to  the  non-residential  market  only. Wholesale non-residential line rental rates are now governed by Decision No. 2018/1523 of December 5, 2018. The subscription caps are 12.32 euros per month for analog and 18.57 euros per month for digital, and that of the call origination collected at the Operator Connection Point associated with these subscriptions is 0.6958-euro cents per minute.\n\nIn July 2020, Arcep published a public consultation on the results of this market analysis and the outlook for the sixth round, for which it  plans  to  set  the  proportion of the intensity of regulation in line with the challenges of a shrinking market, prioritize the migration of the switched telephone network (STN) directly to FTTH networks, and maintain a level playing field between Orange and alternative operators when the STN is closed.\n\n## Universal telephony service\n\nOrange  has  not  been  a  Universal  Service  Operator  since November 27, 2020, when the last three-year designation period expired.\n\nThe  transposition  of  the  European  Code  leads  to  significant changes in the implementation of universal service by the Member States:\n\n- -the  Code  extends  the  scope  of  universal  service  to  include adequate  broadband  Internet  access  at  a  fixed  location  in addition to voice communications;\n- -this  service  must  be  available  and  affordable,  including  for people on low incomes or with special social needs;\n- -the designation of one or more operators as Universal Service Operator in all or part of the country becomes the exception. Such designation may only be made after analysis based on a geographical survey (1) ,  which must demonstrate that there is  evidence  of  market  failure  and  that  other  public  policy instruments implemented are ineffective.\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  government,  Arcep  published  an  opinion on  universal  service  on  December  1,  2020 (2) .  While  reiterating that universal service intervention is now 'only subsidiary,' Arcep notes the full availability of fixed Internet access of at least 8 Mbit/s throughout the country, based on the offers of the various operators and the technological mix in use at the end of 2020.\n\nThe  Directorate  General  for  Enterprise  launched  a  public consultation  between  October  and  November  2021,  including the requirements that should be implemented for the broadband Internet component of the new universal service.\n\nOn the other hand, in its decision no. 2021/0644 of April 13, 2021, Arcep set  the  definitive  assessment  of  the  net  cost  of  universal service and operators' contributions for 2019.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

These authorizations have a term of 20 years, with a possible extension of 20 years. The coverage obligations extend from December 2022 to June 2025.\n\nTo allow the more efficient use of 5G, the government has proposed the reorganization of the spectrum obtained by operators in the 3.4  -3.8  GHz  band,  so  that  each  has  a  continuous  block.  On November 4, 2021, the CNMC issued a favorable opinion on the government's  draft  resolution,  based  on  an  agreement  reached between Telef\u00f3nica, Orange, Vodafone and M\u00e1sm\u00f3vil in July 2021. The spectrum band allocated to Orange under this project is 3,600 -3,710 MHz.\n\nIn  addition,  on  December  1,  2021,  the  Spanish  government presented  a  plan  for  connectivity,  digital  infrastructure  and  the promotion of 5G technology, with a public investment of 4.32 billion euros by 2025, of which 883 million euros are included in the 2021 budget.  The  connectivity  plan  includes  measures  to  encourage the deployment of very high speed broadband in urban centers and  unpopulated  areas,  so  that  by  2025,  100  Mbps  speed  will be achieved for 100% of the population. The 5G promotion plan includes measures to support network deployment, with the goal of  covering  75%  of  the  Spanish  population  with  5G,  as  well  as uninterrupted 5G coverage by 2025 on major roads, on railways and in airports.\n\n## 1.7.3.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed\n\nbroadband Internet\n\n## Wholesale broadband access markets\n\nThe CNMC adopted on October 6 and published on October 15, 2021  its  decision  to  analyze  the  markets  for  wholesale  local\n\naccess at a fixed location and central access at a fixed location, corresponding to 1/2020 (formerly 3a/2014) and 3b/2014 markets, whereby it decided:\n\n- -regarding the 1/2020 market:\n- -to  retain  the  copper  network  unbundling  obligations introduced  in  the  previous  2016  market  analysis  and  to retain access to Telef\u00f3nica civil engineering infrastructure,\n- -not to impose ex ante asymmetrical obligations on Telef\u00f3nica for  the  fiber  network  in  696  municipalities  considered effectively  competitive  (compared to 66 municipalities in the 2016 market analysis), representing 70% of the Spanish population, given that a Virtual Unbundled Local Access (VULA) offer must be made available for the rest of Spain;\n- -regarding the 3b/2014 market:\n- -to  deregulate  bitstream  access  in  the  area  declared non-competitive  for  copper  and  NGA  and  to  impose a  NEBA  fiber  offer  at  rates  that  satisfy  the  economic replicability test with no time limit.\n\nRegarding  the  2/2020  market  (formerly  the  4/2014  market),  the CNMC launched a consultation in December 2020, proposing to maintain  most  of  the  obligations  on  Telef\u00f3nica.  The  decision  is expected in 2022.\n\n## NEBA reference offers (bitstream)\n\nSince 2018, the CNMC has revised the 'economic replicability test' (ERT)  of  Telef\u00f3nica's  offers,  which  is  used  to  set  the  wholesale price of fiber. This test should confirm that the prices of Telef\u00f3nica's wholesale fiber offers (NEBA-local and NEBA-fiber) allow alternative operators to replicate the main fiber offers offered by the incumbent.\n\nIn  December 2020, the CNMC published the results of the third ERT review. As a result, Telef\u00f3nica had to lower its access prices to the NEBA and VULA offers to 16.86 euros. This rate could change again in connection with the cost of capital review initiated by the CNMC in August 2021.\n\nThe National Commission for Markets and Competition (CNMC), established  by  law  no.  3/2013  of  June  4,  2013,  brings  together regulatory authorities from different economic sectors, including telecommunications, and the antitrust authority.\n\nThe Ministry of the Economy and the Digital Transition (2) is in charge of  managing  authorizations,  spectrum  allocation,  numbering, approval of the cost of universal service, quality of service, as well as the settlement of disputes between consumers and operators that do not hold a dominant position.",

The law of December 2012, transposing EU directives issued in 2009, came into force on January 21, 2013. The law of May 7, 2010, on developing telecommunication networks and services, provides access to telecommunications and other technical  infrastructures  funded  by  public  funds.  This  law  was revised and amended on August 30, 2019 by transposing Directive 2014/61/EU on broadband cost reduction.\n\nThe  transposition  of  the  Code  by  a  new  law  on  electronic communications was the subject of a public consultation opened in July 2020. Legislative work is ongoing.\n\n## 1.7.4.2 Regulation of mobile telephony\n\n## Spectrum\n\n## / Summary of spectrum allocated to Orange and their expiration year\n\n| 800 MHz       | 900 MHz      | 1,800 MHz     | 2.1 GHz       | 2.6 GHz       |\n|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| 10 MHz duplex | 7 MHz duplex | 10 MHz duplex | 15 MHz duplex | 15 MHz duplex |\n| (2030)        | (2029)       | (2027)        | +5 MHz (2022) | (2030)        |\n\nInternal source.\n\n## 5G\n\n700 MHz band: as part of the deregulation of 700 MHz spectrum for mobile networks, the UKE has initiated a coordination process with  neighboring  countries,  including  Russia.  On  January  11, 2019,  Poland  asked  the  European  Commission  to  extend  the deadline to June 2022 due to spectrum coordination problems at borders. In addition, a draft law on cybersecurity, introduced by the government, currently provides for the creation of a State-owned strategic  security  network  using  the  700  MHz  band  to  provide telecommunication  and  cybersecurity  services  in  the  areas  of defense, State security and public safety. However, the work is still in progress and the bill has not yet been submitted to Parliament.\n\n3.4-3.8  GHz  spectrum  band:  on  March  15,  2019,  Parliament adopted,  then  published  on  April  5,  2019  amendments  to  the Telecommunications Act allowing operators to use the 3.4-3.8 GHz spectrum bands free of charge for the testing of new technologies or for the reallocation of spectrum. Auctions began on March 6, 2020, but were canceled on May 20, 2020 following the entry into force on May 16, 2020 of the law on the Covid-19 health crisis, which  introduced  security  obligations  regarding  the  spectrum allocation procedure. The new security constraints forced the UKE to start the procedure again from scratch.\n\nAs a result of these constraints on the allocation of spectrum in the 700 MHz and 3.4-3.8 GHz bands, 5G allocations have been delayed until 2022.\n\n## Infrastructure sharing\n\nThe  network  sharing  agreement  between  Orange  and  T-Mobile Polska,  which  dates  from  2011,  was  extended  to  4G  in December 2016. On May 22, 2018, Orange and T-Mobile decided to end spectrum sharing in the 900 MHz and 1,800 MHz bands.\n\n## 1.7.4.3 Regulation of fixed telephony, broadband and very high-speed broadband Internet\n\nThe  ex-ante  regulation  of  Orange's  fixed  services,  for  the  areas defined as non-competitive, relates solely to wholesale offers.\n\n## Analysis of the wholesale very high-speed broadband market (markets 3a/2014 and 3b/2014)\n\nOn October 22, 2019, the UKE published the decisions relating to markets 3a/2014 and 3b/2014.\n\nAccording to  the  regulator,  market  development  and  increasing competition justify further market deregulation. As a result, UKE decided to increase the number of deregulated zones:\n\n- -in market 3a/2014, to 51 municipalities;\n- -in market 3b/2014, to 151 municipalities.\n\nUnder  these  new  decisions,  out  of  a  total  of  approximately 14.6  million  households,  around  six  million  households  are deregulated  on  bitstream  access,  of  which  around  2.3  million households are deregulated on bitstream access and unbundling.\n\n## Reference offer for fixed markets\n\nThe reference offer relates to all wholesale fixed-line services: call origination and termination, wholesale subscription, partial and total unbundling, and bitstream access.\n\nIn  September  2020,  the  European  Commission  approved  the changes to Orange's reference offer without comment. However, no decision has been published since this validation.\n\nThe  Ministry  of  Digitization,  created  in  November  2015,  was incorporated into the Prime Minister's Office on November 6, 2020, as a result of the government reshuffle.\n\nThe  Office  of  Electronic  Communications  (UKE)  is  responsible, in  particular,  for  telecommunication  regulation  and  spectrum management, as well as certain functions related to broadcasting services. In May 2021, the government introduced changes to the Telecommunications Act regarding the appointment and removal of the UKE President. However, in September 2021, the European Commission referred Poland to the EU Court of Justice for infringing the freedom of the national regulator.\n\nThe Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) is responsible for the application of competition law, merger control and consumer protection.\n\n- 1\n\n1",

These  temporary rights  allow  the  first  developments,  and  are  applicable  until  the allocations by auction. These BIPT decisions have been appealed against before the Market Court by associations opposed to 5G. These appeals were dismissed in May 2021.\n\nOn January 21, 2021, the government approved the Royal Decree and the draft law establishing the framework for 5G allocations in the 700 MHz, 1,400 MHz and 3.4 - 3.8 GHz spectrum bands, as well as the renewal of the licenses in the 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz bands that expired in March 2021. Taking into account the  delay  in  launching  the  allocation  procedure,  BIPT  granted temporary rights of use in these bands for a period of six months, the last decision on March 11, 2022, granting temporary rights until September 15, 2022.\n\nOn October 21, 2021, the Council of Ministers approved the royal decrees  covering  the  5G  auction,  which  were  published  in  late December 2021.\n\nOn January 14, 2022, BIPT launched the calls for applications for the allocation procedure of these frequencies.\n\n## Cable wholesale broadband markets\n\nAs  part  of  the  review  of  the  wholesale  cable  broadband markets  launched  in  July  2017  by  the  Conference  of  Electronic Communications  Regulators  (CRC)13],  the  new  decision  was published by the CRC on June 29, 2018.

Licenses in the 700 MHz band are valid  for  twenty  years, until  December 31, 2040. Licenses in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz band are valid until December 31, 2025. In this context, Orange acquired 2x10 MHz in the 700 MHz spectrum band for 33.6 million euros.\n\nIn  the  3.4-3.8  GHz  band,  on  March  1,  2022  the  UK  launched  a tender for licenses for a period of use between 2025 and 2045.

The regulator eased regulations:\n\n- -in  market 3a, by excluding unbundling of the local sub-loop, while maintaining unbundling in the local copper loop, and by l i miting the regulatory obligations of NGA offers to the economic replicability test and to a technical equivalence of inputs;\n- -in market 3b, by imposing a replicability test of 2P offers and multicast IPTV wholesale access offers, instead of regulated prices;\n- -in  market  4,  by  eliminating  the  sector-based  regulatory obligations, because of the competitive nature of the market.\n\nThe RU published rate caps for access to fixed physical infrastructure (civil engineering) on October 17, 2018. The maximum monthly fees are as follows: access to ducts (0.257 euro/month/meter), HDPE tube (0.128 euro/month/meter) and micro-tube (0.116 euro/month/ meter). This is a significant decrease in the access rates for the infrastructure.\n\n## Wholesale broadband markets\n\nIn the context of its third round of analysis of the 3a and 3b markets, on October 19, 2020, Ancom confirmed that the retail broadband market is effectively competitive, and that, as a consequence, no obligation should be imposed on the two wholesale markets. The European Commission approved the conclusions, while suggesting that the market be monitored. These items should also take into account the takeover of the incumbent operator TKR by Orange Romania  on  September  30,  2021  (see  section  1.3  Significant events).\n\n- 1\n\n1",

Orange's view at the date of this Universal Registration Document is that these risks could have a material adverse effect (i) on its business, financial position, earnings, reputation or outlook, or (ii) on its stakeholders. In  addition,  other  risks  and  uncertainties,  as  yet  unidentified  or, at the date of this Universal Registration Document, not currently considered to be material by Orange, could have similar adverse effects. Investors could lose all or part of their investment if these risks were to materialize.\n\nThe  assessment  of  the  materiality  of  these  risks  is  based  on criteria that are stable over time. They take into account the results of mitigation policies implemented by Orange. Only the risks still deemed material at Group level, despite these policies, are set out below. See Section 2.2.1 Group audit, control and risk management.\n\nRisks are presented in this section under four categories:\n\n- -for Orange:\n- -operational  risks  relating  to  Orange's  business  activities (see Section 2.1.1),\n- -risks of a legal nature (see Section 2.1.2),\n- -financial risks (see Section 2.1.3);\n- -for Orange and its stakeholders: the main 'non-financial' risks relating  to  the  employee-related,  social  and  environmental consequences  of  Orange's  business  activities,  and  the effects of those activities in terms of respect for human rights, anti-corruption measures and tax evasion (see Section 2.1.4).\n\nThese  categories  are  not  presented  in  order  of  importance. However,  within  each  category,  risk  factors  are  presented  in descending order of importance as determined by Orange at the date of this Universal Registration Document. Orange may change its view of their relative importance at any time, notably in the event of external or internal developments.\n\n## 2.1.1 Operational  risks\n\nOperational risks mainly include risks related to the telecommunication sector, and risks related to Orange's strategy and  business.  In  addition,  risks  with  potentially  significant employee-related,  social  and  environmental  consequences  are presented in Section 2.1.4.\n\nA high concentration of Orange's critical suppliers and global supply tensions for a large number of products represent a risk for the Group's activities.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange's  critical  suppliers,  particularly  in  the  areas  of  network infrastructure, information systems and mobile devices, operate in highly consolidated markets.\n\nSeveral other sections of this Universal Registration Document also discuss risks in some detail:\n\n- -with respect to risks relating to the global telecommunication services  market,  Orange's  overall  strategy  and  its  business model, see Section 1.2;\n- -with  respect  to  risks  relating  to  regulation  and  regulatory pressure, see Section 1.7 Regulation of activities and Note 18 Litigation to the consolidated financial statements (Section 3.3);\n- -with respect to risks relating to litigation involving the Group, see also Note 10 Taxes and Note 18 Litigation to the consolidated financial  statements  and,  where  applicable,  Section  3.2.1 Recent events;\n- -with respect to risks relating to the Group's employee-related, social and environmental responsibility, see Chapter 4;\n- -with respect to financial risks, see:\n- -Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of the main activities and specific risk factors that may affect this amount,\n- -Notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements for asset impairments,\n- -Note  13.8  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  for derivatives,\n- -Note 14 to the  consolidated  financial  statements  for  the management of interest rate risk,  foreign  exchange  risk, liquidity risk, covenants, credit risk and counterparty risk, and equity market risk. The policies for managing interest rate,  foreign  exchange  and  liquidity  risk  are  set  by  the Treasury and Financing Committee. See Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees;\n- -for the insurance plan, see Section 2.2.3.3 Insurance;\n- -more  generally,  risk  management  policies  throughout  the Orange group are discussed in Section 2.2 Activity and risk management framework,  which  is  an  integral  part  of  the Management Report.\n\nDespite  Orange's  secure  purchasing  policies,  this  consolidation poses a risk to the Group's current or future business (for example, the supply of hardware for 5G networks) in the event that one of these  suppliers  were  to  fail  or  decided  to  change  its  business practices,  regardless  of  the  cause,  including  in  the  event  of international economic sanctions against such critical supplier or its country of origin.\n\nThis  risk  of  failure  is  heightened  by  the  shortages  linked  to  the specific conditions of some markets, such as the one for electronic components, and by the intensity of the global economic recovery which has caused tension in the supply of numerous products and raw materials.\n\nIf a critical supplier were to fail to deliver on Orange's purchasing requirements, Orange's business, earnings and reputation could be permanently adversely affected.",

        "page_content": "Orange  is  faced  with  constantly  increasing  demand  for connectivity  and  must  therefore  accelerate  the  rollout  of its  networks  while  improving  quality  of  service,  but  such investments are constrained by the availability of resources.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange must accelerate the rollout of its fixed and mobile broadband and very high-speed networks in regional areas and improve the quality  of  service  of  its  networks  to  meet  the  high  demand  for connectivity related to the changes in use of such services. Orange has also made commitments regarding geographic coverage and quality  of  service  to  central  government  and  local  authorities  in France. However, Orange's investment capacity is constrained by the availability of human, industrial and financial resources, both its  own  and  those  of  its  subcontractors.  Against  that  backdrop, Orange has ramped up its strategy of co-financing investments and pooling its network infrastructure.\n\nFailure  to  meet  these  expectations  in  a  balanced  manner could have an adverse effect on Orange's earnings and reputation.\n\nOrange is exposed to the risk of an interruption of its services, especially in case of cyberattacks.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nDue to the essential nature of telecommunications, compounded by  the  massive  take-up  of  telework,  the  networks  of telecommunications  operators  are  particularly  exposed  to  risks of service disruption linked to intentional and sometimes criminal acts.  Interruptions  to  the  services  provided  to  customers  may occur as a result of malicious acts such as infrastructure sabotage or  via  increasingly  sophisticated  cyberattacks,  which  are  now  a permanent threat for  both  individuals  and  businesses,  or  at  the request of government or judicial authorities.\n\nInterruptions  may  also  be  unintentional.  They  can  occur  as  a result  of  extreme  weather  events,  human  error,  such  as  when subcontractors work on shared infrastructure, in conjunction with the failure of a critical supplier, or when new applications or software are rolled out or when they are updated. Lastly, they can occur as a result of capacity saturation resulting from the development of digital uses in economic life.\n\nDespite  the  business  continuity  and  crisis  management measures  taken  by  Orange  to  protect  its  networks  and  resize them, the frequency of increasingly numerous cyberattacks, the implementation of all-IP technologies, the increase in the size of service platforms and the consolidation of equipment in a reduced number of locations mean that service interruptions could affect a larger number of customers and several countries at the same time in the future.\n\nSuch events may disrupt activity not only of Orange customers but - more widely - of all citizens, and may even affect their health and safety. They could cause serious damage to Orange's reputation, give rise to liability claims against it and result in a reduction in traffic and revenue, thereby adversely impacting its earnings and outlook. If they were to occur at the level of one or several countries, they could also trigger crisis situations potentially affecting the security of the countries concerned.\n\n- 2\n\nThe shift of Orange's ecosystem toward a more open and fragmented model enables global players to take an increasing share of the service and network value chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompetition  with  numerous  actors,  such  as  over-the-top  (OTT) service  providers  and  Internet  market  leaders,  in  providing value-added services using existing networks is spreading to the majority of services offered by Orange. Operators such as Orange, for which the direct relationship with customers is a source of value, could be marginalized.\n\nMoreover, the opening up and fragmentation of network ecosystems enables  existing  players  (infrastructure  managers,  non-telecom networked businesses such as railways, local authorities or Cloud service providers) to offer network services, and new players (SDWAN, etc.) to position themselves as aggregators of such services, a role traditionally filled by integrated operators such as Orange.\n\nThese developments could adversely affect Orange's revenue and margins.\n\nA  large  part  of  Orange's  revenues  is  generated  in  highly competitive and regulated markets, where pricing pressure remains strong.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange has little ability to raise the prices of its services due to the persistently fierce competition in all the markets in which it operates and the decisions of industry regulators and competition authorities regulating prices in certain areas. Against this backdrop, Orange continues its transformation policy toward a multi-service operator model by proposing convergent offers, by developing its business in high-growth sectors and regions such as cyberdefense or Africa and the Middle East and by improving the quality of its services. If Orange were unable to implement this strategy, it could lose market share and see its margins narrow.\n\nFurthermore, the current inflationary trends weigh on operational margins and, considering its pricing model, it is not certain that Orange will be able to pass on customers all the costs increases that it may incur.\n\nFor  further  information  about  competition,  see  Section  1.4 Operating activities.\n\nOrange is exposed to risks of inappropriate disclosure or modification of stakeholder data in its possession, particularly in the event of cyberattacks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange's  business  activities  require  the  transmission  through its  networks  and  storage  on  its  infrastructure  of  data  belonging to  business  or  government  customers,  suppliers,  partners  and all  stakeholders  other  than  natural  persons  (see  Section  2.1.4 for  information  relating  to  risks  regarding  personal  data).  The increasing  use  of  Cloud  services  and  the  outsourcing  of  digital services exposes Orange to risks of loss, disclosure, unauthorized communication  to  third  parties  or  inappropriate  modification  of such data, potentially resulting from (i) the implementation of new services or applications or their updates, (ii) the development of new businesses in the field of connected objects, (iii) malicious acts (such as cyberattacks) targeting data in Orange's possession, or (iv) negligence or errors that may be committed within Orange or by Group partners to which certain operations are outsourced.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2",

Moreover,  even  though  the  Group's  stakeholders  have  high expectations  in  terms  of  security,  given  Orange's  positioning  as a trusted operator, its reputation could be significantly adversely affected,  which  would  then  have  a  material  effect  on  its  future earnings.\n\nOrange's broad geographic footprint and the scope of its activities expose it to geopolitical, macroeconomic, fiscal and regulatory risks.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOrange has a large base of business in countries or geographic areas marked by political, economic, regulatory or fiscal instability, or countries in which the Group's contribution to local economic activity is significant while its image is sometimes linked with the French  State.  In  this  uncertain  context,  Orange  is  exposed  to decisions contrary to its interests taken by governmental or judicial authorities, such as requests to interrupt services, or new taxes or fines that, if contested, could lead the authorities to decide to suspend services.\n\nMoreover, the value or sustainability of investments made in certain countries could be negatively impacted by international economic sanctions imposed on those countries.\n\nSuch situations  could  call  into  question  the  profitability  outlook justifying investment decisions and adversely impact the Group's financial position and earnings.\n\nThe development of Mobile Financial Services activities in an increasing number of countries confronts Orange with risks specific to this sector in each of its host countries.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nMobile Financial Services, including banking, expose Orange to industry-specific risks such as money laundering, terrorist financing and non-compliance with economic sanctions programs, as well as common risks that are particularly sensitive in Mobile Financial Services, such as fraud, cyberattacks and service disruption.\n\nIf they were to materialize, these risks could have a material effect on the Group's reputation and financial position.\n\nOrange's technical infrastructure is vulnerable to damage caused  by  intentional  or  accidental  damage,  but  also  by natural disasters, the occurrence of which is increased due to climate change.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nNatural  disasters,  intentional  damage  caused  by  war,  terrorism or social unrest, as well as other accidental events such as fires, errors or negligence during civil engineering work on infrastructure could lead to significant destruction of Orange's facilities, resulting in both service interruptions and high repair costs. The frequency and  intensity  of  weather  events  related  to  the  ongoing  climate change  (e.g.,  floods,  storms,  heat  waves)  continue  to  increase, which  could  aggravate  disasters  and  increase  related  damage. These  developments  increasingly  occur  in  a  context  where  the\n\nexpectations of Orange customers and other stakeholders remain high  with  respect  to  its  capacity  to  provide  service  continuity, including in the case of extreme weather events. In the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and facilities located near the  coast  more  often.  While  the  scope  of  coverage  of  related claims by insurers has decreased and could decrease further, the damage caused by major events or natural disasters could result in significant costs that may have to be borne by Orange, and could thus seriously and adversely affect its financial position and outlook.\n\nOrange's strategy to develop its new growth drivers may fail to yield the expected results.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange's strategy is to develop its business in high-growth regions, with a particular focus on Mobile Financial Services, cybersecurity and B2B IT services.  Although  based  on  the  Group's  strengths (capacity  for  innovation,  digital  expertise,  distribution  strength, broad  footprint  in  the  MEA  region  and  brand  awareness),  the development of these businesses requires significant  resources without guaranteeing that the use of the corresponding services will gain sufficient traction to generate a return on these investments.\n\nIf Orange were unable to implement this strategy, it could impact the growth of its revenue and its outlook.\n\nThe  Group's  brand  policy,  combined  with  a  strategy  of geographic expansion and diversification into new businesses, represents a risk for the Orange brand image.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange's strategy of accelerating its business activities in growth areas entails execution risks inherent to new businesses (Mobile Banking and cyberdefense for example) and to the countries into which the Group is expanding. If these risks were to materialize, and although the Group pays great attention to preserving the value of the major asset represented by the Orange brand, they could adversely affect the company's reputation.\n\nIn the event of significant damage to the Orange brand image, the Group's earnings and outlook could be affected.\n\nThe  scope  of  Orange's  business  activities  and  the interconnection of its networks expose the company to a variety of acts of technical fraud, specific to the telecommunication sector.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange  faces  various  types  of  fraud  on  its  telecommunication services activities,  which  may  target  it  directly  or  its  customers. In  a  context  of  increasing  technological  complexity,  network virtualization, and acceleration of the implementation of new services or new applications, types of fraud that are more difficult to detect or control may also appear, favored for instance by the development of mass data processing and artificial intelligence, which increases scope for possible attacks, particularly cyberattacks.\n\nIf significant fraud were to occur, Orange's revenue, margins, quality of service and reputation could be adversely affected.",

Orange must also comply with its own regulatory obligations and oversight by authorities seeking to maintain effective market competition, as well as, in some countries, additional constraints owing to its historically dominant position in the fixed telecommunication market.\n\nOrange's business and earnings could be materially affected by changes in laws or regulations, some of which may be extraterritorial in nature, or by changes in government policy, including decisions made by regulatory or competition authorities regarding:\n\n- -the modification or renewal under unfavorable conditions, or even the withdrawal, of fixed or mobile operator licenses;\n- -conditions  governing  network  access  (primarily  those  in connection with roaming or infrastructure sharing);\n- -service rates;\n- -the introduction of new taxes or increases in existing taxes on telecommunication companies, including  the  introduction  of taxes aimed at facilitating the achievement of countries' carbon neutrality targets (such as taxes on use or handset purchases);\n- -banking and financial supervision, and any related compliance regulations  such  as  laws  and  regulations  on  economic sanctions;\n- -non-financial corporate obligations;\n- -data security;\n- -merger and acquisition policy;\n- -regulations affecting operators of competing sectors, such as cable;\n- -consumerism legislation.\n\nSuch  changes,  developments  or  decisions  could  materially adversely affect the Group's revenue and earnings.\n\nFor  further  information  on  regulatory  risks,  see  Section  1.7 Regulation of telecommunication activities.\n\nOrange is regularly involved in litigation, the outcome of which could have a material adverse effect on its earnings, financial position or reputation.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange  believes  that,  in  general  and  in  the  countries  where  it operates, it complies in all material respects with the regulations in force relating to its activities and its relations with its partners, suppliers,  sub-contractors  and  customers,  as  well  as  with  the conditions governing its operator licenses. However, it is not able to predict the decisions of supervisory or judicial authorities, which are regularly asked to rule on such issues. If Orange were to be ordered by the competent authorities of a country in which it operates to pay an indemnity or a fine, or to suspend certain of its business activities, based on a breach of applicable regulations, its financial position and earnings could be significantly adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, Orange (particularly in France and Poland) is frequently involved  in  proceedings  with  its  competitors  and  the  regulatory authorities due to its pre-eminent position in certain of the markets where it operates, and the claims made against Orange can be very substantial. In the past, the Group has been fined several tens of millions of euros or even several hundreds of millions of euros for cartel practices or for abusing its dominant position. The Group is also involved in substantial commercial litigation with potentially very  significant  penalties.  The  outcome  of  lawsuits  is  inherently unpredictable.\n\nFor  proceedings  before  the  European  competition  authorities, the maximum amount of fines provided for by law is 10% of the consolidated revenue of the offending company (or the group to which it belongs, as the case may be).\n\nLastly, due in particular to its relationships with numerous partners, suppliers and subcontractors, Orange is exposed to a growing risk of legal action by various stakeholders from civil society alleging shortcomings  on  environmental,  employee-related  or  social matters. That could be the case, for instance, if Orange were to distribute products that are found to contain rare minerals extracted under  non-compliant  conditions.  Such  actions  could  cause significant damage to Orange's reputation.\n\nThe main proceedings involving Orange are described in Note 10 Taxes  and  Note  18  Litigation  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.  Developments  in  or  the  outcome  of  some  or  all  of these ongoing proceedings could have a material adverse effect on Orange's earnings or financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

Unfavorable changes in the macroeconomic environment could restrict Orange's access  to  its  usual  sources  of  funding  or  significantly  increase financing costs through an increase in market interest rates and/or the spreads applied to its borrowings.\n\nAny inability  to  access  the  financial  markets  for  a  lasting  period and/or obtain financing on reasonable terms would have a material adverse  effect  on  Orange.  In  particular,  the  Group  may  not  be able to carry out certain projects or could be forced to allocate a significant portion of its available cash to servicing or repaying its debt, to the detriment of investment or shareholder returns. In any event, Orange's earnings, cash flows and, more generally, its financial position and flexibility could be adversely affected.\n\nSee  Note  14.3  Liquidity risk management  to  the  consolidated financial statements, which sets out the different sources of funding available  to  Orange,  the  maturity  of  its  debt  and  changes  in  its credit rating, as well as Note 14.4 Financial ratios, which contains information  on  the  limited  commitments  of  the  Orange  group  in relation  to  financial  ratios  and  in  the  event  of  default  or  material adverse change.\n\n## Risk of asset impairment\n\nChanges  affecting  the  economic,  political  or  regulatory environment may result in asset impairment, particularly of goodwill.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the gross value of goodwill recognized by Orange following acquisitions was 33.6 billion euros.\n\nThe carrying book values of long-term assets, including goodwill, fixed  assets  and  interests  in  associates  and  joint  ventures  are sensitive to any change in the environment that is different from the  assumptions used. Orange recognizes impairment on those assets if events or circumstances occur that entail material adverse\n\n## 2.1.4 Non-financial risks\n\nThe various non-financial risks, included in the scope of Orange's Statement  of  Non-Financial  Performance  (SNFP),  are  identified, assessed and managed using the same methodology as that used for operational risks related to its business, legal risks and financial market risks.\n\nIn its SNFP, Orange presents the material employee-related, social and environmental risks to which its business activities may give rise, whether for itself or its stakeholders, as well as corruption risks and matters relating to business ethics and the fight against tax\n\nchanges of a lasting nature, affecting the economic environment or the assumptions or objectives adopted at the time of the acquisition.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  recognized  3.7  billion  euros  of  impairment  on goodwill in Spain. Over the last five years, Orange has significantly impaired its investments in the Democratic Republic of Congo and in Jordan.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  cumulative  amount  of  goodwill impairment was 9.4 billion euros, excluding impairment of interests in  associates  and  joint  ventures  which  include  in  certain  cases goodwill in their carrying value.\n\nNew events or unfavorable circumstances could prompt Orange to review the current value of its assets and to recognize further material  impairment  that  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  its earnings. Sensitivity analyses carried out at December 31, 2021 with respect to Spain and Romania revealed additional estimated impairment  risks  of  up  to  3%  and  16%  of  net  goodwill  values respectively.\n\nIn addition, in the event of a disposal or IPO, the value of certain subsidiaries may be affected by changes in the equity and bond markets.\n\nFor  further  information  on  goodwill  and  recoverable  amounts (particularly  key  assumptions  and  sensitivity),  see  Note  7 Impairment losses and goodwill and Note 8.3 Impairment of fixed assets to the consolidated financial statements and Section 3.1.2.2 Group operating income.\n\n## Credit-rating risk\n\nA change in Orange's credit rating could increase the cost of debt and in some cases limit access to the financing Orange needs.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nOrange's  credit  rating  from  rating  agencies  is  based  partly on  factors  beyond  its  control,  namely  conditions  affecting  the telecommunication  industry  in  general  or  conditions  affecting certain  of  the  countries  or  regions  in  which  it  operates.  It  may be changed at any time by the rating agencies, in particular as a result of changing economic conditions, a downturn in the Group's earnings or performance, or changes to its shareholding structure. A prolonged multi-notch downgrade in Orange's rating would have a material adverse effect on its financing terms.\n\nevasion.  These  items  were  assessed  in  relation  to  non-financial challenges (see Section 2.2.2).\n\nCombating  tax  evasion,  food  waste  and  food  insecurity,  and promoting  respect  for  animal  well-being  and  responsible  food practices were all taken into account in Orange's non-financial risk assessment. However, they were not considered likely to give rise to material risks to the Group's operations or reputation.",

This includes, for example, their banking details, which form the basis of Orange's Mobile Financial Services business.\n\nThe occurrence of these risks could result in particular from (i) the implementation  of  new  services  or  applications  or  their  update, (ii)  the  development  of  new  activities  in  the  field  of  connected objects or Mobile Financial Services, (iii) malicious acts (such as cyberattacks)  targeting  personal  data,  (iv)  negligence  or  errors committed within Orange or within the Group's partners to whom certain operations are outsourced, or (v) government requests that are not compliant with legal or regulatory requirements (see also the risk factor 'The scope of Orange's business activities, its numerous locations around the world, and its business dealings with a variety of partners may expose the Group to a risk of breaching human rights and fundamental freedoms').\n\nOrange may be held liable in various countries under laws relating to  the  protection  of  personal  data  (such  as  the  General  Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, GDPR), which reinforces the rights of individuals and the obligations of companies involved in data processing, such as telecommunications operators and financial services providers. If these risks were to materialize, the owners of the data disclosed or modified could suffer damage, and the Group could be held liable, its corporate purpose could be questioned and its reputation could be substantially affected.\n\nOrange faces a variety of internal and external risks relating to human health and safety.\n\n## High \u25cf\u25cf\u25cf\n\nOwing to the specific nature of Orange's business as an operator and the scope of its geographical location, international conflicts and a context where social tensions and labor unrest are increasing expose  Orange  employees  and  subcontractors  to  risks  to  their safety while performing their professional activities.\n\nFurthermore, against a backdrop of increasingly regular telework, sometimes a source of social isolation, the employees of Orange and its subcontractors are exposed to risks to their health and even their safety.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group's  transformation  program  linked  to  the Engage 2025 strategic plan and the rapid acceleration of online interactions could generate psychosocial risks, potential sources of physical or psychological disability for individuals. Such risks could also slow the rollout of the Group's strategy and have a material impact on its reputation and operation.\n\nIn the future, Orange may find it difficult to obtain and retain the skills needed for its business on a long-term basis due to numerous employee departures and ever-faster developments in its activities.\n\n## Medium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nEvery year, a significant number of people leave their employment or other relationship with the Group or, in France, may benefit from end-of-career  part-time  work  arrangements.  This  trend  could accelerate in 2022, particularly within the various Group's corporate functions as part of the implementation of the new intergenerational agreement in December 2021 (see Section 1.3 Significant events).\n\nAt  the  same  time,  the  need  for  new  skills  is  growing,  whether related to technological developments or the Group's development in professions in high demand in the job market. This could affect Orange's ability to effectively pursue its activities and implement its strategy. If Orange's attractiveness as an employer or its training programs were to prove insufficient, its earnings and outlook could be adversely affected, and some of the human risks described in the risk factor 'Orange faces a variety of internal and external risks relating to human health and safety' could increase.\n\nIn addition, without the necessary skills, the aim of providing digital support to stakeholders, which is part of the Engage 2025 strategic plan, could prove harder to achieve.\n\nOrange is exposed to risks of corruption, or individual or collective behavior that is not in line with its business ethics or which may also be fraudulent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the Group's activities and those of its suppliers, subcontractors and partners cover all regions of the world, Orange could, despite its  efforts  to  continually  improve  its  anti-corruption  system  in accordance with applicable laws, be exposed to or implicated in cases related to corrupt practices or influence peddling. Similarly, despite its fraud prevention and detection program, Orange could also  be  the  victim  of  fraudulent  behavior  or  behavior  that  does not  comply with international  conventions,  its  Code  of  Ethics  or its  supplier  code  of  conduct.  Such  behavior may originate from persons or companies with which a direct or indirect link can be established,  and  may  directly  target  Orange,  its  customers,  its business relationships or its employees.\n\nIn any event, the Group could be held liable, and Orange's earnings, quality of service and reputation could be adversely affected.\n\nOrange and some of its stakeholders are exposed to physical and transitional risks related to climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the impacts on Orange's infrastructure (see Section 2.1.1,  Operational  risks  -  Orange's technical infrastructure is vulnerable to damage caused by intentional or accidental damage, but also by natural disasters, the occurrence of which is increased due to climate change), climate change could also have a negative impact  on  the  activities  of  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors.  It could  also  exacerbate  inequalities  and  health  crises  among  the population, and generate significant migration flows, particularly in the MEA region, on which the Group's prospects for growth in part depend.

Such violations may relate to forced labor, modern slavery or human trafficking, the rights of children, non-decent, discriminatory or dangerous working conditions, interference with freedom of association or expression, or privacy. In particular, they could occur in regions where minerals are mined, processed and traded in conflict zones, or areas where human rights are not respected. The reduced capacity of Orange to  exercise  its  supervision  via  on-site  audits  (due  to  continued restrictions on international travel) aggravates these risks.\n\nIf  they  were  to  materialize,  these  risks  could  have  a  significant adverse  impact  on  Orange,  or  its  suppliers  and  subcontractors concerned, in terms of image and reputation, and could result in liability for the Group.\n\nMoreover,  Orange  may  be  required,  in  the  countries  where  it operates, to comply with injunctions from local authorities that do not comply with legal or regulatory requirements. These injunctions, the frequency of which is increasing with the growing role played by digital technologies in society, may involve a suspension (in full, in part, or in a given region) of certain networks for which Orange is  responsible,  or  the  interception  of  communications,  or  the disclosure of personal data to third parties. Complying with such injunctions may therefore infringe upon freedom of expression or other fundamental freedoms.\n\nIf  Orange  were  to  fail  to  enforce  applicable  laws  or  regulations, such injunctions could have a significant impact on the image and reputation of both Orange and the offending countries, and could result in an infringement of freedom of expression and privacy for civil society or the targets of such requests.\n\nExposure to electromagnetic fields from telecommunications equipment  could  have  harmful  effects  on  health  and  the perception  of  such  a  risk  could  hinder  the  development of services. Excessive and inappropriate use of telecommunication services and equipment could also have harmful consequences on health.\n\nMedium \u25cf\u25cf\u00b7\n\nFollowing concerns raised in many countries regarding the possible health  risks  linked  to  exposure  to  electromagnetic  fields  from telecommunication equipment, public authorities have in general approved binding regulations and health authorities have issued various precautions on usage.\n\nThere is a consensus among expert groups and health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), that no health risk has been established to date from exposure to electromagnetic fields  below  the  limits  recommended  by  the  International Commission  on  Non-Ionizing  Radiation  Protection  (ICNIRP). The  first  complementary  scientific  studies  conducted  on  some of  these  frequencies  used  for  5G  have  come  up  with  similar findings.  However,  Orange  cannot  prejudge  the  conclusions  of future  scientific  research  or  future  assessments  by  international organizations  and  scientific  committees  mandated  to  examine these issues. If an adverse health effect were to be scientifically established, it would have a significant adverse effect on Orange's business,  brand  image  and  the  Group's  earnings  and  financial position. Beyond potential adverse effects on Orange, this could significantly curb the development of the digital society.\n\nPublic perception of a risk to human health or biodiversity could lead to a reduction in the number of customers and their level of use, as well as an increase in litigation, particularly against the installation of antennas for the mobile network. This could lead to difficulties in creating new sites, in a context where certain stakeholders question the usefulness of rolling out 5G networks. There could also be a tightening of regulations, resulting in a reduction in areas covered, failure to meet Orange's coverage commitments to the authorities, deterioration in the quality of service and an increase in network rollout costs.\n\nThe  ubiquity  of  connected  digital  equipment  may  lead  to inappropriate use due to overuse or exposure to inappropriate content and online harassment. Negative consequences on users could be both physical and psychological, particularly on young adults and children. If this ubiquity were perceived as a risk for the most vulnerable groups, it could undermine confidence in digital technology and act as a brake on innovation, and, for Orange, a decrease in the use of its services and a deterioration of its image.\n\nIn any event, the Group could be held liable, and Orange's revenue, earnings,  quality  of  service  and  reputation  could  be  adversely affected.\n\nThe rapid development of new uses and technologies may jeopardize the commitments made by Orange with regard to reducing its environmental impact.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDue to the nature of its services and its social reach, Orange must offer  new  solutions  to  reduce  the  environmental  impact  of  its customers while limiting its own sources of environmental pollution.

They are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of operational and strategic objectives, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the reliability of financial and non-financial information.\n\nMeasures in place notably enable Orange to meet its obligations under certain laws such as the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, France's Financial  Security  Law  of  July  17,  2003,  Government  Order 2008-1278 of December 8, 2008 transposing Directive 2006/43/EC of May 17, 2006 on statutory audits, Government Order of March 17, 2016 transposing Directive 2014/56/EU, and also French Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption, and the modernization of economic life, known as Sapin II,  as well as Law No. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty  of  vigilance  of  parent  companies  and  ordering  companies, which requires the implementation of a vigilance plan, and Directive 2014/95/EU of October 22 2014, known as the Barnier directive, transposed into French law by Decree No. 2017-1265 of August 9, 2017.\n\nThe  activity  and  risk  management  framework  is  steered  by  the General  Management's  Risks  Committee,  and  is  supported\n\nby  the  work  of  the  other  governance  committees  (see Section  5.2.2.3  Executive  Committee  and  Group  governance committees). It is driven in particular by the Group's Audit, Control and Risk Management Department, with a contribution from the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility Department, the Security Department  and  the  Compliance  Department.  The  systems  are in place in all Group entities as part of a continuous improvement process.\n\nThe  activity  and  risk  management  framework  is  based  on  a cross-functional and collaborative structure, organized into three lines of control:\n\n- -the first line provides operational products and services and manages risks in operations in line with the requirements of the second line;\n- -the second line defines, deploys, manages and assesses the Group's risk management and internal control systems, and provides expertise and assistance;\n- -the third line provides independent and objective assurance.\n\nThe diagram below shows the various players and their interactions, highlighting the central role of the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department  in  relation  to  the  other  players  in  the support functions contributing to the second line.\n\nIn orange : Risk Control governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

It is informed about the work of General Control and Internal Audit and may request their input. The Group's Inspector General sits on the Risks Committee, the Ethics and Sustainable Performance Committee and the Investment Committee.\n\nFinally, in accordance with the provisions of Directives 2006/43/EC and 2014/56/EU, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is tasked with monitoring the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, particularly for financial purposes, in addition to reviewing exposure to employee-related and environmental risks, in  accordance  with  the  latest  amendments  to  the  revised  AfepMedef Code of June 2018.\n\n## 2.2.1 Group Audit, Control and Risk Management\n\nThe  Audit,  Control,  Risk  charter  has  been  signed  by  the  Chief Executive Officer. It sets out the framework for the tasks of the ACR community (Audit, Control and Risk) under the guidance of the Group Department for Audit, Control and Risk Management (DACRG), and the integrated assurance approach (synergies between local and central ACR functions and operational departments) to meet the Company's objectives. The charter reiterates the independence of internal audit in its function as a third line of control.\n\nThe  DACRG  reports  to  the  Delegate  CEO,  Executive  Director Finance,  Performance  and  Development.  It  combines  within  a single body the following functions: internal audit, risk management, general control,  credit  management, internal  control,  fraud,  and revenue assurance.\n\nIts role is to define, deploy, manage and assess the Group's activity and risk management system on behalf of General Management with  a  view  to  providing  integrated  assurance  offering  the  best balance  between  risks  and  opportunities,  working  closely with  operational  departments  and  addressing  their  concerns, capitalizing on a team of experts and co-constructing innovative approaches, in cooperation with the other teams responsible for Group risk management, while preserving audit independence.\n\nAt the heart of the Group's challenges and strategy, through this integrated assurance, the DACRG supports developments in the Group's activities. To this end, its role is to protect revenue (through revenue assurance and customer risk management), control fraud (prevention,  detection  and  treatment),  provide  support  to  the second line of control, but also to strengthen governance, while offering solutions to improve risk control and create value.\n\nThe  continuous  improvement  process  in  risk  management  and internal control is reflected, for instance, in:\n\n- -updates  of  the  fraud  prevention  processes,  the  modules  of which are distributed and evaluated on a regular basis;\n- -risk  management  training  for  Directors  and  Chief  Executive Officers of subsidiaries;\n- -the matching of audit assignments with the Group's major risks;\n- -the circulation of policies and practices defined and listed in the  Orange Internal Control Book  (see  the  Internal Control section  below),  which  cover  the  main  activities  and  may  be accompanied by a self-assessment process to enable entities to position themselves in relation to the practices and levels of control expected by the Group;\n- -the  development  and  implementation  of  procedures  for analyzing large volumes of data to improve the effectiveness of the actions carried out by the teams.\n\nThe DACRG coordinates the organization of internal control reviews with  the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee  in  collaboration with  the  divisions'  internal  control  functions.  They  are  designed to provide assurance that the internal control system is effective, namely that the main risks have been identified and the appropriate steps taken to limit their potential impact. Internal control reviews are part of the integrated assurance approach between operational departments and functions in charge of risk management.\n\nUnder the Engage 2025 strategic plan, the DACRG and the ACR community have been strengthened to support business growth internationally and their diversification in multiservices, particularly in Mobile Financial Services.\n\nLastly,  the  DACRG's activities are in line with the best practices promoted by the Institut fran\u00e7ais de l'Audit et du Contr\u00f4le Interne (IFACI) and the Association pour le Management des Risques et des Assurances de l'Entreprise (AMRAE).\n\n## ISO 9001 Quality Certification for the DACRG\n\nThe  ISO  9001  certification  2015  version  for  the  DACRG  was renewed for the second time in June 2021.\n\nThis  quality  approach,  which  supports  the  DACRG's  aim  of becoming  a  'trusted  business  partner'  contributes  to  the improvement  and  simplification  of  all  processes  with  a  view  to adopting best practices that meet the requirements of Orange's stakeholders.\n\nThis certification covers all activities carried out by the DACRG in the field of risk management in the Group.\n\n## Group Internal Audit\n\nGroup  Internal  Audit  has  approximately  65  qualified  auditors working  as  a  shared  service  for  all  Group  entities.  They  are  for the most part located in France. Group Internal Audit comprises teams  dedicated  to  the  IT  system,  the  networks  and  financial services. Group Internal Audit cooperates with local audit teams, in accordance with their governance rules: sharing of audit plans, follow-up of recommendations, joint audits, and methodological exchanges.  This  mainly  concerns  operator  subsidiaries  that  are not wholly owned (in Europe, notably Orange Polska and Orange Belgium,  and  in  Africa,  notably  Sonatel  group).  Group  Internal Audit, Orange Polska's Internal Audit and Sonatel group's Internal Audit are subject to annual certification by IFACI Certification, in accordance with French professional standards for internal audit (RPAI).\n\nIssues  may  be  referred  directly  to  Group  Internal  Audit  by  the Chairman of the Audit Committee or the Chairman and CEO. The Director of Group Audit is authorized to directly inform the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\nEach year, the audit plan is endorsed by the Risks Committee and approved by the Audit Committee. An annual report, with the main results and findings, is also presented to the Risks Committee and then the Audit Committee.\n\nThe joint operation with Deutsche Telekom (BuyIn) is subject to audits  conducted  jointly  by  the  Orange  group's  and  Deutsche Telekom's Internal Audit Departments.",

The  recommendations  arising from internal audits are systematically monitored, and give rise to action plans that are drawn up and implemented by the Group's divisions  and  subsidiaries.  These  assignments  notably  include work  performed  at  the  request  of  the  Group's  Internal  Control Department as part of the systematic evaluation of management systems, particularly through cyclical audits of subsidiaries' internal control systems. Internal Audit also contributes to the process of identifying, assessing and treating risks through the results of audit assignments and recommendations.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nThe Group's Risk Management Department defines the strategy and rolls out the Group's risk management approach, within the framework  of  the  integrated  approach  promoted  by  the  ACR charter. To that end:\n\n- -it  leads the risk identification and assessment processes on behalf of the Risks Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees);\n- -it  ensures  that  the  corresponding  action  plans  are  followed up,  with  support  from  Group  Internal  Control  and  networks of  risk  managers  and  internal  controllers  of  the  entities  and subsidiaries;\n- -it supports Group entities in mapping risks of all kinds;\n- -it anticipates,  in  collaboration  with  the  Group  Strategy Department, the risks related to the strategic plan.\n\nA risk is defined as a potential event, the consequences of which, if  it  occurred,  would  prevent  Orange  or  one  of  its  entities  from carrying out its missions, meeting its commitments or achieving its objectives, or which could affect Orange's people, assets, earnings and financial position, or the environment or the reputation of the entity or the Group.\n\nThe  various  sources  of  risk  identification  combine  the  views  of management  and  those  of  the  operating  entities.  The  analysis of  causes  and  consequences  complements  and  fine-tunes  the description of the event and influences the risk probability level or risk impact level. The context analysis makes it possible to characterize the  risk  in  each  particular  situation,  to  fine-tune  its  causes  and consequences, and to assess the probability and impacts of the risk in a way that is suited to the area of the organization where the risk is identified. Their inclusion in risk mapping reflects the principle of  the  prevalence  of  impact  analysis  (consequence-related)  over probability analysis (cause-related).\n\nGroup management teams identify and assess, at least annually, the  risks  that  fall  within  their  scope.  This  mapping  forms  the cornerstone on which the management systems are built. It also contains a description of additional action plans aimed at stepping up the internal control required to address these risks. The list of significant  events,  changes in risks and the monitoring of action plans  are  reviewed  during  each  department's  internal  control reviews.\n\nAt Group level, risks are monitored by the General Management's Risks Committee. The assessment of overall risk management is reviewed at least once a year by this committee. It is presented to the Directors at a joint meeting of the Board of Directors' committees, during  which  major  risks  are  discussed  in  the  presence  of  the Directors concerned. This process includes a review of all the risks described in Section 2.1 Risk factors of this document.\n\nIn 2021, an audit of the Group's risk management system, carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd, concluded that the principles and practices mentioned above are the assets and knowledge on which the Group has built a robust risk management system.\n\n## General Control and investigations\n\nGeneral Control involves, at the request of Executive Committee members or their respective Management Committees, or following a report from the ethics whistleblowing mechanism, investigations on matters involving employees that may run counter to the Group's interests. These matters may involve instances of fraud, conflicts of interest, damage to Group assets, behavioral problems and in general any acts by employees that are inconsistent with Group rules. In this respect, General Control works in a complementary manner  to  the  various  departments  within  the  DACRG  as  well as  to  Group  General  Inspection.  In  France,  General  Control  is represented by the investigations unit, which was merged in 2020 into a single team, and at Group level, for international affairs and central functions, by the General Controllers. Some countries, such as Poland, Spain, Romania and Senegal, have dedicated internal structures and operate in a network with General Control.\n\nIn 2021, a study on international surveys carried out by the firm Ricol Lasteyrie validated the principles and practices of General Control and recommended compiling all the documents and texts outlining the rights and duties of the various stakeholders in a charter of the survey.\n\n## Credit Management\n\nGroup Credit Management is tasked with minimizing financial risks related to credit granted to Group customers. Its objective is to have a consolidated view of credit risks with customers and partners (periodic credit committee) and to implement tools to manage those risks. To do so, it calls on local teams or correspondents and on the processes in place in each operating entity.\n\nIt promotes the credit management culture and supervises customer risk  management  within  the  Group.  It  heads  the  Group  Credit Committee, which meets periodically with the various divisions to review bad debt, which is recognized in other operating income and expenses (see Notes 5.3 Trade receivables and 6.2 Other operating expenses to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nIn  the  continuity  of  the  previous  year,  teams  continued  to  be mobilized  in  2021,  to  harmonize,  consolidate  and  control  the financial impacts related to the pandemic.\n\n## Internal Control\n\nGroup Internal Control develops and conducts the internal control strategy  within  Orange.  To  that  end,  it  defines  a  methodology, processes and the tools necessary for its application. It implements them annually, in particular with:\n\n- -the updating and circulation of the Orange IC Book, a set of policies and practices defined by the Group in association with the relevant Group functions and domains;\n- -internal  control  self-assessment  procedures  based  on  risk analysis  and  the Orange IC Book,  the  aim  being  to  identify the main improvements to be made in terms of risk coverage and therefore internal control, and to take corrective action as needed. In addition, internal audits confirm the results of the self-assessment  and  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  the  action plans implemented, if necessary;\n- -risk review procedures and management systems associated with operational processes. Such approaches are based on an end-to-end cross-functional vision. They contribute in particular to the work on Sarbanes-Oxley certification for internal financial control and the accounting control requirements of France's Sapin II law.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

The role of the local internal control function is to assist the operating managers of their entities  in  order  to  help  them  structure  and  maintain  an  efficient internal control system meeting both their own needs and those of the Group. To that end, they apply the Group's activity and risk management  guidelines  within  their  entity,  and  ensure  that  the system operates effectively at their level, in coordination with the other functions of the second line of control, in order to capitalize on all existing systems and thus increase their robustness.\n\nGroup Internal Control agrees to an annual action and evaluation program for each scope (domains, divisions, and entities). It assists the  various  departments  through  internal  control  assignments designed  to  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  activities  are properly controlled in various areas (e.g. compliance with laws and regulations, governance, operational or decision-making processes, integration of new entities, support for the implementation of action plans, etc.).\n\nAmong its recurring actions, it follows  up  with  the  heads  of  the governance committees (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and  Group  governance  committees)  and  coordinates  the organization of internal control reviews with the members of the Executive Committee, with the assistance of the DACRG, and the Group Security, Compliance and Corporate Social Responsibility Departments.\n\nGroup Internal Control ensures the strengthening of the Group's IC systems by supporting its developments (in particular the internal control services of Mobile Financial Services, Orange Middle East Africa, Orange Business Services and accounting controls under the Sapin II law).\n\nThe  Orange  group  Internal  Control  function  manages  the  GRC (Governance, Risk & Compliance) solution of publisher SAI Global, in  particular  for  internal  control  and  risk  management  system documentation, assessments and action plans, and internal audit recommendations. The GRC solution, which is regularly updated, meets the company's expectations with a view to reinforcing the integrated  assurance  strategy  developed  and  deployed  by  the DACRG.\n\nThe Internal  Control  evaluation  is  presented  to  the  Group  Risks Committee and then to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Fraud and Revenue Assurance\n\nRevenue recognition in the telecommunication industry is based on data capture, involving various components of network access, managing  and  collecting  uses;  recovery  via  the  IT  systems, supporting the customer bases and recovery of individual items; and recording via the accounting and financial systems, supporting the  production  of  financial  statements.  The  complexity  of  this technical  and  commercial  architecture  has  led  Orange,  through its Fraud and Revenue Assurance Department, to develop its own revenue  protection  strategy.  It  is  backed  up  by  a  methodology ensuring the correct measurement, substance, comprehensiveness and valuation  of  the  individual  elements  underpinning  customer\n\ninvoicing,  through  a  risk-oriented  overview  of  the  entire  process chain.\n\nGroup  Fraud  and  Revenue  Assurance  (GFRA)  also  defines  the Group's strategy and approach to fraud prevention and detection. To  support  the  deployment  of  this  strategy,  GFRA  works  very closely with its Internal Control and Risk Management colleagues, along with other corporate and operating entity teams.\n\nOrange has adopted an approach based on anticipation and risk analysis to manage fraud. GFRA continuously monitors existing and emerging fraud risks, as well as any new fraud-related legislation. This enables Orange to adapt its anti-fraud strategy accordingly. GFRA maintains up-to-date mapping of the Group's fraud risks, covering  all  risks  anticipated  in  this  area  (including  financial statement fraud, technical (cyber) fraud, identity theft and social engineering fraud, missing trader VAT carousels, money laundering and the financing of terrorism).\n\nOrange  has  implemented  preventive  controls  to  reduce  the likelihood of the occurrence of fraud that could constitute a major risk.\n\nSince prevention cannot be 100% effective, the Group has also defined a control framework designed to detect instances of fraud. Any case or suspicion of fraud identified through these controls is i nvestigated and dealt with in accordance with the law and Orange's ethics principles.\n\nOrange considers that to manage fraud risk and protect revenue effectively, the cost of fraud and revenue leakage must be controlled at  entity  level  and  consolidated  at  Group  level,  allowing  major incidents  to  be  analyzed  and  treated,  and  any  emerging  trends to be identified. With regard to the production of Group financial information, the approach defined by GFRA includes the relevant risks in this area, such as fraud committed by management or fraud in the financial statements.\n\nFraud detection is the responsibility of management, assisted by GFRA and local fraud detection specialists in the Group's entities.\n\nA  Group  whistleblowing  mechanism  is  in  place  as  provided  for under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, France's Sapin II law of December 9, 2016 and the law of March 27, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance of  parent  companies  and  ordering  companies.  The  system  is presented in Section 2.2.4.1.2 Breaches of ethics rules.\n\nWhen  internal  fraud  is  strongly  suspected,  investigations  are generally entrusted to specialized services, in particular to General Control.  Investigation  services  are  responsible  for  establishing the  materiality  of  the  facts.  In  cases  of  internal  fraud,  company management  determines  the  penalties.  For  all  cases  detected (internal or external fraud), the legal, civil or criminal consequences are considered after consulting the company's Legal Department.\n\nAs  part  of  a  continuous  improvement  process,  cases  of  fraud are  analyzed  by  GFRA  in  order  to  improve  controls  and  assess measures to be taken, and thus better prevent and detect similar cases.\n\nA summary report on fraud prevention and detection is reviewed at least once a year by the Group Risks Committee and presented at a joint meeting to the Board of Directors' committees.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.2 Specific financial internal control procedures\n\nThe  specific  financial  internal  control  procedures  relate  to the  preparation  and  processing  of  accounting  and  financial information, and the work on internal control carried out pursuant to  Section  404  of  the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act.  In  addition,  an insurance policy translates certain operational risks into financial commitments.\n\n## 2.2.2.1 Specific internal control procedures pertaining to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information\n\nThe  Group  Accounting  Department  and  the  Group  Controlling Department,  which  both  report  to  the Delegate  Chief  Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development, play a decisive role in the internal control system.\n\nThe  Group  Accounting  Department  and  the  Group  Controlling Department have the following key duties:\n\n- -producing the Group's consolidated financial statements and the  statutory  financial  statements  of  Orange  SA  and  certain French  subsidiaries  within  timeframes  that  meet  financial market requirements and legal obligations while guaranteeing that the statements provide a true and fair view of the Company in  compliance  with  the  accounting  policies  adopted  by  the Group;\n- -preparing  the  management  reports  on  the  Statutory  and consolidated  financial  statements,  and  producing  the documentation  necessary  for  financial  communication  of results  and  the  summary  of  management  reporting  for  the Executive Committee;\n- -managing the monthly and quarterly reporting cycle allowing management to measure the Group's performance on a regular basis;\n- -designing and  implementing  Group  accounting  and management methods, procedures and standards; and\n- -identifying  and  carrying  out  the  necessary  changes  to  the Group's accounting and management information systems.\n\nWithin  these  departments,  internal  control  of  accounting  and financial information is organized around the following elements:\n\n- -the Disclosure Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3);\n- -the Group accounting and controlling function;\n- -unified accounting and management reporting; and\n- -Group-wide accounting standards and methods.\n\n## Unified accounting and management reporting\n\nAll Group entities are part of the Group's management and steering cycle, which has three fundamental components:\n\n- -the  forecast  process  (plan,  budget  and  periodic  internal forecasts);\n- -the  process  for  producing  the  Group's  Statutory  and consolidated financial statements; and\n- -the management reporting process.\n\n## Forecast process (plan, budget and periodic internal forecasts)\n\nThe Group's budget process requires regular updates of internal projections,  and  management's  close  involvement.  It  is  applied to  all  of  the  Group's  countries  and  divisions,  business  units  and subsidiaries.\n\nThe budget must reflect the Group's ambitions at each level of the organization. The budget is drawn up annually, between November and December, and is presented to and approved by the Group's governing bodies. Further forecasts are made during the year (in May,  September  and  November)  to  determine  the  allocation  of resources with a view to achieving the budget objectives.\n\nThe budget dossier is composed of:\n\n- -packages of financial  data,  along  with  summary  comments, particularly on major actions;\n- -capital expenditure by nature; and\n- -analysis of risks and opportunities.\n\nAs part of the budget process, the divisions establish and analyze performance measurement indicators. The budget is broken down by month to serve as a reference for the Group's monthly reporting.\n\nThe Group also draws up a multi-year plan for all countries and divisions,  setting  out  medium-term  financial  trajectories  for  the Group.\n\n## Process of preparing the companies' statutory financial statements and the Group's consolidated financial statements\n\nOrange's financial statements are prepared in accordance with the following principles:\n\n- -pre-closing  of  accounts  at  the  end  of  May  and  the  end  of November;\n- -anticipation of estimates and treatment of complex accounting operations; and\n- -formalization of closing processes and schedules.\n\nAs such, documenting the processes leading to the production of financial information up to the filling of consolidation packages constitutes  a  common  framework  for  all  contributors,  thereby strengthening internal control within the accounting and controlling function.\n\nInstructions  from  the  Consolidation  Department  specifying  the process and agreed timeline for each closing are circulated within the Group, and then broken down by subsidiary.\n\nConsolidation packages are prepared monthly by Group entities in accordance with IFRS accounting principles and entered into the Group's consolidation and reporting tool.\n\nWhere  they  are  compatible  with  local  rules  applicable  to  the statutory financial statements, the Group principles are preferred in  order  to  limit  subsequent  restatements.  However,  if  an  entity applies principles that are not consistent with those of the Group in i ts statutory financial statements and they have a material impact on the assessment of its earnings and assets, the entity concerned will make adjustments to ensure consistency.\n\nEach entity is responsible for identifying, periodically measuring and reconciling differences in accounting methods between the statutory financial statements and the Group standards.\n\nThe  identification  and  assessment  of  the  Group's  unrecognized contractual commitments are covered by a specific report drawn up annually by the Legal and Finance Departments, working in close collaboration. The main contractual and regulatory commitments of  the  Group  that  are  liable  to  have  a  material  impact  on  its financial position are brought to the attention of the Commitments Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Management reporting process\n\nThe reporting process is a major part of the financial control and information system. It is the preferred tool for monitoring, controlling and steering the Group's General Management. The reconciliation of  accounting  information  with  forecast  data,  combined  with monthly  analysis  at  each  level  of  the  Group,  contributes  to  the quality and reliability of the information produced. This operating principle, established by the controlling and accounting functions, applies to all Group entities and at each level of the organization (business unit, division and Group).\n\nThe Group's reporting content and documents, which are used to track the achievement of Group objectives, are established on a regular and consistent basis. The financial data used for reporting are derived mainly from the Group's consolidation and reporting tool,  and  reporting  formats  are  standardized.  The  reports  are validated by the heads of Controlling in each country.\n\nThis reporting allows for the monitoring of the Group's management and performance indicators, and is based on:\n\n- -reporting  in  the  second  and  third  months  of  each  quarter, including  financial  and  operational  indicators,  identifying  the main changes by reporting segment, country and business line;\n- -a quarterly dashboard designed to provide the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Committee with key operational  indicators  for  the  Group  and  major  events  and alerts.\n\nBusiness reviews at the Executive Committee level are organized by country under the authority of the Delegate Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. Their purpose is to steer the business. They bring together the Group Finance Department and the country CEO and finance function on a monthly basis. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer takes part in quarterly reviews. These reviews are based on formalized reporting. Gathering of information for these reports is organized for each country in accordance with the Group's reporting instructions.\n\n## Group-wide accounting standards and methods\n\nFor the preparation of projected and actual consolidated financial statements, the Group has opted for the unification principle, which implies:\n\n- -consistency of the reference framework, accounting methods and consolidation rules;\n- -standardization of reporting formats; and\n- -use of a common IT consolidation and reporting tool within the Group.\n\nWithin  the  Group  Accounting  Department,  the  Standards  and Consolidation Department is responsible for defining and circulating the  Group's  accounting  policies  under  IFRS.  It  also  monitors changes  in  standards  and  formalizes  the  Group's  accounting policies under IFRS in a systematic and structured manner through the Group accounting manual, closing instructions and information or training meetings. In 2020, the Standards Department launched the  QualIFRS  project  aimed  at  ensuring  that  Orange's  main accounting positions are correctly updated under IFRS.\n\nThe system is supplemented by the establishment of standards liaison officers in the various countries and divisions. They form a network tasked with identifying accounting issues locally, circulating the Group's accounting policies among divisions, countries and entities, and accounting departments, and taking into account the training needs of employees responsible for the proper application of Group accounting policies.\n\n## 2.2.2.2 Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant to Section 404\n\n## of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\n\nDue  to  its  listing  on  the  New  York  Stock  Exchange,  Orange  is subject to the provisions of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Section 404 of that Act, the Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the  Delegate  Chief  Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development are required to prepare a report in which they make a statement on  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  procedures  relating  to the  production  of  the  Group's  financial  statements  prepared in  accordance  with  IFRS,  as  presented  in  the  annual  report (Form 20-F), which is filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC).  The  Statutory  Auditors  conduct  their  own assessment of internal  control.  The  management  and  Statutory Auditors' reports are included in Form 20-F each year.\n\nTo better meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Act, Orange, under  the  guidance  of  the  Group  Internal  Control  Department, implements a permanent program to reinforce the internal control culture across the entire Group.\n\nBy  applying  principles  issued  by  the  SEC,  Orange  targets  its financial internal control system at areas of significant risk, making it both more relevant and more effective, and limiting the assessment work to controls covering those areas.\n\nRegarding the reliability of financial information, Orange relies on the internationally recognized 2013 framework of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission. Orange organizes the five component parts of the COSO under two headings:\n\n- -control environment (governance committees, overall policies and procedures); and\n- -operational control (flows and processes).\n\nThe annual work program, which covers the control environment and  operational  control,  comprises  the  following  main  actions, based on the risks identified:\n\n- -identification  of  the  scope:  this  concerns  the  Group's governance committees, the control environment domains and the consolidated entities whose scope is aligned with the audit of the financial statements;\n- -scoping:  identification  by  entity  of  the  relevant  control environment  domains  and  flows  and  information  systems supporting those flows;\n- -documentation of the internal control system implemented and assessment of its effectiveness.\n\nThe work relating to the evaluation of financial internal control takes into  account  the  work  undertaken  by  those  responsible  for  the second line control, such as risk management analyses, work on fraud (prevention, detection and investigation) as well as the work of the third line, i.e. internal audit.\n\nThe  process  conducted  for  fiscal  year  2021  did  not  reveal  any major weaknesses. The Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the Delegate Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance  and  Development,  therefore  concluded  that  the internal control system for the production of the financial statements was operationally effective.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Statutory  Auditors  carry  out  an  independent evaluation of the financial internal control system.\n\n## 2.2.2.3 Insurance\n\nThe Orange group's insurance policy is designed to secure the exposure  of  the  Group's  assets  and  earnings  to  its  main  risks. Orange  implements  a  strategy  aimed  at  organizing  the  transfer of  those  risks  to  players  whose  solvency  and  management capacity (production and claims) must meet the Group's security",

The  suitability  of  the  Group's  programs  in  meeting  its  needs  is confirmed by the regular studies and benchmarks.\n\nNegotiations conducted during the most recent program renewals confirmed the hard market situation that is impacting the majority of business lines (property damage and business interruption losses, financial lines, civil liability, etc.) already observed last year.\n\nUnderwriting policies followed by the vast majority of insurance companies are characterized by the application of significant rate increases accompanied by a drastic reduction in capacity offered and a significant increase in deductibles and retentions payable by policyholders.\n\nCovers negotiated with insurers are systematically submitted by insurance branch to their referrals, which apply underwriting rules defined on the basis of a sector and/or the nature of the business of their client portfolios. This practice can extend to the outright withdrawal of insurers in certain risk areas such as natural disasters or  Directors'  and  Officers'  liability  insurance.  This  trend  in  the insurance market could continue for several months.\n\nDespite this context and the market trend, the Group was able to renew its  main  programs  while  preserving  most  of  the  capacity subscribed.\n\nThis policy has also made it possible to gradually extend the scope of insurance coverage to virtually all Group subsidiaries, activities and  revenue  by  taking  into  account  their  specific  regional  or regulatory constraints.\n\nI n addition, the insurance policy in place includes a risk management strategy  designed  to  identify  potential  vulnerabilities  within  the Group and to carry out preventive actions in line with changes in the Group's activities, sites and environment. This strategy is reflected in the organization of regular visits to Orange's main sites in France\n\nand internationally, in partnership with the engineers of the Group's insurers and brokers.\n\nIn the same vein, Orange's insurance policy includes a contractual risk  prevention  part  concerning  agreements  made  with  key customers, suppliers and other Group partners.\n\nThe transformation of the core business from telecom operator to that of a multi-service operator generates new risks, requiring it to constantly adapt financing in line with the nature of the business activities.  The  Group's  insurers  and  service  providers  are  kept regularly  informed  of  developments,  and  dedicated  insurance policies are taken out where necessary.\n\nThe  main  insurance  policies  that  make  up  the  current  plan  are designed to protect against the following risks:\n\n- -risks of property damage, and consequential financial losses;\n- -third-party  and  customer  civil  liability  risks  incurred  during the management of the Company and the performance of its activities;\n- -risks associated with the Company's vehicle fleets.\n\nThe risk of damage to the telephone poles and open-wire lines of the overhead fixed network remains self-insured. The resulting financial expense  is  monitored  in  conjunction  with  the  Group's  experts insofar as the traditional markets (insurance and reinsurance) no longer offer an appropriate risk transfer solution.\n\nSpecific policies are also negotiated and set up, including:\n\n- -assistance  for  employees  on  business  trips  or  professional assignments, or expatriates;\n- -work site insurance (real-estate or construction projects);\n- -new activities (financial activities, banking).\n\nThe  total  cost  of  coverage  under  the  Group  insurance  plan programs amounts to approximately 0.06% of annual revenue.\n\nLastly,  the  Group  Insurance  Department  applies  internal  control processes to its management, which involves its external partners (experts,  brokers)  in  its  various  stages,  notably  encompassing the  control  environment,  governance and ethics. Employees are regularly made aware of ethics and anti-corruption issues.\n\n## 2.2.3 Framework for the management of non-financial risks\n\n## 2.2.3.1 Group Social Responsibility\n\nThe  Orange  group's  Social  Responsibility  is  handled  by  a dedicated team in charge of CSR, diversity and equal opportunity, and  the  Orange  Foundation  under  the  responsibility  of  a  Social Responsibility executive director. That team reports regularly to the Executive Committee, directly and through the work of the Ethics and Sustainable Performance Committee and to the Orange Board of  Directors through the work of the Governance and Corporate Social  and  Environmental  Responsibility  Committee  (GCSERC). Furthermore, the Group's non-financial risks are reviewed by the Audit Committee.\n\nAccordingly, the Executive Committee and the Board of Directors oversee the Group's actions and priorities on employee-related, social  and  environmental  matters,  and  more  specifically  those related to climate change. They are informed of and take a position on the Statement of Non-Financial Performance, the Vigilance Plan and its implementation, as well as the Statement on modern slavery and human trafficking. The Group CSR Department collaborates with the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department. I n particular it draws on the work on non-financial risks presented by\n\nother divisions to Orange's Risks Committee and uses the Group's risk assessment and management methodology. It also uses the Group's methodology for rolling out its risk management approach to the entities and takes part in divisional internal control reviews.\n\nThe  CSR  Department  is  itself  broken  down  into  different departments (Governance and Operations, Overall Performance, Strategy Rollout) and into different areas of expertise (Environment, Digital  and  Social  Inclusion,  Responsible  Marketing,  Corporate and Social Issues, Respect for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms,  Stakeholder  Dialog).  It  reports  on  the  Group's performance on its scope of activity through non-financial reporting in  particular.  It  drives  trajectories,  the  objectives  and  financial implications associated with the CSR commitments of the Engage 2025 strategic plan through budget exercises, the monitoring of the strategic plan and the half-yearly business reviews (analysis of gaps between achieved and projected) in connection with the Group's Finance and Strategy teams. It relies on the networks of financial and strategic functions of the entities, as well as the networks of CSR leaders and managers responsible for the implementation of the Vigilance Plan which contributes to the operational rollout of the approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

The Group also takes into account the  principles  defined  by  the  ISO  26000  standard  on  the  social responsibility of organizations. It aligns its publications on TCFD guidelines  (Taskforce  on  Climate-Related  Financial  Disclosures -  see  Section  4.2.4.1  Alignment with TCFD recommendations). Furthermore,  the  Group  publishes  non-financial  information  in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI - see https:// oran.ge/GRI for the report drawn up in accordance with the Core option  of  the  GRI).  It  also  takes  into  account  the  Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework, which is gradually being integrated into its publications.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of the indicators and monitor the proper application of the Group's commitments in the entities, Orange has had an external verification of its CSR approach and achievements carried  out  for  several  years  by  one  of  its  Statutory  Auditors,  in order to obtain a reasonable assurance report on a selection of CSR Information (see Section 4.8 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors, designated as an independent third party).\n\n## 2.2.3.2 Specific non-financial internal control procedures\n\nThe  specific  internal  control  procedures  below,  together  with the  policies  and  measures  implemented,  help  mitigate  the risks  identified  by  the  Group  in  the  Statement  of  Non-Financial Performance (SNPF) and the Vigilance Plan. They are presented as they relate to six issues:\n\n- -the environmental consequences of our activities;\n- -the employment-related consequences of our activities;\n- -business ethics;\n- -the  effect  of  our  activities  on  respect  for  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms;\n- -the social consequences of our activities; and\n- -relations with partners, suppliers and subcontractors.\n\nThese issues are the subject of a regular materiality analysis, in line with the risk factors presented in Section 2.1.4 Non-financial risks.\n\nOrange's policies are derived from the definition and criteria used in the Reporting Framework based on the United Nations Guiding Principles (UNGP) launched in February 2015 on key (human rights) issues (1) to assess its impacts. It is an approach based on:\n\n- -an assessment of the severity of risks in terms of their effects on  people,  independently  of  any  policies  or  action  plans implemented by Orange to mitigate their consequences;\n- -the  probability  of  their  occurrence  given  the  Group's  scope, independently of any policies or action plans implemented by Orange to mitigate their occurrence; and\n\n- -Orange's ability to propose a remedy, i.e. the impact that the policies or action plans developed by Orange may have.\n\nOrange has selected six major UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for the Group, around which it has decided to structure its approach and the communication of its impacts. To that end, each of the SDGs selected (as well as the additional related SDGs) has been broken down by theme applicable to Orange, with associated means and impact indicators  to  monitor  trends.  This  work  was carried out by a Steering Committee comprising all of the Group's major functional entities, as well as operational entities, under the authority of the Corporate Social Responsibility Executive Director. It was presented to the Group Executive Committee and approved by  the  Ethics  and  Sustainable  Performance  Committee  and  the GCSER Committee.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.1 Environmental impacts of our\n\nactivities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange  adopts  a  proactive  approach  to  risk  and  impact management to help preserve the environment against a backdrop of strong growth in digital usage. Potential or actual damage to the environment that Orange may have caused was addressed in its 2021 Vigilance Plan.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.1.1 Orange's environmental commitment\n\n## Commitments with respect to greenhouse gas emissions\n\nOrange has been working to reduce its environmental footprint for more than 15 years. Exemplary environmental conduct is one of the cornerstones of its corporate responsibility.\n\nThe Group confirmed its commitment to the climate at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York in September 2019, by signing alongside other major corporations the UN Global Compact commitment  for  an  average  global  warming  trajectory  of  1.5\u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels.\n\nAs an active member of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), in particular alongside the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the GSMA and the International Energy Agency, Orange has made a significant contribution to the production of a methodology document  for  estimating  the  impact  of  the  Information  and Communication Technology sector on the global climate. It explains the emission reduction paths to be followed by the sector in order to comply with scientific recommendations and confine the rise in temperatures to 1.5\u00b0C compared with the pre-industrial era (2) .\n\nAs  part  of  its  Engage  2025  strategic  plan  announced  in December 2019, Orange had undertaken to be Net Zero Carbon by  2040,  10  years  ahead  of  the  GSMA  target  and  the  IPCC recommendations for a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory (3) , which aims to limit the average warming of the planet to 1.5\u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels.\n\nThe  Net  Zero  Initiative (4) ,  in  which  the  Orange  group  is  taking part, formalized a standard for Net Zero Carbon for businesses in February 2019.",

        "page_content": "## Being Net Zero Carbon in 2040 means:\n\n- -as a priority, to have achieved the maximum possible reduction of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  -  Scopes  1,  2  and  3 (1) - by 2040. As a priority, Orange is seeking to reduce its Scope 1 and  2  emissions  and  Scope  3  emissions  over  which  it  has a  direct  influence.  The  Group  is  acting  on  the  other  part  of Scope 3 emissions with its main suppliers, via the International Telecommunication  Union,  the  GSMA  and  the  JAC  (Joint Alliance for CSR);\n- -to contribute to carbon sequestration, for a quantity equivalent to residual carbon emissions in 2040 of Scopes 1 and 2, and Scope  3  partially,  i.e.  those  on  which  the  company  has  a direct effect. This can be done through nature-based (forests, mangroves  or  agroforestry)  or  technology-based  (carbon capture and storage in coal plants, etc.) carbon sequestration solutions;\n- -in  addition,  to  contribute  to  emissions  avoided  outside  its scope, for example by marketing products and services with a better carbon score than existing products or services - or by financing certified or verified emissions avoidance.\n\nTo  be  able  to  comply  with  this  commitment,  the  Group  has  set itself  the  interim  goal  of  reaching  a  30%  reduction  in  its  CO2eq Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 2025 in absolute terms with respect to  the  2015  level.  This  interim  target  has  been  formulated  using the  1.5\u00b0C  trajectory  international  sector-specific  methodology for  digital  technology,  jointly  developed  by  the  International Telecommunication  Union,  GSMA,  GeSI  and  the  SBTi,  in conjunction  with  the  International  Energy  Agency.  Orange  has taken the additional commitment, validated by the SBTi, to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 14% by 2025 in absolute terms compared with the 2018 level.\n\nTo  achieve  these  objectives,  Orange  launched  a  vast  energy efficiency and natural resources savings plan and intends to reach a utilization rate of at least 50% renewable electricity by 2025.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  carried  out  an  assessment  of  its Scope 3 impacts in accordance with the 15 categories defined by the GHG Protocol. Its main impacts concern the sub-categories of fixed assets, purchases of goods and services and use of products sold. Orange has introduced circular economy principles into all its processes and is working with its suppliers to better understand and  reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  equipment  manufacturing, distribution and use, particularly Orange-brand equipment.\n\nFor its residual emissions projected by 2040, Orange is developing a gradual neutralization plan of its emissions by financing natural carbon sinks such as forests, mangroves or agroforestry.\n\n## Commitments to natural resource savings\n\nOrange  has  also  made  the  commitment  to  integrate  circular economy principles into its organization and processes in order to  limit  the  impact  of  its  activities  and  those  of  its  suppliers  and customers on resources and raw materials.\n\nThis commitment breaks down into the following targets by 2025:\n\n- -commit 100% of the range of Orange-brand equipment (boxes, decoders, etc.) to an eco-design approach that reduces the carbon footprint during manufacture and distribution, as well as electricity consumption during its use;\n\n- -collect 30% of mobile terminals by country in Europe and the equivalent  in  volume  of  WEEE (2) of  20%  of  mobile  terminals sold in MEA; recover more than 90% of fixed terminals (box, decoders) distributed by Orange when customers terminate their subscriptions;\n- -at least 10% of total sales volumes of mobile devices in Europe derived from refurbished devices;\n- -attractive  repair  service  available  for  mobile  devices  sold  by Orange in each of its host countries in Europe.\n\nIn addition, for its own needs, Orange aims to use a part of its investment budget for refurbished equipment, through its internal 'marketplace' or by promoting refurbished equipment catalogs with its suppliers. The quantification of this ambition, which will contribute to the reduction in scope 3 emissions, is in progress. Orange is also committed to taking into account criteria relating to the carbon footprint throughout the life cycle and the circular economy when selecting network and information system equipment.\n\n## Action plan to back the commitments\n\nTo  become  Net  Zero  Carbon  in  2040  and  in  the  context  of  its strategic  plan,  Orange  has  built  an  action  plan  that  relies  on numerous simultaneous approaches:\n\n- -the continuation of energy efficient actions on IT & networks. The  Group  relies  above  all  on  the  implementation  of  RAN energy efficiency functions (including advanced sleep modes for  5G antennas) and the intensification of infrastructure and equipment  sharing  (RAN  sharing).  It  also  aims  to  continue pursuing eco-efficiency initiatives in Data centers (optimization of  the  number  of  Data  centers,  fill  rate  and  electricity consumption);\n- -the development of new renewable electricity capacities, with recourse  to  PPAs  (Power  Purchase  Agreements,  long-term renewable electricity supply contracts at a negotiated price), the creation of new solar farms, using solar as a power source for its technical sites and expanding the ESCO (Energy Services Companies) programs, in particular for the use of solar power on sites and optimizing the limited use of generators;\n- -in addition, a specific policy for its buildings and vehicle fleet. The aim is to reduce consumption of the Group's real estate by  20%  by  2025  compared  with  2015,  by  implementing a  '360\u00b0  management'  system  in  all  main  buildings.  The objective is to measure in order to optimize and reduce energy consumption. Whenever possible, Orange has also engaged in an aggressive policy to partially power its office and technical buildings (including Data centers) by solar energy. Concerning mobility,  Orange has defined an action plan that will enable the Group to reduce and electrify its vehicle fleets by 2025. In addition, Orange aims to maintain its status as Europe's biggest corporate carsharing fleet.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.1.2 Environmental monitoring framework\n\nThe Group's Board of Directors oversees the risks and opportunities related  to  the  environment  (particularly  climate  change)  through the  work  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  notably  the  Social Responsibility  and  Orange  Innovation  executive  directors.  The Board is regularly updated on the issues at stake for the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

They are an integral part of the budgetary processes and the strategic plan (see Section 2.2.2.1 Specific internal control procedures pertaining to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information) and are monitored by the Group Executive Committee under the control of the Audit Committee, the GCSER Committee and the Board of Directors. In 2022, the Group Investment Committee will gradually set up an appraisal of the environmental impact of the main projects presented (real  estate  projects  or  projects  related  to  IT  and  the network).\n\nThe  monitoring  of  Orange's  actions  in  environmental  matters  is based on the work of various committees:\n\nThe Green ITN Group Steering Committee chaired by the Orange Innovation  Division  meets  periodically  to  review  the  progress  of energy consumption management programs for the network and IT,  and the development of the use of electricity from renewable sources.  It  ensures  that  the  program  is  properly  implemented. It  includes  members  from  Orange  Innovation,  Group  CSR  and Purchasing Departments, and from the contributing entities.\n\nThe organization of energy efficiency action plans was set up in 2021 by business unit, under the direct guidance of the VP Energy Group (or the regional delegate for OMEA) to strengthen the Group's existing governance in energy management and ensure the control, dissemination and monitoring of programs through the Group. In this way, it strengthens the possibilities of achieving the Group's objectives to control energy costs and reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nThe Circular Economy Group Steering Committee is a strategic internal  circular  economy  steering  committee  set  up  to  define and monitor the actions to be implemented within its businesses, with  the  appointment  of  project  leaders  and  an  implementation plan. Placed under the authority of the Group CSR Department, it is made up of decision-makers from the Group's main business lines:  Purchasing,  Supply  Chain,  Marketing,  Networks  and  IT, Innovation, etc.\n\nThe plan covers several works in progress, such as ecodesign, limiting  the  Group's  consumption  of  critical  non-renewable resources, optimizing waste management, and the possibility of giving network equipment and consumer devices a second life.\n\nIn particular, it aims to coordinate the Orange Sustainable & Circular Ambition for Recertification (OSCAR) program, which focuses on extending the service life of equipment, and its reuse and recovery within the Group. It is based on an action plan with suppliers to ensure the availability of refurbished equipment, the planning of decommissioning for reuse within the Group and the coordination of the internal 'marketplace' for refurbished equipment.\n\nThe Scope 3 Group Steering Committee , set up in 2021, brings together  Group  CSR,  Group  Purchasing,  Orange  Innovation, the  General  Secretariat  and  Legal  Department,  to  oversee  the Scope 3 contribution to the achievement of the Group's objective of  reaching  Net  Zero  Carbon  in  2040  and  to  pursue  the  interim goal of reducing Scope 3 emissions by 14% by 2025 compared to 2018. This committee is tasked with the annual assessment of Scope 3 using highly precise methods mainly based on physical data, identification and prioritization of Scope 3 reduction leads, definition of objectives by broad categories and their operational monitoring  by  business  line.  It  monitors  and  ensures  the dependability of the data collection, processing, consolidation and consistency process with the support of the Carbone 4 firm.\n\nThe  Monitoring  Committee  for  alignment  with  the  TCFD's recommendations was set up to address the recommendations of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) published  on  June  29,  2017.  It  is  piloted  by  the  Group  CSR Department and supported by the Carbone 4 firm. Its objectives include  undertaking  an  in-depth  analysis  of  the  risks  related to  climate  change  and  the  ecological  transition  and  identifying projects  that  need  to  be  implemented  so  as  to  better  fulfill  the recommendations of the TCFD.\n\nA  cross-reference  table  describing  Orange's  responses  to  the TCFD recommendations is available in Section 4.2.4.1 Alignment with the TCFD's recommendations.\n\n## Carbon sequestration program\n\nWith a view to achieving Net Zero Carbon in 2040, the Group is already  developing  a  carbon  sequestration  program  aimed  at gradually  neutralizing  the  equivalent  of  the  residual  emissions estimated for 2040. A large part of the investments to be made in this context was approved by the Group Investment Committees in order to launch the program from 2021.\n\n## Promoting environmental awareness and training\n\nThe  Group  CSR  Department  holds  regular  discussions  with  a network of national and business area contacts in the environmental field comprising around 90 people; it organizes an annual seminar or webinar to exchange best practices and launch new projects.\n\nInternal  communications  regularly  raise  awareness  among  all Group employees at key events such as the United Nations Climate Change Conference and environment days.\n\nAwareness-raising and discussion initiatives enable each employee to factor the objectives of responsible growth into their day-to-day activities. Dedicated training programs are regularly rolled out, such as the CSR Visa, launched in September 2020, which provides a common knowledge base across the Group on CSR challenges and the commitments and action plans implemented within Orange.\n\nAn  indicator  relating  to  the  management  of  electrical  energy consumption  introduced  since  2018  in  the  calculation  of  the incentive  bonus  for  Orange  SA  employees  (see  Section  4.3.3 Compensation)  was  replaced  in  2021  by  the  CO2  emissions reduction  indicator,  thereby  giving  visibility  to  this  commitment; moreover, the Orange LTIPs as of the 2020-2022 period include an environmental criterion to reduce the Group's CO2 emissions (see  Note  6.3  Share-based compensation  in  the  Notes  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Environmental Management System\n\nTo  achieve  the  objectives  of  reducing  environmental  risks  and impacts,  the  Group  is  progressively  rolling  out  environmental management  systems  (EMS)  in  accordance  with  ISO  14001  in its  main  host  countries. This internationally recognized standard describes how companies should organize themselves to manage the environmental impact of their activities. The standard's 2015 version includes new requirements, which the Group is gradually integrating, notably through Stakeholder Dialog and by taking into account complete life cycle impacts.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.1.3 Environmental compliance risk management\n\n## Facilities classified for environmental protection\n\nThe Orange group uses certain facilities, products and substances that may present environmental risks (even minor), some of which are  subject  to  specific  regulations.  That  is  the  case  for  facilities classified  for  environmental  protection  (ICPE)  in  France.  The significant  increase  in  the  number  of  sites  with  ICPE  classified facilities in 2019 is attributable to a revision of regulations (Section ICPE2910 - Combustion facilities), which lowered the classification threshold.",

        "page_content": "These  facilities  are  the  subject  of  ongoing  in-depth  analyses by the Orange group and have led to the adoption of preventive and curative maintenance plans in addition to regulatory periodic inspections. The rollout of the Environmental Management System and ISO 14001 certification audits also ensures compliance with regulations and related controls.\n\nTo prevent health-related risks (Legionnaires' disease) and reduce water consumption, a program to replace air cooling towers with dry  coolers  has  been  underway in France since 2006, although the ongoing restructuring of technical sites is slowing down the program.\n\n| Indicators for France                | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of sites including classified |        |        |        |\n| facilities (ICPE A, D, DC and E)     | 416    | 330    | 346    |\n| Number of wet air-cooling towers     | 26     | 26     | 31     |\n\n## Hazardous substances\n\nSome  facilities  use  regulated  products  or  substances.  These include chlorofluorocarbons (commonly known as CFCs) or other refrigerants  (more  specifically  HCFCs  or  HFCs)  contained  in  air conditioning systems - see above.\n\nOrange requires its suppliers to comply with the European REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) and  implements  the  necessary  means  to  inform  its  customers about the presence of hazardous substances, as defined by the regulation.\n\nOrange  complies  with  the  European  RoHS  II  directive,  which requires  the  Group  to  meet  specific  producers'  or  distributors' obligations  to  limit  the  use  of  certain  hazardous  substances  in electrical  and  electronic  equipment.  In  its  contracts,  the  Group requires its suppliers to apply the European RoHS II directive to all products subject to it, including outside Europe.\n\n## Provisions for environmental risk\n\nIn accordance with its relevant accounting policies, Orange does not recognize provisions for the asset impairment losses that the company may incur as a result of adverse weather conditions, on the grounds that potential losses resulting from weather events can only be confirmed by the occurrence of uncertain future events that are beyond the control of the company.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Orange  group  believes  that  its  activities  as  a telecommunication operator do not pose a serious direct threat to the environment. The Group's activities do not entail production processes  with  a  severe  impact  on  scarce  or  non-renewable resources, natural resources (water, air) or biodiversity and in most cases do not involve any lethal risks. That is why no provision for environmental risk is made in the Group's accounts.\n\nHowever, a provision is recognized to cover the Group's obligation to  dismantle  installed  technical  equipment  and  to  restore  the technical sites it occupies.\n\nThe provision is set on the basis of:\n\n- -dismantling  costs  (on  a  per-unit  basis  for  telephone  poles, terminals and public phones, and per site for mobile network antennas)  borne  by  the  Group  to  meet  its  environmental obligations;\n\n- -annual scheduled asset returns and departures from sites.\n\nI n the Group's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision totaled 897 million euros, of which 396 million euros  for  Orange  SA.  It  consists  predominantly  of  the  cost  of restoring mobile antenna sites to their former state, reprocessing of telephone poles, managing electrical and electronic waste, batteries and accumulators, and dismantling public phones. A portion of the sites dismantling provisions has been transferred from Orange SA to Totem and is recognized at Group level.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.2 Employment-related consequences of our activities\n\nThe  framework  for  controlling  non-financial  risks  linked  to  the employment-related consequences of the activities concerns:\n\n- -the difficulty for Orange to obtain and retain the skills needed for its activities;\n- -the prevention of internal and external human risks relating to health and safety; and\n- -the  preservation  and  protection  of  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms in relation to its employees or those of its supply chain.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.2.1 Securing the skills required for Orange's activities\n\nTo  support  the  growth  ambitions  identified  in  the  Engage  2025 strategic  plan  and  adapt  to  a  constantly  changing  world,  the Group is placing artificial intelligence and data at the heart of this transformation. An ambitious upskilling and professional retraining plan has been launched to ensure that Orange employees have the  right  skills  at  the  right  time  to  meet  the  Group's  challenges, while giving them the means to build and secure their professional careers.\n\n## Employment and skills development\n\nThe Orange group's employment/skills policy is based on Strategic Workforce Planning (SWP), the HR version of the Group's strategic plan, together with Employment & Skills Planning (ESP), which are conducted periodically by entities, based on varying timeframes and degrees of granularity. The identification of skills is based on two frameworks common to the entire Group:\n\n- -the  jobs  framework,  which  has  been  implemented  in  the Group's management tools since early 2020;\n- -the  skills  framework,  which  is  being  structured:  strategic areas of expertise have already been identified. They include key  skills  (listening  and  acting,  communicating  with  impact, working  together,  entrepreneurial  spirit,  using  and  securing data,  SoftAware)  and  key  expertise  (data  AI,  cybersecurity, development, virtualization, the Cloud, etc.).\n\nOrange's skills development and professional retraining program is open to all employees throughout their working lives. It is based on three main priorities:\n\n- -continue to adapt employee skills on all its markets and in all its geographic areas to guarantee the excellence of customer relations;\n- -make sure that all Group employees, regardless of their business area, are comfortable and familiar with new technologies such as data, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and train high-level experts in each of these areas;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

The proposed training offer can be accessed through the Orange Group Learning portal, which includes a portal dedicated to professional retraining in order to identify the training courses that offer bridges to another business area.\n\nOrange Campus and the Group's business schools also propose training  programs  for  new  technological  expertise  in  three dimensions:\n\n- -acculturation programs to enable all employees to learn about these new technologies in order to understand the challenges and the potential benefits;\n- -skills development courses to strengthen the level of expertise of our specialists in each of these key fields (upskilling); and\n- -professional retraining to allow those who wish to access these areas of expertise and encourage internal mobility (reskilling).\n\nIn  France, Orange has chosen to offer certification courses with more than 500 recognized certificates. New ones may be created in partnership with external certifying organizations. They mainly include National Education diplomas and certifications on the list of the National Register of Vocational Certifications (Registre National des Certifications Professionnelles - RNCP), in areas prioritized by the Group.\n\nIn France, three levers for the acquisition of new skills are favored:\n\n- -internal mobility, the priority nature of which was reaffirmed by the creation of a mobility/fluidity program in September 2020. This program aims to simplify the process, open up possibilities and boost fluidity within the Group in France by empowering employees in their mobility;\n- -skills  development,  which  is  based  on  identifying  all  of  the employee's professional experiences, beyond training alone;\n- -external recruitment to bring in additional resources in the key areas of expertise identified by the Group.\n\nA new intergenerational agreement for the 2022-2024 period, part of labor and management dialog in France, proposes measures to promote the workplace integration of young people, for employees at  the  end  of  their  career  and  the  transmission  of  knowledge. The agreement should allow us to continue to recruit externally, welcome a large number of young people on work-study contracts and promote access to the professions of the future; it provides for the recruitment of 8,000 people on permanent contracts, with a particular focus on people under the age of 30; it offers mid-career 'breathing space' and an attractive support package for employees who wish to retire early or rethink the last part of their careers; it also seeks to rebalance the workforce in central and support functions, and in operational and production functions.\n\nIn certain activities with less value added for the Group, particularly in  the  areas  of  fiber  network  construction,  copper  network maintenance and Orange customer services, outsourcing is used in addition to those methods.\n\nOutside France, the employment/skills policy is organized around two main principles, applicable to all entities: acquire key expertise essential for the Group's development and encourage inter-regional mobility.\n\nTo  facilitate  the  application  of  these  principles  and  gain  better overall visibility, there is ongoing work to identify and localize the skills  available  inside  the  Group,  prior  to  the  implementation  of training plans and support for professional development. The other aspects of the employment/skills policy are applied in accordance with local legislative contexts.\n\n## Compensation\n\nCompensation policy is a fundamental component of management, designed to meet the Orange group's strategic objectives, and is consistent with other HR policies (recruitment, career development, training  and  working  conditions).  It  aims  to  acknowledge  the acquisition  of  new  skills  useful  to  the  Group's  ambitions.  In  this respect, in France, the Group relies on a skills and qualifications recognition agreement signed in 2017.\n\nIt is conducted with respect for diversity and professional equality, notably  through  commitments  to  equal  pay  between  men  and women, as per the global  agreement  on  gender  equality  in  the workplace within the Orange group.\n\nEach  entity's  compensation  policy  takes  into  account  the  local situation, the need to attract and retain talent, and its cost, which must be affordable for the entity.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.2.2 Occupational health and safety\n\nPotential  or  actual  health  and  safety  violations  that  Orange  may have caused were addressed in the 2021 Vigilance Plan.\n\n## Group occupational health and safety policy\n\nOrange's commitment to occupational health and safety is led by its Chairman and CEO, and is regularly reaffirmed in a Group Quality of Life at Work (QLW) policy letter. The policy is based on the global health and safety agreement signed in November 2014, the French law with extraterritorial application of March 27, 2017 on the Duty of Vigilance (see Section 4.7 Duty of Vigilance) and the laws and regulations in force in each country. The QLW policy letter dated March 31, 2021 sets guidelines consistent with the Group Engage 2025 strategic plan to guarantee the security of employees, protect their health and improve quality of life at work. It entails:\n\n- -learning from the health crisis and incorporating the challenges linked  to  the  new  ways  of  working,  especially  with  the development of telework;\n- -focusing  more  on  the  development  of  primary  prevention through  better  anticipation  of  individual  and  collective  risk factors;\n- -continuing to adapt the Group in a responsible manner with assessments of the human impact of work performed upstream of projects; and\n- -enhance the Orange contractual policy by relying on constant social dialog.\n\nIn  2021,  a  new  Quality  of  Life  at  Work  Governance  policy  was implemented in the Group. The QLW Department which reports to the Group People & Transformation Department is responsible for  defining  and  driving  the  Group's  policy  on  Health,  Safety, Risk prevention, Social issues and the work environment in their collective and individual dimensions. It sets the general guidelines and priorities for all entities in France, ensures their implementation and acts as an advisor to all Group entities.",

The QLW policy is deployed operationally by each of the Divisions. They exercise their role with full responsibility. They are responsible for ensuring that the Group's priorities are applied within their scope and for their adaptation to the specific characteristics of each business area.\n\n## The Orange group's global health and safety agreement\n\nSigned in November 2014, the global health and safety agreement lays down a common foundation for the Group in terms of health, safety and quality of life at work and health protection in general.\n\nBased  on  a  participatory  approach  involving  all  stakeholders, including social dialog in the field of occupational health and safety, it also requires particular vigilance with regard to the occupational health  and  safety  policy  specific  to  Orange's  partners  and subcontractors, which preceded the law on the duty of vigilance and the ISO45001 international standard dated 2018.\n\nIt  requires  the  introduction of an occupational health and safety management  system  (OHSMS)  complying  with  an  international standard within each Group entity. The choice of standard on which the OHSMS is based is left to each entity: it may be ISO45001 or the Group OHSMS standard, itself based on the former OHSAS 18001 standard and updated in accordance with ISO45001.\n\nSince 2015, the Group Quality of Life at Work Department and, in France, the National Prevention Department which reports to it since 2021, ensure the smooth organization of OHSMS audits every two years, or every three years for ISO45001-certified audits. Note that the Shared Occupational Safety Area became part of the new Group Quality of Life at Work Department in 2021.\n\nThe agreement also promotes any initiatives to participate in health protection programs adapted to the local context and practices. In  particular,  it  ensures  non-discrimination  in  terms  of  health  for employees, with a particular focus on population groups that are vulnerable due to their state of health.\n\nIt has led to the adoption of coverage of health costs as a standard measure within the company's entities in Africa. The financing of the construction and maintenance of Orange Villages by the Orange Foundation (active since 2005), with schools, water sources, health centers and mother and child protection centers, is also part of the health promotion initiatives called for by the global health and safety agreement. In the same spirit, an annual collaboration with the World Health Organization allows the Orange group to be an e-health operational player alongside local bodies in a number of African countries.\n\nThe quantitative and qualitative criteria mentioned in the agreement are used to monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement and internal and external audits are performed by the Audit Department and by several structures  respectively  (Independent  auditors  for the quality of health and safety reporting, Positivity index for the ISO45001-certified OHSMS rate).\n\nThe  analysis  of  these  indicators  and  the  development  of  action plans  are  supported,  monitored  and  promoted  by  the  Group Occupational  Quality  of  Life  Department,  and  are  presented annually to the Worldwide Works Council and the UNI global union, among other bodies. Among other aspects, these indicators cover accidents (workplace and commuting accidents), sick leave, the existence of a health and safety policy letter specific to the entity, the  establishment  of  an  OHSMS  (and  related  training  initiatives together with audit dates) and public health campaigns aimed at the  Orange  population  and/or  the  general  population.  Accident data  are  monitored  not  only  within  the  Group,  but  also  among subcontractors.\n\n## Social dialog on occupational health and safety\n\nSocial dialog on occupational health and safety takes place within the legal or employee representative bodies in France and in each international subsidiary in the form of agreements signed with the social partners. The Global Works Council and the European Works Council are also forums for social dialog on occupational health and safety within the Group.\n\nOrange  is  also  present  through  the  Group  Labor  Relations Department and the Group Occupational Quality of Life Department in  the  Sectoral  Social  Dialogue  Committee  of  the  European Commission's telecommunication branch. Occupational health and safety are central to the work of that body.\n\nIn France, a number of agreements promote the implementation of the Group's quality of life at work policy and the active prevention of risks to employee health and safety:\n\n- -the  telework  agreement,  amended  in  2017,  makes  telework part of an overall financial, employee-related and environmental approach, with expected benefits in terms of well-being at work and savings in travel time;\n- -the agreement on the assessment and adaptation of workloads (2016)  sets  out  a  methodological  framework  and  common benchmarks, providing a practical understanding of workload issues in relation to changes in the workforce and skills;\n- -the  agreement  on  the  assessment  and  prevention  of psychosocial risks (2010) notably endorsed the creation of a National Stress Prevention Committee;\n- -the  agreement  on  workplace  gender  equality  and  work-life balance (2018) offers a framework to facilitate the best balance between professional and private life for each employee, and also enabling them to overcome major life events.\n\n## People involved in prevention\n\nIn  France,  the  network  of  more  than  200  prevention  officers provides methodological support to the teams and offers advice and local expertise on occupational risk prevention issues.\n\nInternationally, health and safety managers play a similar role, and receive support from the Group Quality of Life at Work Department through regular unilateral contacts or exchanges of best practices, including through the 'Quality of Life at Work by Orange meetings' organized on occupational health and safety topics such as the duty of care, harassment and violence in the workplace, telework, health crisis management, and international business travel and assignments.\n\nThe  organization  of  occupational  health  services  depends  on the  legislation  in  each  country.  They  are  either  inter-company or  stand-alone  services,  as  is  the  case  in  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire,  Egypt, Senegal, Mali and Orange France.\n\nWithin the Group Safety Department, the Group also benefits from an occupational health and safety team comprising an international safety director and an international medical consultant, who work in cooperation with the Group's major divisions and provide them with support through shared constant health and safety monitoring on a specific site, expert field visits at the request of the entities, and assistance to entities and employees on international business trips or expatriates in the event of a health and/or safety crisis.\n\nIn  addition, as part of its prevention policy, the Group organizes an employee survey known as the 'Employee Barometer,' enabling everyone to express their views on their experience of working at Orange and their understanding of the Group and its transformation. The system was designed to enable each Group entity to better understand the expectations of its employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

The purpose of this evaluation is to draw up an action plan applied in Operational Units and taken into account in the single document on occupational risk assessment (Document Unique d'Evaluation des Risques Professionnelles  DUERP). The latest survey addressed on October 11, 2021 to all employees must enable the evaluation of the impacts of the health crisis and the new work organizations on all Orange employees in France. The associated action plan is defined in the context of the CNPS and shared with the statutory bodies of Establishments in early 2022.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.2.3 Social  dialog\n\nThe Orange group promotes a substantial structured social dialog involving its employees, labor unions and associations of employee representatives.  With  a  view  to  increasing  transparency  and consultation, Orange has set up employee representative bodies for all  scopes. Each of these bodies has its own prerogatives to strengthen social dialog.\n\nOrange  recognizes  the  right  to  freedom  of  association, representation and membership in a trade union for its employees in accordance with the principles set out in ILO Convention No. 87 (1948) on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise. Employees are free to become members of their choice of trade union or to choose not to do so.\n\nThe Worldwide  Works  Council is  a  forum  for  social  dialog created  by  an  agreement  signed  in  June  2010.  It  enables  all Group employees worldwide to be represented, and to exchange information  with  employee  representatives  on  transnational economic, financial and employee-related issues. It is responsible for  promoting  the  communication  of  Group  issues  to  employee representatives,  strengthening  the  Group's  social  dialog  at  the global level and is in line with the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) development strategy.\n\nThe  Council  does  not  replace  existing  national  representation bodies  or  the  European  Works  Council.  It  complements  the agreement signed in 2006 with the UNI global union on respect for fundamental rights. It meets at least once a year at the initiative of its Chair, who is the Group's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or his representative, and whenever exceptional circumstances so require, with the agreement of management.\n\nThe European  Works  Council is  a  European-level  forum  for social dialog on economic, financial and employee-related issues. It  was  created  by  an  agreement  signed  on  April  14,  2004.  It  is responsible for developing social dialog at European level; creating a forum for discussion and dialog on broad economic, financial and employee-related issues at an overall European level that go beyond the borders of any single country (industrial and innovation strategy, major investment policies, employment, etc.); it complements the national social dialog bodies, without aiming to replace or supervise them.\n\nThe European Works Council meets at least three times a year, and whenever exceptional circumstances so require. Its members receive regular information on the life of the Group, and conference calls are organized whenever warranted by events.\n\nOther national social dialog bodies complete this arrangement, such as the France Works Council , which is responsible for ensuring communication and dialog with the employee representatives from the Group's various entities in France. It meets at least four times a year. It receives information on the activity, the financial position, and changes in the Group's employment and structure.\n\nThere  are  also  different  national  social  dialog  bodies  that enable  employee  representatives  to  be  heard.  In  regions  where representative bodies are not legally required, the Group promotes the creation of employee forums in order to establish formalized dialog.\n\n2.2.3.2.2.4\n\nPromoting diversity and inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  Group  Diversity  &  Inclusion  policy  contributes  to  the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals 10, and to a lesser extend 16 and 17 due to the Group's activity and its economic and social role. The aim is to make the company an ever more inclusive place, giving everyone the opportunity to grow and participate in value creation for the community.\n\nThis policy was updated and enhanced in June 2021. It is based on a cross-functional approach, which consists of combating all forms of discrimination and promoting the inclusion of all employees; a vertical approach, based on three main priorities: gender equality in the workplace, equal opportunities and digital equality.\n\n## Gender equality in the workplace\n\nProfessional  gender  equality  is  a  priority  shared  by  all  Orange entities worldwide. Orange's gender equality policy is steered by the  Professional  Equality  Strategy  Committee,  created  in  2011 and composed of members of the Executive Committee, as well as key representatives of Group entities internationally. It is based on  the  global  agreement  on  gender  equality,  the  fight  against discrimination and violence, and work-life balance signed by the Group with UNI global union on July 17, 2019. It is implemented through  local  committees  and  a  network  of  dedicated  liaison officers in the main subsidiaries and entities. It is monitored jointly by the Group and UNI global union.\n\nFurthermore, the Group has been a signatory of the United Nations' Women Empowerment Principles since March 2015.\n\nThe professional gender equality policy is based on five pillars:\n\n- -the  gender  balance  in  all  of  the  Group's  business  areas, particularly in the technical and digital professions; the Group has set itself a target of 25% of women in these professions by 2025. Orange has been a member of the Femmes@numerique Foundation since 2018, and a signatory of the Manifesto for the reconversion of women for digital professions since 2019. In addition, in 2020 the Group launched a dedicated program, Hello Women, structured around four pillars: raise awareness, recruit, retrain, retain;\n- -access for women to management positions: the Group has set  a  target  of  35%  (which  is  rolled  out  annually)  of  senior management positions being held by women by 2025, in line with the percentage of women in its workforce; this policy is supplemented by a special focus on the percentage of women on the Boards of Directors of Group subsidiaries and on the specialized committees reporting to the Executive Committee;\n- -gender  equality  on  pay:  the  global  agreement  of  2019  set a  2025  target  for  gender  equality  for  pay,  for  comparable positions, among all Orange employees throughout the world;\n- -work-life balance: the Group, which has been a signatory to the Charter of 15 commitments for a balanced life since 2013, signed  the  new  charter  for  parenthood  in  the  company  on October 6, 2021;",

It covers the period from 2022 to 2024.\n\n## Equal opportunity and combating discrimination\n\nThe equal opportunities policy has been a key factor in promoting diversity and inclusion in the Group. Each country, depending on its economic, corporate and social challenges, is responsible for choosing at least one of the five dimensions of diversity below:\n\n- -disability:  Orange  has  been  a  signatory  of  the  International Labour Organization (ILO) 'Enterprise and Disability' charter since  2015,  and  participates  in  global  movements  (i.e.  The Valuable  500,  Global  Business  Diversity  Network  of  ILO). The Group adopted the three principles of GSMA 'Principles for  Driving  the  Digital  Inclusion  of  Persons  with  Disabilities' announced  in  December  2020  to  make  digital  a  lever  for including persons with disabilities. In France, on February 4, 2021 Orange signed the seventh agreement for the employment and integration of people with disabilities and the fight against discrimination. It covers the period from 2021 to 2023;\n- -age:  On  December  17,  2021,  Orange  signed  a  new intergenerational  agreement  for  the  2022-2024  period  (see Section  2.2.3.2.2.1  Securing the skills required for Orange's activities);\n- -more  than  ever,  the  Group  is  determined  to  act  for  the employability of young people from underprivileged backgrounds.  In  France,  Orange  is  thus  committed  in the  government  program  #1Young  person,  1Solution  and participating  in  applying  #1Young  person,  1Mentor  by supporting associations that work to promote equal opportunity and by relying particularly on the commitment of its voluntary employees;\n- -the  origins:  the  Group  is  a  signatory  of  the  Charter  of Mobilization for the Defense of Equality against Racism, and is\n\n2.2.3.2.3\n\nBusiness ethics (fight against fraud, corruption tax evasion and any violations of\n\nbusiness ethics)\n\n## 2.2.3.2.3.1 Business practice ethics policy\n\nOrange  applies  a  comprehensive  approach  to  manage  risks  of unethical behavior (fraud, corruption and influence peddling, tax evasion  and  violations  of  business  ethics),  aimed  at  continuous\n\nimprovement  and  built  around  six  steps:  Management commitment, Governance, Risk analysis, Policies and procedures, Awareness-raising and training, and Controls.\n\n| Step                                | Description                                                                                          |\n|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| #1 Setting the tone                 | The tone set by Senior Executives and managers at all levels in the Group                            |\n| #2 Governance                       | The organization and resources to implement risk measurement actions                                 |\n| #3 Risk analysis                    | Risk analysis to define a proportionate approach                                                     |\n| #4 Policies and procedures          | Policies and procedures to ensure their local implementation through appropriate actions             |\n| #5  Awareness-raising and  training | Awareness-raising for all employees through appropriate communication and targeted training programs |\n| #6 Controls                         | Controls to measure the proper implementation and effectiveness of the program                       |\n\nattentive to the risks of discrimination related to origins (ethnic, social, cultural, geographic, etc.). In France, Orange is a partner of 'Club du 21 e si\u00e8cle' which strives to promote a positive vision of diversity and is a signatory of PAQTE 'Pact with communities for all businesses';\n\n- -identity: the Group is a signatory to the L'Autre Cercle LGBT+ workplace rights commitment charter and the UN Standards of Conduct for Tackling Discrimination against LGBTI people;\n- -personal opinions: Orange has formalized; through its neutrality charter,  the  framework  and  the  commitments  undertaken by the Group in France in the field of individual or collective freedom of expression.\n\n## Digital equality\n\nDiversity  and  inclusion  must  be  reflected  in  the  digital  equality strategy implemented by the Group. In this respect, Orange makes sure that new technologies, work methods and environments do not become a source of discrimination related to bias and stereotypes but a lever for social cohesion, and a synonym of progress both internally and externally.\n\nThree  areas  of  intervention  have  been  identified  to  complement Group actions to promote digital inclusion:\n\n- -the  development  of  inclusive  artificial  intelligence:  Orange is  the  initiator,  with  the  Arborus  endowment  Fund,  of  the International charter for inclusive AI launched in April 2020 (see Section 2.2.3.2.5.3 Policy on the use of artificial intelligence).\n- -diversity  in  digital  professions,  particularly  in  innovation:  in connection with our commitments, the Group seeks to diversify profiles  in  order  to  limit  bias  and  best  address  customer expectations;\n- -the  digital  accessibility  of  our  digital  tools  in  the  largest number: Orange makes accessible all its new digital content in accordance with the WCAG AA international standard and by  ensuring  that  a  maximum  of  digital  tools  and  contents published after 2018 are compliant. In addition, to fight against any risk of digital divide, Orange provides its employees with training and support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

This department acts under the authority of the Group Chief Compliance Officer, who reports to  the  Orange  General  Secretary.  The  team  is  in  charge  of designing, rolling out, coordinating and controlling Group-wide compliance programs. It is made up of 10 people;\n- -the Compliance network composed of the Chief Compliance Officers (CCOs) and Compliance Officers (COs) in the Group's divisions  and  subsidiaries.  The  CCOs  are  appointed  by  the members of the Executive Committee and have a network of COs reporting to them. They are responsible for coordinating and supervising the rollout  of  compliance  risk  management programs in their scope;\n- -the network of Ethics Advisors, appointed by the members of the Executive Committee and the CEOs of the subsidiaries and responsible for driving the transmission of the ethical approach among teams.\n\nTo perform their work, these networks rely on the expertise and resources  of  the  Group  Audit,  Control  and  Risk  Management Department (DACRG) and the Group Legal Department.\n\nThe  compliance  process  is  monitored  as  part  of  the  Group's internal control system and by audits carried out by the Group Audit Department (IFACI certified). It is  also  reviewed  by  the  Statutory Auditors as part of their audits of the control environment and the certification of the financial statements.\n\n## Orange's ethics and compliance approach\n\nThe Group's ethics approach is enshrined in the Code of Ethics and is based on the four strong commitments of respect, integrity, quality and team spirit. The Code of Ethics describes the principles of  action  with  respect  to  stakeholders  and  the  principles  of individual  behavior  that  must  guide  the  conduct  of  employees in  their  professional  activities.  These  principles  of  action  and behavior  reflect  the  same  fundamental  principles  set  out  in  the\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and by bodies such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the OECD, as well as the commitments upheld by Orange in terms of social responsibility. This ethics policy is implemented by the network of Ethics Advisors.\n\nSimilarly, the anti-corruption compliance policy is implemented by the CCOs and the COs. It is based on the principle of zero tolerance with  respect  to  corruption  and  influence  peddling,  formalized  in a letter of commitment signed by the members of the Executive Committee.\n\nThese two approaches are based on:\n\n- -an analysis of the risks of a breach of ethics and analyses of corruption and influence peddling risks as applied to the Group, subsidiaries and relevant entities in order to identify the major risks and target controls to be put in place according to the Group Risk Management methodology, using a 'risk cluster' approach;\n- -strong political commitments, with applications of the Group Ethics Charter, such as the supplier code of conduct or charters adapted  by  the  subsidiaries  in  different  countries,  a  Group anti-corruption policy (updated in November 2017) with local applications where necessary, as well as its Guiding Principles updated in October 2018;\n- -Group policies and procedures adapted to local situations:\n- -a risk-based fraud and compliance due diligence procedure applied to B2B customers, partners and intermediaries,\n- -a 'Compliance Clause' included in contracts and purchase orders, updated in 2018,\n- -a  'Gifts  and  Invitations'  policy  governing  any  benefits received or offered; dedicated applications are gradually being rolled out in order to trace managerial declarations and validations of possible overruns of established limits,\n- -principles for preventing and managing conflicts of interest;\n- -a  Group  whistleblowing  mechanism  completed  by  local systems  and  dedicated  to  gathering  reports  of  violations  or fraud in the areas of accounting, internal control and auditing, in  terms  of  corruption  and  influence  peddling  or  conduct  or situations that could constitute a serious violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, or affecting the health and safety of people or the environment;\n- -ethics  training  and  awareness-raising  actions  and  training and  awareness-raising  tools  for  corruption  prevention  via self-learning  videos  and  content  (e-learning,  quiz,  etc.)  and teaching materials for face-to-face training sessions are made available to Compliance Officers and Ethics Advisors so that they  can  organize  training  and  awareness-raising  programs reflecting the needs of the entities and the risks identified as closely as possible;\n- -an annual Ethics and Compliance Day; and\n- -regular control measures (internal audits, project reviews, etc.) to assess the efficiency of existing measures and improvement leads (internal audits, project reviews, etc.).\n\n## 2.2.3.2.3.2 Compliance with economic sanction\n\nprograms\n\nBeing an international group implies remaining vigilant in the face of  a  changing  environment  and  the  existence  of  numerous  and changing  programs  of  economic  sanctions  and  embargoes.  In 2013,  Orange  issued  a  Group  policy  on  economic  sanctions, and  published  a  legal  and  compliance  manual  on  international economic sanctions in order to secure its business and international development.  In  particular,  the  Group  carries  out  compliance assessments (or due diligence) of its relationships with its partners, suppliers and customers.",

In  particular,  in  geographies where Orange is the dominant operator, it ensures that it does not apply predatory pricing in relation to other operators.\n\nIn France, the Group's Legal and Regulatory Affairs Departments are integrated into the tender construction and marketing processes in order to ensure that bids and prices offered in the retail market (B2C or B2B) comply with competition rules.\n\nIn other geographies, Group teams regularly communicate on the rules and processes to be implemented, and support local teams to ensure the same level of compliance. They also provide support to local teams when they require an additional level of reassurance with respect to current or future business practices.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.3.4 Tax  policy\n\nOwing to its business activities, Orange has assets and employees in  a  number  of  countries.

Orange  publishes  information  relating to  operating  taxes  and  levies  payables  in  Note  10 Taxes to the consolidated  financial  statements,  including  information  on  the breakdown of taxes payable by geography or by tax consolidation group over three fiscal years (see Section 3.3 Consolidated financial statements), and in its annual Tax Transparency report, available on the website at gallery.orange.com/RSE/Non-Financial Reporting.\n\nThe  Group's  approach  to  tax  is  based  on  three  fundamental principles:\n\n- -comply with the laws of each country;\n- -comply with the OECD principles: Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and Tax Administrations;\n- -regularly  assess  practices  and  compare  them  with  existing solutions in the market to ensure their relevance.\n\nOrange in no way seeks to avoid paying taxes and duties, including through  complex  and  opaque  structures.  Orange  publishes  the list  of  countries  in  which  the  Group has interests in its Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Group Tax Director, who reports directly to the Delegate Chief Executive  Officer,  Executive  Director  Finance,  Performance  and Development, has a dedicated team. The Group has drawn up a Code of Tax Ethics that applies to all Group tax specialists and concerns  all  tax  operations.  The  Code  states  that  'the  Orange group's tax specialists may propose the tax options most favorable to the Orange group, knowing that their proposals must be made based on an analysis that is professional, honest, objective and l a w f u l '.\n\nEach year, the tax process is subject to a review under the SarbanesOxley Act (see Section 2.2.2.2 Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act). This control process covers Orange SA and its main subsidiaries. The work conducted by Orange and the independent assessment of the Statutory Auditors both resulted in satisfactory conclusions for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nThanks to its tax policy described above, Orange has not identified any  risk  of  tax  evasion  as  liable  to  create  risks  for  the  Group's operations or reputation.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.3.5 Lobbying transparency policy\n\nOrange acts transparently in its lobbying activities and is registered with the French High Authority (HATVP (1) ), in compliance with the provisions of Article 25 of Law No. 2016-1691 of December 9, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption, and the modernization of economic life (known as Sapin II) governing its relationships with national public decision-makers. As such, Orange does not donate to political parties and reports the amount of expenses related to its representation actions. Orange is also listed in the European Union Transparency Register (2) .\n\nPeople performing interest representation activities for the Group are clearly identified and comply with the Group's Code of Ethics, which  is  supplemented  by  principles  issued  by  the  Group  for interest representatives. They mainly include the absence of any public  political  statements  in  the  name  of  the  company.  They accordingly act in compliance with the Code of Conduct for Interest Representatives before European bodies, and in particular:\n\n- -in full transparency, by declaring their identity and the interests defended;\n- -i n compliance with business ethics by refraining from taking any steps to obtain information or decisions by fraudulent means;\n- -by  guaranteeing  the  quality  and  reliability  of  the  information provided to public authorities, without political exclusivity; and\n- -by responding to any request for information.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.4\n\n2.2.3.2.4.1\n\nEffects of our activities in terms of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImpact study on human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nEach  year,  Orange  performs  a  human  rights  impact  analysis, which  determines  its  risk  assessment  by  geography.  The  latter determines the targeting of actions to be taken by the Group and is shared with entities as part of the Vigilance Plan; it leads to an exchange with the managers of the area in which the countries most at risk are located to recall governance and processes set up by the Group, as well as the GNI principles followed by Orange for conducting its business (see below). In particular, the Group has set up a specific business continuity plan for pre-election periods in high-risk countries, including personnel safety and security, critical infrastructure protection, and continuity of service to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

Respect for the fundamental principles set  out  in  the  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights  and  the International Labour Organization explicitly features in the Group's Code of Ethics. Orange thus asserts its commitment to respecting and promoting fundamental human rights in its activities and sphere of influence, in particular in supporting and promoting freedom of expression and respect for privacy worldwide. It also confirms its commitment to ensure that these rights are respected by each of its employees and managers, both internally (employee relations) and  in  its  relationships  with  its  customers,  partners,  suppliers and  subcontractors;  In  2017,  Orange  published  its  first  report dedicated to respect for human rights, drawn up in accordance with a reporting framework aligned with the United Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, which was subsequently transcribed in 2021 in its fifth Declaration on Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking (available at gallery.orange.com).\n\nAny potential or actual breaches of human rights and fundamental freedoms that Orange may have caused are taken into account in Orange's 2021 Vigilance Plan.\n\nIn 2006, Orange signed a global agreement on fundamental rights for workers with UNI global union, on the application throughout the world of the fundamental conventions of the International Labour Organization (ILO); for the Orange group, the agreement affirms:\n\n- -the condemnation and prohibition of using all forms of forced or compulsory labor in accordance with ILO conventions Nos. 29 and 105 on forced labor;\n- -the prohibition, as provided for by ILO conventions Nos. 138 and 182 on the minimum age for entry into work, using child l abor of children under the mandatory school age in the relevant country or, in any event, before 15 years of age; and\n- -the elimination of discrimination in work relations.\n\nThe commitment of suppliers, subcontractors and service providers in  these  three  points  is  a  selection  criterion  for  Orange  when reviewing responses to calls for tenders and remains a decisive factor during the contractual relationship.\n\nRespect for the health and safety of employees is part of Orange's commitment to promote human rights in its sphere of influence, the purpose of this policy is to integrate the health and safety of employees and those of its subcontractors in a timely manner in all the Group's activities.\n\nThis global agreement also covers the promotion of social dialog and relations with union organizations for Orange employees.\n\nOrange  has  also  undertaken  to  inform  its  own  suppliers  and subcontractors of the existence of this agreement.\n\nUnder  the  agreement,  the  Group's  management,  UNI  global union and its French trade union members and Orange's global trade union alliance representative meet twice a year to review the effectiveness of its application.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.4.2 Control framework for personal data protection\n\n## Group policy on the protection of personal data\n\nThe protection of personal data is governed by the general data security  framework  implemented  by  Orange,  which  covers  both corporate information and personal data. It is one of the important areas  that  Orange  aims  to  develop  to  support  its  Engage  2025 strategic plan, and is covered by a Security Policy aimed at ensuring the continuous improvement of security based on risk management and assessment (particularly cybersecurity). It is regularly updated to mitigate the impact of incidents, or even crises, depending on the level of threat and changes in the environment.\n\nThe Group applies international standards such as ISO27001 for information security and ISO27005 for risk assessments, to guide its actions. The Group holds several certifications, attesting to the quality  of  the  resources  devoted  to  enhancing  the  protection  of Orange's assets and those of its customers. They cover scopes as varied as Orange Money, for African subsidiaries, Plazza, the Group's  employee  social  network,  the  design,  engineering  and support of business services for OBS and European subsidiaries.\n\nThese standards help enhance security management at the entity level  by  providing  a  common  Group-level  framework;  security staff can then decide more effectively which measures to take to prevent threats, and even detect them more quickly, contain them and eradicate any that do occur. The technical and organizational mechanisms derived from the overall security policy are formalized i n the Group Security Standard, which focuses on essential security requirements to be applied throughout the Group. The following are available for security staff:\n\n- -a framework covering the Group Crisis Management Policy;\n- -shared standards defined by the Group Security Standard; it includes 80 minimum rules to be implemented in three areas: information security, physical security and personal security in the face of country risks. Each of these rules is graded, the average determines the overall score of the country. Each year, the entities are evaluated to verify compliance with the security standard. The aim is to reach or maintain a score above 90% for the European and MEA countries;\n- -seminars to share regularly updated best practices in the areas of  physical  security,  data  security,  crisis  management  and business continuity, held annually with the countries of Europe and of Africa;",

        "page_content": "- -a set of provisions enabling the implementation of the Group Security  Policy  specifically  for  personal  data,  taking  into account changes in the European regulatory framework.\n\nOrange  has  thus  developed  a  procedure  to  respond  to  any security-related event or incident involving personal data, a Personal Data Security Guide, a Security Guide for Sensitive Orange Data that  presents  elementary  security  rules  and  actions  to  follow  in order to identify sensitive information and secure it from end to end throughout its life.\n\nSeveral  security  monitoring  centers  also  regularly  monitor deviations from security policies and alerts that may be triggered in  the  event of suspicious activity. Any such alerts are analyzed, and remediation procedures are monitored depending on the level of criticality.\n\nAside from the security of personal data, Orange strives to master all the requirements set for the responsible use of personal data, in a consistent approach aligned with the Group's internal policy.\n\nThe protection framework applies both in intra-Group relationships and with all of the Group's partners and service providers. It seeks to  integrate,  from  the  design  stage,  the  key  elements  enabling the effectiveness of individual rights. This protection framework is integrated into partnership relations or third-party service revenue.\n\n## Governance and implementation framework\n\nThe Group's data protection security governance is the responsibility of the Executive Director of the Strategy and Cybersecurity Division. It  is  implemented  by  the  Group  Security  Department  under  his authority. All documents and processes constituting the security policy  are  communicated  by  the  Group  Security  Director  to  the community of security officers in the entities and to the Group's executive directors. On a daily basis, multidisciplinary committees monitor the projects from an operational standpoint.\n\nThe security policy, like that relating to personal data protection, is presented every year to the Group's Risks Committee and during various internal control reviews. Their application is verified as part of the annual assessment of the entities under the authority of the Group Security Department, and any deviations are addressed in action plans managed locally or monitored at Group level when they cover certain subjects such as identity and access management and the encryption of messaging and workstations. The findings of the annual assessments focus on proposed areas of improvement, and  help  inform  management  and  the  relevant  members  of  the Executive Committee. These assessments are supplemented by penetration tests to verify cyber resilience. They are the subject of a report, including an action plan, which is sent to the entity's CEO.\n\nTo ensure the protection of personal data, a specific organization and Group-level governance have been established in the entities. Compliance  with  the  European  Data  Protection  Regulation (GDPR) is ensured through a risk-based approach, as promoted by that regulatory framework. It is based on the positions of Data Protection  Officers  (DPOs)  or  liaison  officers,  who  rely  on  the Group's internal personal data management policies. Alongside the Group's security policy, it contributes to creating the conditions for mitigating the risk on personal data processed by Orange through various  components:  organization,  governance,  documentation (including standard documents such as data protection clauses) awareness-raising and training, and checks.\n\nA network of Data Protection Officers and liaison officers has been formed within the entities to provide guidance on the significant changes  in  European  regulations,  which  affect  many  of  the Group's entities in Europe and, in some cases, entities outside the European Union. This also makes it possible to monitor the status of regulations in the countries where Orange operates. The Group relies on a broad network of correspondents of several hundreds of individuals with multidisciplinary profiles, including Data Protection Officers  (DPO).  It  is  responsible  for  improving  acculturation  to personal data protection in all business areas including during the integration of new entities in the Group.\n\nThe awareness of all employees is raised through internal training courses on data protection principles. In addition, specific training courses have been developed for data protection officers, project managers, HR and Legal Departments.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.4.3 Control framework for freedom of expression\n\n## Member of the GNI for the promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nOrange  is  committed  to  promoting  freedom  of  expression  and respect for privacy in the ICT sector, in particular within the Global Network  Initiative  (GNI),  a  multi-stakeholder  platform  including Internet  operators,  NGOs,  academics  and  socially  responsible investors.  Orange  and  its  peers  meet  regularly  in  this  body  to exchange best practices in response to government demands in the telecommunication sector. More specifically, they deal with potential conflicts between the assessment of sovereign governments and the  responsibility  of  telecommunication  companies  with  respect to human rights (network access, illegal Internet content, etc.). By pooling the resources of every operator, it can perform a complete analysis of the legal and regulatory framework country by country and establish dialog with governments and international institutions (United Nations, European Commission, the Council of Europe). It is aimed at making recommendations on local policies or laws in  the  interest  of  respecting  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy throughout the world.\n\nThe GNI Principles provide a common Group-wide framework for the development of policies and processes related to freedom of expression and privacy. This framework applies wherever Orange has operational control, and to the extent possible with its business partners, suppliers and distributors. In this respect, Orange ensures that:\n\n- -the  members  of  the  Ethics  and  Sustainable  Performance Committee  and  the  personnel  responsible  for  the  major decisions  affecting  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy  are fully aware of these Principles and the most efficient means to ensure their implementation;\n- -in  circumstances  where  freedom  of  expression  and  privacy may  be  either  compromised  or  promoted,  decisions  taken incorporate these Principles;\n- -the implementation of these Principles respects the safety and freedom of the company's employees.\n\nOrange reports annually on how the Group applies these Principles in its Transparency Report on freedom of expression and respect for privacy available at gallery.orange.com/RSE.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

The summary of these  elements,  as  well  as  the  guidelines  issued  by  the  Group CSR  Department,  are  presented  to  the  Ethics  and  Sustainable Performance  Committee  (offshoot  of  the  Group  Executive Committee)  and  to  the  GCSERC  (Group  Board  of  Directors' Committee).\n\nBased on its participation in the EDH association (Entreprises pour les Droits de l'Homme), a body bringing together 22 of France's largest  corporations,  Orange  has  rolled  out  e-learning  modules available in more than 90% of the Group's countries to promote its main principles among its employees. Within this forum, Orange shares best practices on the implementation of the Vigilance Plan, including the protection of fundamental freedoms.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.4.4 Non-use of minerals from conflict areas\n\nOrange  recognizes  the  legitimacy  of  concerns  about  sourcing materials from regions plagued by political and social conflict, and is committed to using a socially responsible supply chain. However, the supply chain for these minerals is long and complex, involving many players. Orange does not purchase minerals directly, and ensures that its suppliers have performed due diligence to avoid using minerals that may directly or indirectly finance armed groups. As  such,  Orange  contractually  requires  its  suppliers  to  ensure that they themselves do not use minerals from these areas. This obligation  is  explicitly  included  in  its  Code  of  Conduct,  which is  appended to all purchasing contracts, and in the CSR Clause i ncluded in such contracts with the suppliers' signature to 'Orange's Responsible Purchasing Commitments'.\n\nOrange also ensures that this contract clause is correctly followed by its suppliers. To this end, Orange relies on the adherence of its main Tier 1 electrical and electronic equipment suppliers to the RBA (Responsible Business Alliance (1) )  Code of Conduct, which i ncludes a commitment to 'policy and due diligence on the sourcing and traceability of tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold in the products they manufacture to provide reasonable assurance that they are sourced in a manner consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and  High-Risk  Areas,  or  a  recognized  equivalent  due  diligence f r a mework'.\n\nSupplier  evaluations  by  EcoVadis  consider  the  issue  of  non-use of  conflict  minerals.  The  same  applies  to  the  audits  carried  out by  the  JAC,  especially  those  carried  out  on  site,  which  have  a checkpoint on the procedure to ensure the traceability of minerals. Non-compliance on that point results in corrective actions and their follow-up.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.5 Social consequences of our activities\n\nThe  frameworks  for  controlling  non-financial  risks  linked  to  the social consequences of the activities relate to the risks identified in Section 2.1 Risk factors:\n\n- -the possible harmful effects on health of uncontrolled exposure to electromagnetic fields from near and far telecommunication equipment;\n- -the  excessive  or  inappropriate  use  of  telecommunication services and equipment.\n\nThey also cover the more comprehensive notion of responsibility in terms of use of products and services. The Group's commitment is backed by the Responsible Marketing program and the Group's guidelines in its relationship with artificial intelligence.\n\n2.2.3.2.5.1 Policy on the responsible uses\n\nof digital technology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange  undertakes  to  support  the  responsible  use  of  digital technology for all and for families in particular.\n\nTo  combat  inappropriate  uses,  Orange  supports  and  guides stakeholders  toward  peaceful,  responsible  and  creative  digital practices  and  is  setting  up  information  and  awareness-raising tools  to  deal  with  inappropriate  uses  of  technologies.  Orange carefully follows the advice of the experts and authorities on the subject  of  digital  technology  and  health,  and  promotes  their recommendations, particularly those intended for parents, young people and educators in general.\n\nFor children and young people, Orange's commitment is supported by  the  Better  Internet  for  Kids  (BIK (2) )  program,  which  aims  to empower parents and educators to provide children with the best of the digital world.\n\nThus,  Orange's  policy  is  to  support  digital  uses  and  practices adapted to the age and maturity of children and their needs by:\n\n- -fostering the creativity, entrepreneurial spirit and education of young people;\n- -raising  its  employees'  awareness  of  the  issues  involved  in meaningful marketing by laying down guidelines for product managers, and by supporting them in carrying  out  projects (recommendations on virtual reality and augmented reality, for example);\n- -proposing service offers tailored to family requirements;\n- -offering awareness-raising initiatives, workshops and training to support parents, educators and children in the safe uses of digital technology, in cooperation with experts and associations for children and parents;\n- -implementing  parental  control  tools  or  partnerships  to  offer digital coaching services; and\n- -negotiating partnerships to help promote this policy.\n\nThis policy and its follow-up are conducted by the country CSR and  Marketing  teams,  in  coordination  with  the  Child  Protection Committee created in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## 2.2.3.2.5.2 Radio wave policy\n\nMobile  telephony  technologies  are  called  on  to  respond  to  the increasing uses made by users, and may therefore increase the exposure to electromagnetic waves of the general population (via new fixed transmitters) or of users (via new mobile equipment or by creating new behaviors). To best meet this demand, Orange has implemented a Group policy on radio waves and health since 2007, in which it undertakes to:\n\n- -apply the limits defined by the ICNIRP (International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection) and recommended by the WHO for mobiles and mobile network antennas, including in countries within the Orange scope that do not have national regulations;\n- -provide  transparent  and  identical  information  to  all  of  its stakeholders;\n- -publicize the recommendations for the use of mobile devices issued by health authorities to limit exposure to radio waves;\n- -contribute to research and standardization efforts to take these aspects into account as early as possible in product design;\n- -raise awareness of employees working near or on antennas about the safety instructions provided in European Directive 2013/35/EU  of  26  June  2013  and  in  France  its  Decree No. 2016-1074 of August 3, 2016, even in countries not subject to the directive.\n\nCompliance with this policy and these commitments is ensured at Group level by the Radio Waves and Health Committee, comprising an attorney, a public affairs expert, a doctor, a technical expert and two CSR experts, who meet weekly to analyze health and regulatory monitoring, propose initiatives at the Group's operational level and draft 'Group positions' and duty of care notes. These positions are circulated throughout the Group, and even to the Group Executive Committee as necessary.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.5.3 Policy on the use of artificial intelligence\n\nIn its Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange has identified the levers of artificial intelligence (automatic learning, deep learning, etc.) as a performance tool, amplifying the digital transformation. Orange i ntervenes as an expert in 'The High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence' (AI HLEG) of the European Commission and supports the approach. The Group takes inspiration from its key principles:\n\n- -the  goal  of  artificial  intelligence  is  to  contribute  positively  to social and environmental challenges;\n- -solutions based on artificial intelligence must always respect the needs of humans, and operate under their supervision;\n- -they must respect diversity and fight against the risks of bias or discrimination;\n- -the  data  underpinning  artificial  intelligence  algorithms  must respect privacy and be subject to careful governance;\n- -the  robustness  and  security  of  AI-based  solutions  must correspond to the specific challenges of each application;\n- -the  functioning  of  IA-based  solutions  must  be  explained in  a  transparent  and  intelligible  manner,  and  the  chain  of responsibility must be clear.\n\nOrange  is  a  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Impact  AI,  a collective made up of a group of artificial intelligence stakeholders united around two common objectives: addressing the ethical and societal issues of AI and supporting innovative and positive projects around the world.\n\nThe Group ensures that the entire data value chain is responsible and that potential discriminatory biases are identified and controlled.\n\nIn March 2021, Orange set up a Data and AI Ethics Board made up of 11 external individuals, selected for their independence, neutrality, expertise on these issues, and for the diversity of their profiles. The duties of this board include defining an ethical framework for AI and Data, beyond regulatory obligations, in agreement with Orange's values and corporate purpose. It also issues advisory opinions on governance arrangements and on the concrete cases referred to it, for the Orange Executive Committee.\n\nAt  end  2020,  an  audit  carried  out  by  Bureau  Veritas  delivered the GEEIS-AI* framework label for the Group in recognition of its actions in the design, development and use of inclusive artificial intelligence. The label illustrates Orange's commitment to promote digital equality and is in line with the extension of the signature of the International Charter on Inclusive AI.\n\n2.2.3.2.6 Management framework for partners, suppliers and subcontractors\n\n## 2.2.3.2.6.1\n\nRelationships with partners\n\nOrange has an extensive partnership policy  in  order  to  develop different  modes  of  cooperation,  particularly  for  open  innovation (notably  via  Orange  Ventures,  whose  purpose  is  to  create  value by  supporting  entrepreneurship  and  start-ups).  Partnerships may involve funding borne entirely by Orange, either with public entities  (business  development,  external  research,  hosting  PhD students, etc.) or private entities for development services. They may also be based on joint funding or public subsidies, such as in the context of participation in European projects. All partnerships entered  into  by  the  Group  are  subject  to  an  analysis  of  the contributions of each partner, an allocation of ownership by income and  the  definition  of  the  operating  regime  for  the  results.  They give rise to contracts in accordance with the Group's guidelines. Orange applies the business ethics principles defined by the Group for  its  partnerships.  In  sector  partnerships  that  leverage  other stakeholders, the partnerships are also made under the cover of an antitrust declaration.\n\n## 2.2.3.2.6.2 Relationships with suppliers and subcontractors\n\n## Orange's responsible purchasing principles\n\nOrange has for several years implemented a responsible purchasing policy  that  embeds  CSR  in  its  relationships  with  suppliers  and subcontractors and improves management of employee-related, social and environmental risks.\n\nThis policy is implemented by the Global Procurement & Supply Chain Department, which is part of the Orange group Finance & Performance Department and which ensures consistency among all  Group  companies,  each  of  which  has  its  own  purchasing department.  Thus,  more  than  1,500  permanent  employees in  50  countries  and  territories  conducted  negotiations  with 58,700 active suppliers in 2021. A key event for dialog with suppliers is organized annually during the 'Supplier Forum'.\n\nThe Group-level CSR action plan aims to promote the appropriation of CSR commitments by the various purchasing stakeholders and their application in the relevant business processes, and to ensure the Group's compliance with the law on the duty of vigilance. All of these principles have also been adopted by BuyIn, the joint venture between Orange and Deutsche Telekom, which covers the Group's main purchasing domains.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

The Code of Conduct describes in  particular  the  ethics,  employee-related  and  environmental commitments expected by the Group. Orange thus requires that its  partners,  suppliers  and  their  sub-contractors  i)  comply  with all  national,  European  and  international  rules  with  respect  to ethical and responsible behavior. This includes, without limitation, standards dealing with human rights, occupational health and safety conditions,  environmental  protection,  sustainable  development, anti-corruption and child protection; ii) adopt and apply the Group's ethics standards and its commitments and make progress in those areas.\n\nThe responsible purchasing steering committee oversees the implementation of these principles; at least once a year it brings together representatives of the Internal Control Department, Legal, Purchasing and CSR Department. It covers all subsidiaries and is based on five pillars:\n\n- -clear  CSR  commitments  defined  in  Orange's  'Responsible Purchasing Commitments.' They are also stated in the CSR clause of the supplier code of conduct and apply to all suppliers (Group and local);\n- -a  strong  CSR  culture  thanks  to  mandatory  CSR  training sessions for purchasers;\n- -effective CSR risk management based on CSR evaluations and supplier audits;\n- -the  active  search  for  opportunities  through  dialog  with subsidiaries and suppliers;\n- -transparent reporting on the CSR maturity of all subsidiaries.\n\n## Assessment of suppliers and subcontractors\n\nSuppliers and sub-contractors are assessed at several levels of the contractual relationship, using several tools provided to the Group's entities. The assessment is based on a categorization of suppliers and subcontractors with CSR risk in order to prioritize the actions to be carried out to mitigate non-financial risks in the Group's supply chain. The criteria used for this characterization concerns respect for human rights, including work conditions, health and safety and recognition of environmental concerns.\n\n|                                                                                   | Risk category                          | Risk category                                                                                                     | Risk category                                                          | Risk category                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assessment  procedures                                                            | Low human and/ or environmental  risks | Average human and/or  environmental risks                                                                         | High human and/or  environmental risks                                 | Very high human risks                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Type of  assessment                                                               | No assessment                          | Assessment in the event  of doubt                                                                                 | Assessment every two  years                                            | Enhanced assessment                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Initial control (at  the time of the  call for tenders  or contract  negotiation) |                                        | - - An  Ecovadis assessment; or - An Orange internal assessment according to specifications provided by Group CSR | An on-site audit according to specifications provided by Group CSR; or | An on-site audit according to specifications provided by Group CSR; or                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                                                   |                                        |                                                                                                                   | Assessment to be  renewed every two  years at least                    | On-site audit (including those  during the initial control); then  years.                                                                                                                 |\n| Continuous  control                                                               |                                        |                                                                                                                   |                                                                        | provided by JAC), at least the first  year of service or during the term  of the contract if shorter than one  year (if this format was not selected  renewal of the audit once every two |",

        "page_content": "BuyIn  chose  to  use  Ecovadis  for  all  these  audits.  This  service provider offers an ISO 26000-compliant assessment tool to assess the CSR commitment of suppliers.\n\nThe Responsible Purchasing Steering Committee recommends the achievement of a minimum score of 25/100 from one the different assessment procedures in order to be able to enter into a contract with Orange. Corrective action plans are mandatory for prospects or suppliers scoring less than 45/100; they are monitored locally.\n\nThe Group has set up a monitoring and alert system for purchasing and procurement risks related to suppliers deemed key or strategic to the organization and whose failure to comply could have major consequences on the Group's operations.\n\nOnce a year, in addition to the level one control performed locally through the assessment of suppliers and subcontractors, a level two  control  on  the  completeness  of  the  assessments  and  the implementation of the related plans is carried out by the Group's Purchasing  Department.  Level  three  control  is  led  by  Internal Control (DACRG) as part of audits on the Duty of Vigilance.\n\n## The Joint Alliance for CSR\n\nOrange  also  contributes  to  the  development  of  its  standards through the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC - formerly the Joint Audit Cooperation),  which  is  an  association  of  telecommunication operators (18 to date, representing more than 50% of the sector's revenue),  grouped  together  to  audit,  evaluate  and  develop  the implementation of CSR principles by the global suppliers of the ICT sector. Since 2018, the JAC has increased the efficiency of its action through an accreditation program for its suppliers (JAC Academy),\n\ntrained in on-site audit methodology. JAC also works with other institutions  (ITU,  BSR,  CDP,  RMI  and  GSMA)  to  supplement  its requirements on other CSR priorities such as climate change, the circular economy, the traceability of minerals from supply sources that respect human rights and the environment. The JAC is ready to welcome other telecommunication operators so that it can expand its geographical coverage (in Asia, South America and Africa), thus indicating the global nature of its commitment.\n\n## BuyIn\n\nBuyIn is the joint venture created by Orange and Deutsche Telekom in  2011  to  group  together  the  strategic  purchasing  of  the  two international groups. As such, by leveraging its scale, BuyIn can achieve more competitive conditions in terms of quality, price and innovation.  The  company  concentrates  the  assessments  of  its suppliers during calls for tenders. The CSR recommendation that informs this selection is based on the score of the reference partner used by Orange, the results of on-site audits by the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC) and observations by its own CSR experts.\n\nEvery year, BuyIn redefines its risk mapping by purchase category, then conducts a targeted assessment of each high-risk category, as  well  as  the  largest  markets,  in  accordance  with  its  code  of conduct developed with Orange and Deutsche Telekom.\n\nBuyIn makes sure that each supplier under contract has a score higher than the benchmark score defined in our external partner's tool,  or  implements  a  corrective  action  plan  specific  to  those suppliers with lower scores, to allow them to reach the required level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 2\n\n2",

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements. The most significant risks are detailed in Section 2.1 Risk factors.\n\nThe following comments are based on the Consolidated Financial Statements  prepared  in  accordance  with  IFRS  (International Financial  Reporting  Standards,  see  Note  2  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements). The IFRS IC (IFRS Interpretation Committee) decision concerning IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' on the procedures for  calculating  obligations  relating  to  certain  defined-benefits pension  plans  has  been  retrospectively  applied  by  the  Group, affecting opening equity as of January 1, 2019. The application of this decision had no material impact on the Group's Consolidated income statement for the reported periods (see Note 2.3.1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nData  on  a  comparable  basis,  EBITDA  after  Leases  (referred  to as  'EBITDAaL'),  economic  CAPEX  (referred  to  as  'eCAPEX'  or 'economic CAPEX'), the 'EBITDAaL - eCAPEX' indicator, organic cash flow from telecom activities, net financial debt, and the ratio of  net  financial  debt  to  EBITDAaL  from  telecom  activities  are\n\nfinancial  indicators  not  defined  by  IFRS.  For  further  information on the  calculation  of  these  indicators  and  the  reasons  why  the Orange group uses them and considers them useful for readers, see  Section  3.1.5  Financial indicators not defined by IFRS and Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary.\n\nData  on  a  historical  basis  (see  Section  7.2.1 Financial glossary) relates to data for prior periods as reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the current period. The transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis for the 2020 fiscal year is set out in Section 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis.\n\nThe  segment  information  (see  Note  1  to  the  Consolidated Financial  Statements)  that  is  presented  in  the  following  sections is  understood,  unless  stated  otherwise,  before  eliminations  for transactions with other segments.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, data in the tables are presented in millions of euros, without a decimal point.

On a comparable basis, Africa & Middle East countries are the main contributors to this growth with an increase of 10.6% over a year, followed by the Other European countries (up 2.6%) and B2B services (up 0.5%). The 1.6% decrease in revenue in France can be mainly explained by the decline in co-financing received from third-party operators for the FTTH network between the two periods. In Spain, the 4.7% decline in revenue reflects the fiercely competitive environment. On a comparable basis, the increase in Group revenue between 2020 and 2021 is driven by retail services (see Section 7.2.1 Financial Glossary) which continue to grow thanks to convergent services (up 1.9% year-on-year) in France and in Other European countries, and mobile only services (up 4.2%) in Africa and Middle East countries, while the fixed only services fell by 2.8%, affected by the downward trend of classic fixed telephony. On a comparable basis, income from wholesale services is down by 6.8% due to the decrease of co-financing  in  France  while  IT  &  integration  services  (up  6.6%) and equipment sales (up 8.5%) continue to increase, with the latter nearly returning to their 2019 level.\n\nCommercial activity showed very robust performance, particularly for  fiber.  The  Group  has  11.8  million  FTTH  accesses,  up  22.1% year-on-year  on  a  comparable  basis,  on  a  basis  of  56.5  million households  connectable  to  FTTH  connection  at  December  31, 2021, up 19.7% year-on-year. In France, the FTTH access base has grown by 31.7% year-on-year. The convergent customer base has  11.5  million  customers  across  the  Group  at  December  31, 2021,  up  2.1%  year-on-year,  on  a  comparable  basis.  Mobile services have 224.3 million accesses at December 31, 2021, up 4.3% year-on-year, of which 82.0 million are contracts, up 4.8% year-on-year,  on  a  comparable  basis.  Fixed  services  amounted to  46.4  million  accesses  at  December  31,  2021  (down  1.7% year-on-year  on  a  comparable  basis),  of  which  11.8  million  are FTTH accesses, which continue their strong growth (see above). Fixed narrowband accesses dropped 13.3% year-on-year, due to the downward trend for conventional fixed telephony. Lastly, Mobile Financial  Services  cover  1.7  million  customers  in  Europe  and 0.7 million customers in Africa.\n\nEBITDAaL totaled 12,566 million euros in 2021, down 0.9% on a historical basis and 0.5% on a comparable basis with 2020. This result includes an expense of 172 million euros in 2021 related to the employee shareholding program Together 2021 (see Section 3.1.1.3\n\nSignificant Events). Excluding the effect of this program, EBITDAaL would have increased by 0.8% between the two periods, thanks to the strong performance of Africa & Middle East countries and Other European countries which make it possible to offset the decline in Spain, B2B services and France.\n\nOperating income totaled 2,521 million euros in 2021, compared with 5,521 million euros in 2020, on a historical basis, i.e., a drop of 2,999 million euros. This decrease can be mainly explained, firstly, by  the  goodwill  impairment  of  3,702  million  euros  in  Spain  and, secondly, by the recognition of an expense of 1,225 million euros in connection with the renewal of the French part-time for seniors plans  (Temps Partiel S\u00e9niors - TPS relating to the employment of older workers in France). These impacts are partially offset by the 2,279 million euro increase in income from the review of the fixed assets, investments and businesses portfolio, primarily on the basis of the recognition in 2021 of gains from the loss of exclusive control of Orange Concessions (FiberCo in France) and \u015awiat\u0142ow\u00f3d Inwestycje  (FiberCo  in  Poland).  See  all  of  these  elements  in Section 3.1.1.3 Significant Events.\n\nConsolidated  net  income  totaled  778  million  euros  in  2021, compared with 5,055 million euros in 2020, a drop of 4,278 million euros. This contraction can be mainly explained by the 2,999 million euro decrease in operating income on a historical basis and by the counter-effect of the recognition, in 2020, of current tax income of 2,246 million euros following the settlement of a tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006 (see Note 10.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nEconomic CAPEX stood at 7,660 million euros in 2021, up 7.4% on a historical basis and 7.8% on a comparable basis. This increase, in  line  with  the  announced  objective,  follows  the  year  2020  that was marked by substantial co-financing received from third-party operators for the FTTH network and by a slowdown in investments related to the Covid-19 health crisis. In the second half of 2021, economic CAPEX began to fall.\n\nOrganic cash flow from telecom activities stood at 2,401 million euros in 2021, compared with 2,494 million euros in 2020, in line with the announced target.\n\nNet  financial  debt amounted  to  24,269  million  euros  at December 31, 2021. This increase of 780 million euros compared with 2020, despite the disposal of 50% of Orange Concessions (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant Events), is particularly due to the use in 2021 of a portion of the funds received following resolution of the tax dispute in France in respect of fiscal years 2005-2006 (see",

revenue totaled 42,522 million euros, an increase of 0.6% on a historical basis and 0.8% on a comparable basis with 2020.\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 0.6% increase in Group revenue between 2020 and 2021, an increase of 252 million euros, includes:\n\n- -the  negative  impact  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations,  which amounted to 196 million euros, mainly as a result of movements in  the  US  dollar  (for  70  million  euros),  the  Polish  zloty  (for 68 million euros) and the Egyptian pound (for 25 million euros) against the euro;\n- -the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and  other  changes,  which  stand  at  126  million  euros  and primarily include the effect of the takeover of Telekom Romania Communications (TKR) on September 30, 2021 for 164 million euros (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events); and\n- -the organic change on a comparable basis, representing an increase in revenue of 322 million euros.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the increase of 322 million euros or 0.8% in the Group revenue between 2020 and 2021 is mainly attributable to:\n\n- -the 433 million euro increase (i.e. 4.2% growth) of Mobile only services relating to:\n- -the  sharp  increase  of  mobile  services  (prepaid  and contracts)  in  nearly  all  Africa  &  Middle  East  countries, mainly driven by the growth in data services, as well as by the increase in mobile only services in France,\n- -partially  offset  by  the  decline  of  mobile  only  services  in Spain in a context of polarization of offers and a general market movement toward low-cost offers;\n- -the 239 million euro improvement (i.e. up 8.5%) in Equipment sales,  after  the  9.5%  drop  in  2020  against  the  backdrop  of the Covid-19 health crisis (effect of the lockdowns). Between the  two  periods,  this  increase  is  mainly  driven  (i)  by  mobile equipment sales in France, in Europe (Spain, Poland, Belgium and Moldova) and for B2B services, and (ii) by fixed equipment and Internet sales (excluding network equipment) in Spain;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

In France, the downturn of wholesale services is mainly related to: (i) the counter-effect of the significant co-financing of FTTH lines received from other carriers in 2020, the downward trend of unbundling and national roaming, and the decline of interconnection (particularly mobile call termination due to the regulation), (ii) partially offset by the\n\nincrease in construction, marketing, operation and optical fiber network  maintenance  activities  (particularly  leased  lines  of third-party carrier); and\n\n- -the 257 million euro decrease (i.e. down 2.8%) in Fixed only services, primarily due to:\n- -the  structural  drop  in  fixed  only  narrowband  services (conventional telephony) in France, and to a lesser degree, in Poland and in Africa & Middle East countries, and\n- -the downturn in fixed only services for B2B services related to (i) the contraction of voice services (with the downward trend of conventional fixed telephony and the counter-effect of the significant use of audio-conference services in 2020 during the lockdown periods), and (ii) the decline in data services (due to the transformation of service technologies and,  additionally,  the  drop  in  satellite  TV  broadcasting services  (Globecast)  which  were  still  impacted  by  the Covid-19 health crisis),\n- -partially  offset  by  the  growth  in  fixed  only  broadband services in France and in Africa & Middle East countries (due to the progression of optical fiber offers), while these services are down in Spain due to the highly competitive environment.\n\nThe  analysis  of  the  change  in  revenue  by  business  segment  is detailed in Section 3.1.3 Review by business segment.\n\n## 3.1.2.1.2 Number of customers\n\n| Number of customers (at December 31, in thousands,

and\n- -the organic change on a comparable basis, representing a fall of 69 million euros in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the decrease of 0.5% or 69 million euros in Group EBITDAaL between 2020 and 2021 is mainly due to:\n\n- -the 7.9% increase, i.e. 539 million euros, in adjusted commercial expenses,  equipment  and  content  costs  (see  Section  7.2.1 Financial glossary), after the 6.0% fall observed in 2020 against the backdrop of the Covid-19 health crisis. This increase can be explained (i) mainly by the growth of equipment sales and the recovery of the entire commercial activity in France, in Europe and for B2B services, as well as (ii) by the increase in content costs in Spain (mainly costs of television services and soccer rights),  (iii)  by  the  increase  in  retail  fees  and  commissions  in Africa  &  Middle  East  countries  (Orange  Money  commercial momentum and activity), and (iv) by the increase in advertising, promotion and sponsoring expenses (notably the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games);\n- -2.0%  growth,  i.e.  171  million  euros,  of  adjusted  labor expenses  (see  Section  7.2.1  Financial  Glossary),  mainly due to the recognition in 2021, of the expense related to the Employee Offering, Together 2021, for 172 million euros (see Section  3.1.1.3  Significant Events). Between the two periods, the  average  number  of  employees  (full-time  equivalent,  see Section 7.2.1 Financial Glossary) is down 2.0% representing a decrease of 2,670 employees in full-time equivalent (mainly in France, in Spain and in Poland). Wages and employee benefit expenses are stable between the two periods: the decline in the average number of employees (full-time equivalent) of entities located in France is largely offset by the effect of labor policies in France and internationally;\n- -the progression of 7.5%, i.e., an increase of 103 million euros in depreciation and amortization of right-of-use assets, mainly in  France  (increase  in  leased  lines,  commissioning  of  new technical sites), as well as in the Other European countries and in Africa & Middle East countries;\n- -the 2.3% or 81 million euro increase in other network and IT expenses (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary), mainly in Spain, and in Africa & Middle East countries (in connection with the activity growth, development of data services and continued deployment of networks); and\n- -the increase of 52.1% or 29 million euros in depreciation and amortization  of  financed  assets  in  France  (set-top  boxes financed  by  an  intermediary  bank;  see  Note  8.5  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThese unfavorable changes are partially offset by:\n\n- -the 0.8% increase in revenue, i.e. 322 million euros;\n- -the  4.9%  or  224  million  euro  decrease  in  service  fees  and inter-operator  costs  (see  Section  7.2.1 Financial glossary),  in the majority of countries, resulting from the widespread decline of  interconnection costs in nearly all countries, reflecting the general decrease of fixed and mobile services to carriers and the regulatory decline of call termination rates in some countries, mainly in Europe and in Africa & Middle East countries;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This decrease is mainly due to lower impairment and losses on  trade  receivables  from  telecom  activities  (particularly  in France, Europe and for Enterprise services) due primarily to the re-assessment of the risk of non-recovery of trade receivables at December 31, 2021, mainly in connection with the effects of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis  (see  Note  4.3  and  5.2  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nIn  2020, an amount of 253 million euros was recognized for the main specific additional costs generated by management of the Covid-19 health crisis.\n\n## 3.1.2.2.2 Group operating income\n\n| (at December 31, in millions of euros)   | 2021   | 2020 on a comparable  basis   | 2020 on a historical  basis   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Operating income                         | 2,521  | 5,537                         | 5,521                         |\n| Telecom activities                       | 2,702  | 5,736                         | 5,715                         |\n| Mobile Financial Services                | (182)  | (200)                         | (195)                         |\n\nThis section presents the transition from EBITDAaL to Group operating income by type of expense, after presentation adjustments, as presented in Section 3.1.5.2 EBITDAaL and in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n| (at December 31, in millions of euros)                                         | 2021    | 2020 on a comparable  basis   | 2020 on a historical  basis   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| EBITDAaL                                                                       | 12,566  | 12,635                        | 12,680                        |\n| Significant litigations                                                        | (134)   | (211)                         | (211)                         |\n| Specific labor expenses                                                        | (1,276) | (12)                          | (12)                          |\n| Fixed assets, investments and businesses portfolio review                      | 2,507   | 228                           | 228                           |\n| Restructuring program costs                                                    | (422)   | (83)                          | (83)                          |\n| Acquisition and integration costs                                              | (51)    | (37)                          | (37)                          |\n| Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets                                  | (7,074) | (7,106)                       | (7,134)                       |\n| Reclassification of cumulative translation adjustment from liquidated entities | (0)     | -                             | -                             |\n| Impairment of goodwill                                                         | (3,702) | -                             | -                             |\n| Impairment of fixed assets                                                     | (17)    | 5                             | (30)                          |\n| Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures                     | 3       | (2)                           | (2)                           |\n| Elimination of interest on debts related to financed assets  (1)               | 1       | 1                             | 1                             |\n| Elimination of interest on lease liabilities  (1)                              | 120     | 119                           | 120                           |\n| Operating income                                                               | 2,521   | 5,537                         | 5,521                         |\n\nIn 2021, Orange group operating income amounted to 2,521 million euros (of which 2,702 million euros from telecom activities and a loss of 182 million euros from Mobile Financial Services activities), down 54.3% on a historical basis and 54.5% on a comparable basis with respect to 2020.\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 54.3% decrease, representing a fall of 2,999 million euros, in Group operating income between 2020 and 2021 reflects:\n\n- -the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and  other  changes  for  43  million  euros,  corresponding primarily  to  the  effect  of  the  takeover  in  Telekom  Romania\n\n- Communications (TKR) on September 30, 2021 for 40 million euros (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n- -the  negative  effect  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  which amounts  to  27  million  euros,  mainly  resulting  from  the performance of the US dollar against the euro;

This decrease is chiefly attributable to:\n\n- -the fall of 2,999 million euros in operating income on a historical basis;\n- -the  1,810  million  euro  increase  in  current  tax  payables  (see Note  10.2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements),  which primarily stems from:\n- -the change in the income tax expense of the Orange SA tax consolidation group. This can be mainly explained by the counter-effect of the recognition in 2020 of a current tax income of 2,246 million euros following the settlement of a tax dispute in France for fiscal years 2005-2006 (see Note  10.2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements), partially  offset  (i)  by  the  recognition  in  2021  of  a  current tax income of 376 million euros relating to the re-estimate of an income tax expense recognized prior to the reported periods, and (ii) by the fall in the results of entities in the Orange SA tax consolidation group, and\n- -to  a  lesser  degree,  (i)  the  125  million  euro  increase  in deferred tax expense in the UK under the Orange brand, and  (ii)  the  60  million  euro  increase  in  depreciation of deferred tax assets in Spain (see Note 10.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements);\n- -partially offset by the 532 million euro improvement in finance costs,  net  (see  Note  13.2  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements). This change primarily results from (i) the decrease in the cost of gross financial debt excluding financed assets, mainly due to the decrease in the volume of bonds and the change in the interest rate effect of derivatives covering debt denominated  in  Polish  zloty,  (ii)  the  improvement  of  foreign exchange  income,  mainly  linked  to  the  effect  of  derivative instruments (cross currency swaps) set up by the Group to cover its economic exposure on the subordinated notes issued i n pounds sterling, for which the revaluation in respect of foreign exchange risk is not recognized, and (iii) to a lesser degree, by the increase in other net financial expenses.\n\nNet  income  attributable  to  non-controlling  interests  amounted to 545 million euros in 2021, compared with 233 million euros in 2020 (see  Note  15.6  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements). After taking into account net income attributable to non-controlling interests,  the  net  income  attributable  to  owners  of  the  parent company  totaled  233  million  euros  in  2021,  compared  with 4,822 million euros in 2020, a drop of 4,589 million euros.\n\n## 3.1.2.4 Group comprehensive income\n\nThe Group's transition from consolidated net income to consolidated comprehensive income is described in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The ratio  of  economic  CAPEX  to  revenue  from  telecom  activities  is 18.0% in 2021, up 1.2 points on 2020 on a historical basis and on a comparable basis.\n\n## Change on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 7.4% or 528 million euro increase in the Group's economic CAPEX between 2020 and 2021 is due to (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations, which amounted to  26  million  euros,  mainly  as  a  result  of  movements  in  the  US dollar against the euro, (ii) the negative impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 3 million euros, and (iii)  the organic change on a comparable basis, i.e. an increase of 557 million euros in economic CAPEX.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis ,  the  557  million  euro  or  7.8%  increase in  the  Group's  economic  CAPEX  between  2020  and  2021  is attributable mainly to:\n\n- -the decrease in co-financing in France. The Group's investments benefit from co-financing received from third-party operators and subsidies (particularly in France, Spain and Poland) which are deducted from economic CAPEX;\n- -the  decrease  in  fixed  asset  disposals,  mostly  related  to  the counter-effect of the significant disposals made in 2020 (i) for shared services (in the context of the optimization of real estate assets), (ii)  in  France  (with  in  particular  the  disposal  of  FTTH connections to SFR in 2020, following the agreement reached between Orange and SFR in May 2018), (iii) in Spain (with the second phase of the disposal of mobile sites to Cellnex in 2020 for 75 million euros), and (iv) to a lesser degree, for B2B services (with  the  interruption  of  a  significant  project  for  a  business customer with the resale of the assets to the customer in 2020);\n\n- -the growth of investments in very high-speed mobile broadband networks (4G/5G), mainly in Spain, and to a lesser degree in France,  in  Other  European  countries  and  in  Africa  &  Middle East  countries.  At  the  same  time,  the  Group  maintains  its gross investments in very high-speed fixed networks (FTTH). At December 31, 2021, the Group had 56.5 million households connectable to FTTH worldwide (up 19.7% year-on-year), of which 28.8 million in France, 15.7 million in Spain, 5.9 million in Poland, 2.8 million in Romania and 2.4 million in Africa & Middle East countries (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events). The total number  of  households  connectable  to  all  very  high-speed networks (FTTH and cabled networks) totaled 57.5 million at December 31, 2021; and\n- -by the increase of economic CAPEX relating to leased terminals, to the Livebox and equipment installed on customer premises, mainly in France, in connection with the decrease in financed assets (also recognized in investments in property, plant and equipment and intangible assets);\n- -partially  offset  (i)  by  the  fall  in  capital  expenditure  on  legacy fixed and mobile networks in France, in line with the gradual migration of customers to very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband networks (optical fiber and 4G/5G), and (ii) by the decline  in  investments  linked  to  IT  and  to  customer  service platforms, mainly in France.\n\n## 3.1.2.5.1.2 Telecommunication  licenses\n\nIn  2021,  telecommunication  licenses  (see  Note  8.4  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements) amounted to 926 million euros and mainly concern (i) Spain for 618 million euros, principally with the acquisition of 5G licenses for 611 million euros (of which two blocks of 10 MHz frequencies in the 700 MHz frequency band), (ii) France for 264 million euros (corresponding to the renewal of 2G licenses for 207 million euros and 3G licenses for 57 million euros), and (iii) Belgium for 22 million euros.\n\ncapital expenditure, primarily related to the financed assets, and also to telecommunication licenses.\n\nThe  Group's  financial  investments  (see  Section  7.2.1  Financial glossary) are described in Section 3.1.4 Cash flow, financial debt and equity.",

        "page_content": "In 2020, telecommunication licenses amounted to 969 million euros on a historical basis and mainly concerned (i) the acquisition of 5G licenses in France for 875 million euros (for 90 MHz of spectrum in the 3.5 GHz frequency band) and in Slovakia for 37 million euros, and (ii) the renewal of the 3G licenses in the 2,100 MHz frequency band in Romania for 30 million euros.\n\nTelecommunication licenses may, in some cases, give rise to annual fees recognized as operating taxes and levies in the Consolidated income statement.\n\n## 3.1.2.5.2 Investment  commitments\n\nInvestment commitments are set out in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## 3.1.2.5.3 Investment  projects\n\nOrange maintains the targets of the Engage 2025 strategic plan, in a context still impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis. The Group continues to prioritize its investments and its non-strategic asset disposals  depending  on  the  expected  value  creation,  with  the ambition of reaching a ratio of economic CAPEX to revenue from telecom activities of around 15% by 2023. In line with the announced guidance, Orange expects its investments to fall from 2022.\n\nIn  addition,  Orange confirms its commitment aimed at reducing its carbon footprint with the ambition of reaching 50% renewable energy  in  2025,  particularly  through  the  signing  of  the  Power Purchase Agreement (PPA, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events) and will continue its commitment for digital inclusion.\n\nIn  its  core  business,  the  Group  continues  to  revolutionize  the operator  role,  confirming  its  leadership  while  further  upgrading its  infrastructure  based  on  new  fixed  and  mobile  network technologies  (FTTH  and  Standalone  5G  in  particular,  see Section  3.1.1.3  Significant events), by taking advantage of its data in partnership with major Cloud and AI players and by deploying more high-performance IT infrastructures (datacenter, information systems for the next-generation supply chain, etc.):\n\n- -In fixed networks,  whether  using  proprietary  infrastructure or third-party networks via co-financing or optimized leasing, Orange has raised its ambitions in terms of the marketing of its FTTH offers to more than 65 million households in Europe by 2023, thus confirming its European leadership in fiber. The growth will be bolstered by new services based on the home of the future by leveraging the gradual increase in household speeds.\n\nConcerning  its  FTTH  infrastructure,  Orange  will  continue  to invest  directly  to  meet  its  commitments  in  medium-density areas (AMII), for example in France. Conversely, to continue the industrial effort in certain areas while controlling its investments, Orange will rely on its FiberCo  companies  such  as  Orange Concessions, which brings together the FTTH connections of the public initiative networks (R\u00e9seaux d'Initiative Publique) in France (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\nThese  FTTH  deployments  make  it  possible  to  accelerate the  decommissioning  of  copper  in  France  that  could  end around 2030 (see Section 1.4.1 Operating activities - France). Furthermore, the current transition is accompanied by a plan to  replace  wooden  poles  with  composite  equipment  with  a smaller environmental footprint.\n\n- -On the mobile network, 5G looks set to disrupt the telecom industry. After several commercial launches in Europe (France, Spain,  Poland,  Romania,  Slovakia,  Luxembourg),  the  Group will continue its extension of the 5G coverage by making core network  replacements  for  optimal  5G  (Standalone  5G)  from 2023.  Orange  aims  to  offer  lower  latency  and  use  network slicing,  i.e.  prioritizing  certain  network  slices  to  cover  critical usage  or  specific  needs.  The  technical  performance  of  5G technology  will  enable  the  emergence  of  many  new  uses, both for the general public (immersive videos, Cloud gaming) and for businesses, for which 5G will be a catalyst of digital transformation  (optimization  of  production  times,  remote control of machines, predictive maintenance, etc.). To optimize deployments of its mobile infrastructures, in terms of rhythm, coverage  and  financial  capacities,  Orange  will  continue  to develop network sharing agreements (such as those already in  place  in  Spain  and  in  Belgium).  Through  its  TowerCo TOTEM (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), Orange aims to achieve value creation thanks to improved operating efficiency, optimization  of  investments  and  an  increase  in  occupancy rate. In this context, there are plans to develop TOTEM on the European market beyond France and Spain.\n- -In the Enterprise segment , Orange intends to take advantage of the major shift in telecommunications represented by SDWAN  (Software-Defined  Wide  Area  Network)  technology. Orange  is  thus  positioning  itself  as  a  trusted  partner  that supports  companies  seeking  to  optimize  their  connectivity costs, make their networks more reliable, extract value from their  data,  and  ensure  a  performance  in  line  with  the  data speed required by services and applications. This commitment is  supported  by  equipment  financing  programs  to  minimize customer investments in equipment.\n\nTo  ensure  the  deployment  and  maintenance  of international connectivity ,  Orange  will  also  continue  to  invest  in  submarine cable projects in regions where Orange has a strong presence (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events).\n\n- In Africa & Middle East ,  a  high growth region, Orange plans to accelerate the deployment of mobile and fixed services in urban and  rural  areas.  Multiservice  activities,  and  especially  financial services, are also central to the 2025 growth strategy for Africa & Middle East countries.\n- In Mobile Financial Services , Orange Bank plans to extend its scope (through Orange Bank Africa in particular) and to diversify its product portfolio (loans, insurance, specific digital banking offers) while optimizing its IT infrastructure.\n\nSee also Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Between the two periods, 12-month fixed only broadband ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) fell by 1.3%.\n\nThis decrease is partially offset by:\n\n- -the  138  million  euro  increase  of  Convergent  services  which continue their  growth,  in  connection  with  the  1.1%  increase of the convergent customer base year-on-year. This growth in volume is also accompanied by growth in value. The 12-month convergent ARPO (see Section 7.2.1 Financial glossary) grew by 1.1% between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, thanks to the effects of all commercial operations conducted. Between the two periods, the growth of convergent ARPO is mitigated by the fall in income from out of bundle usage, due to the decrease in content offer consumption with respect to the consumption observed during the successive lockdowns of  2020  and  due  to  the  less  extensive  catalog  of  content. Furthermore, the number of mobile telephones in households continues  to  grow,  with  10.0  million  convergent  mobile customers at December 31, 2021 (up 1.6% year-on-year), i.e. 1.69 mobile accesses per convergent customer;\n- -the 62 million euro growth in Other revenue, driven by the effect of the growth of other contents and notifications (particularly push SMS), the increase in revenue from the removal of copper cables, the development in the rollout of build-to-suit mobile sites  (enabling  Orange to accelerate the rollout of its mobile network and increase its coverage in less densely populated areas and along transport routes, while limiting investments);\n- -the  40  million  euro  increase  in  the  revenue  of  Mobile  only services, driven (i)  by  the  1.9%  increase  in  12-month mobile only  ARPO  (see  Section  7.2.1  Financial glossary)  between December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, and (ii) by the 0.9% increase in the mobile only access base; and\n- -the 39 million euro increase in Equipment sales, linked to the turnaround of commercial activity after the decline recorded in 2020 due to the Covid-19 health crisis.",

and\n- -to a lesser degree, the growth of investments in (4G/5G) very high-speed mobile broadband networks;\n- -partially  offset  by  (i)  the  fall  in  capital  expenditure  on  legacy networks in line with the gradual migration of customers to very high-speed fixed and mobile broadband networks (FTTH and 4G/5G), and (ii) by the decline of investments linked to IT and to customer service platforms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

competitive environment.\n\nThe total mobile access base is up 1.2% year-on-year, with 21.8 million customers at December 31, 2021. Contract offers grew 2.2% year-on-year, reflecting both (i) the growth in premium offers, driven  by  Open  convergent  offers  (which  reached  10.0  million customers  at  December  31,  2021),  (ii)  the  increase  in  Sosh brand offers, and to a lesser degree (iii) the increase in offers for SMEs.  The  Sosh  offers  had  a  total  of  4.5  million  customers  at December 31, 2021, up 6.4% year-on-year. The prepaid customer bases are structurally in decline, down 8.6%. In addition, there are 17.0 million 4G customers at December 31, 2021, an increase of 3.9% year-on-year.\n\nThe total  fixed  broadband  access  base increased by 2.5% year-on-year to reach 12.3 million customers at December 31, 2021. This  growth is  mainly  driven  by  (i)  the  dynamism  of  optical  fiber offers, with a total of 5.9 million customers at December 31, 2021, up 31.7% year-on-year, and (ii) to a lesser degree, the continued growth of convergent offers, which grew by 1.1%, with 5.9 million customers at December 31, 2021. Moreover, 7.9 million customers had subscribed to IPTV and satellite TV offers at December 31, 2021,  an  increase  of  3.9%  year-on-year.  Fixed  access  sold  to other  carriers  (wholesale)  are  down  3.7%  year-on-year,  due  to the  structural  decline  of  the  activity  and  migration  from  copper accesses (down 18.5% year-on-year) to very high-speed broadband accesses (up 37.9% year-on-year).\n\n## 3.1.3.2 Europe\n\n| Europe (at December 31, in millions of euros)   | 2021    | 2020 on a comparable  basis   | 2020 on a historical  basis   | Change  (%) on a comparable  basis   | Change  (%) on a historical  basis   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Revenue                                         | 10,579  | 10,665                        | 10,580                        | (0.8)%                               | (0.0)%                               |\n| EBITDAaL                                        | 2,830   | 2,914                         | 2,932                         | (2.9)%                               | (3.5)%                               |\n| EBITDAaL/Revenue                                | 26.7%   | 27.3%                         | 27.7%                         | (0.6 pt)                             | (1.0 pt)                             |\n| Operating income                                | (2,933) | 828                           | 796                           | na                                   | na                                   |\n| eCAPEX                                          | 1,893   | 1,860                         | 1,847                         | 1.8%                                 | 2.5%                                 |\n| eCAPEX/Revenue                                  | 17.9%   | 17.4%                         | 17.5%                         | 0.5 pt                               | 0.4 pt                               |\n| Telecommunication licenses  (1)                 | 650     | 73                            | 73                            | ns                                   | ns                                   |\n| Average number of employees                     | 26,345  | 27,720                        | 26,807                        | (5.0)%                               | (1.7)%                               |",

stability  of  revenue  for  countries  in Europe between 2020 and 2021 can be explained by:\n\n- -the favorable impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 164 million euros, relating to the effect of the takeover of Telekom Romania Communications (TKR) on September 30, 2021 (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n- -offset (i) by the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for  79  million  euros  (mainly  due  to  movements  in  the  Polish zloty  against  the  euro),  and  (ii)  by  the  organic  change  on  a comparable basis representing a 86 million euro contraction in revenue.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the 86 million euro or 0.8% decrease in revenue from countries in Europe between 2020 and 2021 is mainly attributable to:\n\n- -the  277  million  euro  decrease  in  retail  services  (B2C+B2B) in  Spain,  and  additionally  the  57  million  euro  decrease  in wholesale services, in all countries except Romania;\n- -partially offset (i) by growth of 116 million euros of equipment sales in all countries, (ii) by growth of 109 million euros of retail services (B2C+B2B) in Other European countries, and (iii) to a lesser degree, by the 41 million euro increase in integration & IT services in Poland.\n\nBetween the  two  periods,  the  86  million  euro  fall  in  revenue  of countries  in  Europe  is  due  to  the  230  million  euro  decrease  in revenue from Spain.\n\nIn detail, the 86 million euro decrease in revenue from countries in Europe between the two periods mainly stems from:\n\n- -the  decrease  of  135  million  euros  in  revenue  from  Mobile only  services,  mainly  in  Spain  (132  million  euros,  see Section 3.1.3.2.6 Additional information - Spain), and to a lesser degree, in Slovakia and Belgium. In Spain, this decrease can be mainly explained by the 4.6% contraction in 12-month mobile only  ARPO.  The  base  of  mobile  only  accesses  is  up  2.7% year-on-year, driven by the robust performances recorded in Poland, Belgium and Luxembourg;\n- -the  84  million  euro  decrease  in  Fixed  only  services, mainly due  (i)  to  the  decrease  in  fixed  only  broadband  services  in Spain (in  connection with the 10.3% drop in 12-month fixed only broadband ARPO) and in Romania, and (ii) the decline of conventional telephony in Poland; and\n- -the  57  million  euro  decrease  in  revenue  from  Wholesale services,  mainly  in  Poland.  In  Europe,  the  downturn  in international wholesale services in Spain and Poland (reduction in international transit activity) is partially offset by the growth in visitor roaming and increase in incoming traffic.\n\nThis decrease is partially offset by:\n\n- -the 116 million euro increase in revenue from Equipment sales in all countries, due to the recovery of commercial activity in 2021 with the opening of stores, contrary to 2020 which was marked by restrictions related to the Covid-19 health crisis; and\n- -to a lesser degree, the 48 million euro increase in the revenue of IT & Integration services, mainly in Poland.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021, revenue for Convergent services is stable (slightly up by 2 million euros): the deterioration of 114 million euros (down 5.8%) of convergent services in Spain, due to the competitive environment (see Section 3.1.3.2.6 Additional information - Spain), was offset by the 116 million euro growth (up 15.9%) of convergent services in Other European countries. The convergent customer base rose 3.2% year-on-year, up in all countries, and amounted to 5.6 million customers at December 31, 2021.\n\n## 3.1.3.2.2 EBITDAaL - Europe\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 102 million euro decrease in EBITDAaL from countries in Europe between 2020 and 2021 stems from (i) the negative  effect  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations,  amounting  to 21 million euros, partially offset by the positive impact of changes in  the  scope  of  consolidation  and  other  changes,  amounting  to 3  million  euros,  and  (iii)  organic  change  on  a  comparable  basis representing a 85 million euro fall in EBITDAaL.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

are resilient against the backdrop of the Covid-19 health crisis and a highly competitive environment, which is particularly evident in Spain.\n\nOn a comparable basis, the total mobile access base is up 3.1% year-on-year, with 53.5 million customers at December 31, 2021. Prepaid offers continued to decline, accentuated by the Covid-19 health crisis while the contract offers grew in nearly all countries, with a year-on-year increase of 5.2%.\n\nOn a comparable basis, the total fixed access base is down 1.2% year-on-year, with 12.8 million customers at December 31, 2021. The fixed broadband access base on the other hand, recorded a 1.5% year-on-year increase (with 8.9 million accesses at December 31, 2021), driven by the growth in very high-speed broadband, up 9.6% year-on-year (with 5.7 million accesses at December 31, 2021).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The  mobile  access  base  for  contract  customers (excluding  M2M)  is  impacted  by  competitive  pressure  and customer migration to low cost offers, while the mobile access base for prepaid offer customers continues to suffer from the Covid-19 health crisis and its effects on tourism;\n- -the  114  million  euro  decrease  in  revenue  for  Convergent services, which can be explained by the persistently aggressive competitive environment leading to a 6.4% drop in 12-month convergent  ARPO,  which  is  partially  offset  by  the  0.6% year-on-year rise in the convergent customer base; and\n- -to a lesser degree, (i) by the 36 million euro drop in revenue for Fixed only services, also impacted by a competitive environment leading both to a 10.3% contraction of the 12-month fixed only broadband  ARPO  and  to  a  1.8%  decline  in  the  broadband fixed only accesses year-on-year, and (ii) by the contraction of 16 million euros in Wholesale services, related to the decline of international wholesale services;\n- -partially offset by the 74 million euro growth in Equipment sales, related to the turnaround of the commercial activity in 2021 and the counter-effect of the Covid-19 health crisis in 2020 (with in particular the closing of stores).\n\n## EBITDAaL - Spain\n\nBoth  on  a historical basis and on a comparable basis ,  the 182 million euro decline in EBITDAaL in Spain between 2020 and 2021 is mainly due to:\n\n- -(i) the 230 million euro decrease in revenue, (ii) the increase in content costs, mainly due to the increase in costs of television services  and  soccer  rights,  (iii)  the  growth  in  the  costs  of terminals  and  other  products  sold,  in  connection  with  the growth of equipment sales and the business upturn in 2021, and (iv) the increase in the operating expenses and network maintenance;\n- -partially  offset  (i)  by  the  reduction  in  service  fees  and inter-operator costs, owing to the decrease in network access connectivity  costs  due  to  customer  migration  to  proprietary fiber  networks  and  also  the  activity  downturn  (less  transit activity), and (ii) by the fall in other external purchases, related in particular to the cost structure optimization efforts.\n\n## Operating income - Spain\n\nBoth  on  a historical basis and on a comparable basis ,  the 4,131 million euro decline in operating income in Spain between 2020 and 2021 is mainly due to:\n\n- -the goodwill impairment in 2021 of 3,702 million euros in Spain (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) for which t h e business plan has been significantly revised downward since December 31, 2020, in view of (i) a deteriorating competitive environment despite market consolidation operations (affected by the erosion of average revenue per user) and (ii) uncertainties surrounding the continuation of the Covid-19 health crisis (delay in the forecasts for economic recovery); and\n- -secondarily,  (i)  the  182  million  euro  decrease  in  EBITDAaL and (ii)  the  recognition  in  2021  of  an  expense  of  180  million euros in respect of the restructuring program costs (employee departure plans and closure of points of sale, see Note 5.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).",

The activity is driven by the robust performances (i) of the Sonatel sub-group, mainly driven by Guinea, Mali and Sierra Leone, (ii) the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire sub-group,  driven  mainly  by  Burkina  Faso  and  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire, (iii) Egypt, and (iv) to a lesser degree, Cameroon.\n\nIn detail, the 611 million euro growth in revenue of Africa & Middle East countries between the two periods mainly stems from:\n\n- -the 533 million euro increase in Mobile only services, mainly related  to  (i)  the  upturn  in  data  services,  which  reported 25.4% growth year-on-year (driven in particular by the vibrant 4G  customer  base  which  grew  by  34.4%  year-on-year  and reached  44.4  million  customers  in  December  31,  2021), and  (ii)  secondarily,  the  4.4%  growth  of  Orange  Money year-on-year,  supported  by  the  14.6%  growth  of  the  active customer base year-on-year (with 25.1 million active customers at December 31, 2021). Furthermore, the mobile access base continued to grow and reported 5.5% growth year-on-year, with mobile access bases increasing in nearly all countries; and\n- -by  the  98  million  euro  increase  in  the  revenue  of  Fixed only services between the two periods, driven by the development of  broadband  services,  up  28.9%  year-on-year,  with  a  fixed only broadband access base up 20.0% year-on-year, totaling 2.1 million customers at December 31, 2021;\n- -partially offset by the contraction of 32 million euros in revenue from Wholesale services, particularly due to the decrease in revenue on hubbing and incoming international traffic volumes.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.2 EBITDAaL - Africa & Middle East\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 301 million euro increase in EBITDAaL of Africa & Middle East countries between 2020 and 2021 includes (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 21 million euros, (ii) the adverse effect of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 4 million euros, and (iii) the organic change on a comparable basis, representing a 327 million euro increase in EBITDAaL.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the 327 million euro increase in EBITDAaL in  Africa  &  Middle  East  countries  between  2020  and  2021  is primarily explained by:\n\n- -(i) revenue growth of 611 million euros, and to a lesser extent, (ii)  the  fall  in  interconnection  costs  due  to  the  decline  in domestic call  termination  and  the  slowdown  in  international transit activity;\n- -partially offset (i) by the increase in operating taxes and levies, mainly due to the business upturn, (ii) by the increase in other operating expenses (net of other operating income), which can be explained by the recognition of provisions for risks in 2021 and the counter-effect of various settlements of trade payables in 2020, (iii) by the growth of distribution fees, in line with the upturn in commercial activity, in particular Orange Money, and (iv) by the increase in other network and IT expenses, with the development of data services and the continued deployment of the network in all countries.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.3 Operating income - Africa & Middle East\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 264 million euro increase in the operating income of Africa & Middle East countries between 2020 and 2021 includes (i) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 12 million euros, (ii) the adverse impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 4 million euros, and (iii) organic change on a comparable basis, representing a 279 million euro increase in operating income.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis ,  the  279  million  euro  increase  in  the operating income of Africa & Middle East countries between 2020 and 2021 can be mainly explained by the increase of 327 million euros of EBITDAaL, partially offset by the recognition, in 2021, of a  41  million  euro  expense  in  respect  of  restructuring  costs  and programs.\n\n## 3.1.3.3.4 Economic CAPEX - Africa & Middle East\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis ,  the  28  million  euro  increase  in  economic CAPEX in Africa & Middle East countries between 2020 and 2021 includes (i) the negative impact of foreign exchange fluctuations for 11 million  euros,  (ii)  the  organic  change  on  a  comparable  basis, representing an increase of 39 million euros in economic CAPEX.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the 39 million euro increase in economic CAPEX in Africa & Middle East countries between 2020 and 2021 is  mainly  due  to  the  increase  in  investments  in  very  high-speed mobile  broadband  networks  (4G)  to  support  changes  in  usage. The  4G  customer  base  reached  44.4  million  customers  at  the end of December 2021, up 34.4% year-on-year. In addition, Africa & Middle East countries had 2.4 million households connectable to very high-speed broadband at December 31, 2021, up 50.8% year-on-year.",

This change can be explained by the transformation of service technologies and the contraction of satellite broadcasting services (Globecast) which are still impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis.\n\n## 3.1.3.4.2 EBITDAaL - Enterprise\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 53 million euro decrease in Enterprise EBITDAaL between 2020 and 2021 includes (i) the positive effect of  changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 47  million  euros,  (ii)  the  negative  impact  of  foreign  exchange fluctuations  for  12  million  euros,  and  (iii)  organic  change  on  a comparable basis, representing a decrease of 88 million euros in EBITDAaL.\n\n## Change on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the 88 million euro decrease in Enterprise EBITDAaL between 2020 and 2021 can essentially be attributed to:\n\n- -(i) the increase in commercial expenses and equipment costs, in connection with the growth of mobile equipment sales and (ii)  the  rise  in  labor  expenses mainly due to the development of IT & Integration services and the recognition, in 2021, of the expense relating to the Together 2021 Employee Offering (see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events);\n- -partially offset (i) by the drop in other network expenses and IT expenses, (ii) by the 40 million euro increase in revenue, (iii) by the decline in service fees and inter-operator costs, and (iv) to a lesser degree, by the drop in other operating expenses (net of other operating income).\n\n## 3.1.3.4.3 Operating income - Enterprise\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 147 million euro decrease in Enterprise operating income between 2020 and 2021 includes (i) the positive impact of changes in the scope of consolidation and other changes for 47 million euros, and (ii) the negative effect of foreign exchange fluctuations for 14 million euros, and (iii) the organic change on a comparable basis, representing a decrease of 180 million euros in operating income.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the 180 million euro decrease in Enterprise operating income between 2020 and 2021 can be mainly explained (i)  by  the  recognition  in  2021,  of  a  specific  labor  expense  of 123 million euros, mainly under the renewal of the French part-time for seniors plans (plans relating to agreements for the employment of older workers in France, see Section 3.1.1.3 Significant events), (ii) by the contraction of 88 million euros in EBITDAaL, (iii) partially offset by the 33 million euro drop in depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, due to the slowdown of investments.\n\n## 3.1.3.4.4 Economic CAPEX - Enterprise\n\nChange on a historical basis\n\nOn a historical basis , the 20 million euro decrease in Enterprise economic  CAPEX  between  2020  and  2021  can  be  attributed to  (i)  the  negative  impact  of  foreign  exchange  fluctuations  for 3 million euros, and (ii) the organic change on a comparable basis, representing a 17 million euro decrease in economic CAPEX.\n\nChange on a comparable basis\n\nOn a comparable basis , the 17 million euro decrease in Enterprise economic  CAPEX  between  2020  and  2021  can  essentially  be attributed to minor projects in the construction phase.",

This program led to these receivables being derecognized from the balance sheet of Orange Spain (within telecom activities) and presented as customer loans and receivables within Mobile Financial  Services  activities  (see  Notes  4.3  and  17.1.1  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nLoans  and  receivables  of  Orange  Bank  are  comprised  of  loans and receivables to customers and credit institutions. Outstanding loans and receivables to customers at December 31, 2021 came to 2.3 billion euros, an increase of 297 million euros from December 31, 2020 due to the development of the business in France and Spain. Loans to B2C customers made up 96.3% of that total. 54.4% were consumer  loans  (see  Note  17.1.1  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements).\n\nDebts  related  to  Orange  Bank  transactions  are  composed  of customer  deposits  and  bank  debts  with  financial  institutions. Outstanding  payables  to  customers  (deposits  and  savings)  at December 31, 2021 amounted to 1.8 billion euros, down 87 million euros from December 31, 2020 (see Note 17.1.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nFor  more  information  on  the  risks  related  to  Mobile  Financial Services activities, see Section 2.1.3 Financial risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies regularly review the ratings they award. Any change in the rating could have an effect on the cost of future financing or access to liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  a  change  in  Orange's  credit  rating  will,  for  some outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors via Step-up clauses (a clause that triggers an increase in the coupon interest rate in the event of a downgrading of Orange's long-term credit  rating  by  the  rating  agencies,  according  to  contractually defined rules - this clause may also stipulate a downward revision of the coupon interest rate in the event of an improvement in the rating, as long as the interest rate does not drop below the initial interest  rate  on  the  loan  -  see  Note  14.3  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nOrange's credit rating at December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n\n| Orange's credit rating   | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| (at December 31, 2021)   |                     |           |                 |\n| Long-term debt           | BBB+                | Baa1      | BBB+            |\n| Outlook                  | Stable              | Stable    | Stable          |\n| Short-term debt          | A2                  | P2        | F2              |\n\nFor  further  information  on  risks  related  to  the  financial  markets and a history of the Company's credit ratings, see Section 2.1.3 Financial risks.\n\n## 3.1.4.3 Equity\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the French State held 22.95% of the capital of Orange SA and 29.41% of the voting rights, directly or in concert with  Bpifrance  Participations  (see  Note  15  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nThe payment of dividends by Orange took place as follows (see Note 15.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements):\n\n- -in 2021, payment of (i) the balance of the 0.50 euros dividend per share in respect of fiscal year 2020 (including the payment of an exceptional shareholder dividend of an additional 0.20 euros per share in relation to the use of part of the funds received from the settlement of the tax dispute in France concerning fiscal  years  2005-2006,  see  Note  10.2  to  the  Consolidated Financial Statements), and (ii) the interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share for fiscal year 2021;\n- -in 2020, payment of (i) the balance of the dividend of 0.20 euros per share in respect of the 2019 fiscal year, and (ii) the interim dividend of 0.40 euros per share in respect of the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nAdditionally,  Orange  has  not  exercised  its  right  to  defer  the coupon payment related to the deeply subordinated notes since their  issuance  and  accordingly  paid  the  noteholders  238  million euros in 2021 and 258 million euros in 2020 (see Note 15.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\nGiven  (i)  the  issue  by  Orange  of  the  equivalent  of  500  million euros in subordinated notes on May 11, 2021 as part of its EMTN program, and (ii) the partial redemption of existing subordinated notes by a contractual offer for part of the subordinated notes in several  tranches,  the  Group's  outstanding  subordinated  notes at  December  31,  2021  amounted  to  5,497  million  euros,  down 306  million  euros  (see  Note  15.4  to  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements).\n\nCapital management is described in Note 14.7 to the Consolidated Financial  Statements.

As  described  below,  these  figures  are  presented  as  additional information and are not meant to be substitutes for or to be confused with financial indicators as defined by IFRS.\n\n## 3.1.5.1 Data on a comparable basis\n\nIn  order  to  allow  investors  to  track  the  annual  changes  in  the Group's operations, data on a comparable basis are presented for the previous period. The transition from data on a historical basis to  data  on  a  comparable  basis  consists  of  keeping  the  results for the fiscal year ended and restating the previous fiscal year in order to present financial data with comparable methods, scope of  consolidation  and  exchange  rates  over  comparable  periods. Orange provides the details of the effect of changes in method, scope of consolidation and exchange rates on its key operating\n\nindicators  in  order  to  isolate  the  intrinsic  business  effect.  The method used applies the data of the corresponding period of the preceding fiscal year, the methods and the scope of consolidation for the period ended, as well as the average exchange rates used for the Consolidated income statement in the Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended.\n\nOrange's  management  believes  that  the  presentation  of  these indicators  on  a  comparable  basis  is  relevant  because  these  are indicators used internally by the Group for monitoring its operating activities.  Changes on a comparable basis better reflect organic business changes.\n\nData on a comparable basis are not financial indicators defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for an analysis of the Group's historical data for the past fiscal year or previous periods.\n\n## 3.1.5.1.1 2020 fiscal year - Group\n\nThe following table presents, for the Orange group, the transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis for the key operating data for fiscal year 2020.\n\n| 2020 fiscal year/Group (at December 31, 2020, in millions of euros)   | Revenue   | EBITDAaL   | Operating  income   | eCAPEX   | Average  number of  employees   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------|---------------------|----------|---------------------------------|\n| Data on a historical basis                                            | 42,270    | 12,680     | 5,521               | 7,132    | 133,787                         |\n| Foreign exchange fluctuations  (1)                                    | (196)     | (51)       | (27)                | (26)     | -                               |\n| US dollar (USD)                                                       | (70)      | (24)       | (24)                | (6)      | -                               |\n| Polish zloty (PLN)                                                    | (68)      | (17)       | (2)                 | (11)     | -                               |\n| Egyptian pound (EGP)                                                  | (25)      | (9)        | (4)                 | (4)      | -                               |\n| Jordanian dinar (JOD)                                                 | (14)      | (5)        | (2)                 | (2)      | -                               |\n| Guinean franc (GNF)                                                   | (13)      | (7)        | (4)                 | (2)      | -                               |\n| Other                                                                 | (6)       | 11         | 9                   | (1)      | -                               |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                                 |           |            |                     |          |                                 |\n| and other changes                                                     | 126       | 6          | 43                  | (3)      | 885                             |\n| Acquisition/Takeover of Telekom                                       |           |            |                     |          |                                 |\n| Romania Communications (TKR)                                          | 164       | 7          | 40                  | 26       | 913                             |\n| Disposal/Loss of control of Orange Concessions                        | -         | 4          | 14                  | (29)     | (12)                            |\n| Other                                                                 | (38)      | (5)        | (11)                | (0)      | (16)                            |\n| Data on a comparable basis                                            | 42,201    | 12,635     | 5,537               | 7,103    | 134,672                         |\n\nChanges included in the transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis for the 2020 fiscal year include:\n\n- -foreign exchange fluctuations between the average exchange rates for the 2020 fiscal year and the average exchange rates for the 2021 fiscal year; and\n- -changes  in  the  scope  of  consolidation  (see  Section  3.1.1.3 Significant events and Note 3.2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and other changes, mainly include:\n\n- -the  takeover  of  Telekom  Romania  Communications (Europe), through the acquisition of 54% of the capital, on September 30, 2021, effective as of October 1, 2020 on a comparable basis,\n- -the loss of control of Orange Concessions (France), through the disposal of 50% of the capital, on November 3, 2021, effective as of November 1, 2020 on a comparable basis.",

It consists of (i) financial liabilities excluding operating payables (translated into euros at the year-end closing rate) including derivative instruments (assets and liabilities), (ii) less cash collateral paid, cash, cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value. Furthermore, financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges included in net financial debt are set up to hedge in particular items that are not included therein, such as future cash flows. As a result, the portion relating to these unmatured hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income is added to gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference.\n\nfinancial expenses, income taxes and changes in working capital requirements.

In addition, when changes  in  the  scope  of  consolidation  significantly  affect  the Group's net financial debt at the end of the period, the calculation of the ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities is adjusted to take into account the EBITDAaL from those entities over the previous 12 months.\n\n| (at December 31, in millions of euros)                             | 2021   | 2020 on a historical  basis   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|\n| Net financial debt (a)                                             | 24,269 | 23,489                        |\n| EBITDAaL from telecom activities (b)                               | 12,696 | 12,839                        |\n| Ratio of net financial debt/EBITDAaL from telecom activities (a/b) | 1.91   | 1.83                          |\n\nThe ratio of net financial debt to EBITDAaL from telecom activities is used by Orange to measure the Group's ability to repay its debt, and more broadly to measure its financial strength.

The combination would take the form of a 50-50 Joint Venture, co-controlled by Orange and Masmovil (Lorca JVCO) with a combined enterprise valuation of 19.6 billion euros. Valuations are attractive for both businesses, with Orange Spain's enterprise value  at  8.1  billion  euros  (7.5x  2022E  EBITDAaL  and  38.7x 2022E EBITDAaL - eCAPEX) and Masmovil's enterprise value at 11.5 billion euros, which includes the acquisition of Euskaltel (9.9x 2022E EBITDAaL and 17.8x 2022E EBITDAaL - eCAPEX). Totem Spain  and  Masmovil  Portugal  are  not  part  of  the  contemplated transaction.\n\nOrange  and  Lorca  JVCO  would  benefit  from  equal  governance rights in the combined entity. Accordingly, neither Orange nor Lorca JVCO will consolidate the combined operations.\n\nThe agreement between the parties includes (i) a right to trigger an IPO under certain conditions for both parties and (ii) an option for Orange to take control and thus consolidate the combined entity in the event of an IPO. Orange would neither be forced to exit nor to exercise this option.\n\nThe  Joint  Venture  would  bring  together  the  assets,  capabilities and  teams  of  the  two  companies  in  Spain,  building  on  highly complementary business models as well as an existing successful collaboration, to serve 4.0+3.1 million fixed customers (of which 3.0+2.6 convergent), 11.5+8.7 contract mobile customers and close to 1.5 million TV customers.\n\nThe  Joint  Venture  would  have  its  own  network  infrastructure providing it with a competitive edge in the market including:\n\n- -a  state-of-the-art,  nationwide  FTTH  network  reaching  over 16 million homes;\n- -a  leading-edge  mobile  network  with  extensive  national coverage, serving large volumes of traffic in the Spanish market.\n\nThe combined entity would become a stronger market player with revenues of over 7.5 billion euros, EBITDAaL over 2.2 billion euros and would gain the necessary scale and efficiency to:\n\n- -undertake an ambitious and sustainable expansion of its FTTH and 5G networks; and\n- -contribute  to  Spain  maintaining  and  further  developing  a competitive telecom infrastructure.\n\nWith a comprehensive and complementary portfolio of brands, the Joint Venture would provide Spanish consumers and businesses with  competitive  and  differentiated  offers  to  serve  the  needs  of all  market segments, with high quality connectivity, an excellent customer experience and a comprehensive portfolio of innovative services in the challenging digital landscape.\n\nThis Joint Venture is expected to generate synergies which should reach an annual run rate in excess of 450 million euros from the third year post closing onwards.\n\nThe transaction is expected to be signed by the second quarter of 2022 and should close by the second quarter of 2023, subject notably to approval from the relevant administrative, competition and regulatory authorities.\n\n## Consequences of the conflict in Ukraine\n\nIn  light  of  the  situation  in  Ukraine,  the  Orange  Group  has  taken steps to guarantee the safety of its teams in Ukraine and Russia, as a priority, and to ensure service continuity for its customers as well as the security of its infrastructure. The Group has also stepped up its cybersecurity surveillance and joined the collective effort to support those who have been affected by the conflict.\n\nTo  this  end,  Orange  has  set  up  a  crisis  unit  that  is  primarily responsible for monitoring how events are unfolding on a daily basis and how they might affect the Group, and for coordinating all the measures taken by its various entities.\n\nThe Orange Group is present in Russia and Ukraine mainly through its Orange Business Services (OBS) subsidiary (see Section 1.4.4 Enterprise).  OBS  has  around  800  employees  in  Russia  and generated just over 100 million euros of revenue there in 2021. The total value of assets located in Russia is approximately 50 million euros. In light of the situation, the Group has decided to continue its business for existing customers in Russia and Belarus but to avoid entering into any new commercial relationships there. Additionally, Orange has fallen into line with Council Regulation (EU) 2022/350 of 1 March 2022, which means its Globecast subsidiary no longer broadcasts the channels RT and Sputnik. OBS has five employees in Ukraine. The revenue it generates there is not significant.\n\nOrange operates on the B2C market in four countries that border Ukraine: Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Moldova (see Section 1.4.2 Europe). The Group is monitoring the situation in these countries very closely.\n\nMore  information  about  the  risks  to  which  the  Group  and  its stakeholders are exposed can be found in Section 2.1 Risk factors, in particular the following:\n\n- -a high concentration of Orange's critical suppliers and global supply tensions for a large number of products represent a risk for the Group's activities;\n- -Orange is exposed to the risk of an interruption of its services, especially in case of cyberattacks;\n- -Orange's  broad  geographic  footprint  and  the  scope  of  its activities expose it to geopolitical, macroeconomic, fiscal and regulatory risks;\n- -Orange's  technical  infrastructure  is  vulnerable  to  damage caused by intentional or accidental damage, but also by natural disasters, the occurrence of which is increased due to climate change;\n- -Orange  faces a variety of internal and external risks relating to human health and safety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The Europe aggregate thus presents all the business segments in this region;\n- -the Sonatel subgroup (grouping together Sonatel in Senegal, Orange Mali, Orange Bissau, Orange in Guinea and Orange in Sierra Leone), the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire subgroup (including the Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire entities, Orange in Burkina Faso and Orange in Liberia) and each of the other countries in Africa and Middle East. The Africa and Middle East aggregate thus presents all the business segments in this region;\n- -Enterprise, which brings together dedicated communication solutions and services for businesses in France and around the world (including the Cyberdefense activity);\n- -the activities of International Carriers & Shared Services (IC&SS), which contain certain resources, mainly in the areas of networks, information systems, research and development and other shared Group activities, as well as the Orange brand;\n- -Mobile Financial Services, which includes the Orange Bank entity.\n\nThe use of shared resources, mainly provided by IC&SS, is taken into account in segment results based either on the terms of contractual agreements between legal entities, external benchmarks or by reallocating costs among the segments. The supply of shared resources is included in other revenues of the service provider, and the use of these resources is included in expenses of the service user. The cost of shared resources may be affected by changes in contractual relationships or organization and may therefore impact the segment results disclosed from one fiscal year to another.\n\n## Operating performance indicators\n\nEBITDAaL and eCAPEX are the key operating performance indicators used by the Group to:\n\n- -manage and assess its operating and segment results; and\n- -implement its investment and resource allocation strategy.\n\nThe Group's management believes that the presentation of these indicators is relevant as it provides readers with the same management indicators as those used internally.\n\nEBITDAaL relates to operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, effects resulting from business combinations, reclassification of translation adjustment from liquidated entities, impairment of goodwill and fixed assets, share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures, and after interests on debts related to financed assets and on lease liabilities, adjusted for:\n\n- -significant litigation impacts;\n- -specific labor expenses;\n- -fixed assets, investments and business portfolio review;\n- -restructuring program costs;\n- -acquisition and integration costs;\n- -where appropriate, other specific items.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n3 -\n\nThis measurement indicator allows for the effects of certain specific factors to be isolated, irrespective of their recurrence and the type of income and expense, when they are linked to:\n\n- -significant  litigation:  significant  litigation  expenses  relate  to  risk  reassessments  regarding  various  litigations.  Associated procedures are based on third-party decisions (regulatory authority, court, etc.) and occur over a different period to the activities at the source of the litigation. Costs are by nature difficult to predict in terms of their source, amount and period;\n- -specific labor expenses: independent of any departure plans included in the costs of restructuring programs, certain employee working time adjustment programs have a negative impact on the period in which they are signed and implemented. Specific labor expenses also relate to changes in assumptions and experience effects for the various part-time for seniors plans in France;\n- -fixed assets, investments and business portfolio review: the Group conducts an ongoing review of its portfolio of fixed assets, investments and businesses. In this context, exit or disposal decisions are implemented and, by their nature, have an impact on the period in which they take place;\n- -restructuring program costs: the adaptation of the Group's activities to changes in the environment may generate costs related to the shutdown or major transformation of an activity. These costs, linked to the cessation or major transformation of an activity, mainly consist of employee departure plans, contract terminations and costs in respect of contracts that have become onerous;\n- -acquisition and integration costs: the Group incurs costs directly related to the acquisition of entities and their integration in the months following their acquisition. These are primarily legal and advisory fees, registration fees and earn-outs;\n- -where appropriate, other specific items that are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses.\n\nEBITDAaL is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income or cash flow provided by operating activities.\n\neCAPEX relates to acquisitions of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets excluding telecommunication licenses and financed assets, minus the disposal price of fixed assets. It is used internally as an indicator to allocate resources. eCAPEX is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other companies.\n\nThe Group uses organic cash flow from telecom activities as an operating performance measure for telecom activities as a whole. Organic cash flow from telecom activities relates to net cash provided by telecom activities minus (i) repayment of lease liabilities and debts related to financed assets, (ii) purchases and disposals of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, net of the change in fixed asset payables, (iii) excluding the effect of telecommunication licenses paid and principal litigations paid and received. Organic cash flow is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups.\n\n## Assets and liabilities\n\nInter-segment assets and liabilities are reported in each business segment.\n\nNon-allocated assets and liabilities for telecom activities mainly include external financial debt, external cash and cash equivalents, current and deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as equity. Financial debt and investments between these segments are presented as non-allocated elements.\n\nFor Mobile Financial Services, the line 'other' includes the assets and liabilities listed above as well as loans and receivables and payables related to Mobile Financial Services transactions.\n\nThe other accounting policies are presented within each note to which they refer.\n\n## 1.10 Change in segment information expected in 2022\n\nIn  February  2021,  Orange  announced the creation of TOTEM, a European TowerCo that will operate a tower portfolio consisting of approximately 26,000 sites in France and Spain at December 31, 2021. The TowerCo entered the operational phase at the end of\n\n2021 and will require  changes to  the  internal  reporting  followed by the Group and the presentation of segment information as of January 1, 2022.\n\n## Note 2 Description of business and basis of preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 2.1 Description of business\n\nOrange  provides  B2C  customers,  businesses  and  other telecommunication operators with a wide range of services including fixed telephony and mobile telecommunications, data transmission and other value-added services, including mobile financial services. In  addition  to  its  role  as  a  supplier  of  connectivity,  the  Group provides business services, primarily solutions in the fields of digital work, security and improving business line processes.\n\nTelecommunication operator activities are regulated and dependent upon the granting of licenses, just as Mobile Financial Services activities have their own regulations.",

For plans reviewed by the IFRS IC, the cap may be reached at a date prior to retirement.\n\nIn  France, the interpretation of IAS 19 had led to the practice of measuring  and  recognizing  the  commitment  on  a  straight-line basis over the employee's career with the Group. The commitment calculated in this way corresponds to the pro rata rights acquired by the employee at the time of retirement.\n\nThe decision of the IFRS IC, published on May 24, 2021, concludes, in this case, that no rights are acquired in the event of departure before retirement age and that the rights are capped after a certain number of years of seniority ('X'), and the commitment would only be recognized for the last X years of the employee's career within the company.\n\nThis decision was implemented by the Group at December 31, 2021 for plans falling within the scope of the Interpretation Committee's decision.  The  effect  of  this  implementation  mainly  limited  to retirement benefit plans in France.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

For  debt instruments affected by the IBOR reform, it will not be necessary to  apply  the  provisions  of  IFRS  9  to  determine  whether  the modification of the instrument is substantial. These amendments propose that modifications to financial instruments related to the reform be treated prospectively as an update to the interest rate with no impact on profit or loss. With regard to hedge accounting, the amendments introduce an exemption allowing hedge accounting to be maintained despite the change in future cash flows impacted by the change in rates due to the reform.\n\nDiscussions with the counterparties to negotiate the replacement of the indices with the new ones have been finalized. At December 31, 2021, the Group's exposure to financial instruments indexed to variable rates that are due to expire and maturing after the reform's implementation date is now nil.\n\n## 2.3.3 IFRS IC decision on implementation costs of a Cloud Computing agreement - IAS 38\n\nThe  IFRS  IC  has  specified  the  cases  in  which  configuration and  adaptation  costs  for  software  acquired  as  part  of  SaaS ('software as a service') may be capitalized as intangible assets. In  accordance with this decision, only services that result in the creation of an additional code controlled by the customer could be capitalized. Other services would be recognized as expenses for the period or as prepaid expenses. The method used to expense the implementation costs of the Group's SaaS contracts complies with the accounting provisions set out by the IFRS IC in its decision.",

This  amendment  is  not  expected  to  have  a  significant impact on the Group's statement of financial position. However, the implementation of this amendment could lead to the reclassification of certain liabilities from current to non-current, and vice versa. The date of entry into force of this amendment is January 1, 2024.\n\n## 2.4.2 Amendment to IAS 16: Proceeds before intended use\n\nThe amendment clarifies that an entity is not permitted to recognize any revenue from the sale of items produced as a deduction from the cost of the fixed asset while preparing the asset for its intended use. The proceeds from selling such items are recognized in profit or  loss.  This  amendment  should  have  no  effect  on  the  Group's financial statements. The amendment is applicable from January 1, 2022.\n\n## 2.4.3 Amendment to IAS 37: Onerous contracts - cost of fulfilling a contract\n\nThe  clarifications  provided  by  the  amendment  concern  the incremental costs of fulfilling an onerous contract to be taken into\n\naccount  in  the  provision,  namely  the  costs  of  direct  labor  and materials and the allocation of other costs directly related to the contract, for example the depreciation expense relating to a fixed asset  used  in  fulfilling  the  contract.  The  potential  provisions  of this amendment are currently being analyzed. The amendment is applicable from January 1, 2022.\n\n## 2.4.4 Amendment to IAS 12: Taxes - Deferred taxes related to an asset or liability acquired through a single transaction\n\nThe  amendment  introduces  a  new  exception  to  the  exemption from  the  initial  recognition  of  deferred  taxes.  As  a  result  of  this amendment,  an  entity  does  not  apply  the  initial  recognition exemption for transactions that give rise to deductible temporary differences.\n\nUnder applicable tax law, equal taxable and deductible temporary differences may arise on initial recognition of an asset and a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. For example, this may occur when the lease liability and the corresponding right of use are recognized under IFRS 16 at the inception of a lease. The Group's accounting policies are already aligned with the proposals of the amendment. The provisions  of  this  amendment  will  apply  as  of January 1, 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

foreign exchange risks (see Note 14).\n\n## 2.5.3 Consideration of climate change risks\n\nNatural disasters as well as other accidental events related to climate change, such as fires, could lead to significant destruction of the Orange Group's facilities, resulting in both service interruptions and high repair costs. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change (e.g., floods, storms, heat waves) continue to increase, which could aggravate disasters and increase related damage. In the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and facilities located near the coast more often. While coverage of claims by insurers could decrease further, the damage caused by major disasters could result in significant costs to Orange, some of which could be at the expense of the Orange Group and thus affect its financial situation and prospects.\n\nThe  Group  is  therefore  integrating  climate  change  risks  more systematically into its activities. This can be seen in the assessment\n\nof  these  risks  on  the  value  of  some  of  its  assets  through  their depreciation  schedule  or  as  an  event  that  could  lead  to  the identification of an indication of impairment loss or on the eventual possibility  of  obtaining  financing.  Consideration  of  climate  risks is also reflected in the Group's commitment to be carbon neutral by 2040. This commitment changes certain choices in terms of investments related to its activity.\n\nNumerous projects have been initiated within the Group in order to understand the impacts of climate change on its operations. The implementation of actions to limit the effects of the Group's activities on climate change is also underway. The outcome of these projects could  lead  the  Group  to  review  certain  accounting  treatments, judgments or estimates. At December 31, 2021, the Group has not identified any significant impact on its financial statements at the stage of completion of the projects in progress.",

In  accordance  with standard practice in this type of transaction, the amount received by Orange is subject to price adjustments in the months following the transaction.\n\nThe transaction also includes a call option for the acquisition of an additional 1%, exercisable by Orange during the second quarter of  the  years  2025  to  2027.

The transaction values VOO SA at an enterprise value of 1.8 billion euros for 100% of the capital.\n\nAt the end of the transaction, Nethys will retain a minority stake in  VOO  and  governance  rights  to  ensure  the  completion  of  the industrial  and  social  project.  The  transaction  also  includes  the option for Nethys to convert its stake in VOO into Orange Belgium shares.\n\n## Changes in the scope of consolidation during 2020\n\n## Squeeze-out offer on Business & Decision shares\n\nOn May 28, 2020, Orange Business Services launched a mandatory public buyout offer for all the shares of Business & Decision not yet held by the Group, representing 6.38% of the capital.\n\nThis  offer  closed  on  July  8  and  was  followed  by  the  effective delisting of Business & Decision shares on July 13, 2020.\n\nFollowing  this  public  buyout  offer  and  the  acquisition  of  the remaining shares of capital over the second half of the year for an amount of (4) million euros, Orange now holds 100% of the shares of Business & Decision.\n\n## Changes in the scope of consolidation during 2019\n\n## Acquisitions of SecureLink and SecureData\n\nOn January 31, 2019, Orange acquired a 100% equity interest in SecureData, a provider of cyber security solutions in the United Kingdom for 100 million euros.\n\nOn  July  8,  2019,  the  Group  acquired  100%  of  SecureLink,  an independent  cyber  security  operator  in  Europe,  for  377  million euros.\n\n| At acquisition date                                       | SecureLink   | SecureData   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (in millions of euros)                                    |              |              |\n| Acquisition cost                                          | 377          | 100          |\n| Cash acquired net of transaction costs                    | (6)          | (5)          |\n| Cash paid for investment securities, net of cash acquired | 371          | 95           |\n\nGoodwill was recognized in the amount of 392 million euros as a result of the acquisition of Securelink and 97 million euros as a result of the acquisition of SecureData, after allocation of the purchase price to identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n\n| At acquisition date                    | SecureLink   | SecureData   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| (in millions of euros)                 |              |              |\n| Acquisition cost (a)                   | 377          | 100          |\n| Net book value acquired                | (153)        | (32)         |\n| Effects of fair value measurement:     |              |              |\n| Customer relationship  (1)             | 181          | 43           |\n| Trademark                              | -            | -            |\n| Other intangibles                      | -            | -            |\n| Net deferred tax                       | (43)         | (8)          |\n| Net asset remeasured at fair value (b) | (15)         | 3            |\n| Goodwill (a)-(b)                       | 392          | 97           |\n\nFair values were measured using the excess earnings method for the customer base.

At December 31, 2019,\n\nOrange owned 93.6% of the capital of Business & Decision. This change in the percentage share held by Orange with no gain, or loss, of control, was shown in the financing flows in the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Sale of Orange Niger\n\nOn November 22, 2019, Orange sold its 95.5% holding in Orange Niger to Zamani Com S.A.S, a company that is wholly owned by Orange  Niger  minority  shareholders.

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\n## Changes in the scope of consolidation\n\nEntities are fully consolidated if the Group has the following:\n\n- -power over the investee; and\n- -exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and\n- -the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns.\n\nWhen assessing control, IFRS 10 requires judgment and continuous assessment.\n\nClarifications of when the ownership interest does not imply a de facto presumption are provided in Note 20 which lists the main consolidated entities.\n\nJoint ventures and companies over which the Group exercises significant influence (generally corresponding to an ownership interest of 20% to 50%) are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nWhen assessing the level of control or significant influence exercised over a subsidiary or associate, the existence and effect of any exercisable or convertible potential voting rights at the closing date is taken into account.\n\n## Takeovers (business combinations)\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method:\n\n- -the acquisition cost is measured at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including all contingent consideration, at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration are accounted for either through profit or loss or through other comprehensive income, in accordance with the applicable standards;\n- -goodwill is the difference between the consideration transferred and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, and is recognized as an asset in the statement of financial position. Considering the Group's activity,  the  fair  values  of  the  identifiable  assets  relate  mainly  to  licenses,  customer  bases  and  brands  (which  cannot  be capitalized when developed in-house), generating induced deferred taxes. The fair value of these assets, which cannot be observed, is established using commonly adopted methods, such as those based on revenues or costs (e.g.: the 'Greenfield' method for the valuation of licenses, the 'relief from royalty' method for the valuation of brands and the 'excess earnings' method for customer bases).\n\nFor each business combination with an ownership interest below 100%, non-controlling interest is measured:\n\n- -either at its fair value: in which case, goodwill is recognized for the portion relating to non-controlling interests;\n- -or proportionate to its share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets: in which case, goodwill is only recognized for the share acquired.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are directly recognized in operating income in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nWhen a business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the acquisition date through operating income. The related other comprehensive income, if any, is fully reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Loss of exclusive control resulting from the partial disposal of consolidated shares\n\nA loss of exclusive control by the Group over one of its subsidiaries results in the recognition of a capital gain or loss on the disposal, and in the revaluation at fair value of the residual share retained in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 10 applicable in the event of a loss of control.\n\n## Internal transfer of consolidated shares\n\nIFRS do not address the accounting treatment for the transfer of consolidated shares within the Group resulting in changes in ownership interest. The Group applies the following accounting policy:\n\n- -the transferred shares are carried at historical cost and the gain or loss on the transfer is fully eliminated in the acquirer's accounts;\n- -the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their share in the equity against Group retained earnings, with no impact on profit and loss and equity.\n\n## Assets held for sale\n\nThe Group qualifies an asset or group of assets as 'held for sale' when:\n\n- -the management is committed to a plan to sell;\n- -the asset is available for immediate sale in its current state (subject to any conditions precedent that are usual in such disposals); and\n- -the sale is highly probable, within 12 months.\n\nThus, when the Group is committed to a plan to sell involving the loss of control or significant influence over one of its assets, it classifies all assets and liabilities of the entities concerned under a separate line in the statement of financial position: 'Assets/ Liabilities held for sale', at a value equal to the lower of the net carrying value and the fair value net of disposal costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The  breakdown  of revenue by type is as follows:\n\n- -Convergence  services: these include revenue from convergence services for the B2C market (combined Internet + Mobile products);\n- -Mobile only services: mobile only services revenue is generated by incoming and outgoing calls (voice, SMS and data), mainly outgoing, excluding convergent services (details below);\n- -Fixed only services: revenue from fixed only services includes retail  sales  of  broadband  and  narrowband  fixed  services, excluding convergent services (see below) and fixed network business solution services, including voice and data services;\n- -IT  &  integration  services:  these  services  include  unified communication and collaboration services (LAN and telephony, consultancy,  integration,  project  management),  hosting  and infrastructure services (including Cloud Computing), application services (customer relations management and other application\n\nservices), security services, video conferencing offers, as well as  sales  of  equipment  related  to  the  above  products  and services;\n\n- -Services to carriers (wholesale): wholesale revenue includes roaming revenue from customers of other networks (national and  international),  revenue  from  Mobile  Virtual  Network Operators (MVNO) and from network sharing, among others;\n- -Equipment  sales:  Equipment  sales  include  all  sales  of equipment  (mobile terminals, broadband  equipment, connected objects and accessories) with the exception of sales of equipment related to integration and information technology services (presented in the 'IT & integration services' line), sales of network equipment related to the operation of voice and data services in the Enterprise segment (presented in the 'Fixed only services' line) and sales of equipment to external distributors or brokers (presented in the 'Other revenues' line);\n- -Other revenues: these revenues include, in particular, equipment sales  to  external  distributors  and  brokers,  revenues  from portals,  online  advertising  and  the  Group's  cross-functional activities and other miscellaneous revenues.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nMost revenue falls within the application scope of IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers.' Orange's products and services are offered to customers under service-only contracts and contracts combining the equipment used to access services and/or other service offers. Revenue is recognized net of VAT and other taxes collected on behalf of governments.\n\n- -Standalone service offers (mobile only services, fixed only services, convergent services)\n\nOrange offers its B2C and B2B customers a range of fixed and mobile telephony services, fixed and mobile Internet access offers and content offers (TV, video, media, added-value audio service, etc.). Some contracts are for a fixed term (generally 12 or 24 months), while others may be terminated at short notice (i.e. monthly arrangements or portions of services).\n\nService revenue is recognized when the service is provided, based on use (e.g. minutes of traffic or bytes of data processed) or the period (e.g. monthly service costs).\n\nUnder some content offers, Orange may act solely as an agent enabling the supply by a third-party of goods or services to the customer and not as a principal in the supply of the content. In such cases, revenue is recognized net of amounts transferred to the third-party.\n\nContracts with customers generally do not include a material right, as the price invoiced for contracts and the services purchased and consumed by the customer beyond the specific scope (e.g. additional consumption, options, etc.) generally reflect their standalone selling prices. There is no significant impact from contract modification for this type of service contract. Service obligations transferred to the customer at the same pace are treated as a single obligation.\n\nWhen contracts include contractual clauses relating to commercial discounts (initial discount on signing the contract or conditional on reaching a consumption threshold) or items provided free of charge (for example: a free three-month subscription), the Group spreads these discounts or free items over the term of the contract (the period during which the Group and the customer have firm commitments). Where applicable, the consideration payable to the customer is recognized as a deduction from revenue in accordance with the specific terms and conditions of each contract.\n\nIf  the  performance obligations are not classified as distinct, the offer revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. One of the main applications of this method is the initial service connection in the context of a service contract and communication. It is not generally separable from the service contract and communication offer and is therefore recognized in income over the average term of the expected contractual relationship.",

        "page_content": "## -Separate equipment sales\n\nOrange offers its B2C and B2B customers several ways to buy their equipment (primarily mobile phones): equipment sales may be separate from or bundled with a service offer. When separate from a service offer, the amount invoiced is recognized in revenue on delivery and receivable immediately or in installments over a period of up to 24 months. Where payment is received in installments, the offer comprises a financial component and gives rise to the calculation of interest deducted from the amount invoiced and recognized over the payment period in net finance costs.\n\nWhere Orange purchases and sells equipment to indirect channels, the Group generally considers that Orange maintains control until resale to the end-customer (the distributor acts as an agent), even where ownership is transferred to the distributor. Sale proceeds are therefore recognized when the end-customer takes possession of the equipment (on activation).\n\n## -Bundled equipment and service offers\n\nOrange proposes numerous offers to its B2C and B2B customers comprising equipment (e.g. a mobile handset) and services (e.g. a communication contract).\n\nEquipment revenue is recognized separately from service revenue if the two components are distinct (i.e. if the customer can receive one or other of the services separately). Where one of the components in the offer is not at its separate selling price, revenue is allocated to each component in proportion to their individual selling prices. This is notably the case in offers combining the sale of a mobile phone at a reduced price, where the individual selling price of the mobile phone is considered equal to its purchase cost and logistics expenses plus a commercial margin based on market practice. The amount allocated to equipment sales is recognized under revenue on delivery in exchange for a contract asset, spread over the term of the service contract.\n\nThe provision of a Livebox \u00ae (proprietary Internet box) is neither a separate component of the Internet access service offer nor a lease, as Orange maintains control of the box.\n\n## -Services including a build and run phase\n\nFor business clients, some contracts have two phases: build and then management (operation and maintenance) of assets built and delivered to customers. Revenue recognition requires an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each contract in order to determine whether distinct performance obligations exist. Under these contracts, if the construction phase is classified as separate, the Group recognizes the revenue of this phase according to the percentage of completion. However, if the Group does not have a certain right to payment and/or if there is no continuous transfer of control of the asset under construction, then revenue for this phase is recognized upon completion. These contracts are generally multi-year, with scalable offers. On each contract modification, we assess the scope of the modification or its impact on the contract price in order to determine whether the modification should be treated as a distinct contract, as though the existing contract were terminated and a new contract signed, or whether the modification should be considered as a change to the existing contract.\n\n## -Service offers to carriers (wholesale)\n\nThree types of commercial agreements are entered into with Carrier customers for domestic wholesale activities and International carrier offers:\n\n- -pay-as-you-go model: contract generally applied to 'legacy' regulated activities (bitstream call termination, local loop access, roaming and certain data solution contracts), where contract services are not covered by a firm volume commitment. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided (which relates to transfer of control) over the contractual term;\n- -send-or-pay model: contract where the price, volume and term are defined. The customer has a commitment to pay the amount indicated in the contract irrespective of actual traffic consumed over the commitment period. This contract category notably includes certain MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator), IDD (International Direct Dialing) or hubbing (call free floating) contracts. Related revenue is recognized progressively based on actual traffic during the period, to reflect transfer of control to the customer;\n- -mix model: hybrid contract combining the 'pay-as-you-go' and 'send-or-pay' models, comprising a fixed entry fee paid by the customer providing access to preferential pricing conditions for a given volume ('send-or-pay' component). In addition to this entry fee, an amount is invoiced based on traffic consumption ('pay-as-you-go' component). The amount invoiced for the entry fee included in this type of commercial agreement is recognized progressively in revenue based on actual traffic over the period.\n\nCurrent agreements between major transit carriers are not billed or cross-billed (free peering) and are therefore not recognized in revenue.\n\n## -Service level commitment clause\n\nThe contracts entered into by the Group and its customers include service level commitments regarding the processing of orders, delivery and after sales support (delivery time, performance, service reinstatement time). If the Group fails to comply with one of these commitments, it then pays compensation to the customer, which is usually a tariff reduction. The projected amount of these penalties is recognized as a deduction from revenue whenever it is expected that the commitment will not be fulfilled.\n\n## -Public-private service concession arrangements\n\nThe Group rolls out and/or operates certain networks under service concessions, such as the public initiative networks implemented in France to roll out fiber-optic networks in less populated areas. Some contracts are analyzed in accordance with IFRIC 12 'Service concession arrangements.' When the Group builds a network, construction revenue is recognized as counterparty to a right to receive a consideration from either a public entity or users of the public service. This right is accounted for as:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This receivable is recognized at amortized cost.\n\n## -Leases\n\nOrange's lease income is related either to its regulatory obligations to lease technical sites to its competitors, to the supply of equipment in certain contracts with business clients, or to the granting of rights of use meeting the criteria for leasing network equipment, i.e. occasional leases of surplus space in certain buildings to third parties.\n\nLease revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, except for certain equipment leases to business clients, which are classified as finance leases; in such cases the equipment is considered sold on credit.\n\n## 4.2 Other operating income\n\n| (in millions of euros)             |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net banking income (NBI)           |    119 |     79 |     55 |\n| Income from client collection      |     89 |    101 |    110 |\n| Site rentals and franchises income |     87 |     54 |     50 |\n| Tax credits and subsidies          |     44 |     31 |     33 |\n| Income from universal service      |      4 |      4 |      5 |\n| Other income                       |    441 |    336 |    466 |\n| Total                              |    783 |    604 |    720 |\n\nNet  banking  income  (NBI)  represents  the  net  balance  between income  from  banking  operations  (fees  charged  to  customers, interest from loans, banking activities retail commissions and other income  from  banking  operations)  and  expenses  from  banking operations  (interest  paid  on  loans,  commissions  paid  and  other expenses from banking operations). It is prepared in accordance with accounting practices that are commonly used in France in the banking sector.\n\nIncome from customer collections mainly includes interest charged to customers for late payments and recovery of trade receivables previously recognized as loss.\n\nOther income is predominantly comprised of rebilling of network sharing costs, income received from litigation and income relating to line damages.\n\n## 4.3 Trade receivables\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                       | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Net book value of trade receivables - in the opening balance | 5,620  | 5,320  | 5,295  |\n| Business related variations                                  | (53)   | 379    | 1      |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation  (1)                   | 389    | 4      | 50     |\n| Translation adjustment                                       | 36     | (90)   | 28     |\n| Reclassifications and other items                            | 36     | 7      | (53)   |\n| Net book value of trade receivables - in the closing balance | 6,029  | 5,620  | 5,320  |\n\n## Sales of receivables program\n\nOrange  has  set  up  non-recourse  programs  for  the  sales  of  its receivables due in installments in several countries. These are no longer recorded on the balance sheet. The receivables sold mainly concern Spain, France and Poland and amounted to approximately 740 million euros in 2021, 640 million euros in 2020 and 690 million euros in 2019.\n\nSince  2020,  Orange  Spain  has  had  in  place  a  non-recourse program  with  Orange  Bank  for  the  disposal  of  receivables  due in  installments,  replacing  an  existing  program  with  a  third-party bank. This program led to these receivables being derecognized from the balance sheet of Orange Spain (within telecom activities) and presented as customer loans and receivables within Mobile Financial Services activities (see Note 17.1.1).",

Such measures have helped to partially reduce the risk of non-recovery of trade receivables at December 31, 2021, but further\n\nreduce visibility on the evolution of the economic environment (in particular on the risk of business failures).\n\nThere is no change compared to December 31, 2020 in Orange's belief that the concentration of counterparty risk related to customer accounts is limited  due  to  the  large  number  of  customers,  their diversity (residential, professional and large companies) and their various sectors of the economy, as well as their wide geographic distribution in France and abroad.\n\nFor Mobile Financial Services, the effects of the health crisis on bank credit risk are described in Note 17.2.1.\n\nThe table below provides an analysis of the change in impairment for trade receivables in the statement of financial position:\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                   | 2021    | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|\n| Allowances on trade receivables - in the opening balance | (983)   | (888)  | (816)  |\n| Net addition with impact on income statement  (1)        | (212)   | (383)  | (332)  |\n| Losses on trade receivables                              | 283     | 275    | 271    |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation  (2)               | (91)    | 0      | (1)    |\n| Translation adjustment                                   | (7)     | 13     | (5)    |\n| Reclassifications and other items                        | (1)     | 0      | (5)    |\n| Allowances on trade receivables - in the closing balance | (1,012) | (983)  | (888)  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Those trade receivables which include deferred payment terms over 12 or 24 months for the benefit of customers buying a mobile telephone are discounted and classified as current items in the statement of financial position. Receivables from financial leases on equipment leased to companies are recognized as current operating receivables because they are acquired in the normal course of business.\n\nIn order to meet the requirements of IFRS 9, the impairment of trade receivables is based on three methods:\n\n- -a collective statistical method: this is based on historical losses and leads to a separate impairment rate for each ageing balance category. This analysis is performed over a homogeneous group of receivables with similar credit characteristics because they belong to a customer category (B2C, professionals);\n- -a stand-alone method: the assessment of impairment probability and its amount are based on a set of relevant qualitative factors (ageing of late payment, other balances with the counterpart, rating from independent agencies, geographical area). This method is mainly used for carrier customers (national and international), administrations and public authorities, as well as for large business service accounts;\n- -a provisioning method based on anticipated loss: IFRS 9 requires recognition of expected losses on receivables immediately upon recognition of the financial instruments. In addition to the pre-existing provisioning system, the Group applies a simplified approach of anticipated impairment at the time the asset is recognized. The rate applied depends on the maximum revenue non-recoverability rate.\n\nIdentification  of  impairment  losses  for  a  group  of  receivables  represents  the  step  preceding  identification  of  impairment  for individual receivables. As soon as information is available (clients in bankruptcy or subject to equivalent judicial proceedings), these receivables are then excluded from the statistical impairment database and individually impaired.\n\nThe trade receivables may be part of non-recourse programs. When they are sold to consolidated securitization mutual funds, they remain on the statement of financial position. Other disposals to financial institutions may lead to their de-recognition in the event that legal ownership and almost all the risks and benefits of the receivables are transferred as described by IFRS 9.\n\n## 4.4 Customer contract net assets and liabilities\n\n| (in millions of euros)                               | December 31,  2021   | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Customer contract net assets  (1)                    | 740                  | 709                  | 771                  |\n| Costs of obtaining a contract                        | 294                  | 262                  | 258                  |\n| Costs to fulfill a contract                          | 426                  | 265                  | 181                  |\n| Total customer contract net assets                   | 1,460                | 1,236                | 1,209                |\n| Prepaid telephone cards                              | (186)                | (197)                | (212)                |\n| Connection fees                                      | (563)                | (589)                | (665)                |\n| Loyalty programs                                     | (29)                 | (25)                 | (38)                 |\n| Other deferred revenue  (2)                          | (1,717)              | (1,158)              | (1,163)              |\n| Other customer contract liabilities                  | (17)                 | (15)                 | (15)                 |\n| Total deferred revenue related to customer contracts | (2,512)              | (1,984)              | (2,093)              |\n| Total customer contract net assets and liabilities   | (1,052)              | (748)                | (884)                |\n\nThe following tables give an analysis of the balances of customer contract net assets and the costs of acquiring and fulfilling them in the financial statements.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Customer contract net assets - in the opening balance | 709    | 771    | 784    |\n| Business related variations  (1)                      | 30     | (60)   | (13)   |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation                 | 4      | -      | -      |\n| Translation adjustment                                | 0      | (3)    | 1      |\n| Reclassifications and other items                     | (3)    | (0)    | 0      |\n| Customer contract net assets - in the closing balance | 740    | 709    | 771    |",

In 2019, the changes mainly concerned maintenance services paid in advance as part of the acquisition of SecureLink.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Customer contract net assets and liabilities\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from customer invoicing.\n\nTrade  receivables  presented  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  financial  position  represent  an  unconditional  right  to  receive consideration (primarily cash), i.e. the services and goods promised to the customer have been transferred.\n\nIn contrast, contract assets mainly refer to amounts allocated under IFRS 15 as compensation for goods or services provided to customers, but for which the right to collect payment is subject to providing other services or goods under that same contract (or group of contracts). This is the case in a bundled offer combining the sale of a mobile phone and mobile communication services for a fixed period, where the mobile phone is invoiced at a reduced price leading to the reallocation of a portion of amounts invoiced for telephone communication services to the supply of the mobile phone. The excess of the amount allocated to the mobile phone over the price invoiced is recognized as a contract asset and transferred to trade receivables as the service is invoiced.\n\nContract assets, like trade receivables, are subject to impairment for credit risk. The recoverability of contract assets is also verified, especially to cover the risk of impairment should the contract be interrupted. Recoverability may also be impacted by a change in the legal environment governing offers.\n\nContract liabilities represent amounts paid by customers to Orange before receiving the goods and/or services promised in the contract. This is typically the case for advances received from customers or amounts invoiced and paid for goods or services not yet transferred, such as contracts payable in advance or prepaid contracts (previously recognized in deferred income).\n\nCustomer contract assets and liabilities are presented, respectively, in current assets and current liabilities since they are a normal part of the Group's operations.\n\n## Cost of obtaining a contract\n\nWhere a telecommunication service contract is signed via a third-party distributor, this distributor may receive business provider remuneration, generally paid in the form of a commission for each contract or invoice-indexed commission. Where the Group considers the commission incremental and believes that it would not have been paid in the absence of the customer contract, the commission cost is estimated and capitalized in the balance sheet. It should be noted that the Group has adopted the simplification measure authorized by IFRS 15 to recognize the costs of obtaining contracts as an expense at the time they are incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the Group would have recognized in respect of them, does not exceed one year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The costs of obtaining fixed services contracts for a pre-determined term for B2C market customers are expensed prorata temporis over the estimated period of the customer relationship. The costs of obtaining B2B and operator solution contracts are not material.\n\n## Costs to fulfill a contract\n\nContract fulfillment costs consist of all the initial contractual costs necessary to fulfill one or more performance obligations of a contract. These costs, when they are directly related to a contract, are capitalized and recognized prorata temporis over the enforceable period of the contract.\n\nAt Group level, these costs mainly concern contracts for business clients, with, for example, design, installation, connection and migration fees that relate to a future performance obligation of the contract.\n\nThe assumptions underlying the period over which the costs of fulfilling a contract are expensed are periodically reviewed and adjusted in line with observations; termination of the contractual relationship with the customer results in the immediate expensing of the remaining deferred costs. Where the book value of deferred costs exceeds the remaining consideration expected to be received for the transfer of the related goods and services, less expected costs relating directly to the transfer of these goods and services yet to be incurred, the excess amount is similarly immediately expensed.\n\nThe  following  table  presents  the  transaction  price  assigned  to unfulfilled performance obligations at December 31, 2021. Unfulfilled performance obligations are the services that the Group is obliged to  provide  to  customers  during  the  remaining  fixed  term  of  the\n\ncontract.

We have elected to apply certain available practical expedients when disclosing unfulfilled performance obligations, including the option to exclude expected revenues from unsatisfied obligations of contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. These contracts are primarily monthly service contracts.\n\nIn addition, certain contracts offer customers the ability to purchase additional services. These additional services are not included in the transaction price and are recognized when the customer exercises the option (generally on a monthly basis). They are not therefore included in unfulfilled performance obligations.\n\nSome multi-year service contracts with B2B and operator customers include fixed monthly costs and variable user fees. These variable user fees are excluded from the table of unfulfilled performance obligations.\n\n## 4.5 Other assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)                            | December 31,  2021   | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Advances and downpayments                         | 147                  | 116                  | 101                  |\n| Submarine cable consortiums  (1)                  | 194                  | 258                  | 168                  |\n| Security deposits paid                            | 105                  | 93                   | 93                   |\n| Orange Money - isolation of electronic money  (1) | 1,030                | 825                  | 613                  |\n| Other  (2)                                        | 654                  | 545                  | 408                  |\n| Total                                             | 2,130                | 1,837                | 1,383                |\n\n- (1) These receivables are offset by the liabilities of the same amount (see accounting policies below and Note 5.7).",

These receivables are offset by the liabilities of the same amount (see Note 5.7).\n\nOrange Money is a money transfer, payment and financial services solution provided via an electronic money ('e-money') account linked to an Orange mobile number.\n\nSince 2016, the Orange group has become an Electronic Money Issuer ('EMI') in some of the countries in which it operates, via dedicated, approved, internal subsidiaries. Regulations state that EMIs, as last-resort guarantors for the reimbursement of e-money holders, are obliged to restrict the funds collected in exchange for the issue of e-money (obligation to protect holders). The e-money distribution model relies on Orange's subsidiaries and third-party distributors. EMIs issue e-money (or units of value 'UV') at the request of these distributors in exchange for funds collected therefrom. The distributors then transfer the e-money to end holders.\n\nWithin the Orange group, this restriction includes the protection of third-party holders (distributors and customers).\n\nThese transactions have no impact on the Group's net financial debt and are listed under the following headings:\n\n- -assets restricted to an amount equal to the e-money in circulation outside of the Orange group (or UV in circulation);\n- -UV in circulation under liabilities, representing the obligation to reimburse the third-party holders (customers and third-party distributors).\n\nThese two headings are presented under 'other assets' and 'other liabilities' and under operating activities as 'change in working capital requirement'.\n\n## Note 5 Purchases and other expenses\n\n## 5.1 External purchases\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                        | 2021     | 2020     | 2019     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Commercial, equipment expenses and content rights             | (7,385)  | (6,868)  | (7,293)  |\n| o/w costs of terminals and other equipment sold  (1)          | (3,942)  | (3,575)  | (4,042)  |\n| o/w advertising, promotional, sponsoring and rebranding costs | (783)    | (736)    | (823)    |\n| Service fees and inter-operator costs                         | (4,349)  | (4,529)  | (4,608)  |\n| o/w interconnexion costs                                      | (2,956)  | (3,186)  | (3,212)  |\n| Other network expenses, IT expenses                           | (3,530)  | (3,503)  | (3,253)  |\n| Other external purchases                                      | (2,709)  | (2,791)  | (2,706)  |\n| o/w building cost for resale                                  | (1,047)  | (883)    | (701)    |\n| o/w overhead                                                  | (1,044)  | (1,099)  | (1,254)  |\n| o/w rental expenses                                           | (147)    | (151)    | (241)    |\n| Total                                                         | (17,973) | (17,691) | (17,860) |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk at any time. Where appropriate, litigation cases may be analyzed as contingent liabilities, which correspond to:\n\n- -probable obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Company's control; or\n- -present obligations arising from past events that are not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\n## Acquisition and integration costs\n\nAcquisition and integration costs are incurred at the time of acquisition of legal entities (costs linked to the acquisition of the entity, consultancy fees, training costs for new staff, migration costs associated with customer offers, labor expenses associated with the transition).

They include those that have been financed by the supplier (with or without notification of transfer to financial institutions) under direct or reverse factoring, and those for which the supplier proposed an extended payment period to Orange and for which Orange confirmed the payment arrangement under the agreed terms. Orange considers these financial liabilities to carry the characteristics of  trade  payables,  in  particular  due  to  the  ongoing  trade  relationship,  the  payment  schedules  ultimately  consistent  with  the operational cycle of a telecommunications operator in particular for the purchase of primary infrastructures, the supplier's autonomy in the anticipated relationship and a financial cost borne by Orange that corresponds to the compensation of the supplier for the extended payment schedule agreed.\n\nFor payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is negligible. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

In France, civil servants employed by Orange SA are  covered  by  the  French  government  sponsored  civil  and military pension plan. Orange SA's obligation under the plan is limited to the payment of annual contributions (French law No. 96-660 dated July 26, 1996). Consequently, Orange SA has no obligation to fund future deficits of the pension plans covering its own civil servant employees or any other civil service plans. Expenses recognized under the terms of defined contribution pension plans amounted to (727) million euros in 2021 ((729) million euros in 2020 and (724) million euros in 2019);\n- -the Group is committed to a limited number of annuity-based defined-benefit  plans :  notably  the  Equant  plans  in  the United  Kingdom  for  352  million  euros  and  a  plan  for  senior management staff in France for 191 million euros. Plan assets were  transferred  to  these  plans  in  the  United  Kingdom  and in  France. A few years ago, these plans were closed to new subscribers and also closed in the United Kingdom with regard to the acquisition of rights;\n- -the  Group  is  also  committed  to capital-based  defined benefit plans where, in accordance with the law or contractual agreements, employees are entitled to bonuses on retirement, depending on their years of service and end of career salary; this  essentially  relates  to  bonuses  due  upon  retirement  in France, particularly for employees under private-law contracts (688  million  euros  for  Orange  SA,  equal  to  80%  of  the\n- capital-based plans) and for civil servants (23 million euros, equal to 3% of capital-based plans);\n- -other post-employment benefits are also granted to retired employees: these are benefits other than defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans;\n- -other  long-term  benefits may  also  be  granted  such  as seniority  awards,  long-term  compensated  absences  and French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) detailed below.\n\n## French part-time for seniors plans\n\nAs part of the renegotiations of the intergenerational agreement, a  new  French  part-time  for  seniors  plan  (TPS)  was  signed  on December 17, 2021, resulting in the recognition of an employee benefit liability of 1,225 million euros.\n\nThe part-time for seniors plans are accessible to civil servants and employees under private contract from the French entities who will retire no later than January 1, 2028, and who have at least 15 years service within the Group.\n\nThese plans give employees the opportunity to work 50% or 60% of a full-time job whilst receiving:\n\n- -a base salary between 65% and 80% of full-time employment;\n- -the  retirement  entitlement  benefits  of  full-time  employment during  the  period  in  question  (both  the  Company's  and  the employee's contributions);\n- -a minimum salary level.\n\nThese plans last for a period of at least 18 months and no longer than five years.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  may  decide  to  invest  part  of  their  base compensation  (5%,  10%  or  15%)  in  a  Time  Savings  Account (CET), with an additional Group contribution. The CET allows for a reduction in the amount of time worked.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

        "page_content": "3 -\n\nConsolidated financial statements\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  number  of  employees  who  are  or will  be  participating  in  the  French  part-time  for  seniors  plans and thus included in the provision, is estimated approximately at 11,900 employees.\n\n## 6.2.2 Key assumptions used to calculate the amount of obligations\n\nThe assessment of post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits  is  based  on  retirement  age  calculated  in  accordance with  the  provisions  applicable  to  each  plan  and  the  necessary\n\nconditions to ensure entitlement to a full pension, both of which are often subject to legislative changes.\n\nThe valuation of the obligation of the French part-time for seniors plans is sensitive to estimates of the potentially eligible population and to the sign-up rate for the plans (estimated at 70% on average), and  the  trade-offs  that  the  beneficiaries  will  ultimately  make between the different plans proposed.\n\nThe  discount  rates  used  for  the  euro  zone  (which  accounts  for 88% of Orange's pension and other long-term employee benefit obligations as at December 31, 2021) are as follows:\n\n|                    | December 31, 2021    | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2019   |\n|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| More than 10 years | 0.80% to 1.05%       | 0.55% to 0.90%      | 0.70% to   0.90%    |\n| Less than 10 years | -0.15% to 0.40%  (1) | -0.35% to 0.70%     | -0.33% to 0.70%     |\n\n- (1) A -0.15% rate has been used to value the obligation regarding the French part-time for seniors plans (-0.25% as at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019).\n\nThe discount rates used for the euro zone are based on corporate bonds rated AA with a duration equivalent to the duration of the obligations.\n\nThe increase in annuities of the Equant plans in the United Kingdom is based on inflation (3.15% used) up to 5%.\n\nThe main capital-based defined benefit plan (retirement bonuses for employees under private-law contracts in France) is principally sensitive  to  employment  policy  assumptions  (Orange  has historically  had  high  numbers  of  staff  at  retirement  age).  The\n\n(in millions of euros)\n\nDiscount rates (1)\n\n111\n\nSign-up rates for French part-time for seniors plans (2)\n\n(85)\n\n85\n\n- (1) Includes 20 million euros for the French part-time for seniors plans (short term duration).\n- (2) Sensitivity is performed on future entries in French part-time for seniors plans (TPS).\n\nestimated increase in the capital of this plan is based on a long-term inflation assumption of 2% associated with the effect of a higher 'GVT'  (acronym  for  Wage  drift  -  Seniority  -  Job-skills).  'Wage drift - Seniority - Job-skills' refers to annual change in total payroll costs independent of general or categorical increases in wages and salaries, due to in-grade promotions, out of grade promotions and the aging of existing staff.\n\nThe  impacts  on  pension  benefit  obligations  of  changes  in  key assumptions would be as follows:\n\nRate increase by 50 points\n\nRate decrease by 50 points\n\n(101)\n\nRate decrease by 5%\n\nRate increase by 5%",

Its computation is based on external indices commonly used as reference for the Eurozone,\n- -actuarial gains and losses on post-employment benefits are fully recorded in other comprehensive income,\n- -the Group's defined benefit plans are generally not financed. In the rare cases where they are, hedging plan assets are set up by employer and employee contributions which are managed by separate legal entities whose investments are subject to fluctuations in the financial markets. These entities are generally administrated by joint committees comprising representatives of the Group and of the beneficiaries. Each committee adopts its own investment strategy which is designed to strike the optimum strategies to match assets and liabilities, based on specific studies performed by external experts. It is generally carried out by fund managers selected by the committees and depends on the market opportunities. Assets are measured at fair value, determined by reference to quoted prices, since they are mostly invested in listed securities (primarily shares and bonds) and the use of other asset categories is limited.\n\nOther long-term benefits may be granted such as seniority awards, long-term compensated absences and French part-time for  seniors  plan  (TPS) agreements. The calculation of the related commitments is based on actuarial assumptions (including demographic, financial and discounting assumptions) similar to those relating to post-employment benefits. The relevant actuarial gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when they arise.\n\nTermination benefits are subject to provisions (up to the related obligation). For all commitments where termination of employment contracts would trigger payment of an indemnity, actuarial gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss for the period when modifications take place.\n\n## 6.3 Share-based payment\n\n## Employee shareholding plan Together 2021\n\nOn  April  21,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the implementation of an employee shareholding plan, Together 2021, designed to strengthen the Group's employee shareholding. The offering relates to a maximum of subscriptions, including matching contributions,  of  a  value  of  260  million  euros  expressed  in  the reference price before discount and is carried out by buying back existing shares of Orange SA.\n\nThe  number  of  shares  subscribed  at  the  price  of  6.64  euros (taking into account a discount of 30% compared to the reference market price) amounts to 12 million shares, to which are added\n\n14 million shares allocated free of charge in the form of a matching contribution, i.e. a total of 26 million shares.\n\nThe average fair  value  of  the  benefit  granted  to  employees  and former  employees  of  the  Group  stands  at  6.47  euros  per  share allocated  (including  free  shares),  i.e.  an  expense  of  (172)  million euros (including social contributions) recognized though equity for 169 million euros and through social debts for 3 million euros.\n\n## Free share award plans in force at December 31, 2021\n\nThe Board of Directors approved the implementation of free share award plans (Long Term Incentive  Plan  -  LTIP)  reserved  for  the Executive Committee, Corporate Officers, and Senior Management holding the positions of 'Executives' and 'Leaders'.\n\n## Main characteristics\n\n|                                                     | LTIP 2021-2023    | LTIP 2020-2022    | LTIP 2019-2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Implementation date by the Board of Directors       | July 28, 2021     | July 29, 2020     | July 24, 2019     |\n| Maximum number of free share units  (1)             | 1.8 million       | 1.7 million       | 1.7 million       |\n| Estimated number of beneficiaries                   | 1,300             | 1,300             | 1,200             |\n| Acquisition date of the rights by the beneficiaries | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2022 | December 31, 2021 |\n| Delivery date of the shares to the beneficiaries    | March 31, 2024    | March 31, 2023    | March 31, 2022    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

In this respect, the review of expectations could affect the margin of recoverable amounts over the book value tested (see Note 7.4) and result in impairment losses on goodwill and fixed assets.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  updated  its  strategic  plan  during  the  first semester (for the period 2021-2025). Accordingly, new business plans were prepared for all CGUs.\n\nThe discount  rates  and  perpetual  growth  rates used  to determine the values in use were revised as follows at the end of December 2021:\n\n- -the discount rates (which may incorporate a specific premium reflecting an assessment of the performance risks of certain business plans or country risks) experienced a slight increase as a result, on one hand, of the revision of one of their calculation parameters during the second half of 2021, and on the other hand, of the recognition of a precaution on the Enterprise CGU with a view to integrating the effects of the accelerated decline in fixed voice into the valuation used at December 31, 2021;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

the service markets offered by the Group.\n- At  December  31,  2021,  business  plans  and  key  operating assumptions were sensitive to the following:\n- -the  consequences  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic:  deterioration in  the  situation  compared  to  December  31,  2020  in  certain geographical  areas  in  terms  of  the  return  to  an  economic situation deemed normal (such as in Spain or Romania);\n- -the  tradeoffs  to  be  made  by  regulatory  and  competition authorities  between  reducing  prices  to  consumers  and stimulating  business  investment,  or  in  terms  of  rules  for awarding 5G operating licenses or market concentration;\n- -the  fiercely  competitive  nature  of  the  markets  in  which  the Group operates, where price pressure is strong, particularly in Spain;\n- -the Group's ability to adjust costs and capital expenditure to changes in revenue;\n- -and specifically in the Middle East and the Maghreb (Jordan, Egypt,  Tunisia)  as  well  as  in  some

It is tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when there is an indication that it may be i mpaired. Thus, changes in general economic and financial trends, the different levels of resilience of the telecommunication operators with respect to the deterioration of local economic environments, changes in the market capitalization of telecommunication operators, as well as financial performance compared to market expectations represent external impairment indicators that are analyzed by the Group, together with internal performance indicators, in order to assess whether an impairment test should be performed more than once a year.\n\nThese tests are performed at the level of each Cash-Generating Unit (CGU) (or group of CGUs). These generally correspond to business segments or to each country in the Africa and Middle East region and Europe. This is reviewed if the Group changes the level at which it monitors return on investment for goodwill testing purposes.\n\nTo determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of the CGUs or groups of CGUs is compared to their recoverable amount, for which Orange uses mostly the value in use.\n\nValue in use is estimated as the present value of the expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on economic and regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and sales activity and investment forecasts drawn up by the Group's management, as follows:\n\n- -cash flow projections are based on three-to-five-year business plans and include a tax cash flow calculated as EBIT (operating income) multiplied by the statutory tax rate (excluding the impact of deferred tax and unrecognized tax loss carryforwards at the date of valuation). In the case of recent acquisitions, longer-term business plans may be used;\n- -post-tax cash flow projections beyond that timeframe may be extrapolated by applying a declining or flat growth rate for the next year, and then a perpetual growth rate reflecting the expected long-term growth in the market;\n- -post-tax cash flows are subject to a post-tax discount rate, using rates which incorporate a relevant premium reflecting a risk assessment for the implementation of certain business plans or country risks. The value in use derived from these calculations is identical to the one that would result from discounting pre-tax cash flows at pre-tax discount rates.\n\nThe key operating assumptions used to determine values in use are common across all of the Group's business segments. Key assumptions for most CGUs include:\n\n- -key revenue assumptions, which reflect market level, penetration rate of the offers and market share, positioning of the competition's offers and their potential impact on market price levels and their transposition to the Group's offer bases, regulatory authority decisions on pricing of services to customers and on access and pricing of inter-operator services, technology migration of networks (e.g. extinction of copper local loops), decisions of competition authorities in terms of concentration or regulation of adjacent sectors such as cable;\n- -key cost assumptions, on the level of marketing expenses required to deal with the pace of product line renewals and the positioning of the competition, the ability to adjust costs to potential changes in revenues or the effects of natural attrition and employee departure plans underway;\n- -key assumptions on the level of capital expenditure, which may be affected by the rollout of new technologies, by decisions of regulatory authorities relating to licenses and spectrum allocation, deployment of fiber networks, mobile network coverage, sharing of network elements or obligations to open up networks to competitors.\n\nTested net carrying values include goodwill, land and assets with finite useful lives (property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and net working capital requirements including intra-group balances). The Orange brand, an asset with an indefinite useful life, is subject to a specific test, see Note 8.3.\n\nIf an entity partially owned by the Group includes goodwill attributable to non-controlling interests, the impairment loss is allocated between the shareholders of Orange SA and the non-controlling interests on the same basis as that on which profit or loss is allocated (i.e. ownership interest).\n\nImpairment loss for goodwill is recorded definitively in operating income.",

Its recoverable amount is assessed based on the expected contractual royalties (and included in the business plan) discounted in perpetuity, less the costs attributable to the brand's owner.\n\n## 8.4 Other intangible assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)      | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021                                        | December 31, 2021       | December 31, 2021   | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   |\n|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                             |                     | Gross value Accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization | Accumulated  impairment | Net book  value     | Net book  value      | Net book   value     |\n| Telecommunications licenses | 12,116              | (5,374)                                                  | (51)                    | 6,691               | 6,322                | 6,043                |\n| Software                    | 13,796              | (9,418)                                                  | (47)                    | 4,331               | 4,288                | 4,250                |\n| Orange brand                | 3,133               | -                                                        | -                       | 3,133               | 3,133                | 3,133                |\n| Other brands                | 1,104               | (133)                                                    | (901)                   | 69                  | 78                   | 88                   |\n| Customer bases              | 5,297               | (4,939)                                                  | (12)                    | 346                 | 469                  | 597                  |\n| Other intangible assets     | 2,304               | (1,730)                                                  | (204)                   | 370                 | 844                  | 626                  |\n| Total                       | 37,749              | (21,594)                                                 | (1,215)                 | 14,940              | 15,135               | 14,737               |\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                             | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net book value of other intangible assets - in the opening balance | 15,135  | 14,737  | 14,073  |\n| Acquisitions of other intangible assets                            | 2,842   | 2,935   | 2,385   |\n| o/w telecommunications licenses  (1)                               | 926     | 969     | 519     |\n| Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation  (2)               | (888)   | 31      | 328     |\n| Disposals                                                          | (4)     | (4)     | (10)    |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                      | (2,363) | (2,309) | (2,286) |\n| Impairment  (3)                                                    | (40)    | (24)    | 88      |\n| Translation adjustment                                             | 92      | (176)   | 106     |\n| Reclassifications and other items  (4)                             | 165     | (55)    | 52      |\n| Net book value of other intangible assets - in the closing balance | 14,940  | 15,135  | 14,737  |\n\n- (2) In 2021, mainly relates to the effects of the loss of sole control over Orange Concessions.

They mainly comprise network facilities and equipment.\n\nThe gross value of property, plants and equipment is made up of their acquisition or production cost, which includes study and construction fees as well as enhancement costs that increase the capacity of equipment and facilities. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except where they serve to increase the asset's productivity or extend its useful life.\n\nThe cost of property, plant and equipment also includes the estimated cost of dismantling, removing and restoring the site occupied due to the obligation incurred by the Group.\n\nThe roll-out of assets by stage, especially for network assets, in the Group's assessment, does not generally require a substantial period of preparation. As a result, the Group does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nIn France, the regulatory framework governing the optical fiber network roll-out (Fiber To The Home - FTTH) organizes the access by commercial operators to the last mile of networks rolled-out by another operator on a co-funding basis (ab initio or a posteriori) or through a line access. The sharing of rights and obligations between the various operators co-financing the terminal section of networks is classified as a joint operation in accordance with IFRS 11 'Partnerships': Orange only recognizes as an asset its share of the network assets self-built or purchased to other co-financing operators.\n\nThe Group has entered into network sharing arrangements with other mobile operators on a reciprocal basis, which may cover passive infrastructure sharing, active equipment or even spectrum.\n\n## 8.6 Fixed assets payables\n\n| (in millions of euros)                        | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Fixed assets payable - in the opening balance | 4,640  | 3,665  | 3,447  |\n| Business related variations  (1)              | (206)  | 1,002  | 200    |\n| Changes in the scope of consolidation  (2)    | (199)  | (0)    | (14)   |\n| Translation adjustment                        | 31     | (50)   | 29     |\n| Reclassifications and other items  (3)        | 216    | 23     | 3      |\n| Fixed assets payable - in the closing balance | 4,481  | 4,640  | 3,665  |\n| o/w long-term fixed assets payable            | 1,370  | 1,291  | 817    |\n| o/w short-term fixed assets payable           | 3,111  | 3,349  | 2,848  |\n\n- (1) Includes, in 2021, the disbursement of the 5G license for (150) million euros in France.

The payment terms can be over several years in the case of infrastructure roll-out and license acquisition. The payables due in more than 12 months are presented in non-current items. For payables without specified interest rates, they are measured at nominal value if the interest component is negligible. For interest bearing payables, the measurement is at amortized cost.\n\nTrade payables also include those that the supplier may have sold with or without notifying financial institutions in a direct or reverse factoring arrangement (see Note 5.6).\n\nFirm purchase commitments are disclosed as unrecognized contractual commitments (see Note 16), net of any prepayment, which are recognized as prepayment on fixed assets.",

The provision is assessed on the basis of the identified costs for the current fiscal year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of the commitment settlement. This estimate is revised annually and adjusted where appropriate against the asset to which it relates. The provision is present-discounted at a rate set by geographical area and equal to the average rate of risk-free investments in 15-year State bonds.\n\nIn case of extinguishment of the obligation, the provision is reversed in compensation for the net carrying value of the dismantling asset and of the net carrying value of the underlying assets if the dismantling asset is less than the reversal of the provision.\n\n## Note 9 Lease agreements\n\nIn the course of its activities, the Group regularly enters into leases as a lessee. These leases concern the following asset categories:\n\n- -Land and buildings;\n- -Networks and terminals;\n- -IT equipment;\n- -O t h e r .\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIFRS 16 'Leases,' the application of which is mandatory, has been applied within the Group since January 1, 2019.\n\nIFRS 16 defines a lease as a contract that grants the lessee the right to control the use of an identified asset. All leases are recognized in the balance sheet as an asset reflecting the right to use the leased assets and a corresponding liability reflecting the related lease liabilities (see Notes 9.1 and 9.2). In the income statement, depreciation of right-of-use assets (see Note 9.1) is presented separately from the interest expenses on lease liabilities. In the statement of cash flows, cash outflows relating to interest expenses impact operating cash flows, while repayment of lease liabilities impacts financing cash flows.\n\nFor the lessor, assets subject to leases must be recognized on the balance sheet according to the nature of the asset and the associated leasing revenues as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nWhen the Group carries out a transaction qualified as sale and leaseback in accordance with IFRS 16, a right-of-use asset is recognized in proportion to the previous carrying value of the asset corresponding to the right-of-use asset retained as counterparty to a lease liability. A gain (or loss) on disposal of fixed assets is recognized in the income statement in proportion to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The adjustment of the gain (or loss) on disposal recognized in the income statement for the share on which the Group retains its user rights via the lease relates to the difference between the right-of-use asset and the lease liability recognized in the balance sheet.\n\nFinally, the Group applies the two exemptions provided for in IFRS 16, concerning leases with a term of 12 months or less that are not tacitly renewable and leases where the value, when new, of the underlying asset is less than approximately 5,000 euros. Leases covered by either of these two exemptions are presented in off-balance sheet commitments and an expense is recognized in external purchases in the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Real estate leases entered into in France generally have long terms (nine-year commercial leases with early termination options after three and six years, known as '3/6/9 leases') (see Note 9.2). However, depending on the geographical location of the leases, their legal term may vary and the Group may be required to adopt a specific enforceable period taking into account the local legal and economic environment;\n- -Networks and terminals: the Group is required to lease a certain number of assets in connection with its mobile activities. This is notably the case of land on which to install antennas, mobile sites leased to third-party operators and certain 'TowerCos' contracts (companies operating telecom towers). Leases are also entered into as part of fixed-line network activities. These leases mainly concern access to the local loop where the Orange group is a market challenger (total or partial unbundling), as well as the lease of land transmission cables;\n- -IT equipment: this asset category primarily comprises the lease of servers and hosting space in Data centers;\n- -other: this asset category primarily comprises the lease of vehicles and technical equipment.\n\n## 9.1 Right-of-use assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)    | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021                                        | December 31, 2021       | December 31, 2021   | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n|                           |                     | Gross value Accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization | Accumulated  impairment | Net book  value     | Net book  value      | Net book   value     |\n| Land and buildings        | 7,743               | (2,489)                                                  | (324)                   | 4,930               | 4,865                | 4,959                |\n| Networks and terminals    | 3,442               | (926)                                                    | -                       | 2,516               | 1,931                | 1,524                |\n| IT equipment              | 166                 | (111)                                                    | (0)                     | 55                  | 30                   | 29                   |\n| Other right-of-use        | 360                 | (159)                                                    | (0)                     | 201                 | 184                  | 188                  |\n| Total right-of-use assets | 11,711              | (3,685)                                                  | (324)                   | 7,702               | 7,009                | 6,700                |\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                         | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Net book value of right-of-use assets - in the opening balance | 7,009   | 6,700   | 6,790   |\n| Increase (new right-of-use assets)  (1)                        | 2,172   | 1,529   | 1,014   |\n| Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation                | 34      | 1       | 18      |\n| Depreciation and amortization                                  | (1,481) | (1,384) | (1,274) |\n| Impairment  (2)                                                | (91)    | (57)    | (33)    |\n| Impact of changes in the assessments                           | 74      | 331     | 187     |\n| Translation adjustment                                         | 46      | (104)   | 26      |\n| Reclassifications and other items                              | (62)    | (7)     | (28)    |\n| Net book value of right-of-use assets - in the closing balance | 7,702   | 7,009   | 6,700   |\n\n- (1) Comprises in 2021, the right-of-use assets related to the new headquarters of the Orange group (Bridge) in France for 294 million euros.\n- (2) Impairment losses on right-of-use assets mainly concern real estate leases qualified as onerous contracts.",

This lease liability is equal to the present value of fixed and in-substance fixed payments not paid at that date, plus any amounts that Orange is reasonably certain to pay at the end of the lease, such as the exercise price of a purchase option (where it is reasonably certain to be exercised), or penalties payable to the lessor for terminating the lease (where such termination option is reasonably certain to be exercised).\n\nThe Group only takes the lease component into account when measuring the lease liability. For certain asset classes where leases include both service and lease components, the Group may recognize a single contract, classified as a lease (i.e. without distinguishing between the service and lease components).\n\nOrange systematically determines the lease term as the period during which leases cannot be canceled, plus periods covered by any extension options that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise and by any termination options that the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise. In the case of '3/6/9' leases in France, the term adopted is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis.\n\nThis period is also defined taking into account any laws and practices specific to each jurisdiction and business sector regarding the firm lease commitment term granted by lessors. The Group nonetheless assesses the enforceable period, based on the circumstances of each lease, taking into account certain indicators such as the existence of more than insignificant penalties in the event of termination by the lessee. To determine the length of this enforceable period, the Group considers the economic importance of the leased asset and the assumptions made in its strategic plan.\n\nWhen non-removable leasehold improvements have been made to leased assets, the Group assesses, on a case-by-case basis, whether these improvements provide an economic benefit when determining the enforceable period of the lease.\n\nWhen a lease includes a purchase option, the Group considers the enforceable period to be equal to the useful life of the underlying asset where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the purchase option.\n\nFor each lease, the discount rate used is determined based on the yield rate on government bonds in the lessee country, in accordance with the lease term and currency, to which the Group's credit spread is added.\n\nAfter the lease commencement date, the amount of the lease liability may be reassessed to reflect changes introduced in the following main cases:\n\n- -a change in term resulting from a contract amendment or a change in assessment of the reasonable certainty that a renewal option will be exercised or a termination option will not be exercised;\n- -a change in the amount of lease payments, for example following application of a new index or rate in the case of variable payments;\n- -a change in the assessment of whether a purchase option will be exercised;\n- -any other contractual change, for example a change to the scope of the lease or the underlying asset.\n\n## Note 10   Taxes\n\n## 10.1 Operating taxes and levies\n\nAlthough comprising a directly identifiable counterpart, the periodic spectrum fees are presented within the operating taxes and levies payables as they are set by and paid to the States and Local Authorities.\n\n## 10.1.1 Operating taxes and levies recognized in the income statement\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                         | 2021    | 2020    | 2019    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Territorial Economic Contribution, IFER and similar taxes  (1) | (652)   | (795)   | (758)   |\n| Spectrum fees                                                  | (360)   | (341)   | (329)   |\n| Levies on telecommunication services                           | (329)   | (319)   | (276)   |\n| Other operating taxes and levies                               | (586)   | (469)   | (465)   |\n| Total                                                          | (1,926) | (1,924) | (1,827) |\n\nThe 2021 French Finance Act enacted the reduction of the applicable rate of the CVAE in France, effective January 1, 2021.

The current income tax expense mainly represents the obligation to pay a minimum level of tax calculated on the basis of 75% of taxable income due to the 25% restriction on the utilization of tax loss carry forwards.\n\nIn 2021, the Spanish tax group was in deficit, which explains the absence of current tax expense recognized for the fiscal year.\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nI n 2021, a deferred tax expense of (162) million euros was recognized to reflect the negative impact on the recoverable amount of deferred taxes of updated business plan projections in a market that remains highly competitive with significant price pressure.\n\nIn 2020, a deferred tax expense of (102) million euros was recognized to reflect the negative impact on the recoverable amount of deferred taxes of updated business plan projections.\n\nIn 2019, a deferred tax expense of (42) million euros was recognized to reflect evolution of future perspectives for the recoverability of the deferred tax assets.\n\n## Africa & Middle East\n\nThe main contributors to the income tax expense are C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Mali, Guinea and Senegal:\n\n- -in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the corporate tax rate is 30% and the current tax expense stands at (91) million euros in 2021, (77) million euros in 2020 and (52) million euros in 2019;\n\n- -in  Mali,  the  corporate  tax  rate  is  30%  and  the  current  tax expense stands at (67) million euros in 2021, (62) million euros in 2020 and (55) million euros in 2019;\n- -in Guinea, the corporate tax rate is 35% and the current tax expense stands at (63) million euros in 2021, (47) million euros in 2020 and (42) million euros in 2019;\n- -in Senegal, the corporate tax rate is 30% and the current tax expense stands at (53) million euros in 2021, (54) million euros in 2020 and (56) million euros in 2019.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n## Current tax expense\n\nThe current income tax expense primarily reflects the taxation of activities related to Orange's brand activities at a tax rate of 19%.\n\n## Deferred tax expense\n\nIn 2021, a corporate tax rate increase was passed which will rise to 25% from 2023 (it currently stands at 19%). The 2021 deferred tax expense therefore includes an increase of (188) million euros in relation to deferred tax liabilities recognized for the Orange brand.\n\nIn  2020,  the  deferred  tax  expense  included  an  increase  of  (63) million  euros  in  deferred  tax  liabilities  recognized  in  the  United Kingdom on the Orange brand. The British government canceled the tax reduction from 19% to 17% in 2020, provided for by the 2016 Finance Act, thus maintaining the rate at 19%. The deferred tax liabilities on the brand were recorded as of December 31, 2020 at a 19% tax rate.\n\n## Group tax proof\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                             | Note   | 2021    | 2020      | 2019    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------|---------|\n| Profit before tax                                                  |        | 1,740   | 4,207     | 4,669   |\n| Statutory tax rate in France                                       |        | 28.41%  | 32.02%    | 34.43%  |\n| Theoretical income tax                                             |        | (494)   | (1,347)   | (1,608) |\n| Reconciling items:                                                 |        |         |           |         |\n| Tax income related to the 2005-2006 tax dispute  (1)               |        | -       | 2,246     | -       |\n| Impairment of goodwill  (2)                                        | 7.1    | (1,052) | -         | (19)    |\n| Impairment of BT shares                                            | 13.7   | -       | -         | (34)    |\n| Impact related to the loss of sole control over Orange Concessions |        | 557     | -         | -       |\n| Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures         |        | 1       | (1)       | 3       |\n| Adjustment of prior-year taxes                                     |        | (23)    | 1         | 10      |\n| Recognition/(derecognition) of deferred tax assets                 |        | (149)   | (98)      | (36)    |\n| Difference in tax rates  (3)                                       |        | 85      | 157       | 192     |\n| Change in applicable tax rates  (4)                                |        | (235)   | (92)      | 43      |\n| Other reconciling items  (5)                                       |        | 348     | (18)      | 2       |\n| Effective income tax                                               |        | (962)   | 848       | (1,447) |\n| Effective tax rate (ETR)                                           |        | 55.31%  | (20.17) % | 30.99%  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

In Spain, tax losses carryforwards for which a deferred tax asset has  been  recognized  are  expected  to  be  fully  utilized  by  2026, unless affected by changes in tax rules and changes in business projections. The deferred tax assets recognized for Spain amounted to 0.4 billion euros at December 31, 2021.\n\nMost of the other tax losses carryforwards for which no deferred tax assets have been recognized will expire beyond 2026.\n\n## 10.3 Developments in tax disputes and audits\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits in France\n\n## Tax audits\n\nOrange SA was the subject of tax audits for the years 2017 and 2018 for which amending proposals were issued in 2021 for a total amount of approximately 430 million euros (default penalties and i nterest included). These adjustments mainly relate to the calculation of  VAT  on  digital  offerings,  tax  on  electronic  communications services on the same digital offerings, research tax credit, tax on television services, a portion of trademark fees paid by Orange SA to  the  British  company  Orange  Brand  Services  Ltd  for  reasons similar to the adjustments notified during the previous audits and\n\nthe  reconsideration  of  previous  tax  loss  carryforwards  used  for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.\n\nAll of these adjustments are contested by Orange SA. In accordance with its accounting policies, the Group makes a best estimate of the risk of these adjustments based on the technical merits of the positions defended.\n\nOrange SA was subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2015 and  2016.  An  amending  proposal  was  issued  in  2019  covering the calculation of trademark fees paid by Orange SA to the British company Orange Brand Services Ltd and deducted from its taxable income. The administration questions the inclusion of revenue from the roaming contract with Free and revenue from the fixed PSTN business.  This  rectification  request  is  contested  by  Orange  SA, which  has  requested  the  opening  of  out-of-court  proceedings and arbitration between the French and British tax authorities. The additional tax charge would effectively result in double taxation that would fail to comply with the provisions of the Franco-British tax agreement and the European arbitration agreement.\n\n## Tax disputes\n\nThere were no major developments in other tax disputes over the period.\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits in Spain\n\nIn the same way as other telecom operators, the Group regularly deals with disagreements concerning the taxation of its network in various countries.\n\nOrange in Spain is involved in various tax disputes related to local taxes on mobile and fixed services:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Since then, some municipalities  sent  out  tax  bills  in  accordance  with  such Supreme Court sentence. Orange continues to challenge the amount of the tax base, especially in Madrid, despite it was reduced by the municipality due to an error of the latter in the calculation of the tax base;\n- -regarding fixed services, in January 2021, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJUE), in response to an interpretative question raised, has ruled on the 1.5% charge on fixed retail\n\nservices. Since then, Orange Espagne has paid this tax when it is imposed by the municipalities. The application of this charge to  fixed  wholesale  services  is  contested  by  Orange.  At  this stage, Orange estimates that the decision of the CJUE does not lead to a modification of its accounting position.\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits in the rest of the Group\n\nThere were no major developments in other tax disputes and audits in the rest of the Group over the period.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nCurrent income tax and deferred tax are measured by the Group at the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities of each country, based on its interpretation with regard to the application of tax legislation. The Group calculates the tax assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of financial position based on the technical merits of the positions it defends versus that of the tax authorities.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for all temporary differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their tax basis, as well as for unused tax losses, using the liability method. Deferred tax assets are recognized only when their recovery is considered probable.\n\nA deferred tax liability is recognized for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, interests in joint ventures and associates, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- -the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference (e.g. the payment of dividends); and\n- -it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nAccordingly, for fully consolidated companies, a deferred tax liability is only recognized in the amount of the taxes payable on planned dividend distributions by the Group.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nAt each period end, the Group reviews the recoverable amount of the deferred tax assets carried by certain tax entities with significant tax losses carryforwards. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is assessed in the light of the business plans used for impairment testing. This plan may be adjusted for any tax specificities.\n\nDeferred tax assets arising on these tax losses are not recognized under certain circumstances specific to each company/tax consolidation group concerned, and particularly where:\n\n- -entities cannot assess the probability of the tax loss carryforwards being set off against future taxable profits, due to the horizon for forecasts based on business plans used for impairment testing and uncertainties as to the economic environment;\n- -entities have not yet begun to use the tax loss carryforwards;\n- -entities do not expect to use the losses within the timeframe allowed by tax regulations;\n- -it is estimated that tax losses are uncertain to be used due to risks of differing interpretations with regard to the application of tax legislation.",

On November 3, 2021, the Orange group sold 50% of the capital in Orange Concessions to the consortium comprising La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts), CNP Assurances and EDF resulting in the loss of Orange's sole  control  over  this  entity  and  its  subsidiaries.  The  Orange Concessions group is now jointly controlled with the consortium\n\nand is consolidated in the accounts of the Orange group under the equity method. The Group continues to have obligations under network  construction,  concession  and  operation  contracts  in proportion to its shareholding, resulting in a significant decrease in off-balance sheet commitments which now amount to 1,980 million euros  at  December  31,  2021,  versus  4,423  million  euros  at December 31, 2020.\n\nThe recoverable amount of interests in associates and joint ventures is based on the fair value of recent transactions.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe carrying amount accounted for under the equity method corresponds to the initial acquisition cost increased by the share of profit or loss in the period. If an associate incurs losses and the carrying amount of the investment is reduced to zero, the Group ceases to recognize the additional share of losses since it has no commitment beyond its investment.\n\nAn impairment test is performed at least annually and when there is objective evidence of impairment, for instance a decrease in the quoted price when the investee is listed, significant financial difficulty of the entity, observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, or information about significant changes having an adverse effect on the entity.\n\nAn impairment loss is recorded when the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount, the recoverable amount being the higher of the value in use and the fair value less costs to sell. The unit of account is the whole investment. Any impairment is recognized as 'Share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures'. Impairment losses shall be reversed once the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount.",

This  aggregate,  not  defined  by  IFRS,  may not  be  comparable  to  similarly  entitled  indicators  used  by  other companies. It is provided as additional information only and should not be considered as a substitute for an analysis of all the Group's assets and liabilities.\n\nNet financial debt as defined and used by Orange does not take into account Mobile Financial Services activities, for which this concept is not relevant.\n\nIt  consists  of  (a)  financial  liabilities  excluding  operating  payables (translated  into  euros  at  the  year-end  closing  rate)  including derivative instruments (assets and liabilities), less (b) cash collateral paid, cash, cash equivalents and financial assets at fair value.\n\nFurthermore, financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges included  in  net  financial  debt  are  set  up  to  hedge  in  particular items that are not included therein, such as future cash flows. As a result, the portion relating to these unmatured hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income is added to gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability are deducted from the liability's book value. The costs are subsequently amortized over the life of the liability, using the effective interest rate method.\n\nSome financial liabilities at amortized cost, mainly borrowings, are subject to hedging. This relates mostly to borrowings hedged against the exposure of their future cash flows to foreign exchange risk (cash flow hedge).\n\n## 13.4 TDIRA\n\nThe perpetual bonds redeemable for shares ('TDIRAs') with a par value of 14,100 euros are listed on Euronext Paris. Their issuance was described in a securities note approved by the Commission des Op\u00e9rations de Bourse (French Securities Regulator, renamed Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers  (French  Financial  Markets Authority)) on February 24, 2003. At December 31, 2021, taking into account redemptions made since their issuance, 44,880 TDIRAs remain outstanding for a total par value of 633 million euros.\n\nThe TDIRAs are redeemable in new Orange SA shares, at any time at the holders' request or, under certain conditions as described\n\nin the appropriate prospectus, at Orange SA's initiative based on a ratio of 607.027 shares to one TDIRA (i.e., conversion price of 23.228 euros), as the initial ratio of 300 shares to one TDIRA has been adjusted several times to protect bondholders' rights, and may be further adjusted under the terms and conditions set out in the information memorandum.\n\nSince January 1, 2010, the interest rate on the TDIRAs has been the three-month Euribor +2.5%.\n\nThe TDIRA are  subject  to  split  accounting  between  equity  and liabilities. For the securities outstanding at December 31, 2021, the 'equity' component before deferred tax stood at 152 million euros.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                 | December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                        | 2021           | 2020                         | 2019                         |\n| Number of securities                   | 44,880         | 44,880                       | 57,981                       |\n| Equity component before deferred taxes | 152            | 152                          | 196                          |\n| Debt component                         | 636            | 636                          | 822                          |\n| o/w accrued interests not yet due      | 3              | 3                            | 4                            |\n| Paid interest                          | 13             | 14                           | 18                           |",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nSome Group financial instruments include both a liability component and an equity component. This relates to perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRAs). On initial recognition, the liability component is measured at its market value, corresponding to the value of the contractually determined future cash flows discounted at the market rate applied at the date of issue to comparable instruments providing substantially the same conditions, but without the option to convert or redeem in shares. This liability component is subsequently recognized at amortized cost.\n\nThe book value of the equity component is determined at inception by deducting the fair value of the financial liability from the notional value of the instrument. This does not change throughout the life of the instrument.\n\n## 13.5 Bonds\n\nIn 2021, the Group carried out the following bond issues:\n\n| Notional  currency   | Initial  nominal  amount   (in millions of   | Maturity                 | Interest rate  (%)   | Issuer              | Type of operations             | Amounts  (in millions of  euros)   |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| EUR                  | 35                                           | January 15, 2022         | 0.500                | Orange SA           | Re-Issuance                    | 35                                 |\n| EUR                  | 700                                          | June 29, 2026            | 0.000                | Orange SA           | Issuance                       | 700                                |\n| EUR                  | 800                                          | June 29, 2034            | 0.750                | Orange SA           | Issuance                       | 800                                |\n| EUR                  |                                              | 1,000 December 16, 2033  | 0.625                | Orange SA           | Issuance                       | 1,000                              |\n| Total of issuances   | Total of issuances                           | Total of issuances       | Total of issuances   | Total of issuances  | Total of issuances             | 2,535                              |\n| EUR                  | 1,250                                        | January, 14, 2021        | 3.875                | Orange SA           | Repayment at maturity          | (1,250)                            |\n| GBP                  | 517                                          | June 27, 2021            | 0.375                | Orange SA           | Repayment at maturity          | (602)                              |\n| USD                  |                                              | 1,000 September, 14 2021 | 4.125                | Orange SA           | Early repayment                | (851)  (1)                         |\n| EUR                  | 255                                          | October, 13 2021         | 10Y CMS + 0.69       | Orange SA           | Repayment at maturity          | (255)                              |\n| EUR                  |                                              | 272 December 21, 2021    | 10Y TEC + 0.50       | Orange SA           | Repayment at maturity          | (272)                              |\n| EUR                  | 650                                          | January 15, 2022         | 0.500                | Orange SA           | Early repayment                | (650)                              |\n| MAD                  |                                              | 1,090 December 18, 2025  | 3.970                | M\u00e9di Telecom        | Regular annual basis repayment | (15)                               |\n| MAD                  |                                              | 720 December 18, 2025    | 1Y BDT + 1.00        | M\u00e9di Telecom        | Regular annual basis repayment | (10)                               |\n| MAD                  |                                              | 1,002 December 10, 2026  | 3.400                | M\u00e9di Telecom        | Regular annual basis repayment | (14)                               |\n| MAD                  |                                              | 788 December 10, 2026    | 1Y BDT + 0.85        | M\u00e9di Telecom        | Regular annual basis repayment | (11)                               |\n| Total of repayments  | Total of repayments                          | Total of repayments      | Total of repayments  | Total of repayments | Total of repayments            | (3,929)                            |\n\n- (1) The early redemption of the bond with an initial maturity of September 2021 was carried out on April 1, 2021.\n\nThe  Group  issued  bonds  exchangeable  for  BT  securities  for  a notional amount of 517 million pounds sterling (i.e. 585 million euros at the ECB daily reference rate) bearing a coupon of 0.375% and having as underlying 133 million BT shares. The Bonds matured in June 2021 and were redeemable on demand by investors since August 7, 2017, in cash, BT securities or a combination of the two, at Orange's choice. The Group redeemed the exchangeable bonds at maturity for 602 million euros. Under IFRS, this operation was split between a financial liability at amortized cost and a derivative instrument (sale of call option) revalued at fair value through profit or  loss.  In  the  first  half  of  2019,  Orange  purchased  call  options with the same characteristics as the sale of call options included in the bonds exchangeable for BT securities. The purchase of calls offsets the sale of the initial call options, so the Group is no longer\n\nexposed to any change in value of BT securities linked to the bonds exchangeable for BT shares.\n\nUnmatured bonds at December 31, 2021, presented below, were all issued by Orange SA, with the exception of two obligations (each with a fixed-rate tranche and a variable-rate tranche) denominated in Moroccan dirhams held by M\u00e9di Telecom and one bond in CFA francs issued by Sonatel.\n\nWith  the  exception  of  the  commitments  made  by  M\u00e9di Telecom,  which  are  redeemable  on  a  regular  annual  basis, at  December  31,2021,  the  bonds  issued  by  the  Group  were redeemable  at  maturity.  No  specific  guarantee  had  been  given in  relation  to  their  issuance.  Some  bonds  may  be  redeemed  in advance, at the request of the issuer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These assets are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in net financial expenses.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCI)\n\nEquity securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded in other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit/loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)\n\nThis  category  mainly  includes  loans  and  receivables.  These  instruments  are  recognized  at  fair  value  at  inception  and  are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. If there is any objective evidence of impairment of these assets, the value of the asset is reviewed at the end of each reporting period. An impairment loss is recognized in the income statement when impairment tests demonstrate that the financial asset book value is higher than its recoverable amount. For these financial assets, the provisioning system also covers expected losses according to IFRS 9.\n\n## 13.8 Derivatives instruments\n\n## 13.8.1 Market value of derivatives\n\n| (in millions of euros)            | December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   | December 31,  December 31,   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                   | 2021           | 2020                         | 2019                         |\n| Hedging derivatives               | 484            | (311)                        | 324                          |\n| Cash flow hedge derivatives       | 484            | (311)                        | 328                          |\n| Fair value hedge derivatives      | -              | (0)                          | (4)                          |\n| Derivatives held for trading  (1) | (79)           | (199)                        | (187)                        |\n| Net derivatives  (2)              | 405            | (510)                        | 138                          |\n\n- (1) Mainly due to the foreign exchange effects of the economic hedges against the revaluation of subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling (equity instruments recognized at their historical value (see Note 15.4) for (165) million euros in 2021, (210) million euros in 2020 and (136) million euros in 2019.\n- (2) Of which foreign exchange effects of the cross currency swaps (classified as hedging or held for trading) hedging foreign exchange risk on gross debt notional for 657 million euros in 2021, 251 million euros in 2020 and 822 million euros in 2019. The foreign exchange effect of the cross currency swaps is the difference between the notional converted at the closing rate and the notional converted at the opening rate (or at the trading day spot rate in case of new instrument).\n\nThe risks hedged by these derivative instruments are described in Note 14. These derivatives are associated with cash-collateral agreements, the effects of which are described in Note 14.5.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Changes in the value of these instruments are recognized directly in profit and loss.\n\nHedge accounting is applicable when:\n\n- -at the inception of the hedge, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship;\n- -the effectiveness of the hedge is demonstrated at inception and it is expected to continue in subsequent periods: i.e. at inception and throughout its duration, the company expects changes in the fair value of the hedged element to be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged instrument.\n\nThere are three types of hedge accounting:\n\n- -the fair value hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognized asset or liability (or an identified portion of the asset or liability) that are attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk and which could affect profit or loss. The hedged portion of these items is re-measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Change in this fair value is booked in the income statement and offset by symmetrical changes in the fair value hedging of financial hedging instruments up to the limit of the hedge effectiveness;\n- -the cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular interest rate and/or currency risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction (such as a future purchase or sale) and which could affect profit or loss. As the hedged item is not recognized in the statement of financial position, the effective portion of change in fair value of the hedging instrument is booked in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item (financial asset or liability) affects the profit or loss or in the initial cost of the hedged item when it relates to the hedge of a non-financial asset acquisition cost;\n- -the net investment hedge is a hedge of the exposure to changes in values attributable to exchange risk of a net investment in a foreign operation, and could affect profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation. The effective portion of the net investment hedge is recorded in other comprehensive income. It is reclassified in profit or loss upon the disposal of the net investment.\n\nFor transactions qualified as fair value hedges and economic hedges, the foreign exchange impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives is booked in operating income when the underlying hedged item results from operational transactions and in net finance costs when the underlying hedged item is a financial asset or liability.\n\nHedge accounting can be terminated when the hedged item is no longer recognized, i.e. when the Group revokes the designation of the hedging relationship or when the hedging instrument is terminated or exercised. The accounting consequences are as follows:\n\n- -fair value hedge: at the hedge accounting termination date, the adjustment of the fair value of the liability is amortized using an effective interest rate recalculated at this date. Should the item hedged disappear, the change in fair value is recognized in the income statement;\n- -cash flow hedge: amounts recorded in other comprehensive income are immediately reclassified in profit or loss when the hedged item is no longer recognized. In all other cases, amounts are reclassified in profit or loss, on a straight basis, throughout the remaining life of the original hedging relationship.\n\nIn both cases, subsequent changes in the value of the hedging instrument are recorded in profit or loss.\n\nConcerning the effects of the Foreign Currency Basis Spread, cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges, the Group has chosen to designate them as costs of hedge. This option enables recognizing these effects in other comprehensive income and amortizing the cost of the Basis Spread to profit/loss over the period of the hedge.",

        "page_content": "## Note 14   Information on market risk and fair value of financial assets and liabilities (telecom activities)\n\nThe Group uses financial position or performance indicators that are not specifically defined by IFRS, such as EBITDAaL (see Note 1.9) and net financial debt (see Note 13.3).\n\nMarket risks are monitored by Orange's Treasury and Financing Committee,  which  reports  to  the  Executive  Committee.  The Committee is chaired by the Group's Executive Committee Member in charge of Finance, Performance and Development and meets on a quarterly basis.\n\nIt  sets  the  guidelines  for  managing  the  Group's  debt,  especially in  respect  of  its  interest  rate,  foreign  exchange,  liquidity  and counterparty risk exposure for the coming months, and reviews past management (transactions realized, financial results).\n\nThe health crisis has not called into question the risk management policy relating to financial instruments. The Group continued to set up and manage hedging instruments in order to limit its exposure to operational and financial foreign exchange and interest rate risks, while maintaining a diversified financing policy.\n\n## 14.1 Interest rate risk management\n\n## Management of fixed-rate/variable-rate debt\n\nOrange  Group  seeks  to  manage  its  fixed-rate/variable-rate exposure in euros in order to minimize interest costs by using firm and conditional interest rate derivatives such as swaps, futures, caps and floors.\n\nThe fixed-rate component of gross financial debt, excluding cash collateral  received  and  agreements  to  buy  back  non-controlling interests,  was  estimated at 94% at December 31, 2021, 89% at December 31, 2020 and 91% at December 31, 2019.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of the Group's position to changes in interest rates\n\nThe  sensitivity  of  the  Group's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  to interest rate risk is only analyzed for the components of net financial debt that are interest-bearing and therefore exposed to interest rate risk.\n\n## Sensitivity of financial expenses\n\nBased on a constant amount of debt and a constant management policy, a 1% rise in interest rates would improve the annual cost of gross financial debt by 86 million euros, while a decrease of 1% would reduce it by 86 million euros.\n\n## Sensitivity of cash flow hedge reserves\n\nA 1% rise in euro interest rates would increase the market value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and the associated cash  flow  hedge  reserves  by  approximately  1,116  million  euros. A 1% fall in euro interest rates would lead to a decrease in their\n\nmarket value and in the cash flow hedge reserves of approximately 1,114 million euros.\n\n## 14.2 Foreign exchange risk management\n\n## Operational foreign exchange risk\n\nThe  Group's  foreign  operations  are  carried  out  by  entities  that operate in their own country and mainly in their own currency. Their operational exposure to foreign exchange risk is therefore limited to certain types of flows: purchases of equipment or network capacity, purchases of terminals and equipment sold or leased to customers, purchases from or sales to international operators.\n\nWhenever possible, the entities of the Orange Group have put in place policies to hedge this exposure (see Note 13.8).\n\n## Financial foreign exchange risk\n\nFinancial foreign exchange risk mainly relates to:\n\n- -dividends paid to the parent company: in general, the Group's policy is to economically hedge this risk as from the date of the relevant subsidiary's Shareholders' Meeting;\n- -financing  of  the  subsidiaries:  except  in  special  cases,  the subsidiaries are required to cover their funding needs in their functional currency;\n- -Group financing: most of the Group's bonds, after derivatives, are denominated in euros. From time to time, Orange SA issues bonds in markets other than euro markets (primarily the US dollar, pound sterling and Swiss franc). If Orange SA does not have assets in these currencies, in most cases, the issues are translated into euros through cross currency swaps. The debt allocation  by  currency  also  depends  on  the  level  of  interest rates and particularly on the interest rate differential relative to the euro.\n\nLastly, the Group economically hedges foreign exchange risk on its  subordinated  notes  denominated  in  pounds  sterling  that  are recorded  in  equity  at  their  historical  value  (see  Note  15.4),  with cross currency swaps, for a notional amount of 426 million pounds sterling.\n\nThe table below shows the main exposures to foreign exchange fluctuations  of  the  net  financial  debt  in  foreign  currencies  of Orange  SA,  excluding  the  hedging  effects  of  the  subordinated notes described above and of Orange Polska and also shows the sensitivity of the entity to a 10% change in the foreign exchange rates of the currencies to which it is exposed. Orange SA is the entity bearing the major foreign exchange risk, including internal operations which generate a net foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n| (in millions of currency units)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Exposure in currency units  (1)   | Sensitivity analysis   | Sensitivity analysis   | Sensitivity analysis   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | EUR                               | USD                               | GBP                               | PLN                               | CHF                               | Total  translated      | 10% gain  in euro      | 10% loss  in euro      |\n| Orange SA                         | -                                 | 1                                 | (17)                              | 1                                 | (5)                               | (24)                   | 2                      | (3)                    |\n| Orange Polska                     | (146)                             | (7)                               | -                                 | -                                 | -                                 | (151)                  | 14                     | (17)                   |\n| Total (euros)                     | (146)                             | (5)                               | (20)                              | 0                                 | (5)                               | (176)                  |                        |                        |\n\n- (1) Excluding FX hedge of subordinated notes denominated in pounds sterling.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Diversification of sources of funding\n\nOrange has diversified sources of funding:\n\n- -regular issues in the bonds markets;\n- -occasional  financing  through  loans  from  multilateral  or development lending institutions;\n- -issues  in  the  short-term  securities  markets  under  the  NEU Commercial Paper program (Negotiable European Commercial paper, formerly called 'commercial paper');\n- -on December 21, 2016, Orange had entered into a 6 billion euro syndicated loan with 24 international banks in order to refinance the previous syndicated loan maturing in January 2018. The new  loan,  with  initial  maturity  in  December  2021,  includes two options to extend for one more year each, exercisable by Orange and subject to the banks' approval. Orange exercised both of its options, the first one in 2017 and the second in 2018, allowing it, after agreement of the lenders, to extend the initial maturity first until December 2022 and then December 2023.\n\n## Liquidity of investments\n\nOrange invests its cash surpluses in cash equivalents that meet IAS 7 cash equivalent criteria or in fair value investments (negotiable debt securities, bonds with a maturity of no more than two years, UCITS and term deposits). These investments prioritize minimizing the risk of capital loss over performance.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and fair value investments are held mainly in France and other European Union countries, which are not subject to restrictions on convertibility or exchange controls.\n\n## Smoothing debt maturities\n\nThe policy followed by Orange is to apportion the maturities of debt evenly over the years to come.\n\nThe following table shows undiscounted future cash flows for each financial liability shown on the statement of financial position. The key assumptions used in this schedule are:\n\n- -amounts in foreign currencies are translated into euro at the year- end closing rate;\n- -future variable-rate interest is based on the last fixed coupon, unless a better estimate is available;\n- -TDIRA  being  necessarily  redeemable  in  new  shares,  no redemption  is  taken  into  account  in  the  maturity  analysis. In  addition,  interest  payable  on  the  bonds  is  due  over  an undetermined  period  of  time  (see  Note  13.4)  therefore,  only interest payable for the first period is included (including interest payments  for  the  other  periods  would  not  provide  relevant information);\n- -the maturity dates of revolving credit facilities are the contractual maturity dates;\n- -the 'Other items' (undated and non-cash items) reconcile, for financial liabilities not accounted for at fair value, the future cash flows and the balance in the statement of financial position.",

This aggregate, not defined by IFRS, may not be comparable to similarly entitled indicators used by other groups.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the liquidity position of Orange's telecom activities  amounts  to  16,642  million  euros  and  exceeds  the repayment obligations of its gross financial debt in 2021. It breaks down as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Orange group's telecom activities had access to credit facilities  in  the  form  of  bilateral  credit  lines  and syndicated credit lines. Most of these lines bear interest at variable rates.  Available  undrawn  amount  of  credit  facilities  amounts  to 6,188 million euros (including 6,000 million euros for Orange SA).\n\nCash  equivalents  amounted  to  5,479  million  euros,  mainly  at Orange SA for 4,925 million euros in UCITS, 200 million euros in term deposits and 125 million euros in negotiable debt securities.\n\nI nvestments at fair value amounted to 2,266 million euros exclusively at Orange SA, with 2,029 million euros in NEU Commercial Paper and 237 million euros in bonds.\n\nAny specific contingent commitments in terms of financial ratios are presented in Note 14.4.\n\nDue to its cash level and other immediately disposable investments, the Group is not dependent on the sale of receivables organized in certain countries (see Note 4.3).\n\n## Change in Orange's credit rating\n\nOrange's credit rating is an additional overall performance indicator used to assess the Group's financial policy and risk management policy and, in particular, its solvency and liquidity risk. It is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies regularly review the ratings they award. Any change in the rating could have an effect on the cost of future financing or access to liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  a  change  in  Orange's  credit  rating  will,  for  certain outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors:\n\n- -one  Orange  SA  bond  (see  Note  13.5)  with  an  outstanding amount of 2.5 billion  dollars  maturing  in  2031  (equivalent  to 2.2 billion euros at December 31, 2021) is subject to a Step-up clause in the event that Orange's rating changes. This clause was  triggered  in  2013  and  early  2014:  the  coupon  due  in March 2014 was thus computed on the basis of an interest rate of 8.75% and since then the bond bears interest at the rate of 9%;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

At December 31, 2021, the credit facility was not drawn.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  neither  Orange's  credit  ratings  nor  the outlook had changed compared with December 31, 2020.\n\n|                 | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Long-term debt  | BBB+                | Baa1      | BBB+            |\n| Outlook         | Stable              | Stable    | Stable          |\n| Short-term debt | A2                  | P2        | F2              |\n\n## 14.4 Financial ratios\n\n## Main commitments with regard to financial ratios\n\nOrange SA does not have any credit line or loan subject to specific covenant with regard to financial ratios.\n\nCertain subsidiaries of Orange SA have pledged to comply with certain financial ratios related to indicators defined in the contracts with the banks. The breach of these ratios constitutes an event of default that can lead to early repayment of the line of credit or loan concerned.\n\nThe main obligations are as follows:\n\n- -Orange Egypt: in respect of bank financing contracts signed in  2018,  of  which  the  total  nominal  amount  outstanding  at December 31, 2021 was 2,450 million Egyptian pounds (i.e. 137 million euros), Orange Egypt must comply with a 'net senior debt to reported EBITDA' ratio;\n- -M\u00e9di Telecom: in respect of its bank financing contracts signed in  2012,  2014  and  2015,  of  which  the  total  nominal  amount outstanding at December 31, 2021 was 1,755 million Moroccan dirhams  (i.e.  167  million  euros),  M\u00e9di  Telecom  must  comply with ratios relating to its 'net financial debt', 'net financial debt/ EBITDA' and 'net equity';\n- -Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire: in respect of its bank financing contracts signed in 2016 and 2019, of which the total nominal amount outstanding at December 31, 2021 was 91 billion CFA francs (i.e. 139 million euros), Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire must comply with a 'net debt to reported EBITDA' ratio;\n- -Orange Cameroon: in respect of its bank financing contracts signed in 2015 and 2018, of which the total nominal amount outstanding at December 31, 2021 was 50 billion CFA francs (i.e. 76 million euros), Orange Cameroon must comply with a 'net debt to reported EBITDA' ratio.\n- -These ratios were complied with at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Clauses related to instances of default or material adverse changes\n\nMost of Orange's financing agreements, including in particular the 6 billion euros syndicated credit facility set up on December 21, 2016, as well as bond issues, are not subject to early redemption obligations  in  the  event  of  a  material  adverse  change,  or  cross default  provisions.  Most  of  these  contracts  include  cross acceleration  provisions.  Thus,  the  mere  occurrence  of  events of default in other financing agreements would not automatically trigger an accelerated repayment under such contracts.\n\n## 14.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management\n\nThe Group could be exposed to a concentration of counterparty risk in respect of its trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments and derivatives.\n\nOrange considers that it has limited concentration in counterparty risk with respect to trade receivables due to its large and diverse customer  base  (residential,  professional  and  large  business customers)  operating  in  numerous  industries  and  located  in many French regions and foreign countries. The maximum value of the counterparty risk on these financial assets is equal to their recognized net book value. An analysis of net trade receivables past due is provided in Note 4.3. For loans and other receivables, amounts past due but not provisioned are not material.\n\nOrange SA is exposed to counterparty risk through its investments and derivatives. Therefore, it performs a strict selection of public, financial or industrial institutions in which it invests or with which it enters into derivatives agreements. This selection takes particular note of the institutions' credit ratings. Therefore:\n\n- -for each non-banking counterparty selected for investments, limits are based on ratings and maturities of the investments;\n- -for  each  counterparty  bank  selected  for  investments  and derivatives,  limits  are  based  on  equity,  rating,  CDS  (Credit Default  Swap, an accurate indicator of potential default risk) as  well  as  on  periodic  analyses  carried  out  by  the  Treasury Department;\n- -theoretical  limits  and  consumption  limits  are  monitored  and reported on a daily basis to the Group treasurer and the head of the trading room. These limits are adjusted regularly depending on credit events.\n\nFor derivatives, master agreements relating to financial instruments (French  Banking  Federation)  are  signed  with  all  counterparties and provide for a net settlement of debts and receivables, in case of failure of one of the parties, as well as for calculation of a final balance to be received or paid. These agreements include a CSA (Credit Support Annex) cash collateral clause that can lead to either a deposit (collateral paid) or collection (collateral received), on a daily basis. These payment amounts correspond to the change in market value of all derivatives.\n\nAs  a  rule,  investments  are  negotiated  with  high-grade  banks. Exceptionally,  subsidiaries  occasionally  deal  with  counterparties with the highest ratings available locally.",

Orange  SA  owns  subsidiaries  listed on equity markets whose share value may be affected by general trends in these markets. In particular, the market value of these listed  subsidiaries'  shares  is  one  of  the  measurement  variables used in impairment testing.\n\nThe  mutual  funds  (UCITS)  in  which  Orange  invests  for  cash management purposes contain no equities.\n\nThe Orange group is also exposed to equity risk through certain retirement plan assets (see Note 6.2).\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Group was not significantly exposed to market risk on the shares of listed companies. The Group's prior exposure had been significantly reduced in 2019, with the disposal in June 2019 of its residual 2.49% stake in the share capital of BT (see Note 13.7).\n\n## 14.7 Capital management\n\nOrange  SA  and  its  non-financial  subsidiaries  are  not  subject  to regulatory  requirements  related  to  equity  (other  than  the  usual standards applicable to any commercial company).\n\nIts  financial  subsidiaries  (like  electronic  money  institutions)  are subject to regulatory equity requirements specific to their sector and jurisdiction.\n\nLike any company, Orange manages its financial resources (both equity and net financial debt) as part of a balanced financial policy, aiming to ensure flexible access to capital markets, including for the purpose of selectively investing in development projects, and to provide a return to shareholders.\n\nIn terms of net financial debt (see Note 13.3), this policy translates into liquidity management as described in Note 14.3 and a specific attention to credit ratings assigned by rating agencies.\n\nThis policy is also reflected, in some markets, by the presence of minority shareholders in the capital of subsidiaries controlled by Orange.  This  serves  to  limit  the  Group's  debt  while  providing  a benefit from the presence of local shareholders.\n\n1,405\n\n## Effect of mechanisms to offset exposure to credit risk and counterparty risk of the derivatives\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                   | December 31,  2021   | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Collateralised Derivatives (net) (a)                     | 408                  | (520)                | 144                  |\n| Fair value of collateralised derivatives assets          | 690                  | 283                  | 570                  |\n| Fair value of collateralised derivatives liabilities     | (282)                | (803)                | (426)                |\n| Amount of cash collateral paid/(received) (b)            | (362)                | 611                  | (138)                |\n| Amount of cash collateral paid                           | 27                   | 642                  | 123                  |\n| Amount of cash collateral received                       | (389)                | (31)                 | (261)                |\n| Residual exposure to counterparty risk (a) + (b)  (1)    | 46                   | 91                   | 7                    |\n| Non collateralised Derivatives (net)                     | (3)                  | 10                   | (6)                  |\n| Fair value of non collateralised derivatives assets      | -                    | 11                   | 3                    |\n| Fair value of non collateralised derivatives liabilities | (3)                  | (1)                  | (10)                 |\n\n- (1) The residual exposure to counterparty risk is mainly due to a time difference between the valuation of derivatives at the closing date and the date on which the cash collateral exchanges were made.\n\nChanges in net cash collateral between 2020 and 2021 stem mainly from the appreciation of the US dollar and the pound sterling against the euro.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis of cash collateral to changes in market interest rates and exchange rates\n\nA change in market rates (mainly euro) of +/-1% would affect the fair value of interest rate hedging derivatives as follows:\n\n(in millions of euros)\n\n|                                           | Rate decrease of 1%   | Rate increase of 1%   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Change of fair value of derivatives       | (1,221)               | 1,224                 |\n|                                           | Rate decrease of 1%   | Rate increase of 1%   |\n| Amount of cash collateral received (paid) | 1,221                 | (1,224)               |\n\nThe effects of a 10% increase or decrease in the euro exchange rate on the fair value of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk would be as follows:\n\n(in millions of euros)\n\n10% loss in euro\n\n10% gain in euro\n\n10% loss in euro\n\n10% gain in euro\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

                  |\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position have been classified based on the three hierarchy levels:\n\n- -level  1:  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities  that  the  entity  can  access  at  the measurement date;\n- -level 2: inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly;\n- -level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\n\nThe fair value of the financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income ('FVOCI' and 'FVOCIR') is the quoted price at year-end for listed securities and, for non-listed securities, uses a valuation technique determined according to the most appropriate financial criteria in each case (comparable transactions, multiples for comparable companies, shareholders' agreement, discounted present value of future cash flows).\n\nFor financial assets at amortized cost ('AC'), the Group considers that the book value of cash, trade receivables and various deposits provide a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these elements.\n\nAmong financial assets at fair value through profit or loss ('FVR'), with respect to very short-term investments such as deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper or negotiable debt securities, the Group considers that the nominal value of the investment and any related accrued interest represent a reasonable approximation of fair value.\n\nThe fair value of mutual funds (UCITS) is the latest net asset value.\n\nThe fair value of equity securities is the quoted price at year-end for listed securities and for non-listed securities uses a valuation technique determined according to the most appropriate financial criteria in each case (comparable transactions, multiples for comparable companies, shareholders' agreement, discounted present value of future cash flows).\n\nFor financial liabilities at amortized cost ('AC') the fair value of financial liabilities is determined using:\n\n- -the quoted price for listed instruments (a detailed analysis is performed in the case of a material decrease in liquidity to evidence whether the observed price corresponds to the fair value; otherwise the quoted price is adjusted);\n- -the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted using rates observed by the Group at the end of the period for other instruments. The results calculated using the internal valuation model are systematically benchmarked with the values provided by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Group considers the book value of trade payables and deposits received from customers to be a reasonable approximation of fair value, due to the high liquidity of these elements.\n\nThe fair value of long-term trade payables is the value of future cash flows discounted at the interest rates observed by the Group at the end of the period.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss ('FVR') mainly concern firm or contingent commitments to purchase non-controlling interests. Their fair value is measured in accordance with the provisions of the contractual agreements. When the commitment is based on a fixed price, a discounted value is retained.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The results calculated using the internal valuation model are consistently benchmarked with the values provided by bank counterparties and Bloomberg.\n\nWhen there are no reliable market data which identify the probability of default, the CVA (Credit Value Adjustment) and the DVA (Debit Value Adjustment) are measured based on historical default charts and CDS (Credit Default Swap) trends. Counterparty credit risk and the Group's own specific default risk are also continuously monitored based on the monitoring of debt security credit spreads on the secondary market and other market information. Given the implementation of collateralization, and based on counterparty policies and the management of indebtedness and liquidity risk described in Note 14, CVA and DVA estimates are not material compared to the measurement of the related financial instruments.\n\n## Note 15   Equity\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Orange SA's share capital, based on the number of issued shares at this date, amounted to 10,640,226,396 euros, divided into 2,660,056,599 ordinary shares with a par value of 4 euros each.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the share capital and voting rights of Orange SA broke down as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 15.1 Changes in share capital\n\nNo new shares were issued during the 2021 fiscal year.\n\n## 15.2 Treasury shares\n\nAs authorized by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021, the Board of Directors instituted a new share Buyback program (the 2021 Buyback Program) and canceled the 2020 Buyback Program, with immediate effect.

The 2021 Buyback Program is described in the Orange Universal Registration  Document  filed  with  the  French  Financial  Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) on March 17, 2021.\n\nDuring the 2021 fiscal year, Orange bought and delivered treasury shares  to  the  beneficiaries  of  the  'Together  2021'  Employee\n\nOffering.

They are booked in equity.\n\nAs equity instruments are recognized at historical value, the tranche denominated in foreign currency is never re-measured. Where appropriate, a translation adjustment impact is booked in equity when a call option is exercised.\n\nThe remuneration of holders is recorded directly in equity at the time of the decision to pay the coupons.\n\nThe tax impact related to the remuneration is accounted for through profit or loss, and that related to the remeasurement of the foreign currency portion is accounted for in equity.\n\n## Equity component of perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRAs) (see Note 13.4)\n\nThe equity component is determined as the difference between the fair value of the instrument taken as a whole and the fair value of the debt component. The equity component thus determined and recognized at inception is not subsequently re-measured and remains in equity, even when the instrument is extinguished.\n\n'other  movements' in the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders' equity and amounted to 29 million euros in 2021, (2) million euros in 2020, and 51 million euros in 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These instruments are considered to be dilutive when they have the effect of reducing earnings per share of continuing operations.\n\nWhen basic earnings per share are negative, diluted earnings per share are identical to basic earnings per share. In the event of a capital increase at a price lower than the market price, and in order to ensure comparability of the reporting periods shown, the weighted average numbers of shares outstanding in current and previous periods are adjusted. Treasury shares owned, which are deducted from the consolidated equity, do not enter into the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Note 16   Unrecognized contractual commitments (telecom activities)\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Orange is not aware of having entered into any commitment involving entities controlled by the Group that may have a material effect on its current or future financial position, other than the commitments described in this note.\n\n## 16.1 Operating activities commitments\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                                 | Total   | Less than  one year   | From one to  five years More than five  years   | From one to  five years More than five  years   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Operating activities commitments                                       | 12,837  | 3,580                 | 5,840                                           | 3,417                                           |\n| Operating leases commitments                                           | 179     | 54                    | 85                                              | 40                                              |\n| Handsets purchase commitments                                          | 3,850   | 1,558                 | 2,286                                           | 6                                               |\n| Transmission capacity purchase commitments                             | 1,714   | 213                   | 519                                             | 982                                             |\n| Other goods and services purchase commitments                          | 4,635   | 1,190                 | 1,626                                           | 1,819                                           |\n| Investment commitments                                                 | 1,081   | 430                   | 640                                             | 10                                              |\n| Public initiative networks commitments  (1)                            | 82      | 14                    | 56                                              | 12                                              |\n| Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business | 1,296   | 120                   | 629                                             | 548                                             |\n\n- (1) Including unrecognized contractual commitments carried by Orange SA in the context of the deployment of the High and Very High Speed network in France.

They included 397\u00b0million\u00b0euros for the provision of satellite transmission capacity (the  term  of  these  commitments  extends  until  2026  depending on the contracts) as well as an agreement on the use of an FTTH network in Spain in the amount of 878 million euros.\n\n## Other goods and services purchase commitments\n\nThe  Group's  other  goods  and  services  purchase  commitments mainly relate to network maintenance and management, as well as the acquisition of content.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, these commitments include:\n\n- -commitments relating to the co-financed and leased lines for an amount of 950 million euros;\n- -the purchase of broadcasting rights for an amount of 685 million euros;\n- -energy purchase commitments for an amount of 555 million euros;\n- -hosting services for active equipment for mobile sites under a 'Built-to-suit' agreement for an amount of 435 million euros;\n- -site  management  service  contracts  ('TowerCos')  signed in  Africa:  the  amount  of  these  commitments  represents 337 million euros;\n- -the maintenance of submarine cables for which Orange has joint  ownership  or  user  rights,  for  an  amount  of  227  million euros;\n- -the network maintenance for an amount of 194 million euros;\n- -commitments to partners in the field of sports for an amount of 170 million euros.\n\n## Investment commitments\n\nAt the end of December 2021, investment commitments amounted to 1,081 million euros.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  commitments,  which  are  expressed  in monetary  terms,  the  Group  made  certain  commitments  to  the National Regulatory Authorities such as ensuring certain coverage of the population regarding fixed or mobile networks, particularly in the context of assignment of licenses and quality of service. These commitments will require investment expenditure in future years to roll out and enhance the networks. They are not shown in the table above if they have not been expressed in monetary terms, which is usually the case. The Group has accordingly agreed to meet the following conditions:\n\n## In France:\n\n- -the  obligations  included  in  the  authorization  to  use  5G frequencies  in  the  3.4-3.8  GHz  band  issued  to  Orange  on November 12,\u00b02020 are as follows:\n- -the  rollout  of  sites  (3,000  sites  by  the  end  of  2022, 8,000 sites by the end of 2024 and 10,500 sites by the end of 2025), of which 25% must be located in rural areas or industrial areas outside of very densely populated areas,\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8 GHz band or another band,\n- -the provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbps per sector from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of sites by the end of 2025, and 100% of sites by the end of 2030,\n- -coverage of the main highways by the end of 2025, major roads by the end of 2027,\n- -the provision of differentiated services and activation of the IPv6 network protocol (Internet Protocol version 6).\n\nIn addition, the commitments made by Orange to participate in the first stage of the procedure and which made it possible to obtain 50 MHz at a reserve price became obligations in the authorization issued:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange will have to provide a fixed offer from sites using the 3.5 GHz band and a fixed offer to cover the premises that benefit from fixed-access radio network services,\n- -Orange  will  have  to  meet  reasonable  requests  for  the provision of services from private sector companies and public  sector  structures,  provide  indoor  coverage,  offer hosting for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and be transparent about network failures and planned rollouts;\n- -pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  33-13  of  the  French Postal & Electronic Communications Code regarding coverage in lightly inhabited areas:\n- -Orange proposed that it commit to ensuring that, within its FTTH deployment scope in the AMII area, unless refused by  third  parties,  that  100%  of  homes  and  professional premises  would  have  access  to  FTTH  sales  offers  by the  end  of  2020  (including  a  maximum  8%  of  premises connectable  on  demand)  and  that  100%  of  homes  and professional  premises  would  be  made  connectable  by the end of 2022. Subsequent to the Arcep opinion, these proposals were accepted by the government in July 2018,\n- -outside of the AMII area, Orange proposed that it make deployment  commitments  regarding  AMEL  in  the Vienne,  Haute-Vienne,  Deux-S\u00e8vres  and  Lot-et-Garonne departments,\n- -lastly, Orange proposed to make commitments outside of the  AMII  and  AMEL  areas  in  the  following  departments: Orne,  Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es,  Yvelines,  Territoire-de-Belfort, Guadeloupe and Martinique;\n- -on January 14, 2018, the Orange Group and the other French mobile  operators  signed  an  agreement  (the  'New  Deal')  to ensure better mobile coverage of French territory, particularly rural  areas.  This  agreement  includes  enhanced  coverage obligations,  which  are  included  for  the  period  2018-2021  in our licenses in force in the bands 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz, and for the post 2021 period, in the new licenses for 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz awarded on November 15, 2018:\n- -targeted programs for the improvement of coverage, with the coverage of 5,000 areas by operator by 2029,\n- -the generalization of 4G by the end of 2020 on almost all existing mobile sites,\n- -the acceleration of the coverage of the transport routes, ensuring  that  the  main  road  and  rail  routes  have  4G coverage,\n- -the supply of a fixed 4G service and the extension of the service  to  500  additional  sites  upon  request  from  the government by 2020,\n- -the widespread use of telephone coverage inside buildings, proposing voice over Wi-Fi and SMS over Wi-Fi offers and offers  involving  the  indoor  coverage  of  buildings  upon request,\n- -the  improvement  of  reception  quality  throughout  the country,  particularly  in  rural  areas,  with  good  coverage (according  to  the  Arcep  decision  No.  2016-1678  relative to publications giving information on mobile coverage) by 2024-2027;\n- -in 2015, in France, when the frequencies in the 700 MHz band were allocated:\n- -coverage obligations in 'priority deployment areas' (40% of the country within 5 years, 92% within 12 years and 97.7% within 15 years) and in 'white area' not yet covered by a broadband network (100% within 12 years), at the level of priority road routes (100% within 15 years) and at the level",

Management believes that the Group has the ability to fulfill these commitments towards government authorities.\n\n## Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business\n\nCommitments  made  by  the  Group  to  third  parties  in  the ordinary  course  of  business  represented  1,296  million  euros  at December\u00b031,\u00b02021. They include 642 million euros of performance guarantees  granted  to  some  of  its  Enterprise  customers,  in particular in the context of network security and remote access.\n\nThe amount of guarantees granted by the Group to third parties (financial  institutions,  partners,  customers  and  government agencies) to cover the performance of the contractual obligations of non-consolidated entities is not significant. Guarantees granted by the Group to cover the performance of the contractual obligations of the consolidated subsidiaries are not considered as unrecognized contractual commitments, as they would not increase the Group's commitments in comparison to the underlying obligations of the consolidated subsidiaries.\n\n## 16.2 Consolidation scope commitments\n\n## Asset and liability warranties granted in relation to disposals\n\nUnder the terms of agreements between certain Group companies and the acquirers of certain assets, the Group is subject to warranty clauses  relating  to  assets  and  liabilities.  Nearly  all  material  sale agreements provide for ceilings on these warranties.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  main  warranties  in  effect  were  the following:\n\n- -the uncapped warranties granted to the EE joint venture when contributing the operations in the United Kingdom, concerning the restructuring of equity investments and assets done prior to the contribution expiring in 2022;\n- -a warranty given to BT as part of the EE sale, backed 50/50 by Orange Group and Deutsche Telekom as tax and operating warranties, except for events ascribable solely to one or the other,  and  capped  at  the  contractually  set  disposal  price  of 5.1\u00b0billion\u00b0pounds  sterling  (6.1  billion  euros  converted  at  the exchange rate at December 31, 2021) for Orange's share, which will expire in 2023;\n- -standard uncapped warranties granted to Vivendi as part of the additional disposal of Dailymotion (completed in 2017 for the remaining 10% of the share capital). These warranties will expire at the end of the statutory limitation period;\n- -warranties granted to the HIN consortium in connection with the disposal of Orange Concessions (50% of the capital sold in  2021), which will expire at the end of 12 months, with the exception  of  the  tax  and  fundamental  warranties,  which  will expire after 60 days and 3 years, respectively;\n- -warranties granted to the APG group in connection with the disposal of FiberCo Poland (50% of the capital sold in 2021), which will expire at the end of 18 months, with the exception of the tax and fundamental warranties, which will expire after 7 and 6 years, respectively;\n- -miscellaneous standard warranties granted to buyers of real estate sold by the Group.\n\nOrange believes that the risk of these warranties being enforced is remote and that the potential consequences of their being called are not material with respect to the Group's results and financial position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Nearly all material acquisition agreements provide for ceilings on these warranties.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  main  warranties  in  effect  were  the following:\n\n- -standard  and  specific  capped  warranties  obtained  from Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A. in connection with  the  acquisition  of  Telekom  Romania  Communications, which will expire on March 31, 2023 (with respect to the general representations and warranties) and September 30, 2028 (with respect to the fundamental warranties). Some specific capped allowances have also been obtained, for up to 10 years.\n\nOrange believes that the risk of all these warranties being enforced is remote and that the potential consequences of their being called are not material with respect to the Group's results and financial position.\n\n## Commitments relating to securities\n\nUnder the terms of agreements with third parties, Orange can make or receive commitments to purchase or to sell securities.

For instance, with regard to Orange Bank's other financial assets, since investments are managed by portfolio, only the transaction portfolios (financial assets at fair value through profit or loss) have been recognized in current financial assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These assets are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. All changes in fair value are recorded in profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss (FVOCI)\n\nEquity securities which are not consolidated or equity-accounted are, subject to exceptions, recognized as assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit or loss. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value and gains (losses) on disposals are recorded in other comprehensive income that may not be reclassified to profit/loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss (FVOCIR)\n\nAssets at fair value through other comprehensive income that are or may be reclassified to profit or loss mainly include investments in debt securities. They are recognized at fair value at inception and subsequently. Temporary changes in value are recorded in other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss. In case of disposal, the cumulative profit (or loss) recognized in other comprehensive income that may be reclassified to profit or loss is then reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n- -Financial assets at amortized cost (AC)\n\nThis  category  primarily  comprises  miscellaneous  loans  and  receivables  as  well  as  fixed-income  securities  held  with  the  aim of collecting contractual flows. These instruments are recognized at fair value at inception and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\n\nImpairment of financial assets\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, debt instruments classified as financial assets at amortized cost or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, rental receivables, financing commitments and financial guarantees given are systematically subject to impairment or a provision for expected credit loss. These impairments and provisions are recorded as soon as loans are granted, commitments are concluded or bond securities are acquired, without waiting for the appearance of an objective indication of impairment.\n\nTo do this, the financial assets concerned are split into three categories according to the change in credit risk observed since their initial recognition and a depreciation is recorded on the amount outstanding of each of these categories as follows:\n\n- -performing loans: the calculation of losses expected is made on a 12-months basis, and the financial income (interest) is calculated on the basis of the instrument's gross amount;\n- -impaired loans: if the credit risk has significantly worsened since the debt has been booked to the balance sheet, the expected losses, estimated over the duration of the loan, are recognized and the financial income (interest) is calculated based on the gross amount of the instrument;\n- -doubtful loans: the expected loss, estimated over the duration of the loan, is depreciated. The financial income is calculated on the basis of the amount of the instrument net of the depreciation.\n\n## 17.1.2 Financial liabilities related to Orange Bank transactions (excluding derivatives)\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                             | December 31,  2021   | December 31,  2020   | December 31,  2019   |    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----|\n| Payables to customers                                              | 1,796                | 1,883  (1)           | 3,357                |    |\n| Debts with financial institutions                                  | 1,009                | 885                  | 448                  |    |\n| Deposit certificate                                                | 356                  | 358                  | 475                  |    |\n| Other                                                              | 27                   | 30                   | 28                   |    |\n| Total Financial liabilities related to Orange Bank activities  (2) | 3,188                | 3,155                | 4,307                |    |\n\n- (1) The decrease on payables to customers between 2019 and 2020 is mainly due to the discontinuation of Groupama group companies' account-holding activities.\n- (2) Including 28 million euros of non-current financial liabilities in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

The fair value of these derivatives at December 31, 2021 was (0.07) million euros;\n- -210  million  euros  in  notional  value  hedging  a  portfolio  of French inflation-indexed fungible Treasury bonds (Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor index\u00e9es sur l'inflation fran\u00e7aise - OATi) of the same amount and maturity, i.e. 2023. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2021 was (39) million euros;\n- -150 million euros in notional value (of which 26 million euros maturing in 2022, 24 million euros maturing between one and two years and 100 million euros at more than five years), hedging  a  portfolio  of  French  fungible  Treasury  bonds (Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor - OAT) of the same amount and maturity. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2021 was 0.3 million euros;\n- -20 million euros in notional value hedging a portfolio of French Treasury bonds (Obligations Assimilables du Tr\u00e9sor index\u00e9es sur l'estimation - OATie)  indexed  to  inflation  of  the  same amount and maturity, i.e. 2030. The fair value of these swaps at December 31, 2021 was (6) million euros;\n- -5 million euros in notional value hedging a portfolio of securities maturing in 2028 whose fair value at December 31, 2021 was (0.3) million euros.\n\nThe ineffective portion of these hedges recognized in profit or loss in 2021 was not material.\n\n## Cash flow hedge derivatives\n\nAt January 1, 2020, Orange Bank had documented a micro-hedge of  its  issues  with  interest  rate  swaps  which,  at  the  end  of  2021, represented:\n\n- -218 million euros in notional value (of which 135 million euros maturing in 2022 and 83 million euros maturing between one and two years) hedging negotiable debt securities issued by the bank, the fair value of which at December 31, 2021 was almost zero.\n\n## Trading Derivatives\n\n- -Orange  Bank  has  set  up  interest  rate  swaps  as  economic hedges (not designated as hedges under IFRS) of EIB securities for a total notional amount of 10 million euros maturing in 2029, the fair value of which was (0.25) million euros at December 31, 2021. The net effects of this hedging strategy on the income statement are not material.\n\n- -Orange  Bank  has  a  portfolio  of  trading  swaps  with  a  total notional  value  of  28  million  euros  (of  which  18  million  euros maturing between two and five years and 10 million euros at more than five years) and a total fair value at December 31, 2021 of (0.4) million euros. The net effects of this hedging strategy on the income statement are not material.\n- -Orange Bank has set up interest rate futures with a notional amount  of  202  million  euros.  The  notional  amount  of  these derivatives gives only an indication of the volume of outstanding contracts  on  the  financial  instrument  markets  and  does  not reflect the market risks associated with such instruments or the nominal value of the hedged instruments. The net effects of this hedging strategy on profit or loss are not material.\n\n## 17.2 Information on market risk management with respect to Orange Bank activities\n\nOrange Bank has its own risk management system in accordance with banking regulations. In terms of banking regulation, Orange Bank is under the supervision of the French Prudential Supervision and  Resolution  Authority  (Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution - ACPR) and must at all times comply with capital requirements in order to withstand the risks associated with its activities.\n\nOrange Bank's activities expose it to all of the risks defined by the ordinance  of  November  3,  2014,  relating  to  the  internal  control of  companies  in  the  banking,  payment  services  and  investment services sector subject to the control of the ACPR:\n\n- -credit risk and counterparty risk: risk of loss incurred in the event of the default of a counterparty or counterparties considered as the same beneficiary;\n- -consolidation risk: risk arising from an excessive exposure to a counterparty, to a group of counterparties operating in the same economic sector or the same geographic area, or the application  of  credit  risk  reduction  techniques,  particularly collateral issued by a single entity;\n- -market risk: risk of loss due to movements in market prices;\n- -operational risk: risk resulting from an inadequacy or a failure due to procedures, staff, internal systems or to outside events, including events that are unlikely to occur but that would incur a high risk of loss. Operational risk includes risks of internal and external fraud and IT risk;\n- -interest rate risk: risk incurred in the event of changes in interest  rates  impacting  on-balance  sheet  and  off-balance sheet transactions, excluding, where applicable, transactions exposed to market risks;\n- -liquidity risk: risk that the company would not be able to meet its commitments or not be able to unwind or offset a position due to the market situation;",

For market operations, the Risk Department defines, on one hand, the limits implemented and controlled and, on the other hand, the quality of the authorized signatories.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Bank  has  defined  and  regularly  tests  its business  continuity  system.  The  Bank  has  also  undertaken,  as comprehensively as possible, the identification and assessment of its operational risks, for which it also monitors occurrences.\n\nIn  line  with  regulations,  and  in  particular  Titles  IV  and  V  of  the Ordinance of November 3, 2014, the bank's Executive Committee, upon recommendation of the Risk Management Department, sets the  institution's  risk  policy,  which  is  formalized  through  the  risk appetite framework and is guarantor of its proper implementation.\n\nThe Risk Management Department analyzes and monitors risks, carries out the necessary controls and produces reports for various committees:  The  Credit  Committee  (management  of  credit  and counterparty  risk),  Risks  and  Audit  Committee  (management  of operational risks), Financial Security and Compliance Committee (management  of  non-compliance  risk),  ALM  Committee (management of market, interest rate and liquidity risks) and the Executive Committee.\n\n## 17.2.1 Credit and counterparty risk management\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the health crisis, Orange Bank continued to maintain a cautious provisioning policy.\n\nIn France, Orange Bank reviewed its credit risk estimate by taking into account the uncertainties surrounding the economic situation due to the health crisis and considered that segment provisions (i.e. around 5 million euros on the hotel, commercial real estate and private bank loans) and the input stress measures (i.e. approximately 6 million euros on consumer credit) used to calculate provisions should be renewed.\n\nFurthermore,  the  retail  bank,  consumer  credit  and  demand accounts  asset  category,  is  a  statistical  method  for  calculating expected losses. In this respect, the inputs estimated internally by Orange Bank (probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD)) were back tested in 2021 in order to check the performance of the model in production and to take account of the new definition of default (NDOD) that came into force on January 1, 2021. These works led to the recalibrating of inputs for all products. The new recalibrated inputs take into account a more recent data history to estimate the probability of default and loss given default.\n\nTo  take  into  account  the  review  of  these  inputs,  a  provision  of 7 million euros was recognized at December 31, 2021, 6 million euros of which pertain to consumer credit and 1 million euros to demand deposit accounts.\n\nIn Spain, Orange Bank maintained its prudent provisioning policy on the receivables disposal program with Orange Spain. Thanks to a second year of production of short loans, Orange Bank has gained more  perspective,  leading  to  a  revision  of  its  provisioning  rates in 2021. This rates adjustment, based on a preliminary statistical\n\nstudy,  has  made  it  possible  to  estimate  new  risk  inputs  for  the calculation of expected loss, more conservative than the hedging rates recommended by the Bank of Spain on the consumer credit asset category. In this respect, an additional provision of 8 million euros was recognized at December 31, 2021. With a view to 2022, works are in progress for a finer analysis and to build statistical models enhanced with data from ongoing observations of portfolio behavior.\n\nAt end-December 2021, cost of risk for Orange Bank amounted to  38  million  euros  (i.e.  1.7%  of  average  outstanding)  of  which 14 million euros in France (i.e. 0.8% of average outstanding) and 24 million euros in Spain (i.e. 7% of average outstanding).\n\nExcluding methodological adjustments, cost of risk would amount to 23 million euros (i.e. 1% of average outstanding) of which 7 million euros in France (i.e. 0.4% of average outstanding) and 16 million euros in Spain (i.e. 4.6% of average outstanding).\n\n## 17.2.2 Market and interest rate risk management\n\nOrange Bank does not carry out  trading  operations  on  its  own behalf, its market activity mainly concerns investments to optimize liquidity management and purchases of interest rate hedges.\n\nThe outstanding securities portfolio continues to decrease in line with the bank's strategy, market risk indicators remain almost stable and the associated risks are immaterial.\n\nFixed  interest  securities  in  investment  portfolios  are  hedged.  At December  2021,  28%  of  investment  portfolio  securities  had  a maturity below one year. Orange Bank has no exposure classified in trading portfolio. Interest rate risk, after the capital increase that occurred in October 2021, is less than 5% of CET1. The basic risk is immaterial.\n\nOrange Bank finalized  its  transition  plan  from  Eonia  benchmark indices toward \u20acster (iBor) in 2021; the novation of contracts with the bank counterparties was carried out and the documentation of updated hedging relations.\n\n## 17.2.3 Liquidity risk management\n\nIn 2021, Orange Bank continued to prudently manage its liquidity. At December 2021, Net Funding Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 137% and LCR (short-term liquidity coverage ratio) ratio reached 1,033%. Nevertheless, 2021 was characterized by the increase in the liquidity deficit associated with customer operations. The latter rose from (300) million euros in early 2021 to (650) million euros at  December  2021.  The  changes  in  this  deficit  can  be  mainly explained by loan production while customer deposits are down, due to the extinctive management of certain portfolios (especially the enterprise activity).\n\nOrange Bank intensified the diversification of its financing sources and in order to anticipate loan production growth and the slowdown of TLTRO programs of the ECB.\n\n## 17.2.4 Operational risk management\n\nAt bank level, the operational risk guidance scope covers:\n\n- -operational  risks  carried  by  all  the  bank's  activities (management, operating and support activities);\n- -operational risks from essential service providers.\n\nOperational  risk  is  managed  by  the  Permanent  Control  and Operational Risk Director who reports to the Risk, Controls and Compliance Director, who in turn is directly under the authority of an Orange Bank effective manager.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Incidents  are reported as soon as they are detected by all bank employees in a dedicated IT tool.\n\nIn the event of the identification of non-compliance incidents, the operational risks department notifies the compliance department to ensure monitoring and management of such incidents.\n\nThe  operational  losses  sustained  by  the  bank  amounted  to 1.3 million euros in 2021. They amounted to 1.4 million euros in 2020 and 1.3 million euros in 2019. The bulk of operational losses were related to external fraud (means of payment and credit).\n\n## 17.2.5 Non-compliance risk management\n\nOrange  Bank  has  a  Compliance  department,  which  reports  to the Risk, Control and Compliance director. In addition, the bank is  equipped  with  a  system  that  enables  it  to  guarantee  regular monitoring of changes that may occur in the texts applicable to its  activity.  The  presentation  of  major  regulatory  amendments  is also carried out in the Compliance, Financial Security and Fraud Committees.\n\nThe Financial Security and Compliance Committee meets every quarter to examine the actions and situation of bank with respect to compliance, in particular in the light of its customer protection obligations.\n\nThe Human Resources Department training unit, in conjunction with the compliance unit, handles the establishing and monitoring of employee training procedures, the foundation of the compliance system.  Mandatory  training  programs  are  organized  for  all  new arrivals.  In  2021,  105  new  employees  participated  in  mandatory training  provided  in  person  (or  via  video  conference  due  to  the COVID crisis) by the Compliance Manager.\n\nFurthermore,  training  programs  dedicated  to  mortgages  and  to consumer credit and to the claims management system are given to the employees concerned.\n\nLastly,  the  compliance  unit  contributes  its  expertise  in  the preparation of answers to address sensitive customer complaints as well as those sent to us directly the supervisory authorities.\n\n## 17.2.6 Remaining term to maturity\n\nThe following table details the remaining terms of Orange Bank's financial  assets  and  liabilities,  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the contractual maturity dates:\n\n- -maturity-by-maturity for amortizable transactions;\n- -for  roll-over  loans,  since  renewals  cannot  be  presumed,  the renewal dates are taken to be the final maturity dates;\n- -since derivatives are interest rate swaps, they are not subject to any exchange of notional. Their fair value has been broken down by maturity.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                       | Note   | December 31,  2021   | 2022   | 2023 to 2026   | 2027 and  beyond   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|----------------------|--------|----------------|--------------------|\n| Investments securities                       | 17.1.1 | 3                    | -      | 3              | -                  |\n| Debt securities                              | 17.1.1 | 441                  | 127    | 307            | 8                  |\n| Investments at fair value                    | 17.1.1 | -                    | -      | -              | -                  |\n| Fixed-income securities                      | 17.1.1 | 387                  | 80     | 160            | 147                |\n| Loans and receivables to customers           | 17.1.1 | 2,297                | 586    | 1,058          | 653                |\n| Loans and receivables to credit institutions | 17.1.1 | 66                   | 66     | -              | -                  |\n| Other financial assets and derivatives       |        | 74                   | 60     | -              | 14                 |\n| Total financial assets                       |        | 3,268                | 918    | 1,528          | 822                |\n| Payable to customers                         | 17.1.2 | 1,796                | 1,796  | -              | -                  |\n| Debts with financial institutions            | 17.1.2 | 1,009                | 346    | 663            | -                  |\n| Deposit certificate                          | 17.1.2 | 356                  | 273    | 83             | -                  |\n| Other financial liabilities and derivatives  |        | 87                   | 1      | 53             | 33                 |\n| Total financial liabilities                  |        | 3,247                | 2,416  | 799            | 33                 |\n\n## 17.2.7 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities of Orange Bank\n\n| (in millions of euros)                                   | Note   | Classification     | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021     | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                          |        | under  IFRS 9  (1) | Book value          | Estimated  fair value | Level 1   and cash  | Level 2             | Level 3             |\n| Loans and receivables                                    | 17.1.1 | AC                 | 2,363               | 2,363                 | -                   | 2,363               | -                   |\n| Financial assets at  amortized cost                      | 17.1.1 | AC                 | 387                 | 387                   | 387                 | -                   | -                   |\n| Financial assets at fair value  through profit or loss   | 17.1.1 | FVR                | 73                  | 73                    | 73                  | -                   | -                   |\n| Debt securities                                          | 17.1.1 | FVOCIR             | 441                 | 441                   | 441                 | -                   | -                   |\n| Investments securities                                   | 17.1.1 | FVOCI              | 3                   | 3                     | 3                   | -                   | -                   |\n| Cash and cash equivalent  (2)                            | 17.1   | AC                 | 360                 | 360                   | 360                 | -                   | -                   |\n| Financial liabilities related  to Orange Bank activities | 17.1.2 | AC                 | (3,188)             | (3,188)               | -                   | (3,188)             | -                   |\n| Derivatives (net amount)  (3)                            | 17.1.3 |                    | (58)                | (58)                  | -                   | (58)                | -                   |",

These disputes are described, respectively, in Notes 6.2 and 10.3, as appropriate.\n\nAt  December 31, 2021, the provisions for risks recorded by the Group for all the disputes (except those presented in Notes 6.2 and 10.3) amounted to 405 million euros (versus 525 million euros at December 31, 2020 and 643 million euros at December 31, 2019). Orange believes that any disclosure of the amount of provisions on a case-by-case basis for ongoing disputes could seriously harm the Group's position. The balance and overall movements on provisions are presented in Note 5.2.\n\n## France\n\n## Mobile services\n\n- -In parallel to the judicial inquiry for which a final decision was handed down on December 17, 2015 a final verdict was reached by the French Competition Authority fining Orange 350 million euros for having implemented four anti-competitive practices in the 'Enterprise' market segment and imposing injunctions, SFR brought an action on June 18, 2015, for damages suffered because  of  Orange's  practices.  After  several  successive increases in April 2016 and September 2018, SFR raised its claim to 3 billion euros in July 2019. In the wake of this decision, C\u00e9leste and Adista also brought actions against Orange before the  Paris  Commercial  Court  for  damages.  Orange  and  SFR entered into a memorandum of understanding, notably putting an end to their dispute. SFR withdrew its claim for damages from  the  Paris  Commercial  Court  which  duly  noted  this withdrawal on April 2, 2021. This dispute is now closed. The investigation of the cases of C\u00e9leste and Adista versus Orange are ongoing. To date, the overall claims of C\u00e9leste and Adista represent a total of 47 million euros.\n- -Concurrently  to  their  complaints  filed  with  the  French Competition Authority, regarding the practices of Orange in the mobile and fixed-to-mobile markets in the French Caribbean and in French Guiana, for which Orange received a definitive sentence, Digicel and Outremer Telecom initiated before the Paris  Commercial  Court  legal  actions  for  alleged  damages stemming from these practices. After being sentenced by the Paris  Commercial  Court  in  March  2015,  the  Paris  Court  of Appeal decreased the amount of the fine to be paid to Outremer Telecom to 3 million euros in May 2017, noting inter alia that the  damages  should  be  discounted  at  the  statutory  rate  of interest. On December 18, 2017 the Paris Commercial Court ordered Orange to pay Digicel the sum of 180 million euros, to which should be added interest calculated from March 2009 until the date of payment at a higher interest rate than the rate ordered by the Paris Court of Appeal in the Outremer Telecom litigation, i.e. a total amount of 346 million euros. On June 17, 2020, the Paris Court of Appeal overturned judgment and in particular the discounting method applied to the damages set forth in the judgment rendered by the Paris Commercial Court on December 18, 2017, which ordered Orange to pay Digicel 180 million euros in principal. Following this judgment, Orange was refunded 97 million euros. Orange appealed to the French\n\nSupreme Court and re-assessed the risk related to the possible reversal of the Court of Appeal's judgment, which would return the parties to the situation following the first-instance court's decision.\n\n## Fixed services\n\n- -In  2010,  SFR  and  then  Verizon  summoned  Orange  SA  to appear  before  the  Paris  Commercial  Court  demanding  the reimbursement  of  alleged  overpayments  on  interconnection services  provided  by  Orange,  the  price  of  which  allegedly did not reflect their cost. On June 18 and 25, 2013, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed their claims but ordered Orange to  pay  Verizon  1  million  euros  in  damages  with  respect  to services provided in 2008. Orange paid this amount in 2013. SFR  and  Verizon  filed  appeals  against  these  decisions.  In December  2015,  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  dismissed  in full  the  claims  made  by  SFR  and  in  September  2017,  the French Supreme Court rejected SFR's appeal. Furthermore, in  April  2017,  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  dismissed  Verizon completely and reversed the compensation of 1 million euros granted for services provided in 2008. On June 5, 2019, the French Supreme Court annulled the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal and restored the parties to the situation they were in  following  the  first  instance  court's  decision  rendered  on June 25, 2013. The proceedings are still ongoing.\n- -In 2012, SFR brought an action against Orange SA before the Paris  Commercial  Court  denouncing  its  retail  offers  for  the secondary residences market. In February 2014, the trial court ruled  that  Orange  had  abused  its  dominant  position  but  in Octoberr 2014, the Paris Appeal Court annulled this ruling. This decision was then overturned by the French Supreme Court in 2016 and Orange had to pay 53 million euros to SFR pursuant to the trial court's ruling. SFR had raised its claims to 257 million euros before the Court of Appeal. In 2018, the Court of Appeal sentenced Orange to pay 54 million euros and Orange appealed to  the  French  Supreme Court. On September 16, 2020, the French Supreme Court overturned the judgment handed down by the Court of Appeal and restored the parties to the situation they were in following the Paris Commercial Court's decision. Orange applied to the Court of Appeal and obtained through a ruling on September 24, 2021, a reversal of its conviction and the return of the full amount of the sums awarded to SFR, which SFR returned at the end of 2021. SFR appealed to the French Supreme Court again on October 5, 2021.\n- -On April 16, 2021, Bouygues Telecom brought an action against Orange  before  the  Paris  Civil  Court  concerning  the  service quality  of  its  wholesale  offers  for  an  amount  of  78  million  of euros for alleged losses. Orange considers these claims to be without merit.\n\n## Other proceedings in France\n\n- -In  June  2018,  Iliad  brought  summary  proceedings  against Orange SA before the presiding judge of the Paris Commercial Court,  aiming  to  ban  some  of  its  mobile  telephony  offers proposing mobile handsets at attractive prices accompanied by  a  subscription  package,  on  the  grounds  that  they constituted consumer credit offers. The case is currently being investigated by the judges deciding on the merits of the case.",

The  Phones  4U  claim (of an unquantified amount) is currently being disputed before the  High  Court  of  England  and  Wales.  Orange  vigorously challenges the allegations raised by Phones 4U which include collusion between various operators.\n- -Orange Bank is the  object  of  two  historic  lawsuits  whereby the plaintiffs claim in total about 350 million euros in financial damages that they allege to have suffered. In March 2021, the plaintiffs in one of these two lawsuits withdrew from the case. Orange Bank continues to be the target of the other lawsuit whereby the plaintiffs  are  claiming  in  total  about  310  million euros in financial damages that they allege to have suffered. As the Group believes these claims to be without merit and is strenuously contesting them, it has not recognized any financial liability.\n- -In August  2020,  ASSIA  brought  proceedings  against Orange SA before the Paris Civil Court for infringement of two dynamic xDSL line management patents. ASSIA claims a total of around 500 million euros for the financial damage it claims to have suffered. Orange SA considers its claims to be unfounded and  challenges  them.  The  proceedings  are  currently  being examined by the judges deciding on the merits of the case.\n- -The  Evaluation  and  Compensation  Committee,  set  up  as part  of  the  France  Telecom  employee-related  crisis  trial,  to examine individual claims submitted by individuals present in the company between 2007 and 2010 and their beneficiaries, extended  the  period  for  submitting  files  until  December  31, 2020. This Committee is continuing to analyze and process the  requests  received.  At  the  end  of  December  2021, 1,751  individual  requests  had  been  received,  about  1,100  of which had been closed subsequent to an agreement and just under 300 requests are being processed. The Committee is expected to finish its work by the first half of 2022.\n\n## Poland\n\n- -In 2013, the UOKiK opened an investigation on the country's three  main  mobile  operators,  including  Orange  Polska,  for abuse of a dominant position in relation with the retail rates imposed by these three operators on the calls made to the network of the Polish operator P4. On January 2, 2018, UOKiK halted proceedings against the three operators due to no basis on anti-competitive grounds.\n- -In  addition, in 2015 P4 issued two claims for damages for a total  amount of 630 million zlotys (138 million euros) against the  three  operators  jointly  (one  of  which  Polkomtel),  as compensation for the loss it alleged to have suffered in relation to the contested pricing practices. In 2018, the Court of First Instance  dismissed  in  its  entirety  the  first  P4  compensation claim in the amount of 316 million zlotys (70 million euros). P4 has appealed against this decision. On December 28, 2020, the Court of Appeal dismissed the judgment rendered by the Court of First Instance and referred the parties to the Court of First  Instance. On August 25, 2021, Orange Polska received the ruling from the Appeal Court. Polkomtel (one of the three operators) has appealed to the Supreme Court. Orange Polska has joined the Polkomtel lawsuit. Regarding the second claim for damages by P4 for 314 million zlotys (69 million euros), it has been suspended pending the settlement of the first claim.\n\n## Romania\n\n- -On  March  29,  2016,  investigators  from  the  Romanian Competition Council made an investigation at the headquarters of  Orange  Romania,  concerning  possible  discriminatory practices  in  the  mobile  payment  and  advertising  markets. Following  the  investigation, the Competition  Council fined  Orange  Romania  65  million  leu  (13  million  euros)  in December  2018  for  refusal  to  sell  on  the  relevant  markets. Orange Romania was notified of this decision which it appealed in May 2019. On June 24, 2021, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Competition Council. The Parties are still awaiting the notification of the ruling.\n\n## Middle East and Africa\n\n- -A number of shareholder disputes are ongoing between the joint venture comprising Agility and Orange, on the one hand, and its Iraqi co-shareholder in the capital of the Iraqi operator Korek Telecom, on the other. These disputes, which concern various  breaches  of  contractual  documents,  are  the  subject of  pre-contentious  proceedings  and  arbitral  and  judicial proceedings in  various  countries.  In  addition,  on  March  19, 2019, following an administrative decree adopted by the Iraqi Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry,  the  General  Directorate  of Companies  in  Erbil  (Iraqi  Kurdistan)  implemented  the  2014 decision of the Iraqi regulatory authority (CMC) to cancel the partnership  dated  March  2011  between  the  operator  Korek Telecom, Agility and Orange and to restore the shareholding of Korek Telecom as it existed before Orange and Agility had acquired a stake. As a result, the registration of Korek Telecom shares in the name of the original shareholders was imposed without any compensation or reimbursement of the amounts invested.  Orange  thus  considers  that  it  was  thus  unlawfully expropriated of its investment and, on March 24, 2019, sent a notice of dispute to the Republic of Iraq based on the Bilateral lnvestment Treaty between France and Iraq. In the absence of an amicable settlement with the Iraqi State, Orange submitted a  request for  arbitration  with  the  International  Center  for  the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) on October 2, 2020.\n- -In Jordan, the telecom operator Zain brought an action against Jordan  Telecommunications  Company  (Orange  Jordan)  for failure to open geographical numbers allocated by the Jordanian regulator  in  application  of  the  interconnection  agreement entered into Zain and Orange Jordan pursuant to which Zain considers that it has suffered an estimated loss of 250 million Jordanian dinars (288 million euros). On September 30, 2021, the Amman Court of First Instance (judiciary order) ordered the performance of a forensic audit to verify whether the amount of the late payment interest requested by Zain had been calculated in  accordance  with  the  rules  detailed  in  the  interconnection agreement and whether the arbitration clause in the agreement was  applicable.  On  June  22,  2021,  the  Jordanian  Supreme Court ruled on the petition by Orange Jordan for the judiciary courts to decline jurisdiction, considering that the arbitration clause applied to the lawsuit. This ruling was confirmed by the Appeal  Court  on  November  11,  2021  which  rejected  Zain's petition. Zain has filed another appeal with the Supreme Court. The proceedings are ongoing.\n- -In  Mali,  a  lawsuit  had  been  brought  against  the  telecoms operators to challenge the billing of communications ending up on voicemail. In 2013, the Court of First Instance had dismissed the case of the plaintiffs, and the Malian Regulatory Authority (AMRTP) confirmed the compliance of this billing. At the end of 2021, following an appeal by the plaintiffs, the Bamako Court of Appeal sentenced the telecoms operators, and in particular Orange Mali to pay the sum of 176 million euros. Orange Mali has filed several appeals against this decision, on the one hand on the grounds of the foreclosure period of the appeal, and on the other hand for illegality and annulment of the appeal. As the ruling has been notified, Orange Mali has filed an appeal with the Malian Supreme Court.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It is engaged in both operational activities and subsidiary financing activities for the Orange group. The Company provides its B2C and B2B customers and other telecommunication operators with a wide range of services including fixed telephony and mobile telecommunications, data transmission, Internet and multimedia, and other value-added services.\n\nThe Company's purpose, as laid down in Article 2 of the Bylaws, is as follows: 'As a trusted partner, Orange gives everyone the keys to a responsible digital world.'\n\nOrange SA is governed by French law on public limited companies (soci\u00e9t\u00e9s anonymes),  subject  to  specific  laws  governing  the\n\n## Note 2 Significant events\n\n## 2.1 Changes in accounting method\n\n## Rules on the assessment and accounting of pension and similar benefits\n\nOn November 5, 2021, the French Accounting Standards Authority (ANC) amended its recommendation No. 2013-02, introducing the possibility to choose between two accounting methods for rights to benefits related to plans granting a benefit to employees who are still employed by the company on their retirement date, which is capped at a maximum amount and conditional upon a minimum period of time working for the company.\n\nThis amendment follows the decision of the IFRS IC, published on May 24, 2021, for this type of plan, that no rights are acquired in the event of departure before retirement age and that the rights are capped after a certain number of years of seniority ('X'); as a result the commitment is only recognized for the last X years of the employee's career with the company.\n\nBased  on  the  amended  ANC  2013-02  recommendation,  the company  decided,  from  January  1,  2021,  to  allocate  rights  to benefits under this type of plan on a straight-line basis from the date from which each year of service is used for the acquisition of  such  rights,  i.e.  the  date  before  which  the  services  provided by the employee do not affect either the amount or expiration of the benefits. In the past, the commitment was recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee's career with the company.\n\nThis  change  in  accounting  method  reduces  the  amount  of commitments recorded at December 31, 2020, in the amount of (218) million euros.\n\nFrom January 1, 2021, the company also decided to systematically recognize the full amount of:\n\n- -actuarial gains and losses generated over the income statement period;  previously,  in  accordance  with  the  option  permitted under recommendation ANC 2013-02, Orange SA applied the corridor method, which permitted it to defer the recognition in the income statement of actuarial gains and losses, and to only recognize them when their cumulative amount reached the threshold of 10% of the amount of commitments; and\n- -past service cost recognized over the income statement period.\n\nThe amount of unrecognized actuarial losses at December 31, 2020 was 318 million euros, and that of unrecognized past service cost was (4) million euros.\n\nThese two changes in method introduced by the company result in  improved financial information with a view to harmonizing the\n\nCompany,  particularly  French  law  No.  90-568  of  July  2,  1990 relating to the organization of public postal and telecommunication services, and Government Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 on  the  governance  and  capital  transactions  of  companies  with public shareholding. Orange SA is also regulated by its Bylaws.\n\nThe activities of the Company are governed primarily by European Union  directives  and  by  the  French  Postal  and  Electronic Communications  Code  (Code  fran\u00e7ais  des  postes  et  des communications \u00e9lectroniques).\n\nOrange SA has been listed since 1997 on Euronext Paris (symbol: ORA) and on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol: ORAN).\n\naccounting  methods  used  in  the  individual  financial  statements and the  accounting  methods  used  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nAs a result of these three changes in method, Orange SA adjusted upward the amount of its provision for pension and similar benefits at  December  31,  2020,  for  a  net  amount  of  96  million  euros, recognized as retained earnings at January 1, 2021.\n\n## 2.2 Business reorganization operations\n\nThe 2021 fiscal year was marked by the following three operations:\n\n- -on November 1, 2021, Orange SA transferred to Totem France its  business  segment  for  the  operation  of  passive  sites  and infrastructure throughout mainland France with the capacity to host one or several mobile or terrestrial operators from high points, representing a portfolio of towers comprising around 19,700 sites in France.\n\n## Purposes and aims of the partial contribution of assets\n\nElectronic communications operators are increasingly resorting to the pooling of infrastructure to meet their coverage needs, which favors the creation of economic players offering the provision of mobile network passive infrastructure services.\n\nIn  this  context,  it  was  deemed  opportune  to  separate  from other Orange SA activities those related to the operation of high points  throughout  mainland  France,  with  a  view  to  facilitating the  management  and  development  of  the  business  segment transferred and creating a driver for growth and profitability for both companies, particularly  through  the  creation  of  operational  and commercial synergies.\n\nThe  operation  therefore  transforms  Orange  SA's  approach  to the running of its operator model, by improving commercial and operational  excellence  thanks  to  a  dedicated  structure.  It  also increases the number of operators cohabiting a single high point to multiply growth opportunities. Finally, there is greater opportunity to highlight the value of the business in a dedicated structure, to illustrate the Orange group's ambitions in the passive infrastructure field.\n\nAs part of this operational and strategic reorganization, Orange SA therefore transferred to the company Totem France, a wholly owned subsidiary of Orange SA at the time of the contribution, all of the assets and liabilities attached to the business segment transferred and  which  constitute  a  complete  and  autonomous  business segment within the meaning Article 210 B of the French General Tax Code.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This amount mainly comprises an income tax expense of (479) million euros and income from tax consolidation of 91 million euros accruing to Orange SA, the parent company of the  tax  consolidation  group,  and  tax  credits  in  the amount of 54 million euros.\n\nOrange  SA  has  elected  for  Group  tax  consolidation  relief  with various subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the tax consolidation group comprised 60 companies (73 companies at December 31, 2020).\n\nThe Company's net future tax relief reflects an amount in the order of 390 million euros at December 31, 2021, (231 million euros at December 31, 2020), which is primarily linked to the provision for employee benefits. This relief will mainly be applied over the period from 2022 to 2030.\n\n## Developments in tax disputes and audits\n\n## Tax audits\n\nOrange SA was the subject of tax audits for the years 2017 and 2018 for which the total amount of adjustments notified in 2021 amounts to  430  million  euros  (default  penalties  and  interest  included). These adjustments mainly relate to the calculation of VAT on digital offerings, tax on electronic communications services on the same\n\ndigital  offerings,  research  tax  credit,  tax  on  television  services, trademark fees paid by Orange SA to the British company Orange Brand Services Ltd, for reasons similar to the adjustments notified during the previous audits and the reconsideration of previous tax loss carryforwards charged for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.\n\nAll of these adjustments are contested by Orange SA. In accordance with its accounting policies, the Group makes a best estimate of the risk of these adjustments based on the technical merits of the positions defended.\n\nOrange SA was subject to a tax audit covering fiscal years 2015 and  2016.  An  amending  proposal  was  issued  in  2019  covering the calculation of trademark fees paid by Orange SA to the British company Orange Brand Services Ltd and deducted from its taxable income. The administration questions the inclusion of revenue from the roaming contract with Free and revenue from the fixed PSTN business.  This  rectification  request  is  contested  by  Orange  SA, which  has  requested  the  opening  of  out-of-court  proceedings and arbitration between the French and British tax authorities. The additional tax charge would effectively result in double taxation that would fail to comply with the provisions of the Franco-British tax agreement and the European arbitration agreement.\n\n## Tax disputes\n\nThere were no major developments in other tax disputes over the period.\n\n## Note 4 Notes on the balance sheet - assets\n\n## 4.1 Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\n## 4.1.1 Intangible  assets\n\n| (in millions of euros)                        | 2021    | 2020    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Net book value in the opening balance         | 27,455  | 26,700  |\n| Acquisitions                                  | 1,201   | 1,919   |\n| of which licenses  (1)                        | 265     | 877     |\n| of which trademarks, patents and software     | 769     | 769     |\n| of which development costs                    | 218     | 217     |\n| Depreciation, amortization and impairment     | (1,223) | (1,167) |\n| Net impact of Totem France contributions  (2) | (2)     | -       |\n| Other items                                   | (9)     | 3       |\n| Net book value in the closing balance         | 27,422  | 27,455  |\n\n- (2) See Note 2.2 Business reorganization operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It  includes  in  particular the  activities  in  Spain  (excluding  passive  infrastructure management), Romania (99% owned), Slovakia and Belgium (78% owned at the end of 2021 following the public tender offer for Orange Belgium securities);\n- -the value in use of the Orange Participations (OPA) securities consists of the share of values in use of its directly and indirectly held operating subsidiaries, plus the cash held by OPA and its intermediate holding companies. It mainly includes activities carried out in the Africa & Middle East region, grouped within the Orange Middle East and Africa (OMEA) intermediary holding company, banking activities in France, as well as activities in the  Public  Initiative  Networks  (through  Orange  Concessions securities held);\n- -the  value  in  use  of  the  Orange  Polska  securities  comprises Orange SA's share (50.7%) in the enterprise value of Poland, less the net debt of the Orange Polska group;\n- -the  value  in  use  of  the  securities  of  Orange  Brand  Services Limited  (OBSL)  consists  of  the  value  in  use  of  the  Orange brand, plus the cash held by OBSL;\n- -the value in use of the Orange Business Services SA (OBS SA) securities consists of the share of values in use of its directly and indirectly held operating subsidiaries, plus the cash held by OBS SA and its intermediate holding companies. It mainly includes consulting, IT integration and business services for companies in the fields of data, digital, customer experience, connectivity,  Internet  of  Things  (IoT),  Cloud  Computing  and cybersecurity.\n\n## Key assumptions used to determine value in use\n\nIn 2021, the Group updated its strategic plan during the first half (for the period 2021-2025). Accordingly, new business plans were prepared.\n\nThe key operating assumptions used to determine values in use are common across all of the Group's business segments. These assumptions include:\n\n- -key  revenue  assumptions,  which  reflect  market  level, penetration  rate  of  the  offers  and  market  share,  positioning of  the  competition's  offers  and  their  potential  impact  on market price levels and their transposition to the Group's offer bases,  regulatory  authority  decisions  on  pricing  of  services to  customers  and  on  access  and  pricing  of  inter-operator services, technology migration of networks (e.g. extinction of copper  local  loops),  decisions  of  competition  authorities  in terms of concentration or regulation of adjacent sectors such as cable;\n\n- -key  cost  assumptions,  on  the  level  of  marketing  expenses required to deal with the pace of product line renewals and the positioning of the competition, the ability to adjust costs to potential changes in revenues or the effects of natural attrition and employee departure plans underway;\n- -key assumptions on the level of capital expenditure, which may be affected by the rollout of new technologies, by decisions of  regulatory  authorities  relating  to  licenses  and  spectrum allocation,  deployment  of  fiber  networks,  mobile  network coverage, sharing of network elements or obligations to open up networks to competitors.\n\nThese  key  operational  assumptions  reflect  past  experience  and expected  trends:  unforeseen  changes  have  in  the  past  had  a significant  effect  on  expectations  and  may  continue  to  affect expectations in the future.\n\nThe discount  rates  and  perpetual  growth  rates used  to determine the values in use were revised as follows at the end of December 2021:\n\n- -the discount rates (which may incorporate a specific premium reflecting an assessment of the performance risks of certain business plans or country risks) experienced a slight increase as a result, on one hand, of the revision of one of their calculation parameters during the second half of 2021, and on the other hand, of the recognition of a precaution on the Enterprise scope with a view to integrating the effects of the accelerated decline in fixed voice into the valuation used at December 31, 2021;\n- -perpetual growth rates were maintained in most regions, with the effects of the health crisis not leading to any change in the long-term outlook of the service markets offered by the Group.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  business  plans  and  key  operating assumptions were sensitive to the following:\n\n- -the  consequences  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic:  deterioration in  the  situation  compared  to  December  31,  2020  in  certain geographical  areas  in  terms  of  the  return  to  an  economic situation deemed normal (such as in Spain or Romania);\n- -the  tradeoffs  to  be  made  by  regulatory  and  competition authorities  between  reducing  prices  to  consumers  and stimulating  business  investment,  or  in  terms  of  rules  for awarding 5G operating licenses or market concentration;\n- -the  fiercely  competitive  nature  of  the  markets  in  which  the Group operates, where price pressure is strong, particularly in Spain;\n- -the Group's ability to adjust costs and capital expenditure to changes in revenue;\n- -and specifically in the Middle East and the Maghreb (Jordan, Egypt,  Tunisia)  as  well  as  in  some  African  countries  (Mali, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic, Sierra  Leone  and  Burkina  Faso):  changes  in  the  political situation and security with their resulting negative economic impacts on the overall business climate.",

This authorization is granted for a period of 18  months  as  from  the  aforementioned  Shareholders'  Meeting. The 2021 Buyback Program is described in the Orange Universal Registration  Document  (URD)  filed  with  the  French  Financial Markets  Authority  (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) on March 17, 2021.\n\nDuring the fiscal year, Orange bought treasury shares, for a net amount  of  188  million  euros,  and  allocated  the  majority  to  the\n\nbeneficiaries  of  the  'Together  2021'  Employee  Offering.

Civil servants  employed  by  Orange  SA  are  covered  by  the government-sponsored  civil  and  military  pension  plan. Orange SA's obligation under the plan is limited to the payment of annual contributions (French law No. 96-660 dated July 26, 1996).  Consequently,  Orange  SA  has  no  obligation  to  fund future deficits of the pension plans covering its own civil servant employees or any other civil service plans;\n- -Orange SA also provides a defined-benefit plan in the form of annuities for Senior Management in the amount of 188 million euros. The plan assets of this plan were transferred. For several years now, this plan has been closed to new members;\n- -Orange SA is also committed, in the amount of 682 million euros for private sector employees and 23 million euros for civil servants, to capital-based defined-benefit plans : under the laws of some countries or contractual agreements, employees are  entitled  to  certain  lump-sum  payments  or  bonuses  on retirement  depending  on  their  years  of  service  and  end  of career salary;\n- -other post-employment benefits are also granted to retired employees: these are benefits other than defined-benefit and defined-contribution plans;\n- -other  long-term  benefits may  also  be  granted  such  as seniority awards, long-term compensated absences and the French part-time for seniors plans (TPS) detailed below.\n\n## French part-time for seniors plans\n\nAs part of the renegotiation of the intergenerational agreement, a new French part-time for seniors plan was signed on December 17, 2021, resulting in the recognition of a liability of 1,197 million euros.\n\nThe part-time for seniors plans are accessible to civil servants and employees under private contract from the French entities who are\n\neligible for full retirement benefits by January 1, 2028 at the latest, and who have at least 15 years' service within the Group.\n\nThese plans give employees the opportunity to work 50% or 60% of a full-time job while receiving:\n\n- -a base salary between 65% and 80% of full-time employment;\n- -the  retirement  entitlement  benefits  of  full-time  employment during  the  period  in  question  (both  the  Company's  and  the employee's contributions);\n- -a minimum salary level.\n\nThese plans last for a period of at least 18 months and no longer than five years.\n\nThe  beneficiaries  may  decide  to  invest  part  of  their  base compensation  (5%,  10%  or  15%)  in  a  Time  Savings  Account (CET), with an additional Group contribution. The CET allows for a reduction in the amount of time worked.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  number  of  employees  who  are  or will  be  participating  in  the  French  part-time  for  seniors  plans and thus included in the provision, is estimated approximately at 11,900 employees.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021,  the  provision  for  TPS  was  1,686  million euros (versus 791 million euros at December 31, 2020).\n\n## Key assumptions used to calculate the amount of obligations\n\nThe assessment of post-employment benefits and other long-term benefits  is  based  on  retirement  age  calculated  in  accordance with  the  provisions  applicable  to  each  plan  and  the  necessary conditions to ensure entitlement to a full pension, both of which are often subject to legislative changes.\n\nThe valuation of the obligation of the French part-time for seniors plans is sensitive to estimates of the potentially eligible population and to the sign-up rate for the plans (estimated at 70% on average), and  the  trade-offs  that  the  beneficiaries  will  ultimately  make between the different plans proposed.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used to measure Orange SA's obligation in respect of retirement and other long-term employee benefits are the following:\n\n|                                                 | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Discount rates  (1)                             | -0.15% to 1.50%     | -0.35% to 0.90%     |\n| Average expected long-term increase in salaries | 2% \u00e0 2.75%          | 2% to 2.70%         |\n| Long-term inflation rate  (1)                   | 2% or 2.50%         | 2%                  |\n\nThe discount rates are based on AA-rated corporate bonds with the same maturity as the obligation.\n\nThe main capital-based defined-benefit plan (retirement bonuses for employees under private-law contracts in France) is mainly sensitive to employment policy assumptions (Orange has historically had high numbers of staff at retirement age). The estimated increase in the\n\ncapital of this plan is based on a long-term inflation assumption of 2% associated with the effect of a higher 'GVT' (acronym for Wage drift - Seniority - Job-skills). 'Wage drift - Seniority - Job-skills' refers to the annual change in total payroll costs independent of general  or  categorical  increases  in  wages  and  salaries,  due  to in-grade  promotions,  out  of  grade  promotions  and  the  aging  of existing staff.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This loan has been subject to two requests for a one-year extension of the initial maturity date. These requests were\n\napproved by the banks so that the final maturity date for the loan has been extended to December 2023.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, Orange SA's liquidity position exceeded the repayments of gross financial debt scheduled in 2022.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                  | Available amounts   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Bank overdrafts                         | (1)                 |\n| Cash                                    | 1,336               |\n| Marketable securities                   | 7,559               |\n| Drawdown available on credit facilities | 6,000               |\n| Liquidity position                      | 14,894              |\n\n## Change in Orange's credit rating\n\nOrange's credit rating is an additional overall performance indicator used to assess the Group's financial policy and risk management policy and, in particular, its solvency and liquidity risk. It is not a substitute for an analysis carried out by investors. Rating agencies regularly review the ratings they award. Any change in the rating could have an effect on the cost of future financing or access to liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  a  change  in  Orange's  credit  rating  will,  for  certain outstanding financing, affect the compensation paid to investors:\n\n- -one Orange SA bond with an outstanding amount of 2.5 billion dollars  maturing  in  2031  (equivalent  to  2.0  billion  euros  at December 31, 2021) is subject to a Step-up clause in the event that  Orange's  rating  changes.  This  clause  was  triggered  in 2013 and early 2014: the coupon due in March 2014 was thus computed on the basis of an interest rate of 8.75% and since then the bond bears interest at the rate of 9%;\n- -the margin of the syndicated credit line of 6 billion euros might be  modified  in  light  of  changes  to  Orange's  credit  rating, upward or downward. At December 31, 2021, the credit facility was not drawn.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, neither Orange's credit ratings nor the outlook had changed compared with December 31, 2020:\n\n|                 | Standard & Poor's   | Moody's   | Fitch Ratings   |\n|-----------------|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Long-term debt  | BBB+                | Baa1      | BBB+            |\n| Outlook         | Stable              | Stable    | Stable          |\n| Short-term debt | A2                  | P2        | F2              |",

        "page_content": "## 5.5.4 Financial  covenants\n\n## Commitments with regard to financial ratios\n\nOrange SA does not have any credit line or loan subject to specific covenant with regard to financial ratios.\n\n## Commitments related to instances of default or material adverse changes\n\nMost  of  Orange  SA's  financing  agreements,  in  particular  the 6  billion  euro  syndicated  credit  facility,  as  well  as  bond  issues, are not subject to early redemption obligations in the event of a material  adverse  change,  or  cross-default  provisions.  Most  of these contracts include cross acceleration provisions. Thus, the mere occurrence of events of default in other financing agreements would not automatically trigger an accelerated repayment under such contracts.\n\n## 5.5.5 Credit risk and counterparty risk management\n\nOrange SA may be exposed to counterparty risk through trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investments and derivative financial instruments.\n\nOrange  SA  considers  that  it  has  limited  counterparty  risk  with respect to trade accounts due to its large and diverse customer base (residential, professional and large business customers) operating in numerous industries and located in many French regions and foreign countries. The maximum value of the counterparty risk on these financial assets is equal to their recognized net book value.\n\nOrange SA is exposed to counterparty risk through its investments and derivatives. Therefore, it performs a strict selection of public, financial or industrial institutions in which it invests or with which it enters into derivatives agreements. This selection takes particular note of the institutions' credit ratings:\n\n- -for each non-banking counterparty selected for investments, limits are based on ratings and maturities of the investments;\n- -for  each  counterparty  bank  selected  for  investments  and derivatives,  limits  are  based  on  equity,  rating,  CDS  (Credit\n\nDefault  Swap, an accurate indicator of potential default risk) as  well  as  on  periodic  analyses  carried  out  by  the  Treasury Department;\n\n- -theoretical  limits  and  consumption  limits  are  monitored  and reported on a daily basis to the Group treasurer and the head of the trading room. These limits are adjusted regularly depending on credit events.\n\nFor derivatives, master agreements relating to financial instruments (French  Banking  Federation)  are  signed  with  all  counterparties and provide for a net settlement of debts and receivables, in case of failure of one of the parties, as well as for calculation of a final balance to be received or paid. These agreements include a CSA (Credit Support Annex) cash collateral clause that can lead to either a deposit (collateral paid) or collection (collateral received), on a daily basis. These payment amounts correspond to the change in market value of all derivatives.\n\nAs a rule, investments are negotiated with high-grade banks.\n\n## 5.5.6 Notional amount and fair value of derivative financial instruments\n\nNotional contracts or amounts do not represent the amounts to be paid or received and consequently do not represent the risk incurred by Orange SA in the use of derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe fair  value  of  the  currency  swaps  and  interest  rate  swaps  is estimated  by  discounting  expected  future  cash  flows  using  the year-end market exchange rates and year-end interest rates for the remaining term of the contracts.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  over-the-counter  options  is  estimated  using generally accepted market measurement models.\n\nOrange SA may set up hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk with external counterparties on behalf of some of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. In the vast majority of cases, these hedges are subject to mirror transactions in the subsidiaries for which they are  set  up,  with  Orange  SA  not  bearing  any  residual  interest  or foreign exchange rate risk.\n\n-\n\n| (in millions of euros)                  | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                         | Notional  amount    | Fair value          | Notional amount     | Fair value          |\n| Off-balance sheet financial instruments |                     |                     |                     |                     |\n| Interest rate swaps                     | 1,675               | (14)                | 4,835               | (46)                |\n| Cross currency swaps                    | 7,599               | 334                 | 11,790              | (495)               |\n| Forward currency contracts              | 1,499               | -                   | 2,404               | (1)                 |\n| Total firm commitments                  | 10,773              | 320                 | 19,029              | (542)               |\n| Options                                 | 27                  | -                   | 66                  |                     |\n| Total contingent commitments            | 27                  | -                   | 66                  | -                   |\n| Total                                   | 10,800              | 320                 | 19,095              | (542)               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

These commitments will require capital expenditure in future years to roll out and enhance the networks. They are not shown in the table above since they are not expressed in monetary terms:\n\n- -t h e o bligations  included  in  the  authorization  to  use  5G frequencies  in  the  3.4-3.8  GHz  band  issued  to  Orange  on November 12, 2020 are as follows:\n- -the  rollout  of  sites  (3,000  sites  by  the  end  of  2022, 8,000 sites by the end of 2024 and 10,500 sites by the end of 2025), of which 25% must be located in rural areas or industrial areas outside of very densely populated areas,\n- -widespread availability of a 5G service at all sites by the end of 2030, an obligation that may be met either with the 3.4-3.8GHz band or another band,\n- -the provision of a speed of at least 240 Mbps per sector from 75% of sites by the end of 2022, 85% of sites by the end of 2024, 90% of sites by the end of 2025, and 100% of sites by the end of 2030,\n- -coverage of the main highways by the end of 2025, major roads by the end of 2027,\n- -the provision of differentiated services and the activation of the IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) network protocol,\n\nIn addition, the commitments made by Orange to participate in the first stage of the procedure and which made it possible to obtain 50 MHz at a reserve price became obligations in the authorization issued:\n\n- -from the end of 2023, Orange will have to provide a fixed offer from sites using the 3.5 GHz band and a fixed offer to cover premises that benefit from fixed access radio network services,\n- -Orange  will  have  to  meet  reasonable  requests  for  the provision of services from private sector companies and public  sector  structures,  provide  indoor  coverage,  offer hosting for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) and be transparent about network failures and planned rollouts;\n- -pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  33-13  of  the  French Postal & Electronic Communications Code regarding coverage in sparsely populated areas:\n- -Orange proposed that it commit to ensuring that, within its  FTTH deployment scope in the AMII area and unless refused by third parties, 100% of homes and professional premises  would  have  access  to  FTTH  sales  offers  by the  end  of  2020  (including  a  maximum  8%  of  premises connectable  on  demand)  and  that  100%  of  homes  and professional  premises  would  be  made  connectable  by the end of 2022. Subsequent to the Arcep opinion, these proposals were accepted by the government in July 2018,\n- -outside of the AMII area, Orange proposed that it make deployment  commitments  within  the  AMEL  area  for  the Vienne,  Haute-Vienne,  Deux-S\u00e8vres  and  Lot-et-Garonne departments,\n- -lastly, Orange proposed to make commitments outside of the  AMII  and  AMEL  areas  in  the  following  departments: Orne,  Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es,  Yvelines,  Territoire-de-Belfort, Guadeloupe and Martinique;\n- -on January 14, 2018, the Orange group and the other French mobile  operators  signed  an  agreement  (the  'New  Deal')  to ensure better mobile coverage of French territory, particularly rural  areas.  This  agreement  includes  enhanced  coverage obligations,  which  are  included  for  the  2018-2021  period  in our licenses in force in the bands 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz, and for the post 2021 period, in the new licenses for 900 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz awarded on November 15, 2018:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Management believes that Orange SA has the ability to fulfill these commitments made to government authorities.\n\n## Guarantees granted to third parties in the ordinary course of business\n\nAs the parent company of the Orange group, Orange SA grants guarantees  to  third  parties  in  order  to  cover  the  contractual\n\nobligations of its direct or indirect subsidiaries. These guarantees totaled 1,294 million euros at December 31, 2021.\n\nIn the context of deploying the High-Speed and Very High-Speed broadband network in France, the Group signed contracts through the  Public  Initiative  Network  (mainly  public  service  delegation contracts  or  public-private  partnerships  and  procurement contracts  for  design,  realization,  operation  and  maintenance), under terms which Orange SA counter-guaranteed for an overall amount of 252 million euros at December 31, 2021, a portion of the commitments being made by its subsidiaries with public entities, particularly  for  performance  guarantees  and  rehabilitation  of infrastructure.\n\nThese commitments include the performance guarantees granted to certain customers of the Enterprise Division subsidiaries, for an amount of 295 million euros.\n\nOrange SA provides certain guarantees to third parties (financial institutions,  customers,  partners  and  government  agencies)  to ensure the fulfillment of its contractual obligations in the ordinary course of its business. These guarantees are not shown in the table above, as they do not increase the amount of its commitments.\n\n## 6.2 Other commitments\n\n## Warranties given on disposals\n\nUnder the disposal agreements for certain assets, subsidiaries or equity investments entered into by its subsidiaries, the Company guarantees that those subsidiaries will fulfill their obligations under the  asset  and  liability  warranties  they  have  granted.  Nearly  all material disposal agreements provide for caps on these warranties.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  main  warranties  in  effect  were  the following:\n\n- -the uncapped warranties granted to the EE joint venture when contributing the operations in the United Kingdom, concerning the restructuring of equity investments and assets done prior to the contribution expiring in 2022;\n- -a  warranty  given  to  BT  as  part  of  the  EE  disposal,  backed 50/50  by  Orange  group  and  Deutsche  Telekom  as  tax  and operating  warranties,  except  for  events  ascribable  solely  to one or the other, and capped at the contractually set sale price of 5.1 billion pounds sterling (6.1 billion euros converted at the exchange rate at December 31, 2021) for Orange's share, which will expire in 2023;\n- -miscellaneous standard warranties granted to buyers of real estate sold by the Group.\n\nThe Company believes that the risk of all these warranties being enforced is remote and that the potential consequences of their being called are not material with regard to Orange SA's results and financial position.\n\n## 6.3 Financing commitments\n\nOrange SA's main commitments relating to borrowings are set out in  Note 5.4 Financial liabilities and Note 5.5 Exposure to market risks.",

        "page_content": "## Note 7 Litigation\n\nThis  note  presents  all  of  the  significant  legal  disputes  in  which Orange  SA  is  involved,  with  the  exception  of  those  related  to disagreements between Orange SA and the tax or social security authorities  concerning  levies,  income  tax  or  social  security contributions. These disputes are presented in Notes 3.6. Income tax and 5.3 Provisions.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the provisions recognized by Orange SA for all disputes in which it is involved (other than those in Notes 3.6 Income tax and 5.3 Provisions)  amounted  to  323  million  euros, compared with 451 million euros at December 31, 2020. Orange SA believes  that  any  disclosure  of  the  amount  of  provisions  on  a case-by-case basis for ongoing disputes could seriously harm the Group's position. The balance and overall movements on provisions are presented in Note 5.3 Provisions.\n\n## Litigation related to competition law\n\n## Mobile services\n\n- -In parallel to the judicial inquiry for which a final decision was handed down on December 17, 2015, a final verdict was reached by the French Competition Authority fining Orange 350 million euros for having implemented four anti-competitive practices in the 'Enterprise' market segment and imposing injunctions, SFR brought an action on June 18, 2015, for damages suffered because  of  Orange's  practices.  After  several  successive increases in April 2016 and September 2018, SFR raised its claim to 3 billion euros in July 2019. In the wake of this decision, C\u00e9leste and Adista also brought actions against Orange before the  Paris  Commercial  Court  for  damages.  Orange  and  SFR entered into a memorandum of understanding, notably putting an end to their dispute. SFR withdrew its claim for damages from  the  Paris  Commercial  Court  which  duly  noted  this withdrawal on April 2, 2021. This dispute is now closed. The investigation of the cases of C\u00e9leste and Adista versus Orange are ongoing. To date, the overall claims of C\u00e9leste and Adista represent a total of 47 million euros.\n- -Concurrently  to  their  complaints  filed  with  the  French Competition Authority, regarding the practices of Orange in the mobile and fixed-to-mobile markets in the French Caribbean and in French Guiana, for which Orange received a definitive sentence, Digicel and Outremer Telecom initiated before the Paris  Commercial  Court  legal  actions  for  alleged  damages stemming from these practices. After being sentenced by the Paris  Commercial  Court  in  March  2015,  the  Paris  Court  of Appeal decreased the amount of the fine to be paid to Outremer Telecom to 3 million euros in May 2017, noting inter alia that the  damages  should  be  discounted  at  the  statutory  rate  of interest. On December 18, 2017 the Paris Commercial Court ordered Orange to pay Digicel the sum of 180 million euros, to which should be added interest calculated from March 2009 until the date of payment at a higher interest rate than the rate ordered by the Paris Court of Appeal in the Outremer Telecom litigation, i.e. a total amount of 346 million euros. On June 17, 2020, the Paris Court of Appeal overturned the judgment and in  particular  the  interest  calculation  applied  to  the  damages set  forth  in  the  judgment  rendered  by  the  Paris  Commercial Court on December 18, 2017, which ordered Orange to make a principal payment of 180 million euros to Digicel. Following this judgment, Orange was refunded 97 million euros. Orange appealed to the French Supreme Court and re-assessed the risk  related  to  the  possible  reversal  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's judgment,  which  would  return  the  parties  to  the  situation following the first-instance court's decision.\n\n## Fixed services\n\n- -In  2010,  SFR  and  then  Verizon  summoned  Orange  SA  to appear  before  the  Paris  Commercial  Court  demanding  the reimbursement  of  alleged  overpayments  on  interconnection services  provided  by  Orange,  the  price  of  which  allegedly did not reflect their cost. On June 18 and 25, 2013, the Paris Commercial Court dismissed their claims but ordered Orange to  pay  Verizon  1  million  euros  in  damages  with  respect  to services provided in 2008. Orange paid this amount in 2013. SFR  and  Verizon  filed  appeals  against  these  decisions.  In December  2015,  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  dismissed  in full  the  claims  made  by  SFR  and  in  September  2017,  the French Supreme Court rejected SFR's appeal. Furthermore, in  April  2017,  the  Paris  Court  of  Appeal  dismissed  Verizon completely and reversed the compensation of 1 million euros granted for services provided in 2008. On June 5, 2019, the French Supreme Court annulled the decision of the Paris Court of Appeal and restored the parties to the situation they were in  following  the  first  instance  court's  decision  rendered  on June 25, 2013. The proceedings are still ongoing.\n- -In 2012, SFR brought an action against Orange SA before the Paris Commercial Court denouncing its fixed telephony retail offers for the secondary residences market. In February 2014, the  trial  court  ruled  that  Orange  had  abused  its  dominant position but in October 2014, the Paris Appeal Court annulled this  ruling.  This  decision  was then overturned by the French Supreme  Court  in  2016  and  Orange  had  to  pay  53  million euros to SFR pursuant to the trial court's ruling. SFR had raised its claims to 257 million euros before the Court of Appeal. In 2018, the Court of Appeal sentenced Orange to pay 54 million euros and Orange appealed to the French Supreme Court. On September 16, 2020, the French Supreme Court overturned the judgment handed down by the Court of Appeal and restored the  parties  to  the  situation  they  were  in  following  the  Paris Commercial Court's decision. Orange applied to the Court of Appeal and obtained through a ruling on September 24, 2021, a reversal of its conviction and the return of the full amount of the sums awarded to SFR, which SFR returned at the end of 2021. SFR appealed to the French Supreme Court again on October 5, 2021.\n- -On  April 16, 2021, Bouygues Telecom brought an action against Orange before the Paris criminal court concerning the service quality of its wholesale offers for an amount of 78 million euros for alleged losses. Orange considers these claims to be without merit.\n\n## Other proceedings\n\n- -In  June  2018,  Iliad  brought  summary  proceedings  against Orange SA before the presiding judge of the Paris Commercial Court,  aiming  to  ban  some  of  its  mobile  telephony  offers proposing mobile handsets at attractive prices accompanied by  a  subscription  package,  on  the  grounds  that  they constituted consumer credit offers. The case is currently being investigated by the judges deciding on the merits of the case. On October 16, 2020, Iliad, for the first time, assessed its loss at 790 million euros.\n- -In  December  2018  the  administrators  of  former  UK  retailer Phones 4U, (which is in administration and no longer trading), filed  a  claim  against  the  three  main  UK  mobile  network operators, including EE, and their parent companies, including Orange. The Phones 4U claim (of an unquantified amount) is currently being disputed before the High Court of England and Wales. Orange vigorously challenges the allegations raised by Phones 4U which include collusion between various operators.\n- -In August 2020, ASSIA brought proceedings against Orange SA before the Paris Civil Court for infringement of two dynamic xDSL line management patents.

The proceedings are currently being examined by the judges deciding on the merits of the case.\n\n- -The  Evaluation  and  Compensation  Committee,  set  up  as part  of  the  France  Telecom  employee-related  crisis  trial,  to examine individual claims submitted by individuals present in the company between 2007 and 2010 and their beneficiaries, extended  the  period  for  submitting  files  until  December  31, 2020. This Committee is continuing to analyze and process the  requests  received.  At  the  end  of  December  2021, 1,751  individual  requests  had  been  received,  about  1,100  of which had been closed subsequent to an agreement and just under 300 requests are being processed. The Committee is expected to finish its work by the the first half of 2022.\n\nIn  order  to  provide  its  telecommunication  services,  Orange  SA sometimes uses fixed assets of other parties. Terms of use of these assets  are  not  always  formalized.  The  Company  is  sometimes subject  of  claims  and  might  be  subject  to  future  claims  in  this respect,  which  could  result  in  a  cash  outflow  in  the  future.  The amount of the potential obligations or future commitments cannot be  measured  with  sufficient  reliability  due  to  legal  complexities involved.\n\nOther  than  proceedings  related  to  tax  audits  (see  Note  3.6 Income tax), there are no other administrative, legal or arbitration proceedings,  including  any  proceedings  that  are  pending  or threatened, of which Orange is aware, which may have or have had in the last 12 months a material impact on the Company's and/or Group's financial position or profitability.\n\n## Note 8 Transactions with companies and related parties\n\nThe main related-party transactions with associates are carried out in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  and  are  entered  into  through arm's length transactions.\n\nThe  additional  related-party  transactions  cover  the  main transactions  carried  out  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  with companies that belong to the Group and that are not wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by Orange SA and companies in which the\n\n## Note 9 Subsequent events\n\n## Appointment of the new Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Orange Board of Directors met on January 28 and appointed Christel Heydemann as the Chief Executive Officer of Orange as from April 4, 2022. As the Board noted a separation of the positions\n\nChairman of Orange SA's Board of Directors is a member of the Board of Directors, Supervisory Board or Executive Committee.\n\nTelecommunication  services  provided  to  French  governmental authorities, which are one of Orange SA's largest customers, as well as those to its various local and regional authorities, are provided on an arm's length basis.\n\nof Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, at the arrival of the new Chief  Executive  Officer,  St\u00e9phane  Richard  will  continue  to  carry out the duties of non-executive Chairman until the arrival of a new Chairperson and until May 19, 2022, at the latest, the date of the Orange Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## Note 10   Accounting policies for preparing the financial statements\n\nThe  Statutory  Financial  Statements  of  Orange  SA  have  been prepared  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting principles in France and with the provisions of the French General Accounting Plan (Plan Comptable G\u00e9n\u00e9ral).\n\n## 10.1 Accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements were prepared in accordance with ANC regulation No. 2014-03 of June 5, 2014, regarding the amended version of the French General Accounting Plan.\n\nGeneral  accounting  practices  were  used  in  accordance  with the French General Accounting Plan, in line with the principle of prudence, and following the basic assumptions below:\n\n- -going concern;\n- -independence of fiscal years;\n- -consistency of accounting methods from one fiscal year to the next; and\n\nin  accordance  with  general  rules  for  the  preparation  and presentation of Statutory Financial Statements.\n\nThe historical cost method was adopted as the basic method of accounting. Only material information is provided.\n\nThe principal methods used are presented below.\n\n## 10.1.1 Transactions in foreign currencies\n\nSales  in  foreign  currencies  are  recorded  under  revenue  at  the exchange rate on the day of sale. The effect of hedging is, where applicable, accounted for under the same heading as revenue.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at  the  fiscal  year-end  exchange  rate.  Losses  or  gains  arising  on the  translation  of  receivables  and  payables  at  the  year-end  rate are  recognized  in  the  balance  sheet  respectively  as  'unrealized foreign exchange losses' on the assets side or 'unrealized foreign exchange gains' on the liabilities side.\n\nFor financial transactions, unrealized gains or losses on all balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions are determined by currency and by year of due date. For commercial transactions, unrealized gains or losses are determined by currency.\n\nA  provision  is  recorded  for  any  net  unrealized  exchange  losses other than those backed by an underlying instrument that is part of a hedge of equity securities in foreign currencies.\n\nTranslation  adjustments  for  operating  payables  and  receivables (provisioned  or  realized)  are  entered  under  operating  income. Translation  adjustments  for  financial  payables  and  receivables (provisioned or realized) are entered under financial income.\n\n## 10.1.2 Revenue  recognition\n\nThe  main  revenue  from  Orange  SA's  activities  is  recognized  as follows:\n\n## Provision of equipment\n\nRevenue from the sale of handsets and accessories is recognized when delivered. Installation fees are recognized in revenue when the line is activated.",

        "page_content": "Equipment lease revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement.\n\n## Service revenue\n\nRevenue  from  telephone  and  Internet  access  contracts  is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the service.\n\nRevenue from incoming and outgoing telephone communications is recognized when the service is provided.\n\nRevenue related to the use of leased lines and to medium-speed and broadband data transmission is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nRevenue related to the sale of transmission capacity on terrestrial and submarine cables is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract.\n\nRevenue from Internet advertising is recognized over the period over which the advertising service is provided.\n\n## Separable components of a bundled offer and related offers\n\nMany  service  offers  available  on  the  Group's  main  markets  are comprised of two components: an equipment component (e.g. a mobile handset) and a service component (e.g. a talk plan).\n\nHence, for bundled offers including a handset sold at a discounted price  and  a  telecommunication  service,  revenue  recognized  for the handset sale is limited to the amount of the arrangement that is not contingent upon the rendering of service provision, i.e. the amount paid by the customer for the handset: this amount is usually the amount paid at the delivery, or the discounted amounts paid over a 12- or 24-month period with respect to the offers paid by installments.\n\nWhere  separable,  revenue  from  equipment  sales  is  recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer. The provision of an Internet box does not constitute either a separable component of the Internet access service offer nor a rental because Orange maintains control of the box and its usage.\n\nFor certain commercial offers, revenue from connection to a service is  recognized in full when billing the first connection, even if this service is not a separately identifiable transaction from subscription and communications.\n\n## Sales of content\n\nRevenue from the sale of revenue and cost-sharing arrangements ('contact  number'  service)  is  recognized  at  the  gross  amount. Amounts  due  to  providers  of  such  services  are  recognized  in operating expenses.\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  or  supply  of  content  (audio,  video, games, etc.) through the various communication systems (mobile, PC, TV, fixed telephony, etc.) is recognized at the gross amount; payments  to  content  publishers  are  therefore  recognized  in operating expenses. When Orange SA is acting as agent in the sale or supply of content, the related transactions are recognized in third-party accounts and only Orange SA's fees are recognized in net income.\n\n## Customer acquisition and loyalty program costs\n\nSubscriber  acquisition  and  retention  costs,  other  than  loyalty program costs, are recognized in profit and loss in the fiscal year in which they are incurred, that is, on acquisition or renewal.\n\nThe accounting treatment of rights to loyalty discounts granted to customers is defined by CNC Urgent Issues Committee Opinion 2004-E dated October 13, 2004. When the right to a benefit  is granted, the Company undertakes to provide cash discounts or benefits  in  kind  to  its  customers.  The  equivalent  value  in  euros of  loyalty  discounts  granted  to  customers  is  recognized  under deferred income. It is estimated on the basis of assumptions on cancellation rates and utilization rates of the rights by subscribers and is deferred until such time as it is converted into revenue when a future sale is made. This principle is applied to Orange SA's existing PCM  (Change  Your  Mobile)  program,  under  which  customers can get a new mobile phone provided that they enter into a new contractual obligation.\n\n## 10.1.3 Intangible  assets\n\nPursuant to ANC Regulation No. 2015-06 of November 23, 2015, at the start of the fiscal year on January 1, 2016, the technical losses recognized in the financial statements were allocated, transaction by  transaction,  to  the  underlying  assets  on  which  there  were unrealized gains. The residual amount of losses not allocated to components of identified assets remains in commercial goodwill and  is  subject  to  impairment  tests  as  described  in  Note  9.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.\n\nThus,  intangible  assets  mainly  include  technical  merger  losses not allocated to identified assets, licenses, patents, usage rights, software and leasehold rights, as well as development costs.\n\n## Gross value\n\nIntangible assets are recognized at acquisition or production cost.\n\nThe acquisition cost of mobile network operating licenses consists of a fixed portion, which is capitalized, and a variable portion, which is  expensed  (equal  to  1%  of  eligible  revenue).  The  amortization period  for  the  licenses  begins  as  from  the  date  on  which  the network is technically ready for effective marketing of the service and ends on the license expiration date, with the exception of the first  block of frequencies under the UMTS license, for which the amortization period is effective as from the award date.\n\nDevelopment  costs  are  capitalized  when  the  following  can  be demonstrated:\n\n- -the  intention  and  the  technical  and  financial  capacity  to complete the development project;\n- -the project will generate probable future economic benefits for the Company; and\n- -the cost can be measured reliably.\n\nResearch and development costs not fulfilling the above criteria are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nIntangible assets are amortized on a basis that reflects the pattern in which their future economic benefits are expected to be consumed according to their probable use.\n\nThe straight-line basis is usually applied over the following estimated useful lives:\n\nMobile\tnetwork\tlicenses\n\n15 to 20 years\n\nPatents\n\n14 years\n\nIndefeasible\tRights\tof\tUse\tof\n\nsubmarine\tand\tterrestrial\tcables\n\n10 to 20 years\n\nIT\t(applications,\tsoftware,\tlicenses),\n\ncustomer\tservice\tplatforms,\tR&D\n\n3 to 5 years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n3 -\n\n## 10.1.4 Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment mainly comprise network facilities and equipment.\n\n## Gross value\n\nThe gross value of property, plant and equipment corresponds to their acquisition or production cost. This cost includes the costs directly  attributable  to  the  transfer  of  the  asset  to  its  place  of operation and its preparation for operation.\n\nTransfer taxes, fees or commissions and legal costs related to the acquisition are attached to the acquisition cost of the asset.\n\nThe  cost  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  includes,  where appropriate, the estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, representing the obligation incurred by Orange SA.\n\nThe cost of networks includes design and construction costs, as well as equipment and installation capacity improvement costs.\n\nMaintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred, except where they serve to increase the asset's productivity or extend its useful life.\n\nThe rollout of assets by stage, especially for network assets, does not  generally  require  a  substantial  period  of  preparation.  As  a consequence, Orange SA does not generally capitalize the interest expense incurred during the construction and acquisition phase for its property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Interest is entered under expenses in the fiscal year during which it is incurred, independently of how the borrowed capital is used.\n\nPursuant  to  the  component-based  approach,  the  total  cost  of an asset is allocated among its different components and each component is accounted for separately when different components have different useful lives, or when the pattern in which their future economic benefits  are  expected  to  be  consumed  by  the  entity varies, thereby requiring the use of different rates and methods of depreciation.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  depreciated  on  a  basis  that reflects the pattern in which the future economic benefits of each of their components are expected to be consumed according to their probable use.\n\nThe straight-line basis is usually applied over the following estimated useful lives:\n\nBuildings\t(including\tlightweight\tconstructions),\n\nleasehold\timprovements\tand\tequipment\n\n5 to 30 years\n\nInfrastructure\t(civil\tworks,\tcopper\tand\toptical\n\ncables,\ttelephone\tpoles,\tmasts,\tmobile\n\nsite\tresearch\tand\tengineering\tcosts)\n\n8\tto\t30\tyears\n\nEquipment\t(switching,\ttransmission,\tetc.)\n\nand\tfixed\tand\tmobile\tnetwork\tinstallations,\n\nincluding\tinseparable\tunderlying\tsoftware Computer\thardware,\thandsets\n\n5 to 20 years\n\n3 to 5 years\n\nOther\tproperty,\tplant\tand\tequipment\n\n3 to 10 years\n\nLand and fixed assets in progress are not depreciated.\n\nThe depreciable amount of an asset relates to its gross value minus its residual value less disposal costs.\n\nOrange SA makes use of accelerated depreciation allowed under the tax regulations in force. The difference between accelerated depreciation  and  straight-line  depreciation  is  recorded  as  a regulated provision on the balance sheet.\n\n## 10.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized, on a case-by-case basis, when the fair value of an asset falls sustainably below its net book value due to events or circumstances arising during the period (such as obsolescence, wear and tear, significant changes to the manner in  which  the  asset  is  used,  worse  than  expected  economic performance, a drop in revenue or other external indicators, revision of operating cash flows, etc.).\n\nFair value is the higher of market value and value in use.\n\nFor  assets  which  are  to  be  held  and  used,  fair  value  is  usually determined on the basis of value in use, which is the estimated present  value  of  the  future  economic  benefits  expected  to  be derived from the use and disposal of the asset. For assets held for  sale,  fair  value  is  determined  on  the  basis  of  realizable  value assessed by reference to market prices.\n\nIn addition, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, including  the  commercial  goodwill  allocated  to  businesses  in France, are tested overall for impairment relating to all activities and sites in France.\n\nPotential reversal of impairment is examined at each closing date. Impairment on goodwill is definitive.\n\n## 10.1.6 Financial  assets\n\nEquity  securities  are  recorded  at  historical  purchase  cost  plus the share, if any, of the merger loss allocated to them pursuant to ANC Regulation No. 2015-06. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nTo determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized, the historical acquisition cost (including any share of merger losses allocated thereto) is compared to its fair value.\n\nFair value is equal to value in use for strategic interests. However, when an interest is due to be sold, it is measured at market value.\n\nThe value in use of equity securities  is  the  estimated  enterprise value of the component entities of those investments, less their net debt (or plus their net cash), as calculated in their currency and converted into euros at the year-end exchange rate.\n\nDue to the short-term volatility of market value and the strategic nature of its investments, Orange SA uses the discounted cash flow method to assess enterprise value (excluding for banking activity). Cash  flow  projections  are  based  on  economic  and  regulatory assumptions, license renewal assumptions and forecast trading conditions drawn up by Orange SA's Management, as follows:\n\n- -cash flows are taken from business plans covering a timeframe of three to five years;\n- -beyond that timeframe, cash flows are extrapolated by applying a perpetual growth rate specific to each business activity;\n- -the cash flows obtained are discounted using appropriate rates for the type of business.\n\nMarket value is the best estimate of the amount obtainable from the sale of an asset in an arm's length transaction less costs to sell. This estimate is made on the basis of available market information, taking into account any specific circumstances.",

        "page_content": "Other criteria, such as market value (assessed based on average share price over the last 20 trading days), growth and profitability prospects,  parent  company  equity,  proportionate  share  in  the investment (historic basis) can be taken into account, separately or in addition to value in use, when calculating fair value according to the type of each investment.\n\n## Receivables related to equity investments\n\nReceivables  related  to  equity  investments  comprise  mediumor  long-term  loan  agreements  with  Group  companies.  They are  recognized  separately  from  current  accounts  with  Group subsidiaries, which are used for the daily management of their cash surpluses and requirements. Impairment is recognized according to the risk of non-recovery.\n\n## Cash collateral received\n\nOrange SA has negotiated cash collateral agreements with its main bank counterparties,  which  fluctuate  according  to  the  valuation of  off-balance sheet transactions with these counterparties. The amount of this  collateral  is  strongly  correlated  to  movements  in foreign exchange rates.\n\nCollateral paid is recorded in financial assets and collateral received is recognized in other short-term borrowings.\n\n## 10.1.7 Inventories\n\nNetwork maintenance equipment and equipment intended for sale to customers are measured at the lower of cost or likely realizable net book value. The cost relates to the acquisition cost, which is determined by the weighted average cost method.\n\nWhen the likely realizable net book value is lower than the cost of entry, a provision for impairment is recorded that amounts to the ascertained difference.\n\n## 10.1.8 Trade  receivables\n\nDue  to  its  broad  range  of  customers  (B2C  customers,  large companies,  professionals  and  mobile  virtual  network  operators (MVNOs)), Orange SA does not consider itself to be exposed to a customer concentration risk. Impairment is recognized according to the risk of non-recovery of the receivables. It is calculated either on an individual  basis  or  on  a  statistical  assessment  of  the  risk according to customer segment.\n\n## Receivables assigned to installment payments\n\nTrade receivables may include installment payments over at most a two-year period for mobile phone purchases. In 2018, Orange SA established  a  program  with  a  bank  of  non-recourse  disposals of  its  deferred  payment  receivables.  The  transfer  of  ownership having been completed, the receivables thus sold were no longer recognized  on  the  balance  sheet.  This  disposal  is  considered as  a  pure  and  simple  assignment  of  receivables  related  to  the Company's day-to-day business. The difference between the par value and the sale price of the receivable is recorded in operating income.\n\n## 10.1.9 Marketable  securities\n\nMarketable securities are stated at cost. An impairment provision is recognized, where applicable, for each line of securities of the same nature, equal to the difference between their carrying value and  the  average  stock  market  price  during  the  previous  month or, in the case of unlisted securities, their probable trading value. However, in line with CRC Rule No. 2008-15 of December 4, 2008, no  impairment  losses  are  recognized  on  marketable  securities\n\ncomprising shares purchased or held in respect of free share award plans: any loss arising from their removal from the balance sheet without a counterbalancing entry is accounted for by recognizing a provision (see Note 10.1.16 Other employee benefits).\n\n## 10.1.10 Other shareholders' equity\n\nWhen, based on the terms of the contract or the economic conditions at the time of issuance, an interest bearing financial instrument is not redeemable at the lender's option or it is redeemable in equity instruments, it is recognized in Other shareholders' equity.\n\n## 10.1.11 Grants\n\nOrange  SA  may  receive  non-repayable  grants,  presented  in shareholders' equity, under 'Grants,' in the form of direct or indirect funding from third parties for capital projects, mainly provided by local  and  regional  authorities.  They  are  recycled  to  the  income statement  at  the  same  rate  and  over  the  same  period  as  the depreciation of the fixed assets financed.\n\n## 10.1.12 Bond issuance costs\n\nBond issuance costs are recorded in operating expenses in the fiscal year in which the bonds were issued. Share premiums are recognized in financial expenses over the term of the bond.\n\n## 10.1.13 Derivative financial instruments\n\nOrange SA manages the market risks related to changes in interest and exchange rates using financial instruments (derivatives), and particularly cross-currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, caps,  floors,  futures  contracts  in  organized  markets,  forward currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options. These instruments are used for hedging purposes.\n\nGains and losses arising on these derivatives are recorded in the income statement on a symmetrical basis with the losses and gains on the hedged items:\n\n- -differences  in  interest  receivable  or  payable  on  interest rate  derivatives  and  any  premiums  or  discounts  on  these transactions  are  recorded  in  the  income  statement  on  a symmetrical basis over the term of the hedged item;\n- -gains and losses arising on currency derivatives used to hedge balance sheet items are recorded as adjustments to the foreign exchange  gain  or  loss  of  the  hedged  item;  if  the  hedging instrument is unwound or matures before the hedged item, any associated gains or losses are retained on the balance sheet, as deferred income or prepaid expenses, until the transaction is unwound, and are then reclassified as income;\n- -gains and losses arising on derivatives designated as hedges of identifiable firm commitments or identifiable future transactions are deferred and recognized in the valuation of the transaction when it is unwound;\n- -some transactions which comply with Orange SA's hedging policy do not qualify for hedge accounting. In accordance with ANC regulation No. 2015-05 of July 2, 2015 concerning forward financial  instruments  and  hedging  transactions,  changes  in the value of these transactions in open stand-alone positions appear on the balance sheet as counterparties to transitional accounts: on the asset side of the balance sheet with respect to changes related to unrealized losses and on the liabilities side with respect to changes related to unrealized gains;\n- -unrealized gains are not entered on the statement of profit and loss;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

It may also result from Orange SA's practices or from public commitments that have created a legitimate expectation on the part of the third parties concerned that Orange SA will assume certain responsibilities.\n\nThe amount of the provision corresponds to the amount of the outflow of resources that will probably be required for Orange SA to settle the obligation.\n\nContingent  liabilities  are  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  the  financial statements. They correspond to:\n\n- -probable  obligations  arising  from  past  events  that  are  not recognized because their existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the Company's control; or\n- -present  obligations  arising  from  past  events  that  are  not recognized  because  it  is  not  probable  that  an  outflow  of resources  embodying  economic  benefits  without  at  least equivalent compensation will be required to settle the obligation or because the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.\n\n## Litigation\n\nIn  the  ordinary  course  of  business,  Orange  SA  is  involved  in  a number  of  legal  and  arbitration  proceedings  and  administrative actions.  The  costs  that  may  result  from  these  proceedings  are only accrued when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of that liability can be quantified or estimated within a reasonable range. The amount of provision recorded is based on a case-by-case assessment of the risk level, and events arising during the course of legal proceedings may require a reassessment of this risk.\n\n## Dismantling and restoring sites\n\nOrange SA is required to dismantle technical equipment and restore the technical sites it occupies.\n\nThe provision is based on dismantling costs (on a per-unit basis for public phones and mobile antenna sites, or per metric ton for telephone poles and fixed-line electrical and electronic equipment) incurred by Orange SA to meet its environmental commitments and annual estimated asset dismantling and site restoration obligations.\n\nThe  provision  is  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  identified  costs for the current fiscal year, extrapolated for future years using the best estimate of the commitment settlement. It is discounted at a risk-free rate. This estimate is revised annually and adjusted where appropriate against the asset to which it relates.\n\nThe asset to which it relates is depreciated over the forecast duration of the dismantling plan, which in theory is equal to the useful life of the asset concerned (e.g.: 28 years for telephone poles), except for restoring sites for which an assumption of the occupation period for leased sites is taken into account.\n\n## 10.1.15 Long-term employee benefit obligations\n\nEmployee benefits are offered through:\n\n- -defined-contribution plans: contributions are expensed in the fiscal year in which the employee service is rendered; or\n- -defined-benefit  plans:  the  obligation  is  measured  according to method 2 (b), in line with CNC recommendation No. 2003R. 01 and ANC recommendation No. 2013-02 amended (see Note 2.1 Changes in accounting method).\n\nIn accordance with this recommendation:\n\n- -the  obligation  is  measured  on  the  basis  of  demographic (employee  turnover  rate,  mortality,  etc.)  and  financial assumptions (rate of future salary increases, inflation rate, etc.) and is then discounted;\n- -discount  rates  are  determined  on  a  plan-by-plan  basis  by reference to market yields on high quality long-term corporate bonds; they have been calculated based on external indices commonly used as a reference, and after analysis by Orange SA of their relevance, particularly in terms of their composition (the quality of the issuers);\n- -actuarial  gains  and  losses  on  post-employment  benefits are recorded in profit or loss for the fiscal year (see Note 2.1 Changes in accounting method).\n\nOrange SA's defined-benefit plans are not generally funded. Only one plan is funded and as its assets are listed securities, their fair value was equal to their market value on the reporting date. The expected long-term return on these hedge assets was determined on the basis of the discount rate used to measure the debt.\n\nEmployee benefits include post-employment benefits (essentially pension  obligations),  retirement  bonuses  and  other  long-term benefits.\n\n## Post-employment benefits\n\n## Pension plan for French civil servants\n\nCivil  servants  employed  by  Orange  SA  are  covered  by  the government-sponsored civil and military pension plan. Orange SA's obligation  under  the  plan  is  limited  to  the  payment  of  annual contributions  (French  law  No.  96  660  dated  July  26,  1996). Consequently, Orange SA has no obligation to fund future deficits of the pension plans covering its own civil servant employees or any other civil service plans.\n\nThe civil servant pension plan is a defined-contribution plan.\n\n## Retirement bonuses and other similar benefits\n\nThe  retirement  bonuses  paid  by  Orange  SA  to  its  employees, either as a lump sum or as an annuity, in an amount determined by their length of service and final salary at retirement age, can be considered as a defined-benefit plan.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nThe  benefits  Orange  SA  offers  retired  employees,  such  as telephones  and  coverage  of  certain  healthcare  costs,  can  be considered as a defined-benefit plan.\n\n## Other long-term benefits\n\nOther long-term benefits offered by Orange SA concern primarily long-term  compensated  absences  and  the  French  part-time  for seniors plans.",

The  difference between the Orange SA repurchase price and the sale price to employees  due  to  the  matching  contribution  and  the  discount envisaged in the subscription price represents an expense recorded as an exceptional item in accordance with Article 945-50 of the French  General  Accounting  Plan  (see  Note  5.3.2  Share-based payments).\n\n## 10.1.17 Trade  payables\n\nSupplier payment terms are mutually agreed between the suppliers and Orange in accordance with the rules in force. However, some of the key suppliers and Orange SA agreed to extend the payment term for the Company, which may be up to six months for some invoices.\n\n## 10.1.18 Tax  regime\n\nThe Company is at the head of a tax consolidation group under Articles 223A et seq. of the French General Tax Code (CGI). Income tax expenses are calculated and paid by the Company as if there was  no  tax  consolidation.  Tax  savings  or  add-ons  stemming from corrections made to overall taxable income are recognized as  income  or  expenses  at  the  level  of  the  consolidating  parent company, Orange SA.\n\n## 10.1.19 Consolidating company identification\n\nOrange  SA,  whose  headquarters  are  located  at  111  Quai du  Pr\u00e9sident  Roosevelt  92130  Issy-les-Moulineaux  (SIREN 380 129 866), prepares the Consolidated Financial Statements of the largest group of which the Company is a part. A copy of the aforementioned  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  is  available on  the  Group  website  (https://www.orange.com/en/latestconsolidated-results).\n\n## 10.2 Use of estimates\n\nIn  preparing  the  Orange  SA  financial  statements,  Management makes estimates, insofar as many elements included in the financial statements  cannot  be  measured  with  precision.  Management revises  these  estimates  if  the  underlying  circumstances  evolve or in light of new information or more experience. Consequently, the estimates made at December 31, 2021 may subsequently be changed. The assumptions on which the main estimates are based mainly relate to:\n\n- -provisions (see Notes 5.3.1 Employee benefits, 7 Litigation and 10.1.15 Long-term employee benefit obligations);\n- -property,  plant  and  equipment  and  intangible  assets  (see Note 10.1.5 Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets);\n- -equity securities (see Note 4.2 Financial assets);\n- -revenue recognition, where the exercise of judgment is needed to identify the components of a packaged offer or to analyze complex  contracts  which  may  have  an  effect  on  several accounting periods (see Note 10.1.2 Revenue recognition);\n- -off-balance  sheet  commitments for  operating  leases,  where the exercise of judgment is necessary in particular to determine the  duration  of  the  commitment  (see  Note  6.  Contractual obligations and off-balance sheet commitments).\n\n## 10.3 Consideration of climate change risks\n\nNatural  disasters  as  well  as  other  accidental  events  related  to climate change, such as fires, could lead to significant destruction of the Orange SA's facilities, resulting in both service interruptions and high repair costs. The frequency and intensity of weather events related to climate change (e.g., floods, storms, heat waves) continue to increase, which could aggravate disasters and increase related damage. In the medium term, rising sea levels could affect sites and facilities located near the coast more often. While coverage of claims by insurers could decrease further, the damage caused by major disasters could result in significant costs to Orange, some of which could be at the expense of the Company and thus affect its financial situation and prospects.\n\nThe Company is therefore integrating climate change risks more systematically into its activities. This can be seen in the assessment of  these  risks  on  the  value  of  some  of  its  assets  through  their depreciation  schedule  or  as  an  event  that  could  lead  to  the identification of an indication of impairment loss or on the eventual possibility of obtaining financing. Consideration of climate risks is also reflected in the Orange group's commitment to be Net Zero Carbon  by  2040.  This  commitment  changes  certain  choices  in terms of investments related to its activity.\n\nNumerous projects have been initiated within the Company in order to  understand  the  impacts  of  climate  change  on  its  operations. The implementation of actions to limit the effects of the Company's activities on climate change is also underway. The outcome of these projects  could  lead  the  Company  to  review  certain  accounting treatments, judgments or estimates. At December 31, 2021, the Company has not identified any significant impact on its financial statements at the stage of completion of the projects in progress.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Justification of Assessments: Key Audit Matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## Audit Response\n\n## Revenue recognition for telecommunications activities\n\n## (Notes 4.1 and 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements)\n\nThe  Company  recognized  in  the  consolidated  income statement  \u20ac42  522  million  of  revenue  for  the  year  ended December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Company's telecommunications business involves a wide range of frequently changing services and large volumes of data  processing.  This  requires  various  revenue  recognition methods according to the type of product or service sold, and complex IT systems for revenue recognition.\n\nRevenue recognition principles are disclosed in Note 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nRevenue  recognition  of  telecommunications  business  is  a key audit matter due to the complexity of the associated IT systems.\n\nFor the telecommunications business, we have obtained an understanding of the processes used to recognize the various revenue streams, from the contract signature and the initial communication to the invoicing and the receipt of payment.\n\nWe  took  into  account  the  high  level  of  integration  of  the various IT systems involved in revenue recognition by including IT  specialists  in  our  audit  team  and  testing  the  design, implementation  and  effectiveness  of  automated  system controls affecting revenue recognition.\n\nAs part of our work, we:\n\n- -identified  the  main  controls  set  up  by  Orange  that  are relevant to our audit;\n- -tested  the  functionalities  of  business  and  commercial applications  used  to  prepare  accounting  and  financial information, the configuration and interfaces of accounting systems;\n- -performed analytical  procedures  and  tested  a  selection of manual entries at year end, by comparing our revenue estimates, based on a combination of internal data and publicly available external data, with revenue recorded.\n\nWe have also assessed the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes 4.1 and 4.4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nunder specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have  had  numerous  consequences  for  companies,  particularly on  their  operations  and  their  financing,  and  have  led  to  greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a  separate  opinion  on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.",

These tests are performed at the level of each cash-generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs, which generally correspond to the operating segment, or each country in Africa and  the  Middle  East  and  in  Europe.  An  impairment  loss  is recognized if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value. Orange mostly retains the value in use to determine the recoverable amount, which is the estimated present value of future expected cash flows.\n\nThe assessment of the value in use required certain estimates and judgments, as described in Notes 2.5.2 and 7, in particular: the  competitive,  economic  and  financial  environment  of certain countries in which the Group operates, the ability to realize operating cash flows from strategic plans, the level of i nvestment to be made, and the discount and perpetual growth rates used in calculating recoverable amounts As mentioned in Note 7.3, as at December 31, 2021, the business plans and key operational assumptions were sensitive to the Covid-19 pandemic consequences.\n\nWe have considered that the evaluation of those assets is a key audit matter, given their sensitivity to assumptions made by management, and the significance of goodwill and, other intangible  and  tangible  assets  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nWe  have  obtained  an  understanding  of  the  procedure  put in  place  by  the  Group  for  carrying  out  the  impairment  tests and, in particular, the estimation of the cash flows used in the calculation of the recoverable amount.\n\nWe  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness  of  certain  internal  controls  over  the  Group's impairment  assessment  process,  including  controls  related to  the  determination  of  the  recoverable  amounts,  and  the development  of  the  revenue  perpetual  growth  rates  and discount rate assumptions.\n\n- -To assess the reliability of data from the business plans that is used to calculate recoverable value, together with our  valuation  professionals  with  specialized  skills  and knowledge, we:\n- -compared  the  2021  business  plans  projections  with business plans from prior financial years;\n- -compared the business  plans  from  prior  financial  years with actual results of the related years;\n- -conducted  interviews  with  operational  and  finance managers at Orange to gain insight into the key assumptions used in business plans and assess assumptions based on the explanations obtained;\n- -evaluated the Group's forecasted revenue growth rates, by comparing the growth rate to the Group's peer companies' analyst reports and market research reports;\n- -examined the sensitivity  analyses  performed  by  Orange and  performed  our  own  sensitivity  analyses  on  key assumptions to  assess  the  potential  effect  of  a  change in  these  assumptions on the conclusions of impairment tests  (including  operating  cash  flows,  discount  and perpetual growth rates); reconciled the data included in the valuation models used by the Group in the determination of  recoverable  values  to  the  plans  submitted  to  those charged with governance.\n\nRelating  to  the  models  used  for  the  determination  of recoverable values, we involved our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the  methodologies  used  for  the  determination  of  discount rates  and  perpetual  growth  rates  used  in  the  valuations  by comparing them against rate ranges that were independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities.\n\nWe have also assessed the appropriateness of the information presented  in  Notes  7  and  8  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

At  that  date  unrecognized  deferred  tax  assets  amounted to \u20ac3,241 million and mainly comprised tax losses that can be carried forward indefinitely.\n\nAs stated in accounting principles of Note 10.2.3, deferred tax assets are only recognized when it is probable that the tax entity will have sufficient future taxable profit to recover them. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is assessed based on the business plans used for impairment testing, which may be adjusted for tax specificities related to each jurisdiction.\n\nWe  have  considered  that  the  recognition  of  deferred  tax assets associated with tax loss carryforwards is a key audit matter,  given  their  sensitivity  to  assumptions  made  by  the Group,  particularly  relating  to  Orange  ability  to  achieve  the performance  forecasts  in  the  business  plans  and  to  the feasibility of the Group tax planning assumptions.\n\nWe  assessed  the  designed  and  tested  the  operating effectiveness of certain controls set up by the Group on the deferred tax valuation process, including controls related to the development of assumptions used and application of the relevant tax regulations in determining the forecasted taxable incomes.\n\nWe analyzed the method used by the Group to assess tax loss carryforwards to be used in the future.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing future taxable profits, we studied the business plan process to assess the likelihood that each entity recovers its deferred tax assets by:\n\n- -reviewing the process for developing and approving the latest business plans used for those estimates;\n- -comparing the previous forecast to actual results for the years concerned;\n- -comparing the revenue growth rate to the Group's peer companies' analyst reports and market research reports.\n- -examining the consistency of assumptions made to assess deferred tax assets with those used for impairment testing (namely forecasted cash-flows and revenue growth rates);\n- -studying,  with  the  use  of  our  tax  professionals,  the application  of  the  relevant  tax  regulations  and  the feasibility of tax-planning assumptions for each jurisdiction concerned.\n\nOur work also included analyzing, with the involvement of our tax professionals, the likelihood that the concerned entities in the Group could use in the future the tax losses carryforwards as at December 31, 2021, including with regard to:\n\n- -the  deferred  tax  liabilities  that  exist  in  the  same  tax jurisdiction  and  will  allow  the  use  of  the  tax  loss carryforwards before they expire; and\n- -the capacity of each entity in the Group to generate future taxable profits to absorb previous losses.\n\nWe  also  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  information presented  in  Notes  10.2.1  and  10.2.3  to  the  consolidated financial statements.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs  specified  in  Article  L.  823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial Code (Code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the  quality  of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -identifies and assesses the risk of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for the audit opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- -evaluates  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- -assesses  the  appropriateness  of  management's  use  of  the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going  concern. This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence  obtained up  to  the  date  of  his  Audit  Report.  However,  future  events or  conditions  may cause the company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material  uncertainty  exists,  there  is  a  requirement  to  draw attention in the Audit Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- -evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements  and  assesses  whether  the  financial  statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- -obtains  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for managing, supervising  and  performing  the  audit  of  the  consolidated financial  statements  as  well  as  the  opinion  on  the  financial statements.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe  submit  a  report  to  the  Audit  Committee,  which  includes  in particular  a  description  of  the  scope  of  the  audit  and  the  audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore key audit matters we have the duty to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  N\u00b0  537/2014,  confirming  our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set out by Articles L. 822-10 to L. 822-14 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors.

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## Year ended December 31, 2021\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting of Orange S.A\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn compliance with the engagement entrusted to us by your annual general  meeting,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying  financial statements of Orange S.A. for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities and of the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\n## Audit Framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1, 2021 to the date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5 (1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to the following matter described in Notes 2.1 and 5.3.1 to the financial statements, which set out the changes in accounting policy relating to:\n\n- -the application of the revised Recommendation 2013-02 dated from 7 November 2013, as issued by the College of the Autorit\u00e9 des  Normes  Comptables  on  5  November  2021,  related  to the rules applicable for the measurement and recognition of post-employment benefits and similar benefits, with regard to the choice of methods for the recognition over time of the rights acquired in relation to defined benefit plans;\n- -the  application  of  the  recommendation  2013-02  dated  from 7  November  2013,  related  to  the  rules  applicable  for  the measurement  and  recognition  of  post-employment  benefits and similar benefits, with regard to the immediate recognition in the income statement of all actuarial differences and the cost of past services recognized over the period.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the financial statements of this period have been prepared and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have  had  numerous  consequences  for  companies,  particularly on  their  operations  and  their  financing,  and  have  led  to  greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Impairment  is  recorded  when  their carrying amount is higher than fair value, which is value in use for strategic investments.\n\nAs stated in Notes 10.1.5 and 10.1.6 to the financial statements, value  in  use  of  equity  investments  comprises  estimated enterprise value less net debt (or plus net liquid assets), which is calculated in its currency of origin and converted into Euros at the exchange rate effective at the reporting date.\n\nGoodwill  is  recognized  at  acquisition  cost.  Impairment  is recorded when the carrying amount is higher than fair value, generally based on value in use.\n\nDue to the short-term volatility of market value and the strategic nature of its investments, Orange S.A. uses the discounted cash flow method to assess enterprise value (excluding for banking activity). Discounted cash flow is calculated based on economic and regulatory assumptions, assumptions relating to license renewals and operating forecasts by Management.\n\nOther criteria, such as market value, growth and profitability prospects,  parent  company  equity,  proportionate  share  in the  investment  (historic  basis)  can  be  taken  into  account, separately or in addition to value in use, when calculating fair value according to the type of each investment. As mentioned in Note 4.2, as at December 31, 2021, the business plans and key operational assumptions were sensitive to the Covid-19 pandemic consequences.\n\nGiven  their  significance  on  the  balance  sheet  and  the complexity of models used and their sensitivity to changes in data and assumptions on which estimates are based, we believe that the evaluation of equity investments and goodwill is a key audit matter.\n\nWe have obtained an understanding of the procedure put in place by the Group for carrying out the impairment tests on equity investments and goodwill.\n\nWe have assessed the method used by Orange S.A. to identify impairment of equity investments and goodwill.\n\nTo assess the estimate of the values in use of equity investments and the value in use of goodwill, together with our valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, we:\n\n- -analyzed  the  procedure  for  determining  and  approving business plans on which cash flow forecasts are based;\n- -compared 2021 cash flow forecasts with business plans from previous financial years;\n- -compared the business plans from prior financial years with actual results of the related years;\n- -conducted  interviews  of  the  operational  and  finance managers  at  Orange  S.A.  to  gain  insight  into  the  key assumptions  used  in  business  plans  and  assess assumptions based on the explanations obtained;\n- -evaluated the Group's forecasted revenue growth rates, by comparing the growth rate to the Group's peer companies' analyst reports and market research reports;\n- -examined the sensitivity analyses performed by Orange S.A. and  performed  our  own  sensitivity  analyses  on  key assumptions to assess the potential effect of a change in these assumptions on the conclusions of impairment tests (including  operating  cash  flows,  discount  and  perpetual growth rates);\n- -reconciled the data included in the valuation models used by the Company in the determination of recoverable values to the plans submitted to those charged with governance.\n\nRelating to the models used for the determination of enterprise values, together with valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, we:\n\n- -tested  the  mathematical  reliability  of  the  models  and recalculate values in use determined by Orange;\n- -analyzed  the  methods  used  to  determine  the  discount rate and perpetual growth rate, compare those rates with market data and external sources and recalculate the rates based on our own data sources;\n- -analysed the enterprise value resulting from forecast cash flows adjusted for the net debt for each entity considered.\n\nWe have also assessed the appropriateness of the information presented in Notes 4.1.1, 4.2, 10.1.5 and 10.1.6. to the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory  auditor  exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- -identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement of  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3\n\n3",

This  last  section  lays\n\nout Orange's policy for managing its non-financial risks, as well as  the  governance  and  processes  established  in  the  Group. The  non-financial  performance  presented  below  comprises  the scorecard on the implementation of Orange's policies in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.1 Prioritization of CSR challenges\n\n## 4.1.1 Listening to stakeholders\n\n## Stakeholder dialog\n\nOrange bases its CSR efforts on repeated, structured dialog with all of its stakeholders.\n\nThis Stakeholder dialog engaged in by the Group is based on a structured,  systematic  methodology  implemented  throughout Orange since 2008. It is aimed at identifying areas for improvement in  Orange's  business  activities,  by  comparing  the  internal perspective with the external perspective of stakeholders.\n\nIt  involves  consultation  with  pre-identified  internal  and  external stakeholders on the topics addressed in the Orange Group's CSR challenges. The questioning used provides for a semi-quantitative rating system as a way of prioritizing stakeholders' concerns and expectations. Stakeholder dialog involves a degree of subjectivity inherent  to  any  consultation  in  the  responses  given  by  the stakeholders. It is an open exercise based on both real facts and perceptions.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  continued  its  'Responsible  together  in  a  postCovid  digital  world'  dialogs  launched  in  2020  in  Sierra  Leone, Poland and Tunisia, with Spain, Jordan, France, Mali and Guinea Bissau.  This  dialog  incorporates  the  CSR  commitment  pillars  of the strategic plan as well as the notions of freedom of expression, data protection and work organization. It is expected to be rolled out across all of the Group's countries over the next two years. Data sheets on each theme (environment, data security, connected education  and  school,  connected  territories,  connected  health, work organization, etc.) provide a detailed analysis of the results of these dialogs, acting as a source of inspiration for Orange experts.\n\nTo prepare for the renewal of its ISO 14001 certification, in 2021 France  also  launched  a  specific  dialog  on  the  environmental theme: natural resources and/or non-renewables, climate change, pollution, biodiversity.\n\nA Group dialog on the Duty of Vigilance was launched at the end of  2021  to  understand  the  perspective  of  internal  and  external stakeholders with a view to influencing the selection of priorities and action plans to implement as part of the Duty of Vigilance. Through this dialog, Orange strives to improve the quality of the probability analysis in the management of risks linked to the Duty of Vigilance, and  to  better  understand  the  expectations  of  the  stakeholders internally and the specific challenges of the entities, as well as any potential obstacles to the implementation of action plans.\n\nOrange is also actively monitoring developments in order to better understand the expectations related to the changes brought about by digital technology, notably through think tanks and collaborative workshops.\n\n## Committee to monitor Orange's corporate purpose\n\nOrange chose to adopt a corporate purpose incorporated into its Bylaws after approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2020 to formalize its commitment to society. Its vision, co-constructed with its internal stakeholders (social partners, directors) and external stakeholders (NGOs, think tanks, customers, authorities, suppliers, investors, etc.) was formalized as follows:\n\n## 'As a trusted partner, Orange gives everyone the keys to a responsible digital world'.\n\nIt comes with a mission and commitments:\n\n'Our mission is to ensure that digital services are well thought-out, made available and used in a more caring, inclusive and sustainable way in all areas of our business. Orange does everything in its power to  ensure  people  and  organizations  enjoy  a  more  autonomous and secure digital life. Through the engagement and expertise of the Group's teams, Orange employs innovative technologies and services everywhere, and for everyone'.\n\nThe Corporate Purpose Committee is composed of eight external figures representative of its-stakeholders, with recognized expertise and the capacity to be a driving force behind proposals, and two members of Orange's Executive Committee. It is responsible for ensuring that Orange acts in accordance with its corporate purpose and examines Orange's progress in each of its areas of commitment through a selection of means- and impact-based indicators. It was formed in 2021.\n\nThree main areas of focus for work were defined at the committee's first  meeting  that  would  enable  it  to  make  recommendations  on Orange's contribution to a sustainable society:\n\n- -for the environmental aspect, specifying Orange's position on the impact of digital technology and changing uses;\n- -for the social aspect, establishing digital technology as the driver behind inclusion in economic and social terms (particularly in the MEA region), establishing Orange's position on safe and responsible uses particularly with regard to the appropriation of digital technology by children, and specifying Orange's policy on data management;\n- -placing  Orange  in  an  ecosystem  of  players  who  make  an impact.",

The resulting materiality matrix is used to identify the main challenges for Orange as well as identifying weak signals. The matrix allows Orange to question its decisions and approaches, by taking into account the concerns and expectations expressed by stakeholders.\n\nTo provide a 'Group' vision of the challenges faced by Orange, a first  materiality  matrix  based  on  aggregation  of  all  the  dialogs conducted was created in 2017. This first matrix was used for three years,  updating  the  challenges  and  incorporating  the  notion  of maturity brought by the views of experts.\n\nThe Group's materiality analysis updated in 2021 is based on the aggregation of analyses of recent stakeholder dialogs, enriched with  an  analysis  by  geography  (France,  Europe,  MEA,  Group). Its  reporting  is  structured  around  the  four  pillars  of  the  Group's corporate purpose:\n\n- -Committed to the environment;\n- -Committed to digital equality;\n- -Committed to a society of trust;\n- -Committed to a responsible economy.\n\n## Materiality matrix of the Orange Group in 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's materiality matrix updated in 2021 shows an overall alignment of the challenges perceived as having the greatest impact on Orange's business and reputation with those identified as being of highest priority for stakeholders. The dots furthest to the right on\n\nthe matrix are the ones considered to have the highest impact for Orange; the highest dots are those which are most important to the stakeholders, with each dot shown in the matrix having significance at Group level.\n\nIt thus focuses on analysis of the following dialogs:\n\n- -the 'SD 2025' (2025 Stakeholder Dialog) launched in 2020 to reflect  the  new  reality  brought  about  by  Covid.  It  covers  the Group's main CSR topics and allows each country to update its  CSR  road  map  in  a  post-Covid  world.  Eight  countries implemented the SD 2025 in 2020 and 2021;\n- -themathic stakeholder dialogs, which delve deeper into a theme selected by Orange with key stakeholders in the ecosystem. Three thematic stakeholder dialogs were conducted over the last three years:\n- -The  Precariousness  &  Digital  Technology  dialog  was conducted in France,\n- -The Workplace Gender Equality and Diversity dialog was conducted in Spain, Belgium and Tunisia,\n- -The Attractiveness to Young People dialog was conducted in France, Egypt and Senegal;\n- -a 'CSR and co-innovation' dialog was conducted by OBS and covers the major CSR challenges faced by OBS.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The pillar 'Committed to digital inclusion' responds to high demand from stakeholders for inclusive offers (offers tailored to families or support in using digital tools) and for the adoption of new services (access\n\nto education, health, financial products through digital technology). The pillar 'Committed to the environment' is characterized by an impact perceived as strong for Orange internally and as important to its stakeholders. This positioning at Group level reflects a higher level of interest in Europe than in the MEA region, particularly in the challenge related to the depletion of resources.\n\n## 4.1.3 Areas of social responsibility to which Orange is committed\n\nIn response to the stakeholders' expectations, to the major risks and opportunities identified for Orange by its stakeholders, and in keeping with the corporate purpose and the Engage 2025 strategic plan,  which  is  built  on  the  idea  that  economic  performance  is accomplished  thanks  to  exemplary  social  and  environmental conduct, Orange defined four areas of commitment:\n\n## Commitment to the environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange  is  fighting  climate  change  and  its  repercussions  with  a target of reaching Net Zero Carbon by 2040, despite a continuous and steady increase in use across its networks. This will require unprecedented  effort  in  terms  of  energy  efficiency  for  its  own emissions and those of its customers, through the implementation of circular economy principles and through the increased use of renewable  energies.  To  neutralize  its  residual  greenhouse  gas emissions, the Group supplements these measures by investing in natural carbon sinks;\n\nOrange also strives to offer its customers solutions to reduce their own environmental footprint.\n\n## Commitment to digital inclusion\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInvestment in infrastructure and research, essential to achieving sustainable development and community empowerment in many countries, is at the core of Orange's business model. To offer its customers connectivity with ever more adapted speeds and new related services, Orange is committed to taking action to maximize geographical coverage;\n\nI n addition to its ambitions for geographical digital coverage, Orange aims to work for inclusion with a view to reducing inequalities by training the digitally excluded, supporting its customers, promoting responsible service offers adapted to as many people as possible, and supporting digital entrepreneurship. Orange is also committed to  using  digital  technology  to  promote  development  and  equal opportunities for its employees and customers. This is a source of economic and social progress.\n\n## Commitment to a society of trust\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange  aims  to  contribute  to  building  a  society  of  trust  with responsible use of digital technology, ensuring the protection of data and - in particular - personal data, and the transparency of its offers. Orange promotes an open Internet, within the framework of  European  regulation  2015-2120  laying  down  the  measures concerning open Internet access.\n\nOrange  has  also  established  a  Group-wide  system  for anti-corruption  and  the  promotion  of  ethical  conduct  to  all stakeholders. The success of these various initiatives depends on close cooperation with the other players in its ecosystem.\n\n## Commitment to being a player in a responsible economy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOrange  strives  to  create  value  for  its  employees  and  all  its stakeholders by bringing its economic performance objectives in line with a way of doing business that contributes to an inclusive, ethical and sustainable economic life; this is based on exemplary conduct  in  the  management  of  resources  -  maintaining  the employability  of  its  staff,  skills  improvement,  diversity  policy  and  relies  on  sustainable  investments,  responsible  purchases, stimulation of the ecosystem and a strong regional base.\n\n## Contributing to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nThe  Group's  commitment  is  thus  reflected  in  a  selection  of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) established by the member states  of  the  United  Nations,  for  which  the  Orange  Executive Committee  believes  that  the  Group  has  or  should  have  the capacity to make a significant positive contribution. The Group's impacts stemming from Orange's environmental commitments are analyzed and measured through SDG 12 (responsible consumption and  production)  and  SDG  13  (climate  action),  and  its  digital inclusion commitments through SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). Those two areas of commitment and more broadly Orange's business conduct are backed up by SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).",

Working groups were created in 2021 to define the training and support needs of essential players, namely finance professionals,\n\nexecutives  and  leaders  of  the  Group,  in  the  appropriation  and implementation of CSR ambitions.\n\nSince 2021, the 'Learning Cup' has included a category dedicated to CSR training, to identify, promote and share the most effective training courses and foster a learning culture. Access to CSR training is provided by a dedicated portal, accessible to all employees and structured around three pillars: Environment, Inclusion and CSR Policy  of  the  Group.  In  2021,  around  110,000  hours  of  training available on this Orange Learning CSR portal (the Group's digital training catalog) were provided to around 57,000 employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

It\n\nallows for a 'visa' to be obtained subject to completion of a test; as of December 31, 2021, more than 53,000 employees had registered for the training, and almost 40,000 visas had been issued.\n\n| Indicators               | French   | English   | Polish   | Spanish   |\n|--------------------------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|\n| Launch date              | 09/21/20 | 10/26/20  | 10/01/21 | 11/25/21  |\n| Number of visas obtained | 25,784   | 6,847     | 6,335    | N/S       |\n\nNew versions in local languages are currently being translated for Moldova, Slovakia and Belgium (English with Dutch subtitles).\n\nIn addition to the CSR Visa and to encourage employees to adopt CSR concepts, an acculturation webinar contextualized in relation to local challenges is offered to Orange Countries (France, Europe, MEA region). Various training courses were delivered in Senegal and co-facilitated with the local teams. The training will be extended to  the  countries  of  the  OMEA  region  where  there  is  a  demand. Sessions are planned in English for the countries in Europe.\n\nThis process of acculturation has been enriched by a number of thematic training courses:\n\nOne example is the Climat Fresk workshop, which is an opportunity to  discover  the  causes  and  consequences  of  climate  change and Orange's commitments in this area, as well as for discussion\n\n## Further training specific to the businesses\n\nThe  portfolio  of  'business'  training  courses  covers  all  areas  of CSR  and  is  addressed  to  all  functions:  technical,  marketing, finance, etc. For example, in the 'environment' field, the training offer is structured around four centers of expertise: energy, circular economy,  eco-design,  and  environmental  impact  modeling.  It\n\n## Note on methodology\n\n## 2021 non-financial reporting\n\nThe  Group  has  published  an  annual  report  on  sustainable development  and  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  (CSR)  since 2002.  Since  2018,  it  has  also  published  a  Statement  of  NonFinancial Performance (SNFP).\n\nMore  detailed  information  on  employee-related,  social  and environmental commitments, impacts and performance is available at https://gallery.orange.com. All indicators related to reporting are also presented there.\n\n## Reporting period and scope\n\nThe SNFP covers the period from January 1 through December 31.\n\nThe  information  presented  covers  all  the  Group's  activities and  countries  of  operation,  except  where  specifically  stated, corresponding  to  the  scope  of  the  consolidated  subsidiaries. The list of the Group's main consolidated subsidiaries is given in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements (see Section 3.3).\n\nNote that the activities of Orange Bank were included from the 2017 fiscal year.\n\nFor the 2021 fiscal year, the scope of non-financial reporting covers on average 97,3% of the Group's revenue (versus 97,0% in 2020 following  the  acquisition  of  2  subsidiaries  in  Romania  and  the incorporation of 3 subsidiaries of the MEA area - Burkina Faso, Liberia, Sierra Leone). The coverage rate, estimated as a percentage of  the  revenue  of  the  entities  included  in  the  scope,  is  specified for each indicator in the environmental and employee-related data tables.\n\namong participants on the actions to be taken within the Group to reduce CO2 emissions. This training, delivered by around 50 Orange facilitators, was taken by more than 2,250 people in 2021; it is now accessible online and an English version has been added to the French version.\n\nWebinars for Responsible Business also raise awareness among Orange  employees  of  the  way  in  which  the  integration  of  CSR dimensions  at  the  heart  of  the  businesses  can  enrich  value propositions. Fifteen themes are proposed in these webinars, such as  climate  challenges,  assessment  of  the  CSR  performance  of products and services, digital sobriety, accessibility, etc. In 2021, 550 employees attended these webinars, bringing the total number of participants since 2017 to 2,800. In 2021, three new themes were developed: 'digital inclusion,' 'corporate purpose,' and 'committed communication'.\n\nincludes,  for  example,  training  on  the  eco-design  of  products and  services  intended  for  the  innovation  teams,  training  on  the eco-design  of  software  aimed  at  assessing  the  environmental impacts and building more sober solutions, etc.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nThe content of the report was prepared based on the indicators selected to take into account the main economic, employee-related, social  and  environmental  impacts  of  the  Group's  activities.  The selection  of  these  indicators  is  based  on  the  recommendations of international standardization bodies such as standard AA1000 APS (2018), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the United Nations Global  Compact,  the  guiding  principles  of  the  OECD  and  the ISO 26000 standard on Corporate Social Responsibility. Indicators were  collected,  calculated,  and  consolidated  with  the  help  of dedicated IT tools.\n\n## Application of the principles of the AA1000 standard\n\nThe process of developing the 2021 SNFP observed, in its main aspects, the four principles (inclusion, materiality, responsiveness and impact) of the AA1000 Accountability Principles Standard (APS) (2018), a standard in the area of Corporate Social Responsibility based on taking stakeholders' expectations into account:\n\n- -inclusion: identifying the expectations of Orange's stakeholders is a determining factor in identifying sustainable development issues;\n- -materiality: selecting  the  most  significant  sustainable development issues in view of the Group's activities, taking into account stakeholders' expectations and an internal ranking of risks, which is reassessed regularly;",

Orange has also requested a more in-depth verification of certain indicators in order to obtain a reasonable assurance report (see Section 4.8 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors).\n\nThe verification of the most important non-financial information was conducted within a selection of contributing entities,  combining on-site and remote verifications. This work was supplemented by an in-depth review of the consolidation of non-financial information. The  methodology  was  adapted  to  the  fact  that  the  Orange organization has multiple locations.\n\nThe conclusions of the verification work are given in the report on Orange's Statement of Non-Financial Performance (see Section 4.8 Report by one of the Statutory Auditors).\n\n## 4.2 Environmental impacts of our activities\n\n## Implementation of environmental governance\n\nIn  2021,  the  monitoring  of  environmental  commitments  by  the Group's  Executive  Committee  and  the  Board  of  Directors  was stepped up, particularly through the presentation of commitments and action plans in favor of the circular economy in March 2021 to the GCSER Committee, and through the qualification of the climate\n\nrisks  presented  to  the  Risk  Committee,  to  the  Group  Executive Committee and to the joint committees of the Board of Directors. The Group environmental policy in addition to the effectiveness and efficiency of the action plans implemented were included on the agenda for the Group directors seminar in December 2021.\n\n## Environmental Management System\n\nAt the end of 2021, all of the Group's ISO 14001-certified organizations successfully passed their renewal or monitoring audits.\n\nThe Group's ISO 14001-certified scope was up 10.7 points in 2021 compared to 2020, mainly thanks to the certification obtained by\n\nOrange Poland for all of its fixed and mobile activities. The Group's certified scope is determined by weighting the various subsidiaries and entities according to their energy consumption.\n\n|                                      | 2021      | 2020      | 2019      |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Certified scope (energy consumption) | \u00fc\u00fc  70.0% | \u00fc\u00fc  59.3% | \u00fc\u00fc  60.8% |\n\n\u00fc\u00fc Item reviewed by KPMG: reasonable assurance .\n\n## ISO 14001-certified consolidated entities at end-2021\n\n| Subsidiary               | Scope                                          |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Orange Business Services | 45% of employees                               |\n| Orange Egypt             | All activities                                 |\n| Orange France            | All activities                                 |\n| Orange Mali              | All activities                                 |\n| Orange Marine            | All activities                                 |\n| Orange Moldova           | All non-network activities (20% of activities) |\n| Orange Poland            | All activities                                 |\n| Orange Romania           | All activities                                 |\n| Orange Senegal           | 50% of activities                              |\n| Orange Slovensko         | All activities                                 |\n| Orange Spain             | All activities                                 |\n\nOrange Business Services retained all of its certifications for all of its three French sites and its main sites abroad (City Star, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Rabat and Gurugram), representing almost 45% of its employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

be the sum of the 'France' and 'Rest of the World' figures.\n\n- (1) The France scope covers Orange France, the Group's headquarters, Orange Marine and the entities of Orange Business Services operating in the country.\n- (2) Group data for internal consumption for paper and cardboard and water are provisional for 2021, as reporting outside France is not available.\n- (3) Due to a lack of detailed data, in this table all Orange cables are listed under non-hazardous waste; however, some of the oldest cables contain hazardous substances and therefore undergo special processing at the end of their life.\n\nOrange's waste prevention and management policy, both for itself and  its  customers,  is  based  on  extending  the  life  of  products and equipment, notably through their re-use and optimizing their end-of-life  treatment.  The  Group's  commitments  to  the  circular economy  in  the  Engage  2025  strategic  plan  are  presented  in Section 2.2.3.2.1.1 Orange's environmental commitment.\n\nIn 2021, 51,831 metric tons of internal waste were disposed of by the Group (2.9% more compared to 2020), this increase reflecting better traceability in the scope considered. The recovery rate of internal hazardous waste disposed of was 97.2%, the main disposal channels being clearly identified and traced. Only activities carried out directly by Orange are considered to generate internal waste.\n\nThe metric tons of Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) collected from customers returned to levels close to those\n\nrecorded  in  2019,  following  a  sharp  decline  in  2020  due  to  the closure  of  stores  during  lockdown  periods  related  to  the  health crisis.  The  Group's  recovery rate of 82.9% of WEEE waste from customers in 2021 is up slightly compared to the recovery rate of 82.2% in 2019.\n\n## Optimizing the life cycle and end-of-life of equipment\n\nThe Group acts in several complementary ways:\n\n- -promoting the re-use and refurbishing of equipment;\n- -optimizing the management of waste and end-of-life equipment generated  internally,  by  implementing  processing  channels suited to each category of waste and ensuring that they are traceable;",

        "page_content": "- -collecting  and  processing  used  electronic  equipment  from customers  through  approved  external  partners  or  collective channels (where they exist).\n\nAlthough the implementation of suitable systems is already well under way in European countries, the emergence of new circular economy  models  involves  the  development  of  recycling,  using appropriate  systems  in  countries  where  there  is  currently  no structured waste management industry.\n\n## Eco-design of products and services\n\nIn 2021, the eco-design process of Orange products and services was redefined and tested on pilot projects. This process comprising 16  steps  concerns  all  phases  in  the  life  cycle  of  products  and services, from the upstream phase, with a systemic approach to environmental and functional challenges, to the use and end-of-life phase. It goes hand-in-hand with a training course on eco-design to support product managers in applying this new process.\n\nIt  is  applied in particular for Liveboxes and set-up boxes to help reduce their environmental footprint, enable the re-use of resources and generate significant cost-savings. The refurbishing requirement is  included from the design stage and continued throughout the life  cycle of the products. Orange and its suppliers joined forces to eco-design these products so that they can be disassembled and simply and easily repaired and given the necessary upgrades. In line with the initiatives undertaken with the Livebox 4 and the UHD TV set-up boxes, Orange already worked with its ecosystem of partners to improve production and reduce the carbon footprint of the Livebox 5 launched in 2019. This has a 100% recycled plastic shell,  which  is  lighter  and  more  compact,  with  fewer  electronic components and a new design allowing passive ventilation, without a fan.\n\nTo enable customers to identify the most environmentally friendly mobile  phones,  Orange  has  joined  forces  with  four  European operators  (Telef\u00f3nica,  Telia  Company,  Deutsche  Telekom  and Vodafone) to define an 'Eco Rating' index: an overall environmental footprint  rating  is  given  for  each  device  across  five  aspects: durability, reparability, recyclability, climate efficiency and resource efficiency. This initiative is open to all operators through a licensing contract. It offers customers transparency on the environmental impact of smartphones (which peaks during the production phase) and is also aimed at encouraging manufacturers to improve the eco-design  of  their  products.  By  the  end  of  2021,  more  than 160  models  of  telephones  from  16  manufacturers  had  been assigned a rating. The devices on sale in stores and online through Orange in Spain and Poland already showed this rating at the end of 2021. The program is being rolled out in 2022 in other Orange countries in Europe, including France.\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  also  launched  its  first  smartphone  as  part  of an eco-design initiative: the Neva leaf. Its design is based on life cycle analyses in response to obsolescence. It has an excellent reparability  rating  (8.8/10),  thanks  to  its  robust  and  modular design which allows customers to replace the battery and screen themselves and its capacity to receive security software updates. To  minimize  its  environmental  footprint,  it  is  manufactured  from 20% recycled plastic. It is sold in more sustainable packaging (FCS, vegetable-based ink) and without a charger. The Neva leaf was commercially launched in France for the B2C and B2B markets simultaneously in August 2021. Orange aims to extend its marketing to other European countries in 2022, starting with Poland.\n\n## Giving network equipment a second life (Oscar program)\n\nTo reduce the impact of electronic waste on the environment, the Orange group strives to ensure obsolete devices are re-used or are  dismantled  for  recycling,  in  accordance  with  environmental standards in force.\n\nInternally, Orange has a 'marketplace,' a platform where network equipment can be refurbished and re-used, with the support of the manufacturers who guarantee its proper functioning. The re-use might  be  due  to  a  change  in  technology  between  countries,  or technological redeployment between different geographical areas.\n\nA  new  impetus  was  given  to  this  approach  to  offer  end-to-end support open to the outside world for any transactions aiming at the recertification of equipment. The process involves four stages:\n\n- -planning  entity  requirements,  in  particular  by  integrating purchasing  opportunities  for  refurbished  equipment  and decommissioning plans;\n- -working with equipment suppliers to encourage recertification when  choosing  suppliers.  Orange  benefits  from  the  levers of  its  partnerships  with  BuyIn  (purchasing  consortium  with Deutsche  Telekom  for  network  and  IS  equipment)  and  JAC (Alliance between operators initially built to pool supplier audits and  whose  functions  have  expanded  to  implementation  of circular economy principles in the supply chain); for instance Orange entered into an framework agreement with Nokia in October 2021 to increase the use of refurbished material in its telecommunications infrastructures, with a priority given on the mobile access network;\n- -providing  support  to  keep  the  'marketplace'  active  and optimize inventory management;\n- -developing recycling solutions for each subsidiary.\n\nWith  a  gradual  ramp-up  and  operational  implementation  since September 2020, more than 246,000 batches of equipment have been proposed for purchase or sale on this marketplace in 2021, generating close to 58 million euros in investment savings (CAPEX avoided or saved) for Orange.\n\n## Collection of unwanted mobiles\n\nOrange has set itself the target of collecting 30% of the mobiles it sells in Europe.\n\nThe collection rate of mobile phones in the Group's six European countries, excluding the activity of African workshops, was 20.4% in  2021,  compared  to  10.2%  in  2020.  Last  year,  the  collection rate saw a decline of 1.2 points compared to 2019 largely due to the closure of stores - which are also collection points - during lockdown periods.\n\nAcross  the  2020  collection  rate  scope,  covering  the  Group's European countries (France, Poland, Spain, Belgium, Slovakia and Romania) and including waste collected in the workshops in Africa at the initiative of Orange France, the collection rate in Europe was 25.7% in 2021, compared with the rate of 15.1% in 2020. Since 2010, Orange  has  teamed  up  with  Emma\u00fcs  International  and Ateliers du Bocage, a company in the social and solidarity employment sector, to open mobile waste collection workshops in Africa. In the absence of efficient local recycling structures, the collected waste is amassed and then sent to France for recycling in accordance with European environmental standards. Open in five countries (Burkina Faso, Benin, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Niger) these workshops collected the equivalent of 457,000 mobiles with waste status for recycling in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

For example, through this initiative, in Spain in 2021 17% of devices were given a second life among Orange customers without being directly collected by Orange.\n\n## Recovery of customer equipment under leasing contracts (boxes, set-up boxes, etc.)\n\nOrange's commitment is to collect more than 90% of customer equipment distributed under leasing contracts. This objective is part of the CORE (Collection tO REuse) program to improve the collection of equipment and the refurbishing rate (effectiveness of collection processes, reduction of collection times, etc.). It responds to  a  cost-saving  requirement,  to  risks  related  to  the  shortage  of electronic components and to increasing delivery delays.\n\nA meticulously run and monitored collection scheme ensures that as many used products as possible are recovered, sorted, tested, rebooted and refurbished as new so that they can be reused several times in their life cycles.\n\nIn Europe, we are now seeing significant maturity in the approach of several countries including France, Spain, Poland and Belgium in terms of collection, sorting, testing, repairing and refurbishing of multimedia equipment (boxes and set-up boxes, in particular) leased to customers to offer Internet access and content services.\n\nThe equipment targeted includes routers (boxes), set-up boxes and Optical Network Terminals (ONT) for B2C customers and mainly routers for the B2B market. The collection is from customers who have terminated their contract with Orange. Based on this definition, the collection rate at Group level was 67.0% in 2021 with more than 2.6 million items of equipment collected, compared with 68.6% in 2020 for 2.3 million items of equipment collected. In 2021, a major effort  was  made  in  all  the  countries  concerned  to  develop  and harmonize data reporting. In addition, the reporting scope already in  place  for  the  major  countries  of  Europe,  was extended to the countries of Central Europe (Romania and Slovakia) and the OMEA region (Senegal and Jordan). As a result, the 2021 and 2020 data are not directly comparable.\n\nThe refurbishing is entrusted to qualified subcontractors in Europe, overseen by the Supply Chain and Marketing teams in compliance with  the  principles  of  the  circular  economy,  processing  a  total volume of more than 4.3 million units returned to the active portfolio in 2021, thus avoiding the purchase of new equipment as much as possible.\n\n## Collection of client equipment under leasing contracts\n\n| % of contract terminations   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Belgium                      | 77%    |\n| Spain                        | 74%    |\n| France                       | 68%    |\n| Poland                       | 88%    |\n| Romania                      | 36%    |\n| Slovakia                     | N/A    |\n| Jordan                       | 47%    |\n| Senegal                      | 23%    |\n| Group Total                  | 67%    |\n\n## Sale of refurbished mobiles\n\nOrange has set itself the objective of achieving 10% of its phone sales  in  Europe  with  refurbished  devices  by  2025.  In  2021,  the majority of the countries in Europe have signed purchase contracts with refurbished mobile suppliers (mainly Apple phones and to a lesser degree Samsung phones) and have been able to offer them during 2021 to their customers in a market where demand is rapidly expanding.\n\n## Repair service\n\nBeyond the regulatory obligation to provide a standard guarantee service,  Orange  has  committed  to  developing  'attractive'  and competitive repair services in each of the countries in Europe to contribute to extending the useful life of mobile phones outside their guarantee period.\n\nThe  attractiveness  of  these  services  is  assessed  according  to five  criteria:  availability  of  the  service  on  different  distribution channels, autonomy given to the customer to carry out a diagnosis, predictability of the process, visibility of the status of the process, service continuity with the loan of a mobile during the repair. On this basis, a repair service is considered attractive if its assessment exceeds an average score of 75%.\n\n## Repair services attractiveness score\n\n| Score out of 100%   | 2021   |\n|---------------------|--------|\n| Belgium             | 55.0%  |\n| Spain               | 80.0%  |\n| France              | 82.5%  |\n| Luxembourg          | 42.5%  |\n| Moldova             | 47.5%  |\n| Poland              | 65.0%  |\n| Romania             | 67.5%  |\n| Slovakia            | 52.5%  |\n\nThe attractiveness of repair services increased in 2021 compared to 2020, despite a challenging context due to the pandemic and the supply of certain electronic parts. Only Orange Moldova still needs to  extend  its  repair  service  to  devices  outside  the  manufacturer guarantee.",

        "page_content": "## 4.2.1.2 Use of scarce and critical resources\n\n## Rare elements\n\nSince 2011, Orange has applied a process aimed at taking into account issues associated with the scarce and critical resources used in the Group's products:\n\n- -a database, updated regularly and containing data sheets on each material, serves as the basis for carrying out risk analyses and seeking alternative resources. Discussions are held with suppliers to encourage them to limit the use of these resources and  favor  alternative  and  recycled  resources;  in  its  impact analysis  carried  out  with  CDC  Biodiversit\u00e9  in  2021,  Orange identified  more  precisely  the  levels  of  pressure  exercised on the use of land (deforestation, loss of habitat, etc.), water consumption, different forms of pollution (by heavy materials, radioactivity, etc.) and ecotoxicity, in addition to the pollution and waste for 14 key minerals in the composition of its equipment. The risk is deemed high for five materials and medium for seven materials according to this analysis grid;\n- -the Group has opened discussions with industrial operators in  various  sectors  and  public  authorities  to  support  the development of efficient channels to exploit the vast reserves of scarce resources contained within WEEE - veritable 'urban mines'  that  may  contain  up  to  40  times  more  recoverable minerals than there are underground.\n\n## Soil use\n\nThe Group does not extend its control to the soil, except for the buildings in which it operates (offices and Data centers).\n\n## Paper consumption\n\nFor several years Orange has implemented programs to reduce its paper consumption or to use FSC-certified and/or recycled paper.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nThe  main  sources  of  water  consumption  in  the  Orange  group are  water  fountains,  restrooms,  canteens  and  the  technical air-conditioning systems of Data centers.\n\n## Releases into the air, soil and water\n\nThe  only  substances  released  into  the  environment,  with  the exception of CO2 emissions, are HCFCs used in cooling systems. Whenever possible, HCFCs are replaced with HFCs, and systems such as optimized ventilation and free cooling are put in place to reduce the use of air conditioners.\n\n## Food waste\n\nIn the context of the Group's activities, this issue relates to catering, which is mainly outsourced.\n\n## Taking into account nuisance specific to the activities of telecommunication operator\n\nRadio mobile relay antennas can sometimes negatively impact the landscape. In some countries (France and Egypt, among others), the Group has undertaken to blend a number of antennae into the\n\nenvironment and landscape by adapting them to the local style and context (painting, incorporation in buildings, etc.).\n\nThe  Group's  activity  only  generates  a  small  amount  of  noise pollution.  The  generators  deployed  around  certain  technical facilities  are  gradually  being  replaced  by  solar  energy  supply solutions, which considerably reduce noise pollution.\n\n## 4.2.1.3 Impact on biodiversity\n\nIn 2021, Orange conducted an impact study into the biodiversity of its activities, carried out thanks to the recognized expertise of the independent firm The Biodiversity Consultancy (TBC); this firm used the Global Biodiversity  Score  (GBS)  methodology  of  CDC biodiversit\u00e9, a subsidiary of Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations, which provides a standardized score for a company's biodiversity footprint (1) .  This  methodology uses the MSA.km\u00b2 (Mean Species Abundance) indicator that converts the company's impact to an area where 100% of biodiversity would be lost.\n\nThe study  concludes,  as  was  the  case  for  the  first  assessment conducted by the Group in 2013, that the Orange group has a low direct impact on biodiversity, with a Scope 1 static land score of 31 MSA.km\u00b2 and an almost zero static water score. It positions the Group's biodiversity impact, as related to its revenue, at less than half the average impact for Scope 1 (land) of all sectors combined. This  study  also  shows  that  Orange's  main  biodiversity  impact relates to Scope 3 (dynamic and static), in other words an indirect impact in which the Group has less room for maneuver. Work to assess the impact continues on this scope.\n\nWith its policy of investment in carbon sinks that contribute to the recovery of biodiversity and its commitment to the circular economy which reduces the exploitation of natural resources, Orange would have the potential to reduce its impact on biodiversity to Net Zero by around 2040, as for carbon. Orange is however waiting for the methodology issued by SBTi for Nature to be established to make a commitment in terms of its impact on biodiversity.\n\nAt the same time, Orange continues to support programs to better understand the impacts of climate change on biodiversity:\n\n- -as part of a partnership with the CREA (Center for Research on Altitude Ecosystems), through which Orange provides the CREA with its antennas, installed in  high  mountain  areas  to install sensors used to collect information on temperatures and levels of snow and ice, as well as the behavior of fauna and flora via photos and videos, on the Alpine Arc. Orange contributes to  the  processing  and  presentation  of  data  to  the  scientific community and the general public, with volunteer employees who  ensure  the  maintenance  of  the  dedicated  equipment and participate in observations of the flora and fauna of the Alps. This initiative received an award from the United Nations during COP23 - CREA Mont-Blanc and Orange were the 2017 recipients of the United Nations Momentum for Change prize;\n- -in  another  area,  in  partnership  with  ARGO  (an  international consortium  launched  in  2000  by  the  Intergovernmental Oceanographic  Commission  of  UNESCO  and  the  World Meteorological Organization), Orange Marine helped develop and maintain a global network of profiling floats, measuring the temperature and salinity of the oceans in real time. The new buoys are expected to incorporate biochemical data soon.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

        "page_content": "to  14.4%  of  total  electricity  consumption.  This  percentage  is  up 1.6 points compared to 2020 on a comparable basis.\n\nOnce again this year, the global health crisis had significant effects on energy consumption: the sharp increase in traffic on the networks was not associated with a sharp increase in energy consumption (increase of only 2.8% between 2021 and 2020 for energy on the network and IS), an increase in energy expenses related to travel (+3.8% between 2020 and 2021) after an exceptional year in 2020 and a fall in consumption related to office buildings.\n\nFor the three countries with the highest energy consumption or CO2 equivalent emissions,\n\n- -in France (48% of energy expenses and 14% of CO2 equivalent emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 of the Group in 2021), the slight recovery  in  energy  consumption  in  2021  (+1.1%)  was  due to  the  increase  in  energy  consumption  of  the  networks  and information system, partially offset by the drop in consumption of buildings. CO2 emissions were down 1%, mainly thanks to the initial benefits from renewable electricity contracts recognized in 2021;\n- -in Poland (11% of energy expenses and 28% of CO2 equivalent emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 in 2021), the reduction in energy consumption of 2.4% in 2021 compared to 2020 is mainly due to the reduction in energy consumption of the networks and information system. CO2 emissions were down 2.6%;\n- -in Egypt (6% of energy expenses and 14% of CO2 equivalent emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 in 2021), a slight reduction in energy consumption and CO2 emissions in 2021 compared to 2020 thanks to the sharp decline in the use of network fuel oil.\n\nFor  its  Scope  3,  Orange  publishes  information  each  year  on consumption based on the distances traveled by its employees; Scope 3 was assessed as a whole in accordance with the rules of the GHG Protocol. Its assessment is inherently more imprecise than that of Scopes 1 and 2. In 2020, the volume of the Group's total Scope 3 emissions was estimated, for 2018, at approximately 7.2  million  metric  tons  of  CO2  equivalent.  The  Group's  main Scope 3 items  are  the  subcategories:  purchases  of  goods  and services (around 30% of Scope 3 emissions), fixed assets (around 45% of Scope 3 emissions) and use of products sold (around 15% of Scope 3 emissions). A more fine-tuned and detailed assessment of Scope 3 is currently in progress, based in particular on more physical data, with the support of the specialist firm Carbone 4.\n\nAs part of its Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange has undertaken the following commitments:\n\n- -reduce  its  CO2 equivalent emissions by 30% by the end of the plan, compared to 2015; at the end of 2021, Orange had reduced its CO2 equivalent emissions by 12.1% compared to 2015, taking into account the added consumption of the three additional countries in the energy reporting at the end of 2021, i.e.  on  97.3%  of  the  Group's  revenue  and  considering  these same consumption levels in 2015 (assumption for simplification purposes  in  the  absence  of  available  data  for  2015).  By comparison to the figure of -12.3% CO2 equivalent emissions published for 2020 compared to 2015 on the scope of 97.0% of  the  Group's  revenue,  in  2021  Orange  reduced  its  CO2 equivalent emissions by 12.4% compared to 2015;\n- -meet more than 50% of its electricity needs from renewable sources by the end of the plan. At the end of 2021 and taking into account both its own actions and the energy mix of the countries  in  which  it  operates,  Orange  meets  36.3%  of  its electricity needs from renewable sources.\n\n## 4.2.2.1 Network energy consumption\n\nA vast energy action plan, Green ITN 2020, launched in 2008 to reduce energy consumption related to the operation of networks and information systems is continuing in a second phase with the 'Green Program' focused on the commitments for 2025. It relies in particular on new levers, such as the use of artificial intelligence,\n\nadvanced  standby  modes,  and  the  ramp-up  of  active  network sharing.\n\nIn 2021, the energy consumption of the network and the information system represents 82% of the Group's total consumption and 87% of CO2 equivalent emissions (consumption including that of buildings housing network equipment). The action plans implemented have made it possible to limit the Group's energy consumption (Scopes 1 & 2) to less than 3% in 2021 compared to 2020, despite a significant increase in traffic in 2021.\n\nFor the two largest energy-consuming countries in the Group:\n\n- -in  France,  the  change  in  energy  consumption  related  to networks  and  information  systems  remains  contained  (+3% between 2020 and 2021), thanks to actions aimed at improving efficiency,  and despite the increase in the number of mobile sites with the coverage of dead zones, the continued rollout of 4G and the ramp-up of 5G. From 2014 to 2018, the volume of data transported for mobile phones increased seven-fold, and the energy performance over the same period improved by 80% (i.e. quantity of electricity to transport 1 gigabyte);\n- -in  Poland,  the  change  in  energy  consumption  related  to networks and information systems between 2021 and 2020 was  -3%,  thanks  to  continuation  of  the  historical  networks decommissioning  plan  (copper  telephone  network,  ATM technology, etc.) and of energy efficiency action plans, including implementation  of  Big  Data  solution  to  control  and  manage electricity  consumption, placing mobile access networks on standby during the night, and modernization of the technical environment with the establishment of free cooling.\n\nThanks to the Green ITN program, between 2015 and 2020, close to 3.4 TWh of electricity and more than 190 million liters of fuel oil were saved across the Group's networks and information systems scope. These savings prevented the release of at least 3.3 million metric tons of CO2 over this period. During 2020, the actions taken avoided the consumption of 870 GWh of electricity and 72 million liters of fuel oil.\n\nThese  results  were  made  possible  by  a  series  of  measures introduced and the increased cooperation with equipment suppliers with  a  view  to  developing  and  obtaining  highly  energy-efficient telecommunication equipment.\n\nSharing of the network and the technical environment of the mobile access network, which generates the majority of energy expenses on the Group's network, is a powerful lever for reducing energy expenses. At the end of 2021, 53.8% of radio sites were shared, including 26.1% also for energy management. Based on studies carried out in Poland when active network sharing within the joint venture Networks! was set up, energy savings of around 30% were recorded.\n\nSimilarly,  the  increase  in  new  generations  of  radio  technology in  the  routing  of  traffic  allows  for  greater  energy  efficiency.  Each generation that arrives at maturity enables the energy consumption of 1 gigabyte transported to be reduced to approximately one-tenth of the initial consumption. With its targeted activation modes, 5G is efficient from an energy standpoint.\n\nThe rationalization of Data centers and their virtualization continues, with capacity rationalization, and optimization of the portfolio, their occupancy rate, and their energy efficiency. In France, following the example of the first eco-efficient data center commissioned in 2012, Orange has undertaken large-scale work to build two new Data centers, which replace some ten Data centers across the country. At equivalent capacity, an eco-efficient data center consumes 30% less than the old ones. Thus, the PUE (power usage efficiency) of a newly installed data center in France is less than 1.3. The average PUE of Data centers installed in France was 1.64 in 2021, compared to  1.65  in  2020  and  1.68  in  2019.  In  Poland,  Orange  has  also embarked on the construction of a new eco-efficient Data center based on the same model.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

In France, the decommissioning of copper will begin in 2023. For mobile networks, the Group plans for  the  gradual  phasing  out  of  the  2G  and  3G  generations  in  all European Union countries between 2025 and 2030.\n\nThe expansion of metering solutions continues on radio sites in particular; the trials conducted using artificial intelligence in 2021 on the usage of the resulting data allow for their optimization.\n\nIn 2021, innovation efforts were also made on assessing the impact of  changes  in  architecture  and  traffic  on  energy  consumption: this  involved  in  particular  the  rollout  of  10G/100G  interfaces  for optical access (XGS-PON technology), and 400G on the IP core side,  IP/optical  synergy,  etc.  These  new  architectures  allow  for 2.5 times less energy consumption for the same amount of traffic. Similarly, studies were launched on the implementation of specific functionalities such as placing cards on standby and the phasing out of chassis/cards/ports on fixed equipment.\n\nSince November 2021, Orange has had a new generation modular laboratory dedicated to innovation testing to reduce the Orange group's energy footprint.\n\n## 4.2.2.2 Other energy consumption\n\n## Reducing buildings emissions\n\nIn 2021, office buildings represented 9.1% of the Group's energy consumption and 8.4% of CO2 emissions, with the latter down 3.3% compared to 2020 on a comparable basis. Consumption for the years 2020 and to a lesser extent 2021 remain difficult to interpret due to the pandemic, which caused the closure of certain buildings.\n\nVarious actions were taken to improve the energy performance of buildings in France and to reduce CO2 emissions:\n\n- -the rollout of a digital platform for consumption management across all office and mixed sites, i.e. more than 2,000 sites, helped to improve monitoring of the energy consumed and to gain a predictive insight into consumption in kWh, in CO2 and in euros;\n- -the  real  estate  carbon  strategy  continued,  notably  with  the gradual  phasing  out  of  fuel  oil  furnaces,  the  reduction  in gas  furnaces,  the  management  of  cooling  fluids  and  the development of renewable energies (heat pumps, air treatment center  heat  recovery,  recovery  of  heat  from  the  network's technical environments, etc.). The operational HQE certification, led by the General Management System, helped to improve the energy performance of Orange major buildings across France;\n- -the methodology enabling compliance with the tertiary decree implementing the ELAN law (definition of eligible sites, reference consumption levels, action plans, etc.) has been prepared and deployed for application in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, Orange was awarded ten Cubes d'or and 25 podium positions including three major awards in the categories Energy Savings, Greenhouse Gases and Best Portfolio Improvement in the French Energy Savings Championship (Championnat de France des \u00e9conomies d'\u00e9nergie). For the 46 Orange sites competing in France, the savings achieved were 2.15 million euros and 21.2 GWh avoided, i.e. 2,712 metric tons CO2 equivalent avoided.\n\nIn the MEA region, Orange Sonatel won first prize in Communication and Awareness-raising.\n\n## Reducing transport emissions\n\nBusiness  travel  accounts  for  4.8%  of  the  Group's  energy consumption,  down  by  24%  compared  with  2019  (up  3.8% compared with 2020 taking into account the exceptional decline in travel in 2020), and 5.0% of CO2 equivalent emissions. Orange continues to roll out its action plans aimed at increasing the share of electrified vehicles in its fleet, limiting business travel, and promoting collective and shared transport methods.\n\nThe  Group  has  a  large  fleet  of  company  vehicles,  with  France representing three-fourths of the Group's fleet.\n\nThe size of the fleet in France has been constantly decreasing by more than 4% per year since 2015, falling below the threshold of 16,000 vehicles at the end of 2021, with the aim of continuing this decrease by more than a thousand vehicles by 2025. In France, Orange is now making the renewal of its fleet mandatory by avoiding diesel  technology,  which  emits  fine  particles  matter  (NOx),  and boosting the use of electrified vehicles to control its CO2 emissions.\n\nAt the end of 2021, Orange was using more than 2,200 electrified vehicles (+83% in one year). More than 1,100 charging points have been installed or are in the process of being installed since the start of  the  fleet  electrification  program,  and  have  been  networked  at nearly 200 Orange sites, now enabling supervision and monitoring of the terminals concerned. Each user of Orange's rechargeable electric vehicles has a web tool and a mobile app including a map of these charging stations and the ability to book them. Finally, these very  vehicles  are  equipped  with  cards  giving  them  access  to  a network of 30,000 charging points across France. The Group's aim is to be equipped with 7,000 electrified vehicles by 2025.\n\nLaunched in 2013 with around 100 vehicles, the car-sharing fleet exceeded 3,800 dedicated vehicles at the end of 2021. Orange thus has the largest car-sharing fleet in France and Europe and wishes to continue optimizing this fleet with 6,000 shared vehicles by 2025.\n\nFurthermore,  several  Group  entities  have  introduced  plans  to limit  the  use  of  private  cars  (company  travel  plans,  carpooling, car-sharing,  road  risk  management  and  eco-driving  training courses,  etc.).  For  example,  in  France,  Orange  SA's  car-pooling solution was offered to 27,250 employees.\n\nEmployees,  moreover,  have  solutions  allowing  them  to  reduce business  travel  (video-conferencing  and  other  tools  for  remote collaborative work). Orange has around 270 video conference rooms in France and close to an additional 100 in the rest of the world.\n\n## 4.2.2.3 Use of electricity from renewable sources\n\nTo meet its objective of obtaining 50% of its Scope 2 electricity supplies from renewable sources by 2025, Orange is developing a  strategy  across  all  its  geographies.  In  2021,  Orange  already used  36.3%  electricity  from  renewable  sources,  due  to  its  own production and taking into account the energy mix of countries in which the Group operates, versus 31.3% in 2020 on a comparable basis. Orange intend to meet this objective by prioritizing additional green energy production and by benefiting from decarbonization of the energy mix of the countries in which it operates.",

        "page_content": "In  Europe,  Orange  prioritizes  the  use  of  long-term  renewable electricity contracts at a known price (Purchase Power Agreement - PPA). At the end of 2021, the Group had entered into agreements of  this  type  for  a  total  capacity  of  almost  500  GWh  per  year, corresponding  to  10%  of  Orange's  electricity  consumption  in France, 9% of its electricity consumption in Poland and 50% of its electricity consumption in Spain.\n\nIn  addition,  certain  European  countries  have  used  energy  from renewable sources for their electricity supply (Scope 2) through consumption contracts with Guarantee of Origin (GoO) certificates: this  was  the  case  in  2021  for  OBS  International  for  34%  of  its Scope 2, for Orange Spain for 36%, for Orange Slovakia for 67% and for Orange Belgium for all of its electricity consumption.\n\nIn the MEA region, Orange has rolled out an extensive solarization program, with more than 6,000 solar sites equipped to power its infrastructures with photovoltaic solar panels at the end of 2021 (4,750 sites at end-2020), which represents more than 16% of all mobile sites in the MEA region; this program is carried out either through investments by the company itself or through long-term energy contract signed with ESCO (Energy Services Company):\n\nOrange  is  rolling  out  ESCO  solutions  in  the  MEA  region.  The aim  is  to  outsource  investment,  installation,  modernization  and operational  management of electricity generating infrastructures with a view to optimizing electricity consumption, supply reliability, its  environmental impact and energy costs. These projects were rolled out in eight countries in the MEA region: Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Guinea Conakry, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Central African Republic, Liberia and Cameroon. The implementation of this program should continue in other countries in the area. Orange undertook to extend some of these solar fields to benefit neighboring populations, with a first mini-grid operational in the DRC in November 2021.\n\nThis  program  is  supplemented  by  the  implementation  of  hybrid generator/battery sites allowing for a significant reduction in the consumption of fuel oil thanks to optimization of the process.\n\nOrange is also developing an electricity production program thanks to solar plants. In Jordan, nearly 70% of the electricity required for Orange operations is covered by electricity from three solar plants. This solution will also be rolled out in Mali, with plans to extend it to others countries as soon as the regulatory energy framework allows for  solar  farm  deployment and self-consumption through energy network transport and distribution (wheeling).\n\nOrange thus makes:\n\n- -annual generation from renewable sources of 117 GWh;\n- -taking into account the factors of CO2 emission from the energy mix  of  these  countries  of  the  MEA  region,  the  use  of  these programs made it possible to avoid the emissions of more than 175,000 metric tons of CO2 in 2021, i.e. 13.4% of the Group's emissions (Scopes 1 and 2). This reduces fuel consumption by 65 million liters, i.e. up to 80%, depending on the site.\n\nIn 2021, the technical site solarization program was extended to partial solarization of office buildings and Data centers, both in the MEA region and in Europe.\n\nFor example, in January 2022 Orange signed an EAAS (Energy As A Service) contract with ENGIE to solarize the Groupement Orange Services  located  in  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire  (GOS  -  pooling  entity  serving 18 subsidiaries of Orange Middle East and Africa (OMEA), providing services for the hosting and use of pooled infrastructure, service and IT platforms) through the installation of a photovoltaic plant, on the roof and sun shades of solar parking lots, with a total installed power  of  355  kWc  covering  close  to  60%  of  the  Data  center's day-time consumption (7 am to 6 pm). Commissioning is planned for the second half of 2022.\n\n## 4.2.2.4 Implementation of the carbon sequestration program\n\nFor  the  portion  of  unavoidable  residual  carbon  emissions, Orange  has  opted  to  prioritize  carbon  sequestration  through the  implementation  of  natural  carbon  sink  systems  (forests, mangroves, etc.) to be able to physically and sustainably capture carbon in the atmosphere. Orange's initiatives are gradually taking shape, with priority given to the economic and social development of regions, to the impacts on the populations concerned by these projects, and the positive impacts on biodiversity:\n\n- -through local projects, like the partnership with Alliance For\u00eats Bois  signed  in  October  2021  to  finance  the  reforestation of  around  175  hectares  of  forests  in  mainland  France,  a partnership  in  Senegal  with  N\u00e9b\u00e9day  for  the  plantation  of 100,000 trees in five years, the reforestation of pines in Spain, a partnership project with Plan\u00e8te Urgence in Cameroon, etc;\n- -with a stake in the multi-investor fund Livelihoods Carbon Fund 3;\n- -with Orange Nature, an innovative single-investor carbon fund with 50 million euros launched by Orange in December 2021 in  partnership  with  the  asset  management  company  Mirova (Natixis Investment Managers) and which exclusively targets a payment in kind in the form of high quality carbon credits.\n\nO\n\n- 4\n\n4",

Orange  Business  Services  offers  its  B2B  and  governmental customers  remote  work,  video-conferencing  and  virtual  IT infrastructure  services  that,  under  certain  conditions,  enable greenhouse  gas  emissions  to  be  reduced  (see  Section  1.4.4 Enterprise). -\n\nIn  2021,  Orange  started  to  identify  in  its  activity  portfolio  the products  and  services  it  offers  which  allow  these  Enterprise customers  to  reduce  their  environmental  footprint,  based  on  a customer case study or based on types of offers selected by the industry  as  a  solution  to  reduce  environmental  footprint.  These assessments are part of the Group's gradual alignment with the TCFD  recommendations.  Through  this  first  approach  it  was possible to identify Orange Business Service revenue related to this selection of offers and services in excess of 1 billion in 2021. The offers selected are listed below.\n\nOrange also offers and implements tools that significantly improve climate  change  monitoring  and  raise  public  awareness  (see Section 4.2.1.3 Impacts on biodiversity).\n\nOrange is developing innovative solutions with the ability to meet the objectives of implementing the circular economy and optimizing the consumption of resources, including energy.\n\n## First catalog of eco-green offers\n\nIn 2021, Orange Business Services created its first catalog of offers which take into account environmental footprint in their design; it comprises various solutions:\n\n- -digital information exchange solutions:\n- -teleworking solutions: Ademe estimated (1) that teleworking can reduce travel by 69% and distances traveled by 39%, which in France translates to a reduction of 3,300 metric tons of CO2 per day, or 817,000 metric tons of CO2 per year and 1.3% of all CO2 emissions released by cars in France (Ademe, July 2020),\n\n- -solutions for audio-conference bridges, highly secure OVP Advanced virtual rooms;\n- solutions focused on innovation in the design of products and services:\n- -eco-design  of  website  and  mobile  application  software developments,\n- -eco-management of mobile fleets: introduction of an offer for  businesses  of  refurbished  mobiles,  an  extended  life cycle of offers, integration of recycling into design of the offer,\n- -virtualization of private infrastructures offer;\n- -solutions focused on new applications of the IoT (Internet of Things):\n- -Smart  Eco  \u00c9nergie  to  monitor  and  optimize  the  energy performance  of  the  building  portfolio.  In  France,  this solution  enables  compliance  with  the  tertiary  decree  of the ELAN law. This decree imposes a reduction in energy consumption of 40%, 50% and 60% respectively by 2030, 2040 and 2050 for all office buildings larger than 1,000 m\u00b2, i.e. 17% of national energy consumption,\n- -Oc\u00e9an Fleet Management solution to optimize the use of fleets of vehicles or boats,\n- -smart metering as a form of preventive management and detection of anomalies in flows.\n\n## Environmental consulting and audit\n\nOrange Consulting and Orange Innovation work together to offer customers the possibility to optimize their digital carbon footprint and to be able to take this environmental aspect into account in their  investment decision. Orange thus provides a digital carbon footprint calculator customized to the specific requirements of the company.\n\nOrange  also  joined  forces  with  ENGIE  to  offer,  through  'ENGIE Impact!,' expertise on the combined IT component in companies' energy master plans.\n\nBased  on  this  model,  Orange  works  through  a  co-innovation initiative with business customers to develop this expertise.",

Orange will add to  the  table  as  it  continues  to  align  its  operations  with  the TCFD's recommendations.\n\nFor  the  purposes  of  the  table,  Orange  defines  short-term  as the  current  strategic  plan  (Engage  2025  covering  the  period 2020-2025), the medium term as 2030, and the long term as 2050.\n\nThe Group has already achieved a significant level  of  alignment with the nine recommendations identified by Orange. Furthermore, recommendation no. 5 was the subject of additional work in 2021:\n\n- -as  a  member  of  the  ITU,  Orange  has  made  a  significant contribution to the definition of sector trajectories for digital at the global level, respecting an average warming target limited to 1.5\u00b0C compared to pre-industrial levels. This work was carried out  in  cooperation  with  the  GSMA,  GeSI,  the  International Energy  Agency  and  SBTi.  The  associated  recommendation ITU-T L. 1470 is available (1) ; a specific guide for operators was published in the first half of 2020 jointly with SBTi (2) ;\n- -in 2021, Orange identified internal correspondents representing each  business  (risk,  finance,  purchasing,  CSR,  etc.)  to further  improve  compliance  with  the  TCFD's  four  pillars  of recommendations.  Specific  areas  for  action  were  identified for 2022 with the support of the consultancy firm Carbone 4, particularly to promote work related to Scope 3 and improve alignment of the Section 'indicators and objectives.' Orange plans to report all of its Scope 3 emissions on all significant emissions items, as described by the GHG Protocol;\n\n- -Orange carried out a full assessment of the risks associated with climate change in 2021, taking into account the physical risks  and  transition  risks,  with  the  participation  of  the  main businesses and all regions of the Group. The Group also has a study on the physical resilience of its businesses in relation to a climate warming scenario of more than 3\u00b0C compared to the  pre-industrial  era  (equivalent  to  IPCC  scenario  RCP4.5). This  study,  initially  carried  out  on  the  scope  of  France, consisted  of  reviewing  past  impacts  according  to  climatic hazards  and  network  components  (Data  centers,  Optical/ Subscriber connection nodes, cables, poles, antennas, etc.). Climatic  sensitivity  thresholds  were  thus  identified,  focusing on  highest-risk  hazards  (heat  waves,  strong  winds,  intense rainfall,  lightning  strikes,  wildfires).  These  climate  indicators were then projected according to two time horizons (2030 and 2050),  based  on  data  from  M\u00e9t\u00e9o  France.  The  project  was subsequently extended to the other countries where the Group i s present, with the same projection of climate indicators to 2030 and based on data from four climate models used in the IPCC's work (3) .  Following  this  risk  identification  work  carried  out  in 2021 by the Risk Department, with the Group CSR Department and all of the businesses concerned, in 2022 the Group will continue its work aimed at assessing the climate-related risks and exploiting the opportunities to be defined;\n- -in  addition,  an  assessment  of  the  financial  risks  and opportunities associated with the climate was updated as part of the response to the CDP questionnaire. These assessments give  orders  of  magnitude  relating,  for  example,  to  the  risks of  losses  and  opportunities  for  gains  linked  to  changes  in customer behavior, changes in energy costs and actions to guard against cost increases.\n\nO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

taxonomy\n\nIn accordance with European Regulation 2020/852 of 18 June 2020 on  the  establishment  of  a  framework  to  facilitate  sustainable investment within the European Union and its annexes and with the Commission Delegated Regulation of 6 July 2021, Orange is subject  to  the  obligation  to  publish  key  performance  indicators such as the proportion of its revenue, capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) arising from services associated with economic activities that may be considered environmentally sustainable.\n\nThis classification system, known as the EU Taxonomy, establishes a list of economic activities considered environmentally sustainable based  on  technical  criteria,  in  line  with  the  European  Union's environmental objectives. This regulation is subject to change and the economic activities currently considered sustainable within the meaning of the EU Taxonomy are likely to be reassessed.\n\nThe  EU  Taxonomy  examined  13  sectors  of  activity  which  are described  in  Annexes  1  and  2  of  the  Commission  Delegated Regulation of 4 June 2021. The European Commission's approach is progressive; thus as a priority, the sectors of activity responsible\n\nfor the highest greenhouse gas emissions have been the subject of these first texts. Analysis of the eligibility of different sectors should evolve in line with the maturity of the Commission's work.\n\nThe majority of the activities for the provision of telecommunications services to B2C and B2B customers and other telecommunications operators is not, to date, included in the scope covered by Annexes 1 and 2 to the Commission Delegated Regulation of 4 June 2021 and as a result, the majority of Orange activities are not eligible for the EU Taxonomy at this time, although the Group believes that its  activities  can  make  a  positive  contribution  to  the  adaptation and  mitigation  of  climate  change  (see  Section  4.2.3  Business opportunities associated with reducing the environmental footprint).\n\nThe operational activities of the Mobile Financial Services segment (primarily including Orange Bank) were taken into account in the analysis and are not considered eligible activities. In fact, they do not contribute to the Group's revenue due to their nature and remain insignificant  in  comparison  to  the  telecommunication  services activities provided by Orange. (see Section 1.4.6 Mobile Financial Services and Section 3.3, Note 1 Definition of operating segments and performance indicators).",

For information, OPEX related to eligible and individually eligible activities represented 0.7% of  the  total  OPEX  related  to  external  purchases,  other  operating income and expenses, and labor expenses.\n\n## Note on methodology - EU Taxonomy\n\nTo calculate the performance indicators related to the EU Taxonomy, the Orange group used the following assumptions:\n\n- -numerator of the indicator on CAPEX:\n- -eligible CAPEX related to research and development was estimated based on average costs and relates to patents belonging to the following categories of the classification established  by  the  European  Patent  Office:  'Y02 Technologies or applications for mitigation or adaptation against  climate  change'  and  'Y04S  Systems  integrating technologies  related  to  power  network  operation, communication or information technologies for improving the electrical power generation, transmission, distribution, management or usage, i.e. smart grids';\n- -numerator of the indicator on OPEX:\n- -OPEX  related  to  eligible  activities  8.1  Data  processing, hosting and related activities and 8.2 Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions was estimated using the tool\n\n- for the allocation of direct and indirect costs to the different business lines of the Orange Business Services division,\n- -the eligible OPEX related to research and development was estimated based on average costs and relates to patents belonging to the following categories of the classification established  by  the  European  Patent  Office:  'Y02 Technologies or applications for mitigation or adaptation against climate change'  and  'Y04S Systems integrating technologies  related  to  power  network  operation, communication or information technologies for improving the electrical power generation, transmission, distribution, management or usage, i.e. smart grids',\n- -eligible  OPEX  related  to  the  company  vehicle  fleet  was estimated  based  on  the  proportion  of  the  vehicle  fleet at  November  30,  2021  composed  of  hybrid  or  electric vehicles, applied to the total expenditure on rental charges, service costs, maintenance and reconditioning of vehicles estimated over the period,\n- -OPEX  related  to  employees  in  charge  of  maintenance for  the  eligible  activities  within  the  meaning  of  the  EU Taxonomy was estimated based on an assumption of 1.4% of  the  payroll  costs  over  12  rolling  months  allocated  to assets belonging to the employment category 'Operation and maintenance' in the classification of employees used by the Orange group. This assumption is in line with the proportion  of  the  Group's  revenue  eligible  within  the meaning of the EU Taxonomy;\n- -denominator of the indicator on OPEX:\n- -OPEX  related  to  employees  in  charge  of  maintenance was estimated based on the payroll costs over 12 rolling months allocated to assets belonging to the employment category 'Operation and maintenance' in the classification of employees used by the Orange group.\n\n## 4.2.4.3 Financing related to environmental performance\n\nIn September 2020, Orange published its 'Sustainability financing framework' with a view to issuing bonds backed by its investments in  social  or  environmental  areas.  The  first  bond  issue  of  this program for an amount of 500 million euros, for a maturity of nine years and an annual coupon rate of 0.125% was more than five times oversubscribed. It enabled Orange to extend its investor base and pursue its policy to optimize its financing structure.\n\nThe first allocation and impact report published in 2021 detailed the  projects  selected,  the  funds  concerned  and  the  impacts  of each  project  category.  At  the  end  of  2020,  nearly  328  million euros made it possible to finance, on the social side, the rollout of  fiber  in  rural  France  as  part  of  the  digital  inclusion  category, with 361,000 beneficiaries, investments in 17 start-ups via Orange Ventures for social inclusion; on the environmental side, Orange selected the sharing of infrastructure in Poland for the energy efficiency  category  with  close  to  106,000  metric  tons  of  CO2 emissions  avoided,  and  the  refurbishing  of  boxes  in  France  for the circular economy category, with more than 4.8 million items of equipment concerned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

This is particularly the case for Orange France data.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4 -\n\n## Note on methodology - Environment\n\n## Reporting scope\n\nThe  data  shown  cover  the  entire  consolidated  financial  scope, unless otherwise mentioned.\n\nThe  international  reporting  by  Orange  Business  Services  was limited  to  11  countries  (84  sites)  in  the  67  countries (1) where  it operates. These countries represent 76% of the OBS International workforce and 65% of the occupied floor space of its buildings (in  square  meters),  namely,  Australia,  Brazil,  Switzerland,  Egypt, Germany, India, Mauritius, Russia, Singapore, the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs  regards  the  consumption  of  electrical  energy,  the  OBS International reporting is based on 157 sites in 39 (2) ) countries where OBS is located. These countries represent 83% of the occupied floor space of its buildings (in square meters) outside of France.\n\nElettra, a subsidiary of the Orange group with a cable ship business, is excluded from the reporting scope to date.\n\nThe reporting on energy data includes in 2021 the consideration of 3 new subsidiaries located in Burkina Faso, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nThe  environmental  reporting  of  this  section  is  based  on  a non-financial information system. The key indicators are subject to  quarterly  reporting  at  country  level  and  indicators  of  lesser materiality for the Group are reported every six months or annually.\n\nThe changes in methodology that had a Group-level effect greater than or equal to 5% of the indicator or a country-level effect greater than or equal to 20% of the indicator, and data updates following receipt of actual figures that had a significant effect on the Group are calculated on a comparable basis (pro forma). Adjusted data for the prior year in the report are thus indicated in the notes of each of the tables.\n\n## Characteristics of the indicators\n\n## Environmental Management System\n\nThe  'Group  ISO  14001  certification  rate'  KPI  is  the  ratio  of electrical  energy  consumed  by  all  areas  of  the  Group  that  are ISO 14001 certified over the total electrical energy consumed by the Group.\n\nIt is calculated across the entities or divisions consolidated by the Group.\n\n## Mobile phones collected\n\nCalculation  of  mobile  phones  collected  takes  into  consideration five collection streams: responsible citizen collection, collection of mobile phone waste in Africa, B2C redemption offers, Enterprise redemption offers, and after-sales service returns. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of mobile handsets collected by the number of new mobile handsets sold by Orange through controlled channels, over the same period.\n\n## Evacuated waste and recovered waste\n\nEvacuated  waste  is  waste  that  is  no  longer  stored  on  Group premises  or  that  is  no  longer  under  its  direct  control,  as  it  is entrusted to a service provider or an external organization, with or without a financial transaction. Recovered waste is waste that has been recovered in the form of reuse, recycling, and material or energy recovery. These concepts apply for European countries.\n\nFor  non-European  countries,  and  taking  into  consideration  the gradual set-up of structured channels, the quantities of recovered waste concern, more broadly, all quantities of evacuated waste that have been sold.\n\nFor waste indicators, excluding the indicator 'Collection rate of used mobiles', the reporting process must be strengthened, particularly in  countries  outside  Europe.  The  latter  still  include  local  sectors that are not very mature, impacting the monitoring of waste and its treatment after removal. This scope corresponds to less than 20% of Group consolidated revenue, and contributes to 5% of the total tonnage of consolidated waste.\n\nFluorescent  bulbs,  PCB  (polychlorinated  biphenyls)  and  printer cartridge waste have been accounted for under 'Other hazardous waste'.\n\nDifferent specific service providers are involved according to the type of waste concerned (copper cables, paper, network equipment, batteries, wooden poles, etc.). Special attention is given to wooden poles  in  order  to  prohibit  their  reuse,  taking  into  consideration regulatory restrictions, and to ensure their appropriate destruction.\n\nFor leased sites, household or similar waste is not recoded as it is managed by the lessors.\n\nWEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) collected from B2C customers is  WEEE  (mobile  handsets,  fixed  handsets  and multimedia) returned to sales points, sent by mail or collected by service providers on behalf of Orange.\n\nThis  indicator  includes  the  mobile  telephones  of  the  Group's employees. It  includes  batteries  and  rechargeable  cells  that  are part of equipment when it is returned by customers, and the other types of batteries and rechargeable cells collected separately at the various collection points.\n\nLikewise,  for  tertiary  and  network  waste  not  including  customer WEEE, in France, only waste handled by a service provider that has signed a framework agreement with the Orange group is added to the reporting, except for a limited number of types of Orange Marine waste. These service providers represent the majority of the waste handled. For the 2021 fiscal year, Network WEEE data for the fourth quarter are not yet available and have been estimated. Waste from the dismantling of telephone booths is included in the 'Other non-hazardous waste' indicator for aluminum, stainless steel, steel, glass and in the 'network WEEE' indicator for WEEE.\n\nFor  OBS  in  France,  reused  WEEE  waste  is  recognized  as recovered  and  action  plans  are  being  implemented  to  increase reporting coverage. WEEE from OBS France's B2B customers is not recognized in this Customer WEEE indicator, but rather in the internal WEEE (network) indicator.",

The company restaurants are the sole responsibility of the Works Councils and are not included in the Orange group's consolidation scope.\n\nFollowing  an  evaluation,  the  Group  believes  that  the  volumes i nvolved are not significant enough to warrant setting up a restrictive and verifiable process of collecting and consolidating data on water consumption.\n\n## Energy\n\nThe energy used by Data centers, buildings and stores is calculated using the online control tool that measures and controls in real time all of the buildings' systems, including IT, air conditioning, UPS, etc.\n\nThe  energy  consumption  of  Orange  France  is  partly  based  on estimates:\n\n- -data for office buildings, including fuel oil, relating to the fourth quarter are derived from the average of the first nine months of the year;\n- -data for IT and networks are estimated from the 4th quarter data known and extrapolated on the basis of the equipment park;\n- -data for business travel are estimated on the basis of the first three quarters, applying a coefficient relating to the decline in historical activity over the last quarter.\n\nEnergy use by the Orange Spain network is extrapolated based on  invoices  supplied  by  the  electricity  supply  companies.  The electricity consumption of Poland is calculated using a statistical sampling of invoices received during the year.\n\nThe  'fuel  oil  consumption  (all  buildings  and  all  uses)'  indicator comprises consumption (excluding vehicles) of domestic fuel oil, diesel  and  gasoline,  as  well  as  marine  heavy  fuel  oil  and  diesel for Orange Marine's fleet. Fuel consumption is not counted in the countries of the MEA zone when it is not directly invoiced to Orange.\n\nThe energy consumption of buildings - in particular stores - for which the Orange group is not directly invoiced, is not recorded. The consumption of energy from urban heating plants is not recognized due to the difficulty of estimating the associated CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen sharing networks with a third-party operator in which the technical environment is shared, only the electricity purchased by Orange for its own sites is recorded; this rule applies due to the fairly balanced nature of the sharing.\n\nThe  Group's  share  of  renewable  energies  takes  into  account the share of renewable energy in each country according to IEA (International Energy Agency) data in its updated version for 2021 in proportion to Orange's consumption in each of these countries, restated for consumption of Orange's own renewable energy (own production).\n\n## Accounting for fuel oil in the MEA zone on a comparable basis\n\nThe fuel conversion coefficient used until 2020 on the Group's ITN perimeter to transform the m\u00b3 of fuel oil consumed into GWh and to\n\nconsolidate the energy consumption produced by the generators had been defined according to the GHG protocol method.\n\nAfter  installing  a  complete  monitoring  system  for  electricity consumption in several of the Group's subsidiaries in the MEA zone and analysing electricity consumption on the perimeters concerned, a significant discrepancy was found on the 2020 reference data between  the  values  measured  by  the  installed  monitoring  and the conversion values of the volume of fuel oil consumed. After technical analysis, the average conversion coefficient of the m\u00b3 of fuel oil consumed in electric GWh was revised in order to be in line with the values measured and reported by our monitoring systems. This new coefficient and its calculation method have been validated by Carbone 4 and Statutory Auditors, appointed as independent third party.\n\nThe  method  of  consolidating  electricity  consumption  adopted by  the  Orange  group  on  its  ITN  perimeter  (diesel  fuel  oil  from generators) is as follows:\n\n## From 2021:\n\n- -for  the  Group's  subsidiaries  benefiting  from  a  monitoring system,  the  consumption  data  comes  from  the  installed monitoring;\n- -for  the  Group's  subsidiaries  that  do  not  yet  benefit  from  a monitoring  system,  the  conversion  of  m\u00b3  of  diesel  fuel  oil consumed into electric GWh is carried out on the basis of the new coefficient.\n\nBetween 2015 and 2020:\n\n- -The  adjustment  of  the  consumption  data  corresponding  to the m\u00b3 of diesel fuel oil consumed in electric GWh was carried out on the basis of the new coefficient.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)\n\nThe calculation  of  GHG  emissions  from  scope  2  of  each  of  the countries of the Group is derived from the electricity consumption of each entity to which the energy mix of each country is applied, after deduction of the share of electricity supply from renewable sources directly  acquired  through  consumer  contracts  with  certificate  of guarantee of origin (CGO) from suppliers, or from Orange's various programs to supply electricity from renewable sources (PPA, Esco, solar farms, solarization of sites,\u2026).\n\nFor the 2021 emissions related to electricity consumption, the IEA emissions factors in its updated version of September 2021 were used for all countries. Emissions from previous years have not been restated  for  these  new  emission  factors.  The  emissions  factors used for other fuels (natural gas, fuel oil, coal, gasoline, diesel and LPG) come from the GHG Protocol.\n\nRefrigerant emissions are not exhaustive; even though this emission item is negligible (Carbon 4 study on the Group's carbon footprint), the Group is working to improve monitoring of these emissions.\n\nWith regard to transport, the GHG Protocol 'short-haul' air transport emissions factor (180 g of CO2/passenger km) was used for all flights (short-,  medium-  and  long-haul),  suggesting  overestimation  of emissions from this mode of transport. The rail transport emissions factor is taken from the Bilan Carbone\u2122 (Carbon Footprint) method when  this  is  available  for  the  corresponding  country;  for  other countries, a standard factor of 100 g of CO2/passenger/km is used.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

These data are complemented by those taken from the Group's financial information system.\n\nFor the sixth year running, Orange received 'Top Employer Global' certification  in  February  2021.  This  label  recognizes  the  best policies and practices in terms of human resources. Orange did not carry out the procedure for the 2022 label.\n\n## 4.3.1 Employment\n\n## General changes in the number of Group employees\n\nIn 2021, the Orange group experienced several changes in terms of scope. Internationally, the main change related to the inclusion of  two  Romanian  telecommunications  companies,  Telekom Romania (2,903 permanent employment contracts) and Nextgen (406 permanent employment contracts) in the Europe division in the last quarter. Three other movements took place during the fiscal year: the respective departures of Business & Decision North America (OBS division: -35 permanent contracts) and Sofrecom Argentina (Corporate division: -255 permanent contracts), and the inclusion of the Belgium company Anytime (+54 permanent contracts) within the Mobile Financial Services division. The Group also experienced internal changes, with the integration of the Sofrecom companies in  the  Corporate division, the creation of the Totem company to manage  the  Towerco  activities  in  France  and  Spain  and  of  the company  Orange  Concession  (which  supports  local  authorities in the digital development of their region), in partnership with a consortium comprising several players, a company which was then removed from the Group's scope of consolidation.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Group had 139,698 active employees, of whom 136,928  were  on  permanent  contracts  and  2,770  on  fixed-term contracts. The number of permanent contracts was down 4.2% (-5,959)  on  a  comparable basis, with fixed-term contracts down 7.1% (-211). These trends vary depending on the different scopes.\n\nThey  were  mainly  driven  by  France,  where  the  Group  had 78,435  employees  at  the  end  of  December,  breaking  down  as 77,377  permanent  and  1,058  fixed-term  contracts,  a  decline of  3,915  active  employees  (-4.8%),  i.e.  -3,843  permanent  and -72 fixed-term contracts. The decline was attributable to Orange SA (-4,463  permanent  contracts,  i.e.  -6.3%),  with  the  permanent\n\ncontracts of the French subsidiaries increasing by 5.8% (+620). The reduction in fixed-term contracts (-72, i.e. -6.4%) was also driven by the parent company (-163, i.e. -20.9%), a decrease partially offset by the increase in this population within the French subsidiaries (+91, i.e. +26.1%).\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  59,551  employees  on  permanent  contracts worked outside France, down 3.4% (-2,116 permanent contracts) on  a  comparable  basis  (but  up  1,571,  i.e.  +2.7%  on  a  historical basis, in particular after the integration of the two new Romanian companies). This situation masks a number of differences:\n\n- -OBS international continues to increase its permanent workforce (+383 permanent contracts, i.e. +2.5%) in emerging markets (Egypt, India, Morocco and Mauritius) within the company Equant, as well as in the Scandinavian companies of Orange Cyberdefense;\n- -the  Europe  division  posted  a  decline  (-2,005  permanent contracts, i.e. -6.7% on a comparable basis) stemming from the decrease in employees in Orange Spain (-831 permanent contracts,  i.e.  -11.2%),  Orange  Poland  (-775  permanent contracts,  i.e.-7.0%)  and  the  Central  Europe  segment (-397 permanent contracts, i.e. -4.1%, a trend driven by the two Romanian acquisitions), with Orange Belgium remaining stable;\n- -the Middle East & Africa division also posted a decrease in its permanent workforce between 2020 (on a comparable basis) and 2021 (-346 permanent contracts, i.e. -2.5%).\n\nIn terms of average full-time equivalent employees (FTEs) (monthly average  over  the  year),  the  Group's  internal  workforce  was 132,002 FTEs at the end of 2021. This represents a reduction of 2,670 FTEs (-2.0%) on a comparable basis, a trend mainly driven by France (Orange SA).\n\n| Number of employees - active employees at end of period   | 2021        | 2020    | 2020 on a comparable  basis   | 2019    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Orange SA                                                 | 66,599      | 71,297  | 71,225                        | 76,301  |\n| French subsidiaries                                       | 11,836      | 11,125  | 11,125                        | 10,941  |\n| Total France  (1)                                         | 78,435      | 82,422  | 82,350                        | 87,242  |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)                           | 61,263      | 59,728  | 63,519                        | 59,526  |\n| Group total                                               | \u00fc\u00fc  139,698 | 142,150 | 145,869                       | 146,768 |\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  the  Group  had  2,770  employees  on fixed-term contracts, nearly 62% of whom were outside France. Between 2021 and 2020 on a comparable basis, this head count was down by 7.1% (i.e. -211 fixed-term contracts), a trend driven by countries outside France (-139. employees or -7.5%).\n\nThis additional workforce, which represented 2.0% of the workforce at the end of 2021 (stable compared with 2020), is marginal. At the end of 2021, almost half of all employees on fixed-term contracts were working in customer-facing activities (primarily sales and services for B2C customers). The innovation and technology businesses (information systems and networks) are their second sector of activity (19%).\n\n| Employees by contract type   | 2021        | 2020    | 2020 on a comparable  basis   | 2019    |\n|------------------------------|-------------|---------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Permanent contracts          | 136,928     | 139,269 | 142,887                       | 143,526 |\n| Fixed-term contracts         | 2,770       | 2,881   | 2,982                         | 3,242   |\n| Group total                  | \u00fc\u00fc  139,698 | 142,150 | 145,869                       | 146,768 |",

Accordingly, the number of outside hires on permanent contracts made in 2021 by the Group was 9,200, up 12.8% compared to 2020, a year in which external recruitments saw a sharp decline, in a context heavily affected by the health crisis.\n\nThere were close to 2,200 recruitments in France in 2021, which exceeded by almost 9% the minimum projection forecast in the intergenerational agreement of December 12, 2018. Anticipating the impact of retirements, these recruitments will also support the Group's transformation and intensify the acquisition of new skills, by renewing generations (more than half of the employees recruited are under 30). As was the case in 2020, over 80% of new hires\n\nare in the 'Innovation and Technology' and 'Customer' business lines. These new arrivals, more than 55% of whom are based in the growing French subsidiaries of the OBS division (OBS SA, Orange Cyberdefense and Business & Decision), continue to develop their expertise, particularly in software production design, data analysis, consulting and information systems integration, or cybersecurity.\n\nIn the rest of the world, recruitments totaled 7,005 in 2021, more than 75% of which were within the Innovation and Technology and the Customer business lines. The increase recorded compared with 2020 (+872, i.e. +14.2%), which was accompanied by the increase in definitive departures (+48.1%) in this scope but without offsetting them, was observed mainly (70% of the total) in the Innovation and Technology business line. This increase was mainly driven by the OBS division (85% of the trend) and to a more moderate extent by the Europe division:\n\nO\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The sharp rise in competition resulting from this explains the increased number of departures (+17.9%, i.e. +2,226 departures compared with 2020), driven above all by resignations. This trend was more pronounced internationally  (13.5%  turnover  rate  excluding  retirement  in  2021) than in France (1.9% turnover rate excluding retirement).\n\nIn France, there were fewer departures than in 2020, down 8.9% (-590),  with  6,010  departures  recorded  in  2021,  including  more than 85% departures due to retirement, almost exclusively in the parent  company.  This  trend  was  mainly  driven  by  the  decrease in  the  number of retirements at Orange SA (-827, i.e. -15.8%), in\n\nline  with  the  age  structure.  The  downward  trend  in  the  parent company was partly offset by an increase in resignations in the French subsidiaries (+126, i.e. 26.4%), mainly in the subsidiaries of the OBS division with hard-to-fill positions (software design, data experts, etc.) in the job market. Given these specificities, turnover rates  excluding  retirements  differ  between  Orange  SA  (1.0%  in 2021) and the French subsidiaries (7.7%).\n\nInternationally, however, the number of departures posted a sharp increase of almost 50%, i.e. 2,816 more departures compared with 2020. This increase was mainly driven by resignations (+2,283, i.e. + 67.0%), which account for 80% of the total increase and were up significantly across all divisions, on job markets under increasing tension.\n\n| Number of permanent employee resignations   | 2021      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA                                   | 211       | 198    | 189    |\n| French subsidiaries                         | 604       | 478    | 722    |\n| Total France  (1)                           | 815       | 676    | 911    |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)             | 5,689     | 3,406  | 5,204  |\n| Group total                                 | \u00fc\u00fc  6,504 | 4,082  | 6,115  |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: a company is assigned to the scope in which its revenue is consolidated.\n- \u00fc\u00fc Item reviewed by KPMG: reasonable assurance .\n\n| Number of permanent employee dismissals   | 2021      |   2020 | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Orange SA                                 | 39        |     33 | 49     |\n| French subsidiaries                       | 58        |     44 | 66     |\n| Total France  (1)                         | 97        |     77 | 115    |\n| International subsidiaries  (1)           | 949       |    778 | 1,916  |\n| Group total                               | \u00fc\u00fc  1,046 |    855 | 2,031  |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: a company is assigned to the scope in which its revenue is consolidated.\n- \u00fc\u00fc Item reviewed by KPMG: reasonable assurance .\n\n## Professional integration of young people\n\nFollowing a decrease attributable to the health crisis and resulting lockdown  periods  in  France  in  2020,  the  number  of  internship agreements  signed  was  up  25%  in  2021,  with  more  than 2,100 agreements. This result still falls short of pre-health crisis levels and the average minimum annual commitment (2,400) provided for in the intergenerational agreement covering the 2019-2021 period signed with the social partners on December 12, 2018. In fact, the health crisis changed the landscape of these internship requests, with the removal of the 'internship' module from many courses.\n\nThe number of work-study contracts signed was expected to fall in  2021,  but  remained  well  above  the  average  minimum  annual\n\ncommitment (2,150) provided for in the same agreement. In addition, there were 4,615 students on work-study contracts in France at December 31, representing 6.0% of permanent contracts at the same date. The rate of professional integration in France therefore exceeds Orange's commitments to trade unions (5%).\n\nKeen to capitalize on their initial professional experience and the skills  acquired,  the  Group  continues  to  give  preference  to  these young interns or work-study students in external recruitment for permanent contracts, in the areas needed for the Group's future in  France.  In  2021,  nearly  600  of  them  (representing  more  than 25% of permanent hires in France during the year) benefited from this  program.  This  result  puts  Orange  in  a  position  to  meet  its commitment to recruit at least 2,000 over the 2019-2021 period.",

In 2021, as in the previous year, it mainly concerned commercial departments, in particular half for the sales activities to B2C customers, and 20% of the total in B2B sales and\n\nservice. Less significant in network activities, the use of temporary labor represents a small volume in information systems activities. The  16.7%  increase  compared  to  2020  was  mainly  driven  by activities with B2C customers.\n\nThe Group recommends using temporary employees rather than employees on fixed-term contracts for assignments of less than two months. External labor represented 0.6% of the Group's total workforce in France in 2021.\n\n| Interim employees - Group France  (1)             | 2021  (3)   | 2020  (4)   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| Amount of payments made to external companies for |             |             |        |\n| employee placement (in millions of euros)         | 30.1        | 25.2        | 36.7   |\n| Monthly average number of temporary workers  (2)  | 632         | 542         | 775    |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: excludes companies with employees in France whose revenue is consolidated under the 'international' business consolidation scope.\n- (2) Calculation of interim employee expenses recorded in the Group France results.\n- (3) The 2021 figures are provisional.\n- (4) The 2020 figures have been updated.\n\n## Outsourcing\n\nThe  use  of  employees  belonging  to  external  companies  takes the form of service contracts. In France, they are mainly used in the field of networks, in the areas of technical intervention (on the networks and on the customer's premises), studies, engineering, architecture, as well as in B2B and B2C customer relations and service. They are also used in the field of information systems on design, development and integration activities.\n\nThe use of subcontracting concerned 32,221 full-time equivalent employees (monthly average over the year) at end-December 2021, compared  with  35,721  FTEs  in  2020,  a  decrease  of  9.8% (-3,500 FTEs). This external labor accounted for 30.4% of the total Group workforce in France (Orange SA and Group subsidiaries operating  in  France).  The  reduction  recorded  mainly  relates  to the construction of the very high-speed broadband network, with certain regions seeing completion of their rollout program in 2021.\n\n| Outsourcing - Group France  (1)                       | 2021  (3)   | 2020  (4)   | 2019   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| Amount of subcontracting (in millions of euros)       | 3,030.5     | 2820.9      | 2724.3 |\n| Full-time equivalent workforce (monthly average)  (2) | 32,221      | 35,721      | 33,691 |\n\n- (1) Scope of financial consolidation: excludes companies with employees in France whose revenue is consolidated under the 'international' business consolidation scope.\n- (2) Calculation based on the outsourcing expenses recorded in the statutory financial statements of the companies in the Group France scope of consolidation.\n- (3) The 2021 figures are provisional.\n- (4) The 2020 figures have been updated.\n\n## 4.3.2 Training\n\n| Number of training hours  (in millions) (1)               | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Group total audited scope (80% of consolidated employees) | 2.52   | 1.98   | -      |\n| Group total audited scope (66% of consolidated employees) | -      | -      | 2.49   |\n| o/w Orange SA                                             | 1.72   | 1.38   | 2.15   |\n\n- (1) With the continued rollout of the Orange Group Learning tool in the subsidiaries in France and the rest of the world, the scope published for the 2021 fiscal year includes Orange SA, La G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de T\u00e9l\u00e9phone, OBS SA, Orange Cyberdefense, Belgium, Spain, Moldova, Poland, Romania, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal and Madagascar.

The  rate  of  access to training in the Group was therefore 92% in 2021, up 9 points compared to 2020.\n\nIn this context, particular attention was given to ensuring fair access to training. For 2021 in France (UES Orange, i.e. 50% of the Group's workforce) rate of access to training for employees was 92%, that of those aged over 45 years was 95% and in this same scope the rate of access to training for women was 94%.\n\nThe change in teaching formats did not cause any reduction in the employees' level of satisfaction with the training completed. The Net Promoter Score (NPS), which measures the level of satisfaction of learners in the Group, increased to 58 in 2021 compared to 51 in 2020.\n\n## Training content\n\nIn  2021,  training  actions  mainly  related  to  the  development  of skills in customer relations, the acculturation of employees to new technologies with programs such as 'Data IA Starter', 'security is learned through daily work' and '5G Story' as well as developing and  building  the  technological  skills  of  the  Group's  experts particularly in the areas of Data, Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity and 5G.\n\n## 4.3.3 Compensation\n\nCompensation and recognition are mainly based on:\n\n- -basic salary;\n- -variable  compensation,  which  rewards  individual  and  group performance, through the achievement of both quantitative and qualitative targets in the service of customer satisfaction;\n- -collective  compensation,  such  as  incentive  or  profit-sharing schemes in France;\n- -the allocation of shares to certain executives under long-term incentive plans;\n\nIn  these  areas,  Data  Analyst,  Data  Engineer  and  Cybersecurity Engineer  certification  and  diploma  programs  for  reskilling  were also launched in partnership with renowned organizations such as the Centre National des Arts et M\u00e9tiers (CNAM) and the University of Dublin to offer employees the opportunity to develop into new strategic businesses in the Group.\n\nIn France, the Orange Apprentice Training Center (CFA) created in October 2020 to develop apprenticeships launched its second year of  students  on  work-study  contracts  in  September  2021  across four  career  paths:  Data  Analyst,  Cybersecurity  Engineer,  Cloud Specialist and Customer Service Technician. Of the students who joined the program for this second year, 34% were young women (up 7 points compared to 2020) and 5.9% were employees with disabilities. Qualiopi (1) certified since November 2021, the Orange CFA already has 149 students on work-study contracts.\n\nTo ensure the quality of the services provided by its subcontractors, Orange  also  builds  the  skills  of  its  employees  (Service  Quality Controllers,  Contract  Manager,  Partner  Manager,  etc.)  in  charge of steering, monitoring and measuring its subcontractors' quality of service through a series of training actions dedicated to quality, safety and environment verification (VQSE or V\u00e9rification Qualit\u00e9 S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Environnement).\n\nTraining actions aimed at developing the softskills of the Group's employees  were  also  taken  throughout  2021  to  increase  their capacity  to  work  together  in  a  simple,  fluid  and  responsible way, to adapt to new ways of working and in particular to hybrid working  arrangements.  In  France  (UES  Orange,  i.e.  50%  of  the Group's workforce) the portion of training devoted to human and cross-functional  skills  represented  18%  of  the  total  number  of training hours.\n\nFinally, 2021 was also marked by the launch of a comprehensive training  offer  intended  for  all  Group  employees  on  Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to make every employee familiar with Orange's  commitments  in  this  area,  with  a  view  to  integrating challenges related to inclusion and the environment into practices for daily action (see Section 4.1.4. Appropriation of the Group's CSR challenges and commitments by all employees).\n\n- -benefits  programs,  covering  health,  death  and  disability insurance, savings and retirement, in addition to non-monetary items, which are socially responsible solutions that also develop a sense of belonging to the company. Employee shareholding programs  also  contribute  to  this  aim,  while  increasing employees'  share  in  the  Group's  capital  (see  Section  6.2.1 Distribution of capital and voting rights).\n\nThe  compensation  policy  of  the  Group's  entities  is  managed  in close  collaboration  with  the  Finance  Department.  It  takes  into account the local situation, in particular through legal obligations, the macroeconomic environment, the rate of voluntary departures (turnover) and compensation policies observed in the market.",

These agreements are based mostly on a financial indicator and operating priorities, including the quality of service provided to customers. When targets are achieved, the amount of payroll paid out as the incentive bonus is usually around 4%.\n\nUnder the agreement at Orange SA for 2021 to 2023, the incentive bonus  is  based  primarily  on  the  achievement  of  an  operating performance  indicator  (growth  in  revenue,  control  of  operating expenses and optimization of investments in all markets), with a\n\nweighting of 60%. This indicator is supplemented by an indicator relating  to  the  quality  of  service  offered  to  customers,  with  a weighting  of  30%  (measuring  customer  satisfaction  across  all universes  and  markets),  plus  a  Corporate  Social  Responsibility indicator relating to the reduction of CO2 emissions generated by the activity, which accounts for 10%.\n\nIncentive bonuses representing 5.0% of the payroll were paid in May 2021 at Orange SA, in respect of 2020. For an average annual compensation of 50,000 euros, the individual incentive bonus came to 2,650 euros.\n\nFor 2021, a provision for exceeding the operating performance, service quality and CO2 emissions reduction targets was recognized at December 31, 2021.\n\n| (in millions of euros)          | 2021     | 2020     |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|--------|\n| Orange SA incentives            | 166  (1) | 196  (2) |    191 |\n| Additional Orange SA incentives | 11       | 196  (2) |    191 |\n\n- (1) Amount funded at December 31, 2021.\n- (2) Updated 2020 amount.\n\n## Employee profit-sharing\n\nAn employee profit-sharing agreement was signed with the trade unions in France in June 2013, replacing the previous agreement. This  agreement  applies  to  the  employees  of  Orange  SA  and its  majority-owned  French  subsidiaries  that  are  parties  to  the agreement.\n\nUsing a dispensatory calculation formula, the special profit-sharing reserve of each company is equal to 4% of its operating income (loss)  (French  GAAP),  and  the  Group's  profit-sharing  reserve\n\namounts to the sum of the positive special profit-sharing reserves of the companies that are parties to the agreement.\n\nThe Group's special  profit-sharing  reserve  is  distributed  among all  beneficiaries,  20%  based  on  their  length  of  service  and  80% in proportion to their gross annual compensation. Employees may choose whether their individual amounts are paid to them directly or deposited in the Group Savings Plans.\n\nThe following table shows the amount of profit-sharing distributed over the last three years under the Group profit-sharing agreement in France.\n\n| (in millions of euros)                      | 2021     | 2020     |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------|\n| Special profit-sharing reserve of the Group | 120  (1) | 114  (2) |    146 |\n\n- (1) Amount funded at December 31, 2021; including 115 million euros funded in the Orange SA accounts.\n- (2) Updated 2020 amount.\n\n## Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 2021-2023\n\nOn  July  28,  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  approved  the implementation of a conditional long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for\n\napproximately 1,300 senior managers, covering 1.6 million shares delivered  as  such  (see  Note  6.3  Share-based  payment  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

Almost 62% of them benefit from one of the schemes resulting from the agreements in favor of seniors and late-career  development,  with  the  great  majority  opting  for  the French part-time for seniors plan (TPS).\n\nThe  new  intergenerational  agreement  signed  with  the  social partners  on  December  17,  2021  again  included  a  selection  of measures for employees in the latter stages of their career, known as 'TPS 2022' in reference to the year in which entries should be made to the scheme. Accessible to employees taking retirement up to January 1, 2028, it provides a period of 'free time' before their official  retirement, which can last up to four years depending on the employee's situation. The employee remains part of the active workforce  during  this  period.  The  large  number  of  employees recorded in the below 30% category relates to this phase of the program.\n\n## 4.3.5 Social  dialog\n\n## Organization of social dialog\n\n## Worldwide\n\nThe Worldwide Works Council was created in 2010 to provide a common platform  for  social  dialog  at  Group  level.  It  comprises 32  members  representing  23  countries  across  the  world,  each with more than 400 employees. It met twice in 2021. It examines economic, financial and employee-related matters of a global or transnational nature, such as the Group's general business and its  probable  developments,  its  financial  position,  its  Corporate Social Responsibility, and its industrial, commercial and innovation strategy.\n\nEmployee representatives  are  either  trade  union  representatives appointed  by  their  trade  union  to  sit  on  the  committee, representatives  appointed  by  elected  forums  of  employees,  or\n\n## Telework\n\nSince  the  agreement  of  June  22,  2009,  telework  has  been  one of  the  methods  of  organizing  work  within  the  Group  in  France. Consolidated by new agreements and amendments (in 2013 and 2017), its practice has been developed and extended to all levels of the organization. Orange has a very comprehensive agreement and significant experience with more than 42,000 Orange SA employees working from home in 2021, i.e. more than 60% of the workforce. 36,500  employees  regularly  work  from  home  and  5,600  have worked from home occasionally as provided for in the agreement.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Minister of Labor presented Orange with the WIWO teleworking label, rewarding the company for its experience in  the  area  and  its  commitment  to  the  ongoing  improvement  of practices  in  favor  of  a  modern  and  efficient  approach  to  work organization,  which  promotes  performance  and  quality  of  life  at work.\n\nIn the Group's scope of activity, excluding Orange SA, teleworking was practiced by more than 50% of the workforce in 2021.\n\nemployee  representatives  appointed  by  a  democratic  process according to locally defined rules.\n\n## In Europe\n\nThe  European  Works  Council  comprises  24  employee representatives from 18 countries. It met six times in 2021. The subjects presented relate to the company's economic and financial situation,  employment  trends,  changes  in  the  activities  and structure of the Group, particularly in the area of cybersecurity and infrastructures (such as the Orange TowerCo Europe project).\n\n## In France\n\nIn  2021,  the  Social  and  Economic  Committee  (CSEC)  of  UES Orange met 20 times - mainly to discuss health and safety and measures implemented for the Covid-19 pandemic - for recurring\n\nthe Group savings plan (PEG) or International Group savings plan (PEGI),  and  45,000  retired  employees  with  assets  in  the  PEG. The offer related to a maximum ceiling of subscriptions, including matching contributions, of a value of 260 million euros (expressed in the share price before discount of 30%). Underlying shares were redeemed in advance by Orange as part of its redemption program. In the end, the entire offer, i.e. 26.1 million shares, were delivered on December 1, 2021 to more than 64,000 subscribers in 37 countries. The Group's employee shareholding accounted for more than 7% of Orange's capital at the end of 2021.",

In 2021, the survey was however delayed to 2022 and the results will cover the Group's capacity to adapt to its new ways of working following the health crisis period.\n\nThe results of the 2020 barometer bear witness to the commitment of  Orange's  men  and  women  around  the  world:  91%  said  they were proud to work at Orange, 87% recommended Orange as a great place to work, and 92% recommended Orange products and services.\n\n## Group health, safety and quality of life at work dashboard\n\nIn application of the Worldwide Health, Safety and Quality of Life at Work agreement of 2014, and in line with the rollout of the Group vigilance plan:\n\n- -triennial agreement on Orange SA incentives;\n- -agreement  establishing  a  death  and  disability  plan  for Orange SA civil servants;\n- -agreement for the integration  and  continued  employment  of employees with disabilities and for anti-discrimination;\n- -agreement on the mobility plan (commuting between work and home);\n- -two  amendments  to  the  agreement  relating  to  the  Group retirement savings plan (PERCO - plan d'\u00e9pargne pour la retraite collectif) (employer's contribution for 2021, and modification of a mutual fund);\n- -amendment  to  the  health  agreement  for  Orange  SA  civil servants;\n- -two  amendments  to  the  Death  and  Disability  -  Health agreements for private employees (framework agreement and implementing agreement);\n- -amendment to the UES Orange social dialog agreement.\n- -all the Group's companies have social dialog bodies dedicated to health and safety and employee working conditions; and\n- -all the Group's employees have health insurance.\n\nNearly 70% of the Group's workforce is covered by an occupational health and safety policy letter specific to their entity. This testifies to a strong involvement of local executive teams.\n\nEach entity  should  have  in  place  a  system  for  the  management of  health  and  safety  at  work.  Several  major  entities  have  been audited and certified ISO 45001 since the publication of this new international standard in 2018. In addition, some Group subsidiaries are certified to OHSAS 18001 (a standard that will remain in force until the end of 2021). In 2021, the Group had close to 23 entities certified  ISO  45001  for  their  Occupational  Health  and  Safety Management System (OHSMS), covering nearly 27% of the Group's total  workforce excluding Orange SA. The remaining entities are regularly  audited,  according to a reference framework based on international standard ISO 45001, without any certification process. The audit program was successfully maintained in France despite the international health crisis. It was not possible to do the same in  the  rest  of  the  Group,  as  international  travel  has  been  limited since March 2020: a support program for non-certified OHSMSs was  offered  to  more  than  20  entities  operating  internationally, to  enable them to obtain ISO 45001 certification at a later date. Training for managers and information sessions for pilot partners (a member of the Management and the entity's OH&S officer) are held regularly in France. Internationally, a similar process also began in January 2020 in several entities of the MEA division.\n\n| Number of occupational accidents with lost time  (1)   |   2021  (2) |   2020  (3) |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| Group total                                            |         542 |         496 |    695 |\n| o/w Orange SA                                          |         374 |         369 |    491 |\n\n- (2) The number given for Orange SA is for fiscal year 2021, recorded at December 31, 2021.

This slight increase may be related to a  partial  resumption  of  international  travel  and  to  the  fact  that  a\n\nCovid-19 situation reported during a business trip is registered as an occupational accident. The fact that the indicators related to accidents have not returned to the levels before the health crisis is most certainly a reflection of the high number of teleworkers in the Group since March 2020.\n\n## Absenteeism\n\n| Number of days of employee absence due to illness  (1)   | 2021  (2)   | 2020  (3)   | 2019      |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Group total                                              | 1,094,246   | 1,173,707   | 1,092,105 |\n| o/w Orange SA                                            | 622,707     | 686,331     | 656,142   |\n\n(2)\n\nThe number given for Orange SA is for fiscal year 2021, recorded at December 31, 2021.

For Orange SA, i t was even lower than the 2019 figure, possibly due to the continued high percentage of teleworkers acting as a protection factor against\n\nother annual seasonal infectious illnesses (flu, gastroenteritis, etc.) in  a  population largely vaccinated against SARS-CoV2, therefore with fewer sick leave periods related to the pandemic than in 2020.\n\nThe number of days of absence for occupational accidents saw a less pronounced change, with a slight decrease in 2020, then a rise in 2021, possibly reflecting less the impact of teleworking and more the effect of lockdowns in the different countries in 2020, mainly in the roles not eligible for teleworking, which is compatible with a return to pre-crisis levels.",

The  figures  are  too  low  in  absolute  terms  to  make  a meaningful interpretation. It should also be noted that this indicator only concerns files for active employees.\n\n## Specific case of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic\n\nHealth crisis management exercises are a regular feature within the Orange group, due to its presence in endemic areas with annual occurrences (the last two years have been marked by leprosy in Madagascar, Ebola hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and measles in Africa, Europe and the United States). Health  alerts  are  then  published  on  the  Group's  reference  site (Travel  security),  which  also  addresses  security  risks  (terrorism, social-political disorder, etc.) and natural disasters (earthquakes, hurricanes, etc.).\n\nThanks to this experience, Orange's reactivity at  both  local  and central level was much greater in the specific context of the SARSCoV-2 health  crisis.  The  continuation  over  time  of  the  efforts  in response to the pandemic and to adapt to it is a multi-disciplinary task. It is based on observing the government requirements in each country, and on the exchange of know-how and strong support\n\nbetween entities, as well as sharing information at Group level for improved global monitoring.\n\n## Remediation\n\nIn the context of the so-called France Telecom social crisis trial, in July 2019 Orange decided to set up a compensation commission to review individual situations. Its implementation was discussed with the trade union organizations. The Monitoring and Compensation Committee, set up on October 1, 2019 to examine individual claims submitted by individuals present in the Company between 2007 and  2010  and  their  beneficiaries,  extended  the  period  for  filing claims from June 30 to December 31, 2020. It continues to analyze and process requests received with a view to closure expected at the end of the first quarter of 2022. It is responsible for reaching amicable solutions and settlements in order to avoid long, costly and socially painful litigation procedures for those concerned.\n\nAt the end of December 2021, around 1,751 individual requests had been received, about 1,100 of which had been closed subsequent to an agreement, with slightly less than 300 requests are still being processed.\n\n## 4.3.7 Promoting diversity and inclusion\n\nThe Group's actions to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace are presented in Section 4.5.3 Orange's commitment to diversity and an inclusive workplace.\n\n## Note on methodology - employment data\n\nThe  employee-related  data  in  this  section  come  primarily  from the HR information system and are complemented by data from the  Group's  financial  information  system.  The  methodological specifications or limitations of some indicators are provided below and include a compilation of the details given in the employment indicator tables.\n\n## Breakdown of men-women among supervisory staff (permanent employees at the end of the period)\n\nThe rule for calculating the 'supervisory staff' indicator is based on the active workforce with permanent contracts.\n\nThe  'supervisory  staff'  indicator  includes  employees  belonging to the 'senior management' category, which corresponds to the consolidation of levels E, F and G of the French National Collective Agreement for Telecommunications (CCNT), or the equivalent level for  entities  outside  France  and  French  subsidiaries  that  do  not benefit from this agreement.\n\n## Percentage of women in the management network\n\nThe management network is a network comprising 1,330 managers at  the  end  of  2021.  Its  members  all  hold  positions  of  very  high responsibility in the Orange group.\n\n## Disabled employees - Orange SA\n\nThe 'number of employees with disabilities' indicator relates to the number of employees declared in the DOETH (French mandatory declaration for employees with disabilities).\n\nTheir  'integration  rate'  and  'employment  rate'  are  calculated according to the DOETH methods. The figure shown for 2021 is provisional due to the processing time of the declarations.\n\n## Number of departures\n\nThe 'number of resignations' and 'number of dismissals' indicators only  take  into  account  the  departure  of  employees  in  active employment  on  a  permanent  contract.  Thus,  the  departure  of employees that are temporarily not working (inactive employees: long-term medical leave, extended leave, unpaid leave, etc.) are not included in these indicators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

The figures for the prior year (y-1) are updated with the final figures when the subsequent fiscal year (y+1) is reported, taking account of any adjustments made at a later date.\n\nThe number of theoretical hours worked over the year fluctuates by country. It is calculated based on the number of employees in active employment (full-time equivalent), the number of annual theoretical working  days,  and  the  number  of  theoretical  hours  worked  per day in each country where the Group operates (as reported by the subsidiaries for the last two items).\n\nThe  definitions  of  the  'number  of  employee  days  of  absence due  to  illness'  and  'number  of  employee  days  of  absence  due to  occupational  accident'  indicators  relate  to  employees  on permanent contracts and employees on fixed-term contracts.\n\nThe 'number of employees recognized as having an occupational illness' indicator only takes into account recognized occupational illnesses declared by active employees.\n\nThe  'frequency  rate  of  occupational  accidents'  relates  to  the number  of  occupational  accidents  with  lost  time  per  million theoretical hours worked per year.\n\nThe 'severity rate of occupational accidents' relates to the number of  days  of  sick  leave  for  occupational  accidents  per  thousand theoretical hours worked per year.\n\n## 4.4 Breach of ethics rules\n\n## Tone from the Top\n\nOn November 30, 2021, Orange's 9th Ethics & Compliance Day provided a fresh opportunity to affirm the commitment of the Group and  its  managers,  with  talks  from  the Delegate  Chief  Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development and the Secretary General and Secretary of the Board of Directors during a morning of discussions in which various senior managers of the Group (including the Orange France Director of Communication and CSR, the Director of Mergers and Acquisitions, the Treasury and Financing Director, the Group Chief Compliance Officer and the Director of Managerial Development & Talent) were given the opportunity to speak.\n\n## Governance\n\nIn 2021 the governance work of the compliance program continued with a presentation to the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC) of the Group's Board of Directors, a presentation of the analysis of the risks of corruption and influence peddling to the Group Risk Committee, as well as the holding of a Risk Committee meeting dedicated to cases of fraud and corruption, attended by the Lead Director, and four  sessions of the Group Ethics and Sustainable Performance Committee.\n\nThe Compliance network (Chief Compliance Officers - CCOs) met 11 times in 2021 to share information and recommendations by the Group CCO as well as to share experiences of the entity CCOs; the Ethics network (which brings together the Ethics Advisors) met three  times  in  2021  to  share  information  and  experiences,  and monitor work projects and the roadmap for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmong the highlights of  the  actions  carried  out  or  continued  in 2021, we note that:\n\n- -the  Group's Anti-Corruption Policy, which serves as a code of  conduct  within  the  meaning  of  the  Sapin  2  law,  has  now been rolled out and/or adapted throughout the Group and its subsidiaries;\n- -the Group's Fraud & Compliance due diligence methodology, which was completely updated in 2021, has been rolled out across all Group divisions and countries. Project reviews are used to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  methodology  by the  entities  and  give  rise  to  training  to  strengthen  control  of the procedure and to recommendations by Group Compliance experts;\n- -the prevention of conflicts of interest continued with obligatory reporting campaigns in certain subsidiaries including Orange Slovensko, Sonatel, Orange RDC and Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire;\n- -the  rollout  of  tools  for  declaring  gifts,  meals  and  invitations continued in the entities and subsidiaries which cover more than 90% of Group revenue;\n- -a  new  tool  was  introduced  for  team  information  and awareness: the chat-bot which in a few questions can provide initial  responses  on  recurring  subjects  related  to  ethics and  compliance  (conflicts  of  interest,  gifts  and  invitations, whistleblowing);\n- -the Group's whistleblowing mechanism has evolved from an email  address,  active  since  2003,  to  an  outsourced,  secure platform for the collection of alerts (Hello Ethics), accessible to employees and external stakeholders.",

This platform replaces the email address. Its implementation was supported by a communication plan to the network of leaders, managers and employees, which was escalated in the subsidiaries.\n\nReports are processed according to the procedure laid down by the Group or its subsidiaries: acknowledgment of receipt, review of the admissibility of the report and processing by teams authorized according to the area, while respecting the confidentiality of the whistleblower and the people concerned throughout the process.\n\nThe observations after the new system's first six months of activity are:\n\n- -a very sharp increase in the number of messages received in the domains covered by the whistleblowing system;\n- -filtering  of  messages  'out  of  scope'  of  the  whistleblowing system and deletion of spam arriving by email; and\n- -analysis of alerts shows inaccurate assignment of domains by authors - the reallocation of messages to the different themes shows that filtering is de facto non-existent for the HR domain and partial for the 'customer complaint' domain.\n\n## Distribution of alerts by entity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Distribution of alerts by domain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Controls\n\nEach year, the 'Ethics' area is reviewed by the Statutory Auditors in  accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (see Section 2.2.2.2 'Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act'),  with  a  review  of  the following points: existence of the Code of Ethics and access to it by employees, information for employees on conflicts of interest and the existence of an internal whistleblowing system, access to and communication on this system. This control concerns Orange SA and its main subsidiaries representing 95% of the Group's revenue. The work conducted by Orange and the independent assessment of the Statutory Auditors both resulted in satisfactory conclusions for the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nThe  Statutory  Auditors  also  monitor  the  progress  of  the  AntiCorruption Compliance program during twice-yearly meetings with the Group's Chief Compliance Officer and his team.\n\nLastly,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  conducted  several  audits of  Sapin  2  compliance  programs  in  2021  (Group  and  country programs), several Standard Entity Reviews during which the Sapin 2 compliance program was also reviewed as well as an audit on the Group's whistleblowing system.\n\n| Indicators                                                          | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Governance: entities with a Compliance and/or Ethics representative | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| Training: UN-Orange Anti-Corruption Visas delivered during the year | 7,300  | 31,700 | 37,000 |\n\nNo significant customer or supplier complaints have been formalized against the Group regarding Compliance issues.\n\nO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

This is occurring to such an extent that they can be considered a fundamental need. In this regard, Orange has made digital inclusion one of the pillars of its commitment in its Engage 2025 strategic plan, covering the period 2020 to 2025 (see Section 1.2.3 The Orange group strategy).\n\nOrange's commitment to inclusion covers:\n\n- -society,  through  schemes  promoted  by  its  Orange  Digital Centers, its support for entrepreneurship and its Foundations;\n- -its customers, through the digital coverage of regions, social offers,  support  for  uses  and  complementary  services  to connectivity  (banking  services,  access  to  energy,  health services, education, etc.); and\n- -its  employees,  with  a  policy  promoting  diversity  and  equal opportunities,  the  strengthening  of  commitment  programs (skills sponsorship, volunteering).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is supplemented by measures aimed at promoting a range of responsible products and services across its entire scope.\n\nOrange  has  produced  several  socioeconomic  footprint  studies since  2017.  It  is  seeking  to  complement  this  approach  by developing a methodology for analyzing the impacts of its activities on its stakeholders. Two studies were launched in 2021 in the digital inclusion field to assess the changes made to those who benefit from its programs:\n\n- -the first was conducted by IM-PROVE on all the programs of the  Orange  Foundation.  It  is  a  largely  quantitative  study  on several thousand beneficiaries;\n- -the  second  relates  to  the  Orange  Digital  Centers  program to carry out a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the impact of the training received. It is carried out internally by the Orange research department's laboratory of human sciences.\n\nThe aim of the initiative is to better assess the social challenges in  each region and to have a decision-making tool to adjust the Group's actions.\n\n## 4.5.1 Orange's commitment to inclusion for society\n\nIn addition to its connectivity offer, through its strategic plan Orange has committed to rolling out digital inclusion and solidarity schemes in  all  geographies between now and 2025. Among the initiatives taken  in  this  respect,  Orange  plans  to:  (1)  open  Orange  Digital Centers bringing together open Code schools, Orange Fab and structures dedicated to solidarity inclusion, such as the FabLab, in  each of the countries where the Group operates; (2) establish a Foundation in each country where this is legally possible, and extend the Foundation's programs (Digital Schools, Digital Home, Solidarity FabLabs,  etc.)  to  all  countries;  (3)  provide  affordable smartphones and a 'social' offer for customers who are the most excluded  from  digital  technology  in  Europe  due  to  purchasing power; and (4) support its customers' uses with digital workshops in stores, other locations or online, as well as a space on its website dedicated to the safe and responsible use of digital technology. Orange intends to consolidate the formalization of its commitment to digital inclusion, based on ongoing collective coordination work under the responsibility of the Group CSR.\n\n## 4.5.1.1 Orange Digital Centers\n\nOrange has made a commitment to open an Orange Digital Center in each of its geographical areas, i.e. at least 26 centers by 2025 (18 in the MEA region, and 8 in Europe).\n\nThe  Orange  Digital  Center  is  the  structuring  and  emblematic mechanism for Orange's commitment to make digital technology an opportunity for all. It is a place that brings together a coding school, an Orange Fab and/or an incubator, a solidarity FabLab and an Orange Ventures branch, where this exists within the business scope in question.\n\nEntirely free and accessible to everyone, with particular attention paid to the professional integration of women, these centers offer a wide range of tools and services that provide access to digital skill  learning  paths  and  the  creation  of  activities  based  on  new technologies and with a strong social impact.\n\nDigital  inclusion  is  made  a  reality  through  a  coherent  and comprehensive  course  of  free  training  in  digital  ecosystems, offering the opportunity to follow a unified pathway, ranging from help to increase the employability of young people in reintegration programs, to support for talent and entrepreneurs. Orange Campus programs (under the Orange Digital Center brand) also supports certain Orange employees or those outside the Group in working\n\ntoward  future  digital  professions  (data  and  artificial  intelligence, cybersecurity). The strength of Orange's action lies in a complete network  of  regions,  in  order  to  sustainably  embed  its  inclusion initiative and roll it out across a multiplicity of sites in regions and rural areas (Maisons digitales, Orange Studios in Poland). At the end of 2021, nine Orange Digital Centers were already operational (Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Mali, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia). Orange is one of five international companies to  have  received  a  GEEIS-SDG  Trophy  in  2021,  for  the  Orange Digital Center program.\n\n## 4.5.1.2 Support for entrepreneurship\n\nIn a hyper-connected world, Orange promotes synergies between players by creating ecosystems for support and exchange and by sharing knowledge in an Open Innovation approach. Orange works hard to set up support systems at every stage in the life of start-ups to train, identify, assist and promote digital talent.\n\nThrough its numerous calls for bids, Orange picks the start-ups most  likely  to  lead  the  coming  changes  in  digital  habits  and integrates them into the digital ecosystem. Orange provides various kinds of technical and expert support covering the spectrum from incubation to acceleration, as well as access to financing that is appropriate  to  the  different  levels  of  start-up  maturity.  Start-up accelerators, the 17 Orange Fabs form a global network that aims to build commercial partnerships with the Group through managerial strengthening and commercial development programs. The Group also supports various incubators and incubator networks in France and Africa via its subsidiaries, particularly in Senegal, Guinea and Mali.  In  order  to  open  up  the  field  of  impact  entrepreneurship, Orange is supporting La Ruche (social business incubator) across France, Ronalpia in the Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region, and is a partner of Incub'Innov, an incubator located in Seine-Saint-Denis dedicated to start-ups linked to African diasporas. The programs in  which Orange is a partner, the UNDP's SDG Finance Geneva Summit and AFIDBA (AFD For Inclusive and Digital  Business  in Africa)  support  innovation  with  a  positive  impact  in  emerging markets,  particularly  on  the  African  continent.  Lastly,  Orange encourages entrepreneurial initiatives combining employees and start-ups, with the Villa Bonne Nouvelle, Villa Atlantique and Villa Occitanie  incubators  and  corp-working  (corporate/co-working) spaces in France.",

These start-ups should contribute to  the  emergence  of  new  responsible  economic  models  with  a positive impact for the environment, inclusion and social support.\n\nFinally, Orange also provides expertise and visibility, with:\n\n- -the  Orange  Start-up  platform,  dedicated  to  promoting  and supporting innovative companies in all the Group's geographical regions;\n- -digital tools such as Cloud Starter, a Cloud Computing platform for start-ups, and Orange Developer, which brings together all of Orange's API & SDK toolset and development kits;\n- -coordination in communities: Imagine with Orange, which is active in 56 countries, Villa Bonne Nouvelle, a showcasing of the  Group's  HR  innovation,  Les  Ambitieuses  TechForGood program,  launched  in  partnership  with  La Ruche  social innovation  incubator,  and  the  Orange  Social  Entrepreneur awards in Africa and the Middle East (POESAM), which identify and assist around 50 innovative start-ups every year at national and/or  international  level,  to  meet  sustainable  development challenges in this part of the world.\n\n## 4.5.1.3 Philanthropy and the Orange Foundation\n\nThe Orange Foundation works to promote the social and vocational integration of young people and women in difficulty: young people without qualifications or jobs, women in vulnerable situations and people  with  autism.  For  the  past  34  years,  the  Foundation  has provided them with access to education, health and culture, helping them integrate better into society. Orange also contributes to the democratization of culture among all sections of the population, by promoting access to vocal music, books and museums. The Foundation  is  currently  active  in  all  these  areas,  ensuring  that digital  skills,  which  have  become  essential,  are  an  integral  part of  equal  opportunities.  Thus,  with  the  support  of  committed employees, through more than 23.5 million euros invested in 2021 in 23 countries with its partner associations, the Orange Foundation is enabling its beneficiaries to make a new start.\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  strategic  plan  Engage 2025,  Orange  has committed to:\n\n- -extend  opportunities  for  Group  employees  to  deliver  skills sponsorship (in a general interest association, in one of the areas  supported  by  the  Foundation  or  by  leading  digital support workshops with employees who have already chosen the  Orange  Solidarity  association,  for  example),  until  now only available under the French part-time for seniors plans, to employees transferring within the Group. In 2021, 129 Orange employees  chose  to  get  involved  with  Orange  Solidarity  as part  of  their  Part-time  for  seniors  plan/skills  sponsorships, with  289  employees  in  total  and  457  including  employees continuing  in  their  role  as  volunteers  after  retirement.  Since 2010,  3,380  chose  skills  sponsorship  through  partner associations  of  the  Foundation  (445  active  employees  at end-2021). Since 2019, a pilot program has been underway on a skills sponsorship program for the Group's young talents. It\n\nallows them to undertake assignments for periods of three to six months in associations supported by the Foundation, such as FabLabs or Missions Locales (French public system for the return to employment of disadvantaged young people);\n\n- -ensure the Foundation has a presence in each of the countries where  it  operates,  grouping  together  the  philanthropic programs  within  a  common  structure  to  promote  synergy between the different actions it performs, in particular giving vulnerable young people and women access to digital tools. The foundation works in 23 countries. In this scope, 17 local foundations (1) are operational, and work has begun in several other countries.\n\nThe  Orange  Foundation  carried  out  training  actions  in  2021  for nearly 500,000 beneficiaries, including 54,850 new beneficiaries in France and 84 100 outside France:\n\n- -215  new  Digital  Schools  in  the  MEA  region  enabled 75,000  students  in  remote  schools  without  books  or  the Internet  to  access  educational  content;  on  an  accumulative basis  since  the  start  of  the  program,  there  are  1,215  Digital Schools operational in 16 countries in the MEA region making it possible to reach 425,000 students each year;\n- -Nearly 7,000 women received digital training in the Foundation's 362 Maisons Digitales across 23 countries (in France, in other European countries and in the Middle East);\n- -despite the health crisis, 9,000 Digital Workshops (face-to-face or remote) organized in France by Orange Solidarity provided digital training to 37,500 people in difficulty in France;\n- -45  FabLabs Solidaires in Europe have remotivated and trained 9,500 young people who are unemployed or not in school in digital manufacturing;\n- -specifically  in  France,  34  Together  for  the  Integration  of Young People projects enabled 2,100 young people who are unemployed or not in school to carry out a collective project related  to  digital  technology,  and  19  Tiers Lieux Solidaires centers were supported to provide assistance and training in digital technologies for 8,000 people without digital skills;\n\nMoreover,  Orange  improves  the  living  conditions  of  around 500,000 people through 100 Orange Villages distributed across 11 countries in Africa, with a water source, a health center and a school.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Orange  Foundation  contributed  to  the  solidarity effort in the fight against Covid-19 by providing equipment and aid worth 11 million euros between April 2020 and April 2021, including 2 million euros in aid granted in April 2021. Each country received health kits  (masks,  gloves,  gel,  etc.)  and  a  fund  for  carrying  out emergency actions. In 2021, Orange also directed its resources at supporting vaccination actions against Covid-19 in 16 countries of the MEA region.\n\nFinally,  since  April  2021,  the  l'arrondi sur salaire  was  offered to  Orange  employees  in  France,  allowing  them  to  make  a micro-donation  from  their  salary  to  the  Orange  Foundation  or one of the Orange Foundation's four partner associations. At the end of  2021,  nearly  200,000  euros  had  been  transferred  to  the associations through this initiative by more than 3,500 employees who were members of the scheme in December 2021, Orange having doubled the amount collected through this solidarity effort.\n\nO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

In addition to coverage, the population excluded from digitization for reasons of  purchasing  power,  technological  skills  or  personal  situation, particularly in terms of education or training, is estimated by the GSMA at an average of 24% in Europe, and 47% and 49% respectively in MENA and Sub-Saharan Africa. The rapid move to online and digital provision of essential services in everyday life (employment, education, access to culture, access to social rights, etc.) creates a risk of social exclusion for populations who do not have access to online services or are not familiar with these tools.\n\nThe  digital  equality  action  program,  included  in  Engage  2025, covers several areas, as described below:\n\n- -provide  access  to  as  many  people  as  possible:  extend  the coverage of fixed and mobile networks by investing actively in their development;\n- -propose inclusive offers, with one social offer per country in Europe by 2025;\n- -sell affordable smartphones, by offering multimedia devices at accessible prices in each country, such as the Sanza in Africa and the Middle East, or refurbished mobile phones in Europe;\n- -roll  out  support  programs  for  digital  uses,  with  one  Orange Digital  Center  per  country,  one  Foundation  per  country  and digital workshops in each European country by 2025.\n\n## 4.5.2.1 Providing access to as many people as possible\n\nTo bring the benefits of the digital world to all areas, and improve speeds for everyone, Orange is undertaking an action plan, based chiefly on:\n\n- -developing access infrastructures to extend fixed and mobile network coverage and to roll out new technologies (fiber, 4G, 5G);\n- -expanding the network of submarine broadband optical fiber cables as well as IP and IPX points of presence to improve Internet connectivity for Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.\n\nFor  more  details,  see  Section  1.5  Orange's  networks  and Section  1.2.3  The  Orange  group  strategy  -  Faster  digital development for regional communities.\n\n## 4.5.2.2 Offering accessible services and supporting appropriate use\n\nDriven by its  Engage 2025 strategic plan, Orange has launched an action program for digital equality, aiming firstly to remove the purchasing power barrier through the use of 'inclusive' offers, and secondly to offer free training sessions for everyone in its stores, in other locations and online, providing user support and skills for everyday use of digital services.\n\n## Offering accessible services\n\nAs  part  of  its  Engage  2025  strategic  plan,  Orange  made  the commitment to launch a social  offer  in  the  European  countries where it  operates,  such  as  its Coup de Pouce Livebox offer in\n\nFrance. This offer, designed for low-income households who do not have home Internet access, includes (1) attractively priced InternetTV-Telephone access via ADSL or Fiber, (2) a refurbished laptop with a suite of office tools, and (3) free digital support available in certain Orange stores. This offer was jointly built between Orange and  local  non-profit  organizations  to  support  these  groups  of people; it had more than 10,000 customers in France at the end of 2021.\n\nOrange  is  also  a  partner  of  the  Fonds  de  Solidarit\u00e9  Logement (FSL), through the signature of agreements with 76 departments and seven metropolitan  areas  for  debt  write-offs  the  amount  of which is decided by the departmental social services, for people in situations of serious poverty.\n\nIn  Spain,  the tarifa social offer, launched in fall 2020, includes a fiber access, a fixed line and a mobile line at a reduced price; it is reserved for households on minimum incomes.\n\nSimilarly, Orange is extending its inclusive offerings by expanding its range of handsets. In Europe, Orange is supplementing its catalog with  refurbished  handsets,  which  provide  high-performance equipment  at  a  discount  compared  to  new  equipment  (see Section  4.2.1.1.  Waste prevention and management - Sale of refurbished mobiles). In the MEA zone, the range of Sanza devices sold in 16 countries in Africa and the Middle East provides access to advanced features for a price starting at around 20 US dollars. A credit facility is also offered in three MEA countries to facilitate the purchase of smartphones.\n\nOther areas also present opportunities for Orange to develop its business model: to counter digital exclusion related to disability or age, Orange has been delivering a 'designed for everyone' strategy for some years now. Its objective is to adapt products and services for the needs of these people and design specific products that combine innovation, simplicity and ergonomics, either directly or in partnership with start-ups in an Open Innovation approach.\n\nOrange has thus developed a range of offers and products that specifically meet the needs of disabled and elderly people. In terms of customer relations, several countries of the Group have a digital and accessible catalog of adapted products and services (France, Poland, Spain, Belgium, and others), a dedicated website (France, Poland, Belgium, and others), autonomy labeled stores (France, Poland, Belgium, Senegal) and dedicated customer call centers. For example, in France at the end of 2021, Orange launched the Swissvoice  G80  Smartphone,  a  new  device  which  provides  a response to the digital inclusion challenges faced by the elderly, thus strengthening the intergenerational link. It was developed in collaboration with Atlinks to meet their needs (loudspeakers with amplified  sound in hands free (conversation/radio)), user-friendly interface,  unified  messaging  (photos/messages),  videophone enabled (WhatsApp included) and user support from carers (remote assistance).\n\nIn addition, a skill center dedicated to digital accessibility checks all  the  websites in the French scope to establish declarations of compliance.  In  2021,  80  accessibility  declarations  for  Orange websites were announced by the Orange skill center. This work is  continuing  for  the  customer  and  business  applications  and webapps. The web portals of many countries of the Group were also  audited  (Belgium,  Botswana,  Cameroon,  Spain,  France, Jordan,  Luxembourg,  Morocco,  Moldova,  Poland,  Slovakia  and Romania).",

        "page_content": "## Supporting appropriate use\n\nImplementing Orange's policy on the safe and responsible use of digital technology involves several measures, which continued in 2021. For the general public in France, digital workshops in small groups  allow  participants  (seniors,  parents  and  children)  to  be given  an  hour's  free  support  on  various  themes.  In  2021,  more than 10,000 participants in France took part in one of the digital workshops  organized  by  Orange  on  seven  themes,  thanks  to 287 employee volunteers.\n\n## 4.5.2.3 Offer inclusive services that complement connectivity\n\nAs part of its overall development approach, Orange offers services to cover the basic needs of populations, based on its connectivity offer. Orange has identified several areas in which it is taking action: financial  services,  access  to  energy,  health,  and  in  the  AfricaMiddle East region, agriculture (mAgri, a range of decision-support services for the agricultural world and enabling virtual marketplaces to be set up), education and e-education.\n\n## Access to online financial services\n\nOrange Money was launched in 2008 (first launch in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire), to offer a person-to-person money transfer service and facilitate access  to  the  recharging  of  prepaid  communication  credits.  It now aids economic development in the countries where Orange operates,  by  enabling  people  without  bank  accounts  to  access financial services.\n\nOrange  Money  makes  it  possible  to  make  cash  deposits  and withdrawals, money transfers, bill payments, etc. Orange Money is now considered an essential activity for Orange, with 25.1 million customers spread across 16 countries at the end of 2021 within the scope of the Group's consolidated companies.\n\nFollowing Orange C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in 2018, Orange Guinea and Orange DRC obtained 'GSMA Mobile Money Certification' in 2019, a global initiative  that  provides  greater  security,  transparency  and  more secure and reliable mobile financial services to millions of mobile money users worldwide.\n\nInternational money transfers from mobile to mobile is available between France and Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Cameroon, DRC, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Morocco and Senegal.\n\nFollowing  receipt  of  a  banking  license  from  the  Central  Bank of  West  African  States  in  2019,  Orange  launched  Orange  Bank Africa in July 2020 in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire in order to expand its credit and savings offerings and thus promote access to financial services in a context where less than 20% of people in the UMOA zone hold bank accounts. Orange Bank Africa had 0.7 million customers at the end of 2021.\n\n## Access to electricity\n\nAccess  to  electricity  is  a  major  issue  for  the  African  continent, where Orange can play a leading role by capitalizing on its brand, its commercial presence and its technical assets. While ensuring the  continuity  of  its  own  services,  Orange  is  committed,  in  this domain with high operational stakes, to a diversification approach that strengthens the Group's positive, participatory presence in the MEA region.\n\nOrange is developing two different offers intended for customers not connected to the national grid and for customers connected to the national grid or to a minigrid:\n\n- -for  the  first  group,  generally  those  living  in  rural  and  remote areas, the offer consists of making the purchase of individual solar  electricity  production  equipment  affordable  with  a staggered payment system to replace fossil energy expenses; these individual solar kits were distributed at the end of 2021 in nine countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the DRC, Guinea, Madagascar, Mali, Senegal and Sierra Leone); the aim is to provide access to solar energy in rural areas or on the outskirts of town and cities where the quality of service of  electricity  providers  is  non-existent  or  insufficient.  The service consists of allowing the regular use of a kit comprising a  solar  panel,  a  central  unit  containing  a  battery  and  a  SIM card, lamps with LED bulbs, a multi-socket charging cable, a radio, a portable flashlight and an optional television set or fan. Customers become owners after a defined period. The kits are produced with partners selected by Orange for their quality and ability to offer integrated solutions and to meet large-scale demand. Payment via Orange Money means the service can be granted or re-established automatically and remotely for the required period of time. This staggered payment system and remote control mechanism has been piloted since 2021 on the new digital platform Pay as you go Orange (OSE). At the end of 2021, around 100,000 households were benefiting from this offer;\n- -for the second group, the availability of an 'electricity wallet', with remote control of a smart meter connected to the Orange OSE  platform  and  payment  via  Orange  Money.  This  offer is  available  following  an  agreement  between  Orange  and operators of the electricity distribution network (PowerCo) or minigrid; it opens up the possibility for them of remote meter reading  and  improves  customer  relations  in  various  areas: supervision, management, billing and payment. For electricity operators, it is  now possible to carry out readings remotely, quickly  and  without  loss  of  data,  as  well  as  to  implement advanced  customer  management  mechanisms  such  as avoiding load shedding in entire areas and limiting power to each household instead. Two minigrid operators have opted for this solution, in Burkina-Faso in 2018 and in the DRC in 2021.\n\n## Digital access to healthcare\n\nIn 2020, Orange Business Services reorganized its health entities Enovacom  (leader  in  interoperability  in  France)  and  Orange Healthcare  to  create  a  single  division  and  comprehensively meet the  needs  of  players  in  this  sector  as  it  undergoes  digital transformation in France and internationally. The new structure's dedicated  e-health  software  and  service  offerings  address  four major challenges: protection of health data, exchanges and sharing between players in the healthcare ecosystem, the digitization of the patient pathway, and the use of health data.\n\nOrange  aims  to  accelerate  the  development  of  new  healthcare solutions  based  on  the  massive  use  of  data.  It  is  within  this framework  that  Future4care  was  launched  to  create  the  joint venture  between  Sanofi,  Capgemini,  Generali  and  Orange  to develop e-health. Future4care's aim is to unite all players in the health  sphere  (patients,  healthcare  facilities,  startups,  academic and institutional, public and private) to collectively invent the future of e-health, to make Europe a key player in the global scene and guarantee  its  sovereignty  in  this  area.  Future4care  relies  on  the expertise  of  be  ys,  an  international  group  specializing  in  digital identity, personal information flows, and the processing and hosting of sensitive data, with which it entered into an industrial partnership at the start of 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

It includes:\n\n- -information  services  via  mobile  phone,  or  hotline  to  answer health  questions  (sexuality/birth  control,  AIDS,  STDs, malaria, etc.), vaccination schedule reminders (service via USSD launched as part of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)  on  the  recommendation  of  the  WHO),  family  planning service via SMS and USSD;\n- -remote advice and monitoring services (by SMS/USSD and/or voice messages): M-vaccine and e-Vaccination in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, vaccination schedule reminders in Mali, Senvitale in Senegal, Gifted Mom for maternal and infant health in Cameroon and CAR, Cycle M for family planning in the DRC;\n- -insurance and savings services: Sini Tonon in Mali, Hospital allowances in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Activa Makala and AssurTous in Cameroon;\n- -geolocation  and  connection  services  (doctors,  hospitals, on-call pharmacies, appointment scheduling, etc.): Gifted Mom in Cameroon and CAR, Health First in Cameroon, geolocation of on-call pharmacies in Mali.\n\nIn  order  to  develop  innovative  e-health  solutions,  by  improving access  and  quality  of  care  through  digital  platforms  that  in particular strengthen links between healthcare professionals and patients, in October 2019 Orange signed a partnership agreement with the Global Fund for the implementation of a digital platform for healthcare professionals in Morocco, in collaboration with the Ministry of Health. Its aim is to facilitate monitoring of patients as part of the HIV and tuberculosis care pathways. This was extended in 2020 to other African countries including C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the DRC and Burkina Faso.\n\nIn collaboration with AXA Assurance Maroc, in September 2021 Orange  MEA  also  acquired  a  majority  stake  in  DabaDoc,  the Moroccan health-tech for the digitization of health services in Africa. DabaDoc develops solutions adopted by thousands of healthcare professionals  in  Morocco,  Tunisia  and  Algeria.  With  Orange's investment, the platform is in a position to step up its development and  extend  its  services  to  other  geographical  areas  particularly in  the  countries  of  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  DabaDoc  benefits  from\n\nOrange's  technological  expertise  and  payment  solutions  which instantly  provide  concrete  benefits  to  patients  and  to  the  entire African health ecosystem.\n\n## Digital access to education\n\nCommitted to access to a quality education for all, Orange has developed a leading interactive mobile platform to train teachers in rural areas in the African continent, in partnership with USAID since 2014. Since 2020, Orange Campus Africa in partnership with the Virtual University of Senegal (UVS) has offered an online training program designed to bring together in a single place the content from recognized partners in education and training. Orange offers a global platform to meet the specific needs of the populations (adaptation  of  training  to  local  cultural  and  economic  contexts, and mobile payment in local currency for additional or premium services such as tutoring or certification), universities (teaching of new subjects, particularly related to technologies and the digital economy, online monitoring of students, virtual classes) and African companies.  Since  the  beginning  of  the  health  crisis,  15  of  its subsidiaries have offered Free Mobile connections to a selection of classes from international and African partners.\n\nOrange  also  developed  an  'education  pass,'  available  in  five countries  in  the  MEA  region,  which  provides  access  to  online educational content at a price negotiated within a sponsored data mobile contract. This pass is available in Burkina Faso, Senegal, Mali, Guinea and the DRC.\n\nAccess to education is also one of the areas of commitment of the Orange Foundation (see Section 4.5.1.3 Philanthropy and the Orange Foundation, with the Maisons digitales and Digital Schools program in partnership with each country's Ministry for Education.\n\nIn  their  digital  transformation  process,  African  companies  and authorities are also committed to digital training. Orange Africa and Middle East for example supports the digital transformation of the F\u00e9lix  Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny de Yamoussoukro National Polytechnic Institute  in  C\u00f4te  d'Ivoire.  The  Group  supports  the  Masters  in Data  science.  Since  2017,  this  program,  in  partnership  with  the Abidjan Institute of Statistics and Applied Economics, the \u00c9cole Polytechnique  and  Orange,  has  trained  African  experts  in  the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence and Big Data. Orange MEA continues its  reflections  for  programs  of  the  same  type  in  other African countries.\n\n## 4.5.3 Orange's commitment to diversity and inclusion within the Group\n\n## 4.5.3.1 Promoting diversity and inclusion\n\nOrange is convinced of the benefits of diversity and inclusion for its  financial  and  social  performance.  The  Group's  Diversity  and Inclusion  policy  seeks  to  welcome  and  develop  all  talents,  and encourages the social commitment of its employees. It is based on the ambition to make the Company an ever more inclusive place that  gives  everyone  the  opportunity  to  thrive  and  contribute  to creating value for the community. In addition to the fight against discrimination, it is based on three priorities: professional gender equality, equal opportunities and digital equality.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion assessment\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  the  evaluation  of  its  diversity  and professional gender equality policy and actions via the GEEIS and GEEIS Diversity certification (Gender Equality & Diversity European and International Standard), obtained by the Group itself and in\n\n20 entities and 17 countries since 2011, following audits conducted every  two  years  by  an  independent  external  body.  In  2021,  this certification  was  confirmed  for  the  Orange  group  and  in  nine countries, mainly in Europe: Belgium, Brazil, France, Luxembourg, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Tunisia.\n\nThe 2020 Employee Survey revealed that at least 85% of employees think that Orange represents the diversity of society well.\n\nIn  France,  equality  in  Orange's  recruitment  processes  is  verified every three years by an external body. From 2022, the review will be extended to all stages of recruitment.\n\nThe  November  2021  Diversity  Leaders  in  Europe  2022  ranking (Statista/Financial Times) placed Orange in seventy-eighth place out of 850 inclusive companies and in second place in the telecom sector.  In  2021,  in  the  Equileap  ranking  on  professional  gender equality, the Orange group was ranked 10th out of 3,700 companies across the world, and 2nd in its sector.",

        "page_content": "At  the  same  time,  the  Group  participates  in  the  assessment of  discrimination  and  the  measurement  of  inclusion  through tools  and  barometers developed by its partners such as AFMD (Association Fran\u00e7aise des Managers de la Diversit\u00e9). In 2021, an Orange  Diversity  footprint  for  France  was  established  by  Mixity on  five  aspects  of  diversity:  disability,  gender,  multi-cultural, multi-generational and LGBT.\n\nTo promote its actions and contribute to progress initiatives, the Group is an active member in the work of international organizations such  as  the  ERT  (European  Round  Table  of  Industry),  the  ILO (International Labor Organization), the GSMA and think tanks and is involved in various inter-company coalitions or coalitions with public institutions.\n\n## Awareness and training\n\nOrange  raises  the  awareness  of  its  employees  to  diversity  and inclusion thanks in particular to the coordination of the Community of Diversity Players and to communication campaigns organized for international days devoted to specific causes (women's rights, elimination  of  violence  against  women,  disabled  persons,  fight against homophobia, etc.).\n\n## 4.5.3.2 Gender equality in the workplace\n\n## Gender equality in the workplace\n\n| Percentage of women - Group            | 2021      | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| % of women in the active workforce     | \u00fc\u00fc  35.9% | 36.0%  | 36.0%  |\n| % of women in supervisory staff  (1)   | \u00fc\u00fc  31.3% | 31.3%  | 30.9%  |\n| % of women in management networks  (2) | \u00fc\u00fc  31.6% | 31.1%  | 29.8%  |\n\nWith regards to female-male representation on the Group's Board of  Directors,  see  also  Section  5.2.1.3  Applying the principle of diversity and balanced representation between women and men.\n\nProfessional gender equality is a cross-functional priority, shared by  all  Orange  entities  worldwide.  In  2021,  the  Group  continued to roll out the global agreement signed on July 17, 2019 with UNI global union. This agreement is based on a participatory approach by all stakeholders and structured social dialog. In 24 subsidiaries and entities around the world, local diversity/professional gender equality  committees,  bringing  together  company  and  employee representatives, were created and dedicated liaison officers were appointed.  The  agreement  is  monitored  jointly  by  the  Group and UNI global union; it gave rise to two meetings in March and December 2021.\n\nIn France, Orange continued during the year to implement the fifth agreement  on  gender  equality  and  work-life  balance,  signed  in January 2018 by Orange SA and extended until December 2021. On December 22, 2021, a sixth agreement was signed by Orange SA and three trade union organizations.\n\nThe  professional  equality  policy  is  managed  by  the  Strategic Professional Equality Committee, the Group's governance body, which met twice in 2021. It is rolled out within the Group in five areas:\n\n## Gender balance in all of the Group's occupations, in particular in technical and digital fields\n\nThis is a major area for the Group which has set itself the objective by 2025 of having 25% women in these occupations of the future, in  which women are underrepresented. For many years, Orange has carried out awareness-raising initiatives among young girls in the attraction of these professions, while also promoting retraining for  women  and  by  encouraging  female  entrepreneurship.  In France, through the women's technician classes program, Orange trained  nearly  600  female  jobseekers  in  technical  professions between  2012  and  2021,  of  whom  nearly  three-quarters  were hired on permanent contracts. In addition, the Group has set itself the  target  of  recruiting  30%  women  for  the  integrated  classes run  by  its  Apprentice  Training  Center  (CFA).  Support  for  female entrepreneurs continued in 2021: the Women Start and #Femmes Entrepreneuses programs, successfully launched in 2018, were renewed, as well as the women's award created in 2020 as part of the Orange Social Entrepreneur Award in Africa and the Middle East (POESAM). Finally, in 2021 the Group rolled out a federative program, Hello Women, which aims to develop diversity in technical and  digital  occupations  around  four  areas:  raise  awareness, identify, retrain and retain. In France, as part of this program, a call for projects enabled the identification of four new partners, with the implementation of innovative projects in 2021. In parallel, the Group launched an international call for projects which led to the selection of 20 projects in 20 countries, which will be implemented in 2022.\n\n## Equal access by women to positions of responsibility\n\nThe Group has set a target of 35% women in management bodies by 2025, in line with the percentage of women in its workforce. This  objective  is  integrated  into  the  talent  management  policy. The  Group's  Executive  Committee  comprises  28.5%  women since September 2020. The proportion of women in management\n\nThe  Group  trains  its  employees  in  inclusive  management  and wellbeing at work and in 2021 rolled out a Vivre ensemble la diversit\u00e9  module  (called  Diversity  Together  outside  France),  in various countries with close to 4,600 employees registered. Since 2018, employees have learned about gender equality via an online training  program  that  provides  a  'professional  equality  visa'. This certification has been obtained by nearly 19,000 employees in  France.  An  international  visa  was  launched  in  April  2021  in several  languages  and  has  already  been  followed  by  close  to 10,000 employees across the world.\n\nIn  keeping  with  its  intention  to  make  its  new  digital  content accessible to all, Orange made available to its employees a 'Digital Accessibility  Visa,'  to  raise  their  awareness  in  the  use  of  digital tools accessible to as many people as possible. It was followed by 1,600 employees by the end of 2021.\n\nOrange  also  supports  the  public  certification  module  Objective IA, created by the Montaigne Institute, OpenClassrooms and the Abenoa Foundation, with the aim of training the public in the basics of AI, in France and the rest of the world.\n\nIn France, the HR teams, in charge of recruitment, and managers are  regularly  trained  on  the  impact  of  stereotypes  and  bias  in decision-making, particularly during the recruitment process.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

In  the  top  10%  of  positions  with  the  highest responsibility,  women  represented  31.5%  of  executives  at  the end  of  2021.  Development  or  mentoring  projects  (including  by the Group's executive management) are offered to high-potential employees  in  various  countries  as  well  as  access  to  external networks such as PWN (European Professional Women's Network) and WIL (European Network for Women in Leadership). Orange also supports the internal networks which act to promote diversity with more than 8,000 members worldwide.\n\n## Gender equality on pay\n\nas part of the global agreement on gender equality in the workplace, the  Group  has  set  itself  a  target  of  gender  equality  on  pay  in comparable situations by 2025. The pay gap analysis methodology, common to all countries and used by the Group since 2018, is used in all subsidiaries with more than 400 employees to measure pay gaps in a consistent manner. The analysis leads to action plans, adapted to the context of each country, in order to reduce the gaps identified.\n\nIn  France,  maintaining specific budgets in the annual salary rise exercises  makes  it  possible  to  continue  to  reduce  the  pay  gap between  women  and  men,  which  in  comparable  employment situations  is  1.5%  (2020  figure  for  Orange  SA).  In  accordance with  the  French  law  of  September  5,  2018,  which  stipulates  the obligation for companies to publish annual indicators relating to the pay gap between women and men and the actions undertaken to  eliminate  such  gaps,  the  Orange  Economic  and  Social  Unit obtained an overall score of 94 out of 100 points in 2021 for the indicators measured in 2020.\n\n## Work-life balance\n\nin  the  global  agreement  on  gender  equality  in  the  workplace  of July  17,  2019,  Orange  undertook  to  facilitate  the  reconciliation between professional and personal or family life, in particular by promoting  teleworking  and  flexible  working  hours,  the  right  to disconnect and a number of support measures for employees who are parents or caregivers. Since 2020, the health crisis linked to the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the rollout of teleworking\n\nin  all  countries  where  the  Group  operates  and  particularly  in countries in Africa and the Middle East, where this practice was less widespread. In October 2021, the Group signed the new company Parenting Charter.\n\n## Combating sexism, harassment and violence\n\nAs part of the global agreement of July 17, 2019, Orange reaffirmed its  commitment  to  the  prevention,  detection,  reporting  and handling of all situations of sexism, harassment and violence. In 2021,  a  framework  for  action  was  prepared  by  the  Group  and circulated  to  all  subsidiaries  and  entities  worldwide  to  support them in their handling of these situations. The Group's commitment also  concerns  violence  within  couples,  for  which  Orange  offers employees who are victims, both women and men, and who so request, appropriate support measures. On November 23, 2021, the  Group signed the Charter of commitment against domestic violence and joined the network of companies committed to this cause, OneInThreeWomen.\n\n## 4.5.3.3 Orange for equal opportunities in the company\n\nOrange's equal opportunities policy is based on five dimensions:\n\n## Disability: Employment and integration of people with disabilities or cognitive diversity\n\nThe French law of September 5, 2018 on the freedom to choose a professional future has changed the method of calculating the employment rate, with:\n\n- -the elimination on January 1, 2020 of the indirect employment rate achieved with purchases from the sheltered employment sector (STPA purchases), which is no longer taken into account in  the  employment  rate  but  is  deducted  from  the  financial contribution  in  the  event  that  the  rate  is  lower  than  6%  and for  each  employee lacking in this shortfall. This explains the absence of integration rate data since 2020, and the addition of an employment rate line; and\n- -the increase related to employees with disabilities aged 50 and over, which counts for 1.5.\n\n| Employees with disabilities - Orange SA                                   | 2021       | 2020  (4)   | 2019      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Number of employees with disabilities                                     | 4 363  (1) | 4 748  (1)  | 5,250     |\n| Amount invoiced by the sheltered employment sector (in millions of euros) | 17,6       | 19,1        | 20.1      |\n| Integration rate                                                          | -          | -           | 7.0%  (3) |\n| Employment rate                                                           | 6,51%  (2) | 6,57%  (2)  | -         |\n\n- (1) Employees with disabilities declared in the French mandatory declaration for employees with disabilities (DOETH) given by URSSAF.\n- (2) Employment rate calculated according to DOETH methods given by URSSAF.\n- (3) Integration rate calculated according to DOETH methods.\n- (4) 2020 data have been updated.\n\nFollowing  the  2021-2023  agreement  for  the  employment  and integration  of  people  with  disabilities  and  the  fight  against discrimination in the Orange SA scope and to boost recruitment, significant action has been taken on the diversification of sourcing to promote a proactive approach. The use of recruitment agencies has thus increased recruitments from 8% to 44%.\n\nIn total, the employment rate of workers with disabilities in 2021 was 6.5%, exceeding the legal requirement. The rate of conversion to permanent contracts of work-study students with disabilities was 6.82%.\n\nSTPA purchases were maintained with significant investment levels despite a slight decrease in the networks and catering thanks to major efforts by the Purchasing Department to limit the impact of the  health  crisis  on  inclusive  purchases.  A  decrease  in  the  cost of  keeping  employees  in  employment  was  observed  due  to  the health  crisis  which  generated  lower  transport  costs  particularly in  comparison  to  the  cost  of  fitting  out/equipping  employees' teleworking environments.\n\nInternationally,  following  the  adoption  of  the  GSMA  principles laid  down  on  December  3,  2020  to  promote  the  inclusion  and empowerment  of  people  with  disabilities,  the  Group  organized workshops in eight countries of the OMEA region for improved local adoption of inclusion challenges.\n\nA special edition of the Orange.com Magazine entitled 'Disability, neurodiversity:  how  to  take  action  for  inclusive  digitization?') was  promoted  to  mark  the  international  day  of  persons  with disabilities on December 3, to highlight initiatives which illustrate our commitments in the different countries in which we operate.\n\nThe  Neuroteam  program  was  launched  on  April  29,  2021;  it marks the Group's new drive to make cognitive diversity an asset for performance and wellbeing at work within the company. The program  brings  together  a  multidisciplinary  working  group  of 70 people and 12 entities and involves representatives of different business functions and members of a community of employees concerned. The action plan will be rolled out in the first half of 2022.",

        "page_content": "## The origins\n\nI n 2020, as part of the partnership with the Club 21 e Si\u00e8cle, Orange's senior  executives  took  part  in  the  Barometer  survey  conducted with the firm McKinsey. This survey aims to measure socio-cultural diversity in management bodies in order to support the approach and examine more closely the subject of representations of diversity within  the  company  and  better  understand  the  expectations of  internal  and  external  audiences.  The  results  were  shared  in September 2021 and a group of companies involved was created to monitor and replicate the evaluation.\n\n## Integration of young people\n\nOrange has renewed its intergenerational agreement signed for the period 2022-2024: it covers the Group's companies in France and takes into account three major areas: the long-term integration of young people into employment, the employment of seniors, and the transmission of knowledge and skills.\n\nTo facilitate the career development of young people and boost their employability, the Group supports structures and initiatives working to  promote  equal  opportunities.  The  wide-ranging  associations supported make it possible to cover all educational and academic levels, from school through to higher education and entry into the working world: Article Un, Nos Quartiers ont des Talents, Proxit\u00e9, and  Capital Filles  in  France  and  in  Romania,  and  also  \u00c9nergie Jeunes, JOB IRL and Ptech.\n\nIn 2021, Orange codesigned a new remote format for the obligatory two-week  work  experience  for  9th  Graders  which  provides high  school  students  unable  to  access  in-company  immersive environments  with  a  chance  to  discover  the  Group  and  its businesses and to carry out their first skills assessment.\n\n## Identity\n\nTo contribute to progress in the inclusion of LGBT+ people in the professional  environment,  as  an  active  member  of  the  French association L'Autre Cercle the Group takes part in its activities such as  the  annual  role  models  ceremony  -  two  Orange  employees received  awards  for  the  third  edition  -  and  in  the  association's prospective  work.  Orange  thus  contributed  to  the  Odyssey  for Equity project on 'the place of LGBTI+ people in the world of work in 2031' which brought together 14 companies and 18 NGOs - more than 115 contributors from 21 countries. The results of this reflection process gave rise to a white paper presented in August 2021.\n\nAn annual partnership with T\u00eatu Connect was forged in 2021 to target  young  students  and  boost  Orange's  attractiveness  as  an employer.\n\nSince its creation, the Group has supported the internal Mobilisnoo network  of  LGBT+  employees  and  friends,  and  facilitates information for employees, in particular thanks to the LGBT+ Guide 'Sexual orientation and gender identity: understanding and acting at Orange in France'.\n\nIn  2021,  for  the  first  time  in  France  an  in-store  campaign  was launched  to  mark  International  Day  Against  Homophobia  and Transphobia  on  May  17  (IDAHOT)  and  as  signatories  of  L'Autre Cercle's LGBT+ Commitment Charter, the Group signed an open letter reaffirming its commitment and calling for managers of public and private organizations, in turn, to follow the commitments of the Charter.\n\n## Personal opinions\n\nA  training  course  for  managers  and  HR  aims  to  facilitate  the understanding  of  the  expression  of  religious  convictions  in companies in France. Over the past four years, 392 people have been trained.\n\nA guide on 'The expression of religious beliefs in the company: understanding  and  taking  action  at  Orange  in  France'  is  made available to all employees.\n\nGiven  the  absence  of  measures  on  equal  opportunities  matters related  to  origin,  beliefs,  cognitive  diversity,  gender  identity and  sexual  orientation,  in  2021  the  Group  launched  a  cycle  of conversations for managers and HR with an upstream survey on perceptions concerning discrimination. 1,235 employees from HR and managers took part.\n\n## 4.5.3.4 Digital  equality\n\nSee Section 4.5.4.1.3.2 Inclusive artificial intelligence.\n\nTo continue efforts following the launch of the International Charter for  inclusive  AI  in  April  2020,  104  companies,  associations  and academics signed these commitments for more inclusive AI. To capitalize on this voluntary action and launch a collective dynamic of sharing good practices, Orange and the Arborus fund launched the Club for inclusive AI in December 2021, bringing together all the voluntary signatories to push forward their actions with a view to facing future challenges.\n\n## 4.5.3.5 Orange promotes employee commitment\n\nOrange facilitates  the  commitment  of  its  employees  to  inclusion by making it possible for everyone to volunteer or be involved in skills-based sponsorship, as well as giving their time:\n\n- -the employee volunteering program previously applied, mainly to reinforce in-store staff teams during busy periods, and which extends to training in the digital  workshops and the Orange Digital Centers, in addition to the work of partner associations. In 2021 in France, 1,748 Orange employee volunteers took part in  two  major  programs:  Digital  Workshops  (online,  outside, stores) and Employee Workshops (online, 30 minutes or 1 hour): Onenote, Teams, Visio. In addition, Orange runs a voluntary program 'Volunteer for the integration of young people' among its  employees  in  France.  In  2021,  612  Orange  volunteers offered support to more than 40,000 young people from eight associations  supported  by  the  Group  through  individual  or group mentoring;\n- -the  existing  skills  sponsorship  program,  open  to  employees starting the part-time work scheme at the end of their career (see Section 4.3.4. Work organization - Working hours organization); this program is extended to all employees in a transition period or between two positions for one-off assignments during their professional career and is particularly aimed at young people and  people  in  difficulty  (Orange  Solidarity);  it  reinforces  the solidarity initiatives carried out in the Orange Foundations;\n- -openness to local volunteering by teams of employees, in the form of volunteering during solidarity events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n- 4",

Orange has also put in place a policy to support the proper use of digital technology, taking into account the recommendations of international health authorities. It is aimed at Orange employees, in particular marketers and communicators, as well as users of our products and services in order to enable them to adopt the good habits described in the Group's policy (Section 2.2.3.2.5.1 Policy on responsible uses of digital technology).\n\nOrange  is  gradually  putting  indicators  in  place  to  monitor  the proper implementation of its policy. Data presented below detail the reporting scope for each year and not the application scope for the policy.\n\n## 4.5.4.1 Protection of personal data\n\n## 4.5.4.1.1 Monitoring of the personal data protection initiative\n\n## Governance\n\nThe implementation of the GDPR governance program is monitored by  the  Group  Security  Department  and  the  Personal  Data  and Security Department of the Group Legal Department. In 2020, a security statute and objectives were presented to the members of the Group Executive Committee and the members of the Board of Directors. A survey was also conducted by an external firm to assess Orange's position in relation to its European peers, measure progress since the most recent benchmarking and identify areas for improvement.\n\n## Operational organization\n\nThe approach taken by the Group Security Department is assessed annually to check compliance with the Group Security Standard. The annual entity reviews involve exchanges of information between the Security Department and the entities' management, involving relevant members of the Executive Committee. They assess the entities in terms of data security and suggest areas for improvement. The 47 self-assessments carried out in 2021 on entities in Europe and  Africa  (operator  subsidiaries  and  Group  support  functions, representing more than 90% of the Group's revenue) helped, for example, to correct vulnerabilities or structure security organization systems in certain subsidiaries.\n\nIn  terms  of  personal  data  protection,  all  'Operator'  subsidiaries in  Europe and Orange Business Services had a Data Protection Officer  (DPO)  in  2021.  The  DPO  network  is  managed  under  the framework  of  the  Data  Protection  Committees  by  the  Group DPO; it meets very regularly to ensure correct deployment of the compliance approach in line with developments in legislation, to share best practice, and address common challenges in the rollout of the Group's cross-functional projects and legal matters relating to  data  protection.  Several  hundred  people  in  the  Group  spend\n\nall  or  part of their time maintaining this continuous improvement approach and supporting the business divisions.\n\nFurthermore,  associated  with  this  network  are  numerous multidisciplinary  committees  in  the  entities  and  in  the  central functions that deal with the deployment and the compliance issues that may arise. The Legal Department and the DPOs are members. This  structure  has  made  it  possible  to  ensure  that  the  program has  been  well  understood  down  to  the  business  unit  level.  It complements the monitoring process of the Group's security policy.\n\nFor entities in the MEA region, regional staff, like their European counterparts, are made aware of personal data protection through meetings. Legal requirements in the MEA region are monitored and sharing is organized on a regular basis for the application of texts within the above-mentioned network.\n\n## Awareness and Training\n\nIn 2021, due to the health situation it was not possible to organize seminars for sharing best practice in the areas of physical security, information security, crisis management and business continuity, but training continued with more than 26,000 employees receiving training  in  cybersecurity,  such  as  the  basics  of  cybersecurity, the  GDPR,  encryption  tools  and  cyber  barrier  measures.  This represented more than 200,000 hours of training for the Group in 2021.\n\nAs in the area of security, raising the awareness of all employees to  the  risks  and  ensuring  that  everyone  acquires  best  practices is  achieved  through  support  from  the  Security  Department.  An employee  data  protection  charter  and  the  internal  group  policy on data protection have been distributed in each country and are available on the Company's Intranet. The entities have promoted follow-up e-learning or in-person training sessions. In some entities, the participation rate is estimated at over 80% of employees.\n\n## Controls\n\nIn 2021, two Group entities in the MEA region underwent a remote evaluation to verify the proper implementation of the Group Security Standard, share best practices from other subsidiaries and collect those of the evaluated subsidiaries. In 2021, the European countries (France, Spain, Poland, Slovakia, Romania, Belgium and Moldova) improved  their  score  for  compliance  with  the  Group  Security Standard at over 90%. Within the MEA division, efforts continued to reach 90% by 2025, particularly through the shared skills center.\n\nThe results are shared with the members of the Group's Executive Committee to adjust the action plans according to the areas of improvement identified.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of protection of the information created, processed  and  stored  by  the  Group,  more  than  1,000  manual technical  and  non-technical  audits  (intrusion  tests,  regulatory audits, organization audits, etc.) and more than 100,000 automated audits  (vulnerability  scans  and  code  audits  in  particular)  were carried out in 2021.\n\n| Indicators                                                                              | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| % of entities in Europe with a DPO                                                      | 100%   | 100%   | 100%   |\n| % compliance with Group requirements: security organization theme (Group average)       | 89%    | 87%    | 90%    |\n| % compliance with Group requirements: security  management system theme (Group average) | 89%    | 85%    | 86%    |",

        "page_content": "## 4.5.4.1.2 Business opportunity: Orange Cyberdefense\n\nIn  May  2018,  Orange  combined  its  cyber  activities  within  the Group's Strategy and Cybersecurity Department (DSCS) in order to strengthen the security of the Group's systems and networks. The aim was both to ensure a high level of internal cyberdefense and to develop Orange's commercial activities in this strategic area.\n\nOrange Cyberdefense combines the historical security expertise and  infrastructure  of  Orange  Business  Services  (OBS)  with  that of Atheos, acquired in 2014, Lexsi, acquired in 2016, SecureData acquired in January 2019 and SecureLink, acquired in July 2019. Orange Cyberdefense thus has the critical mass needed in this consolidating  market,  and  the  ability  to  support  its  customers locally in all their geographies.\n\nWith  18  SOCs  and  14  global  CyberSOCs,  an  epidemiology laboratory  and  an  internal  research  center,  in  2021,  Orange Cyberdefense's know-how was officially recognized in France by the  National  Agency  for  Information  Systems  Security  (ANSSI), which  awarded  Orange  Cyberdefense  the  following  three  main certifications:  PASSI  (audit),  PDIS  (detection)  and  PRIS  (incident response). Orange Cyberdefense is the only company to hold this triple certification.\n\nOrange Cyberdefense has at its disposal multiple OBS locations around the world and leverages Orange's 30 years of experience in  making  at-risk  infrastructures  secure,  whether  for  SMEs, multinational  corporations  or  local  authorities.  It  draws  on  the security  expertise  of  2,500  employees  working  in  France  and internationally. This expertise, particularly in the area of research and threat knowledge, gives rise to open information sharing in the form of the publication of the Security Navigator guide. Each day, 200 malicious sites are discovered and shut down.\n\nOrange Cyberdefense is also a training entity which, for more than 15 years, has provided a training offer dedicated to cybersecurity -  from  regulatory  compliance  to  prevention  of  threats.  The training modules proposed and their formats are adapted to the requirements  of  the  entity  in  question  (private  companies,  local authorities and hospitals).\n\nOrange is now positioned as a major player in the cybersecurity sector in Europe, with 838 million euros in revenue in 2021 (+14% on a comparable basis compared to 2020). Orange Cyberdefense has been assessed as a:\n\n- -'leader' in the IDC European Managed Security Services 2022 Vendor Assessment;\n- -'Representative Vendor' in 2021 in the Gartner 'Market Guide on Managed Detection and Response';\n- -'Very Strong' in the 2021 Assessment report of GlobalData Global Managed Security Services;\n- -'Strong Performer' in the Forrester Wave\u2122 Managed Security\n- Services Providers (MSSPs) report for 2020.\n\n## 4.5.4.1.3 Orange promotes responsible use\n\n## 4.5.4.1.3.1 Responsible  marketing\n\nOrange has implemented a responsible marketing policy and offers support for best practices.\n\nInternally, the Marketing and Communication Department is given guidelines that are enriched through forums, webinars, discussions and  co-construction  workshops  on  responsibility  issues  such as  'transparency'  or  'supporting  usages.'  See  Section  4.1.5 Appropriation of the Group's CSR challenges and commitments by all employees.\n\nExternally, this policy has been followed by the Orange brand since 2019. Examples include the marketing campaign in all the countries where  the  Group  operates  on  the  theme  of  'we  all  have  great powers, we all have great responsibilities,' calling on its customers to use digital devices appropriately, in particular in terms of road safety,  screen  time  and  parents'  vigilance  on  the  use  of  digital devices by their children.\n\nI n addition to the Orange Cyberdefense offer, Orange also proposes a range of offers to protect all of its customers, both B2B and B2C. For example, in France, Orange has positioned itself as a trusted operator for B2B customers:\n\n- -the Cyberfilter service offers protection for Internet browsing over  the  mobile  network  with  alerts  when  accessing  a  site that Orange has identified as malicious. This solution can thus detect viruses and verify that an email address has not been the subject of a data leakage on the web. It also enables testing of a URL for the risk of phishing;\n- -t h e   Suite de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pro (professional security suite) protects customers' personal and professional data, protects their bank details, blocks fraudulent sites and secures equipment against new potential threats;\n- -the SugarSync solution enables encrypted access and sharing of all types of documents. It also allows sharing of documents with employees or customers while defining the rights for each of them and defining the safeguarding rules.\n\nAnd as a trusted operator for the general public:\n\n- -the  free  mobile  application  'Orange  T\u00e9l\u00e9phone'  provides protection against unwanted calls by automatically detecting and  blocking  cold  calls  and  malicious  calls,  and  identifying professionals  thanks  to  reverse  directory  look-up;  it  notifies the user of premium-rate numbers and enables fast and easy access to the main emergency numbers;\n- -Orange  also  offers  its  customers  various  Parental  Control solutions  for  mobile  phone  and  TV  (see:  Section  4.5.4.1.3.3 Appropriate use of services).\n\n## 4.5.4.1.3.2 Inclusive artificial intelligence\n\nTo  reflect  its  commitment  to  digital  equality,  with  the  Arborus Endowment  Fund,  Orange  launched  the  International  Charter for  Inclusive  Artificial  Intelligence  in  2020.  This  charter  aims  to create a framework of trust in the way AI systems are designed, developed  and  used.  Based  on  seven  commitments,  it  is  a reference  document  for  companies  implementing  AI.  It  aims  to promote diversity by ensuring that the entire data value chain is responsible  and  that  discriminatory  biases  are  identified  and controlled. Since its launch, this charter has been signed by more than 70 organizations and companies at the end of 2021, including Orange. In December 2020, the Group obtained the international GEEIS AI label for inclusive artificial intelligence, following an audit by an external certification body.\n\nIn  addition, the Group is a partner and member of the Strategic Committee of Objective IA, an e-learning program developed by OpenClassrooms  with  the  Institut  Montaigne  and  the  Abenoa Foundation, which aims to train 1% of the French population in AI subjects.\n\n## 4.5.4.1.3.3 Appropriate use of services\n\nOrange  is  gradually  putting  indicators  in  place  to  monitor  the proper implementation of its policy. Data presented below detail the reporting scope for each year and not the application scope for the policy.\n\n- 4\n\n4",

Orange in Poland offers 'Safe Starter for your Kid,' a low-cost offer including parental controls and unlimited calls with a parent, even if the plan limit has been exceeded.  Parental  controls  are  integrated  directly  into  the network, with no app to download or set up. Orange Poland also offers a parental control application called 'Protect your Children on line,' which enables parents to manage the time their children spend online, to check the applications they are using and to filter inappropriate content on websites. Orange in Spain offers 'Kids Ready,' a subscription with unlimited calls between family members and the child, even if the plan limit has been exceeded. Parental controls can be set up in MyOrange, as well as a geolocation service for the child. Orange in Slovakia offers 'Prima Kids,' including unlimited calls between both parents and the child, even if the plan limit has been exceeded. Parental controls are included for two months and then offered as an option. Orange France offers its customers parental controls on  mobiles,  PCs  and  TV  and  is  continuing  its  partnership with the digital coach Xooloo for more comprehensive family protection; in accordance with the CNC T\u00e9l\u00e9com et Jeunesse advice, Orange France systematically provides information and offers free protection tools for minors (parental controls, option to block multimedia purchases and SMS+) and dual information by SMS when subscribing to a mobile line for a minor;\n- -countries also introduced information, workshop and training initiatives  (mainly  virtual  since  2020).  In  Spain,  the  Por Un uso Love de la technologia programs offer information and\n\nwebinars for parents on topics such as 'how to become the best influencers of your children,' 'how to manage access to pornographic content with your children' or 'how technology affects your children's brains' and online training on security and  data  privacy  on  the  Internet  and  social  networks.  In Belgium, a blog provides parents with information on children's screen time and cyberbullying. In Poland, several platforms, including the TogetherOn-line website, provide advice on safe and reasonable use of the Internet in order to prepare children for new uses, by making their phones safe and protecting them from online dangers (Internet abuse, access to inappropriate content,  online  hate  or  harassment).  Orange  Poland  was tasked,  in  partnership  with  the  Ministry  of  Education,  with a  MegaMission  project  in  primary  schools  to  facilitate  the distribution  of  messages  on  responsible  use  of  the  Internet (34,000 pupils  and  1,250  schools  at  end-2021  following  the launch  in  2020).  In  Slovakia,  the  Detinanete  site  deals  with responsible  digital  uses  for  children,  parents  and  teachers (including  workshops in  schools  with  experts).  An  eSchools for  the  Future  program  also  supports  digital  skills  and  the responsible use of online media;\n\n- -in France, in 2020 Orange signed the protocol of commitment with  the  French  government  for  the  protection  of  children from  pornographic  content  online,  alongside  associations committed  to  the  protection  of  minors,  and  other  digital technology professionals; in 2021 and under the supervision of  the  public  authorities,  Orange  signed  a  new  protocol  on excessive  screen  usage.  Orange  France  also  continued  its awareness-raising actions, through the site bienvivreledigital.fr which helps families in their usage and understanding of digital technology. The site had an audience of more than 1.2 million page views in 2021.\n\nOrange promotes the offer of parental controls across its entire scope, with the following results in Europe:\n\n| Active parental controls           | 2021  (2)   | 2020  (2)   | 2019  (1)   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Number of active parental controls | 625,976     | 536,362     | 290,219     |\n\n- (1) Six contributing countries (Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia).\n- (2) Eight contributing countries (Belgium, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Moldova, Romania, Poland, Slovakia).\n\n## 4.5.4.1.3.4 Electromagnetic  waves\n\nThe orange.com website has a section on radio waves and health (1) , in seven languages, in which the Group provides transparent and up-to-date  information,  including  precautions  for  use,  for  all  its stakeholders. In 2021, the Group continued to improve the part of the radio waves section dedicated to 5G. Actions to raise public awareness of issues relating to radio waves are implemented in each  country  in  accordance  with  their  culture  and  governance: dialog committees organized by health and regulatory authorities, relations  with  local  authorities,  public  information  meetings  in certain countries, etc.\n\nOrange has worked with professional federations (GSMA, FFT, etc.) of which it is a member, at national and international levels, to publish official information and learning tools for the general public on the deployment  of  networks  and  mobile  phone  uses.  For  example, Orange  France  largely  engaged  in  dialog  with  local  authorities for the launch of the 5G rollout. In Poland, this dialog was used as evidence of transparency in the rollout of 5G during the sixth International seminar on mobile telephone electromagnetic fields, an international event organized by the Polish National Institute of Communications.\n\nOrange, through the Mines Telecom- Foundation, sponsors the C2M (characterization, modeling and management of exposure to electromagnetic waves) chair, together with the ANFr, the French Government Agency that manages the country's radio spectrum. In addition, Orange is involved in international standardization groups dealing with the assessment methods for human exposure to electromagnetic fields such as the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC).\n\nOrange carries out standards assessments on new technologies in cooperation with the entities concerned (3GPP, IEEE, ETSI, etc.).\n\nOrange  complies  with  the  requirements  of  the  authorities  who, to improve public information and take account of developments in  the  usage and appearance of new devices that might expose consumers to radio waves, have extended the requirement to display the SAR (specific absorption rate) to all electrical radio equipment intended  for  use  near  the  body,  no  longer  limiting  it  to  mobile phones. Orange has revised its process for approving the choice of radio equipment distributed by or bearing the Orange brand, in particular by strengthening its SAR requirements during production testing, and by conducting training and awareness-raising actions for marketing teams in France and abroad.",

All antennas provided by Orange to its subsidiaries meet European standards and the company carries out controls during installation using simulation\n\ntools.  The  Group  regularly  trains  employees  working  near  or  at antennas on safety recommendations and how to use a dosimeter, in particular at the request of MEA countries. Security perimeters are assessed and defined around the antennas; their calculation is based on a tool made available to subsidiaries by the Group.\n\nThe time required to commission a site depends on the regulatory processes and the length of consultation required with stakeholders.\n\n| Time required to authorize   the commissioning   of a mobile antenna  (1)   | 2021                                                                                             | 2020                                             | 2019                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| Average time to deploy an  antenna for a new site                           | 57% from 12 to 24 months 29% from 6 to 12 months 14% from 3 to 6 months  29% from 6 to 12 months | 57% from 12 to 24 months 43% from 6 to 12 months | 57% from 12 to 24 months 43% from 6 to 12 months |\n| Average deployment times for new  technology for site redevelopment         | 43% from 3 to 6 months 28% < 3 months                                                            | 28% from 6 to 12 months 72% from 3 to 6 months   | 28% from 6 to 12 months 72% from 3 to 6 months   |\n\n- (1) Seven contributing countries (Belgium, Spain, France, Moldova, Poland, Romania and Slovakia).\n\nOf the seven subsidiaries that responded, 57% take between 12 and 24 months to develop a new site. These delays are mainly due to obstacles encountered during the deployment with town halls,  landlords,  local  residents  or  other  stakeholders.  Similarly, 28% of responding countries take 6 to 12 months to deploy a new technology on an existing site. The objective is to shorten these deployment times as much as possible, while maintaining a period of consultation.\n\nOrange  has  introduced  the  risk  of  non-compliance  with  safety instructions by employees and subcontractors in its 2021 vigilance plan. The Group ensures that the technicians, employees of Orange, working on antennas in Europe are trained in safety instructions, including health aspects related to radio waves. These instructions are sent to subcontractors and repeated as part of the prevention plans during on-site operations.\n\n(1)\n\n| Training in radio wave risks prior to work on-site                           | 2021  (2)   | 2020  (2)   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------|\n| % of Orange stakeholders trained in radio wave risks and safety instructions | 100%        | 100%        | 100%   |\n\n- (1) One contributing country (France).\n- (2) Eleven contributing countries (Belgium, Botswana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, France, Spain, Jordan, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Tunisia).\n\n- 4\n\n4",

Orange determines more precisely the criteria corresponding to its assessment of the human rights risks incurred as a result of its activities and geographies. As such, 14 dimensions of human rights are considered in the form of  risk  criticality  indexes  to  provide  an  aggregate  rating,  country by country. They cover the stability of the countries in terms of the degree  of  corruption,  democratic  governance,  the  power  of  the judiciary in its scope and effectiveness, as well as respect for the rights of minorities, indigenous people, children and women; since 2020 they have also included the aspects of government stability and civil unrest.\n\nThey are supplemented by more specific aspects as an operator of  critical  infrastructure:  digital  inclusion,  freedom  of  opinion and expression and, in the face of the multiplicity of government injunctions, interception of communications or cut-off of telephone service or Internet access. As an employer and ordering company in its supply chain, the criterion of discrimination against employees is added.\n\nIn  its  2021  assessment,  Verisk  Maplecroft  made  the  following observation, which led Orange to adapt its assessment of the risks in terms of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for 2021: the occupational rights indexes have seen a decline over the past five years which has been particularly acute in countries with mass industrial production. Many dimensions are affected, such as modern slavery, child labor, discrimination, occupational health and safety, and decent wages. Accordingly, a number of primary manufacturing  centers  in  Southeast  Asia  were  downgraded  by Verisk Maplecroft to 'extreme' risk in the modern slavery index. According  to  Verisk  Maplecroft,  the  human  rights  of  citizens  in 40% of the top 100 locations in which direct foreign investments are concentrated worldwide are at 'high' or 'extreme' risk, which represents some 1.4 billion people and at least one-tenth of invested sums. More specifically, the province of Xinjiang was identified as having used forced labor for the manufacture of mobile phones.\n\nOrange's  approach  is  to  rethink  its  use  of  new  equipment  by favoring the recertification of existing technical equipment by local companies, and to forge partnerships with some of its suppliers to  tighten  control  of  its  requirements  throughout  its  technical equipment value chain. In fact, the approach of prioritizing countries which pose less of a risk in this dimension of human rights, and also\n\nother dimensions of social responsibility, is ineffective in terms of application, because the manufacturing locations for essential parts still remain very limited worldwide.\n\nThe 2021 impact study on human rights carried out for the entire Orange operator scope, with the help of scores attributed by Verisk Maplecroft, highlighted four geographical areas where Orange has a presence as requiring ongoing attention in terms of the respect of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms.  They  are  Mali,  the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and Guinea. In total, 1,749 people are directly employed by Orange in these four countries to serve more than 23.5 million customers. Five countries are assessed by the firm as also requiring special attention  in  terms  of  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms. They  are  Guinea-Bissau,  Cameroon,  Egypt,  Burkina  Faso  and Madagascar. In total, 7,886 people are directly employed by Orange in these countries to serve more than 50.2 million customers.\n\nThe Group identifies election periods as requiring special attention to prevent risks specific to its business as a critical infrastructure operator. Pre-crisis units are activated and are jointly coordinated by the MEA zone Security and Business Continuity Departments prior  to  election  periods,  and  remain  active  until  the  results  are announced. With the involvement of the subsidiaries concerned and the support of the Group Security Department, they verify the implementation of procedures enabling employees to continue their essential activities in  complete safety. Orange acts in respect of the principles of the GNI (see Section 2.2.3.2.4.1 Impact study on human rights and fundamental freedoms).\n\nTo  be  able  to  fully  exercise  its  power  to  oppose  any  unjustified request, Orange also ensures that it has the latest legal provisions allowing the authorities to request network cuts, service reductions or communication interceptions, particularly before elections are held. In fact, requests for service interruption from governments are increasingly concurrent with the electoral process (in the run-up to an election and during the election itself, including the counting period).  The  number  of  annual  service  alteration  or  interruption requests were down this year, with the electoral periods in Orange's scope of activity having been shorter than last year.\n\nDespite the search for constant dialog with the authorities, Orange is sometimes led, in liaison with the Global Network Initiative (GNI) and  non-governmental  organizations,  to  challenge  opinions  on discriminatory behavior or behavior that undermines respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nOrange  may  receive  several  requests  from  the  authorities,  of different and simultaneous nature: request for reduction of Internet speeds, limits on access to certain social networks, interruption of different categories of telecommunication services.\n\n| Indicators                        |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of major incidents handled |      4 |     10 |     10 |",

        "page_content": "The four major incidents handled by Orange for posing a potential threat to the protection of privacy in 2021 were of different types:\n\n- -in  terms  of  respecting  privacy  and  protecting personal data, Orange  France  (and  all  operators  in  France)  closed  a  site following a court order in order to prevent the disclosure of the personal data of almost 500,000 people, including sensitive health-related  data.  The  formal  and  well-founded  nature  of the request led Orange to implement this closure decision for 18 months in accordance with the court's decision;\n- -in  terms  of  protection  of  civil  security,  Orange  followed up  three  requests  from  the  national  authorities  for  service interruption for a limited time, including one request for which Orange  succeeded  in  limiting  the  injunction  to  a  reduction of  video  streaming  while  maintaining  the  rest  of  the  traffic. Orange reached out to the international community to provide transparency on the government's requests and their impacts. Finally, a notification on the traffic issues was sent to Orange customers.\n\nThe  Orange  Foundation  is  present  in  the  following  countries considered  to  require  attention:  Burkina  Faso,  Cameroon,  Mali, Guinea and Madagascar. It provides support to populations there through programs dedicated primarily to women and young people, in the areas of health and education.\n\nLike  other  GNI  member  companies,  Orange  is  regularly  and independently  assessed  on  its  progress  in  implementing  the GNI principles. The aim of the assessment is to enable the GNI's Board of Directors to determine whether each member company is making good faith efforts to implement its principles as part of a continuous improvement approach. The independent assessment, which includes both an examination of the company's processes (systems, policies and procedures) and an examination of specific case studies, concluded that implementing the GNI principles is definitely a priority for the Group, that the principles are integrated in Orange's policies and that Orange is making good faith efforts to  implement  the  GNI  Principles  in  a  process  of  continuous improvement. These findings were published by GNI in April 2020, in its GNI Public Assessment Report.\n\n## 4.5.5.2 Promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nOrange renewed its signature to the United Nations Global Compact in 2021, in accordance with the fundamental principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization.\n\nOrange works to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms and defends their values, particularly with regard to the responsibility it intends to assume in respect of its supply chain: Orange actively participates in the respect of human rights in its sphere of influence through the following collective initiatives:\n\n- -as a signatory to the United Nations Guiding Principles, Orange contributed  to  discussions  as  part  of  a  working  group  on companies and human rights (BHRWG of the United Nations)\n\non the new framework ('UNGPs 10+') to be put in place after ten years of applying the Guiding Principles. Orange shares the United Nations' analysis on the effective implementation of the Principle of 'protection of human rights' by public authorities and the Principle of 'respect for human rights' by companies. Orange  proposes  to  set  up  an  analysis  of  the  sharing  of responsibility between public authorities and companies prior to  the  implementation  of  a  Principle  of  'remedy'  yet  to  be developed;\n\n- -Orange also takes part in the ILO platform on child labor, which returned its work in June 2021;\n- -as part of the JAC, a Human Rights working group was created in February 2021. Initial work focused on the subject of forced labor, with questioning of suppliers by the operators, based on the report of the Australia Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) which described  the  forced  labor  allegations  and  concerns  of  the Uyghur people and other ethnic minorities in and from Xinjiang. Of the 35 suppliers questioned by the eight members of the JAC (including Orange), 29 provided proof of due diligence, either because they did not use suppliers in or from Xinjiang, or an audit did not provide any proof of forced labor associated with  the  factories  named  in  the  ASPI  report,  or  because corrective  measures  had  been  taken  (including  banning  the use of certain providers). The work of the JAC continues on follow-up of corrective action plans and for suppliers who are yet to respond; the next subject to be tackled by this working group will be child labor;\n- -an initiative  to  share  good  practices  between companies on these same issues was undertaken with the participation of Orange within the French association EDH (Entreprise pour les Droits de l'Homme).\n\nIn addition, Orange takes action to increase visibility of issues in the sector and to promote good practices. On several occasions in 2021, Orange presented the context and its policy in terms of respecting freedom of expression and privacy in response to the governmental injunctions for restriction or alteration of access to its services:\n\n- -at a round table organized in April by BSR (Business for Social Responsibility) and the ERB Institute 'EMEA roundtable about the  Future  of  Sustainable  Business.'  Orange  highlights  its transparency in the matter and the constant need to challenge civil society to ensure respect for continuity of service without discrimination;\n- -during  FIFAfrica21  in  September  at  a  session  dedicated  to this  topic,  alongside  the  United  Nations  special Rapporteur, academics and public authorities.\n\nFinally, Orange took part in the definition of human rights-related standards with the GRI.\n\nOther  aspects  related  to  the  respect  of  human  rights  and fundamental freedoms are described in the various sections of this chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

They have also obtained the Supplier Relations and Responsible Purchasing label issued by the French\n\nMinistry  of  the  Economy  and  Finance,  Business  Mediation  and the  National  Purchasing  Council;  they  once  again  passed  the intermediate assessment of this label in 2020 and 2021.\n\n## Measuring and reducing the carbon footprint of purchases and supplies\n\nAs part of its Scope 3 assessment and reduction work, Orange works with its suppliers to raise their awareness and involve them in  an  environmental  transformation  initiative  from  a  'win-win' approach.\n\nIn November 2021, the annual CSR Suppliers Forum organized by the Group Purchasing department deliberately chose to focus on the environment, by presenting the environmental goals adopted by Orange and the Scope 3 decarbonization initiative to which it has committed, as well as the ecosystem concerned and expectations towards  suppliers  in  this  regard.  In  addition,  Orange  actively contributes  to  working  groups  dedicated  to  energy  efficiency, the  circular  economy  and  carbon  footprint  reduction  acting  for the  purposes  of  the  JAC  (see  Section  2.2.3.2.1.2 Environmental monitoring framework).\n\nFrom an operational point of view, Orange works in collaboration with  the  Carbone4 consultancy firm to have a clearer picture of the  emissions  factors  of  its  purchases  (Scope  3).  At  the  end  of 2021,  the  Group  had  identified  large  portions  of  its  purchases with a significant CO2 equivalent impact based on the scope of activity of its French subsidiary. The aim is to further develop the\n\nmeasurement for all of the Group's subsidiaries. This is a preliminary exercise  before  the  integration  of  environmental  requirements with objectives which may be quantified during calls for tenders or in the course of the contractual relationship. Orange takes the approach of ensuring close collaboration with its suppliers, during the learning phase. To date, several calls for tenders have included environmental requirements (life cycle analysis, carbon reduction objective or energy efficiency objective).\n\nFor  its  supplies,  Orange  completes  this  approach  with  the measurement  of  the  carbon  footprint  of  all  distribution  flows  of customer equipment and logistical operations in the warehouse, in  all  European countries. This work conducted in 2021 enabled the rollout of various action plans aimed at reducing the carbon footprint of the supply chain, such as the reduction of packaging in France, use of the modal shift, the rollout of lockers for customers to collect products ordered online in Poland, etc.\n\nIn parallel, Orange Business Services, as a service provider, must comply  with  RFPs/RFIs  including  environmental  requirements. The  Group  therefore  already  has  to  justify  its  environmental transformation on a consistent basis with its objectives.\n\n## 4.6.1 Supplier CSR maturity assessment program for Orange subsidiaries\n\nIn addition to the maturity assessments carried out by the BuyIn joint venture on the Group's main suppliers (network equipment, IT software and hardware, customer devices, and service platforms), since 2019, Orange has defined an assessment program for local suppliers, which is gradually integrated by the subsidiaries. Its main objective is to increase the visibility of suppliers' CSR performance in  order  to  better  mitigate  risks  and  support  those  who  need  to strengthen their efforts in this area.\n\nThis  initiative  involves  assessing  the  CSR  maturity  of  suppliers belonging to the high CSR risk category and presenting a significant annual order value. In order to guarantee the independence and quality of the CSR analysis, supplier assessments were entrusted to a partner recognized in this field, whose methodology is based on international CSR standards and guidelines such as the Global Compact, ISO 26000, ILO or GRI.\n\nIn  2021,  this  initiative  was  extended  to  new  entities:  Orange Egypt,  Orange  Cote  d'Ivoire,  Orange  Morocco,  Orange  Bank, who joined the entities already involved, including Orange France, Orange Spain, Orange Slovakia, Orange Moldova, Orange Jordan, Orange Cameroon, Orange Madagascar, Orange Poland, Orange Romania, Orange Belgium, Sonatel in Senegal and OBS. To ensure the rollout, training has continued as well as the sharing of best practices between the subsidiaries.\n\nAs part of the program, 82 new assessments were carried out among existing  suppliers  in  2021,  including  20  suppliers  assessed  by France. There were 36 suppliers identified as requiring improvements i n  C SR per formance. For these suppliers, Orange entities systematically request corrective action plans and monitor them.",

        "page_content": "In France, the process continued in 2021. A new assessment (or reassessment) campaign was conducted on suppliers in the high CSR risk purchasing categories, under local or Group contracts. The first corrective action plans were requested and monitored over\n\nthe year 2021. At the same time, for consultations for high CSR risk purchasing categories, a CSR maturity assessment was requested. In addition, specific additional questionnaires may be sent out on certain Orange CSR requirements during these consultations.\n\n## 4.6.2 Interaction with Orange's suppliers as part of the JAC\n\nIn  addition  to  its  coordinated  on-site  CSR  audit  program  (see Section  2.2.3.2.6.2  Management framework for suppliers and subcontractors) using its own resources, Orange works alongside other operators via the Joint Alliance for CSR (JAC). The JAC has expanded its scope since 2018, with the JAC Academy, a body whose objective is to train suppliers in the JAC's audit methodology and incorporate it into their supply chains.\n\nIn 2021, the JAC conducted 71 audits, including 53 on-site audits carried out directly by the JAC, ten using the VAP & FLA standard (Validated  Assessment  Program,  Fair  Labor  Association)  and eight  audits  via  the  JAC  remote  protocol.  The  JAC  also  carried out 17 investigations among workers, specifically on their working\n\n## 4.7 Duty of Vigilance\n\nIn  accordance with Law no. 2017-399 of March 27, 2017 on the Duty of Vigilance of parent companies and contracting companies, Orange's  first  vigilance  plan  was  approved,  after  consultation, by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 4, 2018. It included a risk map,  procedures  for  evaluating  the  position  of  subsidiaries, subcontractors and suppliers, appropriate actions for mitigating risks  or  preventing  serious  abuses,  a  whistleblowing  and  report collection system, and a system for monitoring the measures taken.\n\nEach year, Orange updates its information and draws up a new plan, including targets for improving the system as well as measures to implement and evaluate its effectiveness. The new plan is available\n\n## 4.7.1 2022 vigilance plan\n\nThis is in line with the 2021 vigilance plan: it takes into account the Group's orientations expressed through its corporate purpose and implemented in its Engage 2025 strategic plan covering the period from 2020 to 2025.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe  vigilance  plan  and  its  report  are  presented  to  the  Group's Ethics  and  Sustainable  Performance  Committee  and  GCSERC, before approval by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Group CSR Department, in charge of effectively defining and implementing the plan, acts in coordination with the other Group functions and has created a vigilance plan monitoring group that benefits from the tools and networks of the CSR, Internal Control, Risk  Management,  Compliance,  Purchasing,  Human  Resources\n\nconditions. These actions made it possible to reach the level of tier-two and tier-three suppliers (65% of audits and investigations).\n\nThe JAC's actions in 2021 resulted in 402 corrective action plans, of which 43% addressed occupational health and safety requirements, 23% other working conditions, 18% excessive working hours and 16% the environment, affecting about 107,150 employees. In 2021, 643 action plans relating to the current year or previous years were closed.\n\nSince  2010,  the  JAC  has  conducted  a  total  of  812  audits  in 40 countries (84% of the audited production facilities are located in  Asia),  improving  the  working  conditions  of  around  1.4  million employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non the website gallery.orange.com/CSR and the main elements of  its  implementation are described in Chapter 2 for risk factors and their control framework and Chapter 4 for implementation of the measures taken. See the Cross-Reference Table of the Board of  Directors'  Management  Report  to  the  Shareholders'  Meeting (Section 7.3.3).\n\nOn  January  24,  2022,  Orange  received  the  FIR-A2  award  for the second time for the best vigilance plan (version 2021) which encourages the Group to continue to give its best efforts in the interests of continuous improvement.\n\nand  Legal  Departments  in  order  to  communicate  with  Group entities and enable the appropriation and effective implementation of the action plans stemming from the vigilance plan.\n\nResponsibility  for  the  steering  and  rollout  of  the  vigilance  plan is  assumed  by  the  vigilance  plan's  operational  committee,  a cross-functional group comprising members mainly from the CSR Department, the Audit, Control and Risk Management Department and the legal department. It meets twice a month to define the new operational orientation, priorities for action and evolution of the plan. The  engagement of  the  Group's  subsidiaries  and  entities  in  the actions related to the rollout of the vigilance plan is coordinated by the Supervisor responsible for deployment of the Group Vigilance Plan, in coordination with local correspondents. Each subsidiary or entity concerned by the plan has thus appointed a person in charge of implementing the vigilance plan within its scope.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

A summary appears below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.7.2 2021 vigilance plan implementation report\n\nThe law on the Duty of Vigilance stipulates that a report on the implementation of the previous year's plan be published. The full report  is  available  on  the  website  https://gallery.orange.com/ CSR. It provides a detailed report on the rollout and effectiveness of action plans specific to the implementation of the mechanism; the  main  results  for  2021  of  the  action  plans  implemented  for 'Health and Safety,' 'Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms' and  the  'Environment'  appear  in  this  chapter  on  Non-Financial Performance.\n\n## Scope of implementation of the plan\n\nThe  plan  is  intended  to  be  rolled  out  across  all  of  the  Group's consolidated subsidiaries based on the Group's risk management methodology. In 2020, the monitoring of the plan's rollout covered 95% of the Group's consolidated revenue; with a view to ongoing improvement, these subsidiaries not yet covered by the reporting were invited, starting from 2021, to include the risks related to the duty of vigilance identified by the Group CSR in their general risk mapping to ensure coverage.\n\n## Implementation\n\nSince 2020, its implementation has been coordinated by a dedicated person from the Group CSR Department, the vigilance plan rollout supervisor;  it  is  the  subject  of  a  quarterly  'Risks/Compliance/ Internal Control' dashboard within the Social responsibility division,\n\nwhich includes feedback and indicators on progress in the rollout of the plan.\n\nThe  coordinated  adoption  of  the  tools  deployed  according  to the  Group's  risk  management  methodology  is  ensured  by  a dedicated system for the Group's entities; it was supplemented in 2021 with the introduction of a digital GRC (compliance and risk management) tool to facilitate risk mapping updates, the prioritization of actions for implementation to ensure management and their regular assessment in the entity. It also facilitates the continuous improvement of the Group's risk standards related to the duty of vigilance.\n\nSupport for roll-out in the entity takes the form of individual and collective interactions and is also due to implementation of thematic monitoring on the Orange corporate social network. This allows for the sharing of good practices.\n\nInternal audit was strongly involved, in particular, in the form of a questionnaire on CSR governance sent to all Group entities and subsidiaries;  the  response  rate  was  52%.  The  Group's  Audit Department  began  two  new  projects  covering  the  scope  of the rollout of the Vigilance Plan in Spain in 2021 and in Egypt in 2022,  whose  recommendations will  be  known  in  2022.  Another project in 2021 related to the Group's whistleblowing mechanism, covering whistleblowing alerts related to compliance and the duty of vigilance (see Section 4.4 Breach of ethics rules - Processing of whistleblowing alerts).",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021\n\nTo the Annual General Meeting,\n\nIn our capacity as Statutory Auditor of your company (hereinafter the 'entity') appointed as independent third party, and accredited by the COFRAC under number 3-1049 (1) ,  we  have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on the historical financial information (actual or extrapolated) of the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared in accordance with the entity's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended December 31, 2021 (hereinafter, respectively,  the  'Information'  and  the  'Statement'),  included  in the Group's Management Report pursuant to the requirements of Articles L. 225-102-1, R. 225-105 and R. 225-105-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  entity,  we  conducted  works  designed  to express  a  reasonable  assurance  conclusion  on  the  information selected by the entity and identified by the sign \u221a .\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the  procedures  performed,  as  set  out  in  the  'Nature and scope of our work' section of this report, and the information collected,  nothing  has  come  to  our  attention  that  causes  us  to believe  that  the  Statement  is  not  presented  in  accordance  with the applicable regulatory requirements and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Comments\n\nWithout modifying our conclusion and in accordance with article A. 225-3 of the French Commercial Code, we have the following comments:\n\n- -For the calculation of health and safety indicators, despite the strengthening of the Group's data collection system and tool, the annual reporting by local entities can still be improved;\n- -For the calculation of indicators relating to training, the Group has  extended  the  scope  of  reporting,  which  now  covers 81% of the Group's consolidated workforce and 84% of the consolidated turnover (compared to 82% of the consolidated turnover in 2020), following the inclusion of Orange Madagascar and Orange Cyberd\u00e9fense;\n- -For  the  calculation  of  waste-related  indicators,  apart  from 'Mobiles  collected  from  customers',  the  reporting  process need  to  be  particularly  reinforced  in  MEA.  These  countries include  local  waste  management  providers  that  are  still  not mature, impacting the monitoring of waste and its treatment after removal. This perimeter represents less than 20% of the Group  consolidated  turnover  and  contributes  to  5%  of  the reported waste.\n\n## Reasonable assurance conclusion on a selection of non-financial information\n\nBased on the  procedures  performed,  as  set  out  in  the  'Nature and scope of our work' and 'Nature and scope of additional work on  the  information  selected  by  the  entity  and  identified  by  the sign \u221a' sections of this report, and the evidences collected, the information selected by the entity and identified with the symbol \u221a in the Statement has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n## Preparation of the Statement\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or established practices on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together  with  the  Guidelines,  the  main  elements  of  which  are presented in the Statement (or available on request from the entity's registered office).\n\n## Inherent limitations in preparing the Information\n\nAs discussed in the Statement, the Information may be subject to  inherent  uncertainty  because  of  incomplete  scientific  and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is  sensitive  to  methodological  choices,  assumptions and/or estimates used for their preparation and presentation in the Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4\n\n4",

We conducted around fifty interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\n## Nature and scope of our work\n\nWe planned and performed our work to address the areas where we identified that a material misstatement of the Information was likely to arise.\n\nWe believe that the work carried out, based on our professional judgement, is sufficient to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- -we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities, and the description of the principal risks associated;\n- -we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, with due consideration of industry best practices, where appropriate;\n- -we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in article L. 225-102-1 III as well as information regarding compliance with human rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation;\n- -we verified that the Statement provides the information required under article R. 225-105 II of the French Commercial Code, where relevant with respect to the principal risks, and includes, where  applicable,  an  explanation  for  the  absence  of  the information required under article L. 225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;\n- -we verified  that  the  Statement  presents  the  business  model and  a  description  of  principal  risks  associated  with  all  the consolidated  entities'  activities,  including  where  relevant and  proportionate,  the  risks  associated  with  their  business relationships,  their  products  or  services,  as  well  as  their policies,  measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- -we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- -assess  the  process  used  to  identify  and  confirm  the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented,\n- -corroborate  the  qualitative  information  (measures  and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important presented  in  Appendix.

As the Board decided to separate the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, St\u00e9phane Richard will remain a non-independent director and will continue to act as non-executive Chairman until the arrival of the new Chairperson, and at the latest until May 19, 2022, the date of the Orange Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nWith the arrival of a new Chief Executive Officer, opting for this form of  management is a natural evolution at a moment of change in governance and is in line with the wishes of the company's various shareholder stakeholders. St\u00e9phane Richard had also expressed the  view  that  the  functions  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  Chief Executive Officer should be separated by mid-2021.\n\nIn July 2021, with the forthcoming expiration of St\u00e9phane Richard's term  of  office,  the  Chairman  of  the  Governance  and  Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC) and the Lead Director jointly initiated a series of steps. This process led to the creation, at the proposal of the Chairman, of an ad hoc committee at the Board meeting of October 25, 2021, in accordance with Article 5 of the Board's internal regulations, to lead the process aimed at renewing the Group's governance.\n\nThe  Board  appointed  the  Chairwoman  of  the  GCSERC, Anne-Gabrielle  Heilbronner,  and  the  Lead  Director,  Bernard Ramanantsoa, as members of this ad hoc committee, which was set up to work closely with the French State as shareholder (Agence\n\ndes  participations  de  l'\u00c9tat)  in  the  search  for  and  identification of  a  candidate  for  the  position  of  Chief  Executive  Officer  (see Section  5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).  The  ad hoc committee was assisted in this work by a specialized recruitment firm, Spencer Stuart, and by an expert firm in executive compensation, Mercer.\n\nBeginning in November 2021, this ad hoc committee, after having established the framework for the profile and missions of the Chief Executive Officer, participated in numerous interviews to refine the list of potential candidates, who were asked to provide a strategic roadmap for the Group, and interviewed some of these candidates, leading it to draw up a final list of persons likely to hold the position of  Chief  Executive  Officer.  This  ad hoc  committee  also  worked on  the  development  of  the  remuneration  elements  of  all  types proposed to Christel Heydemann in her capacity as Chief Executive Officer (see Section 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for executive and non-executive corporate officers). The steps of this process as well as the roadmaps were regularly shared with the members of the Board of Directors, taking care to preserve confidentiality.\n\nThis  ad  hoc  committee interacted on numerous occasions with the directors (independent directors, employee directors) and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and reported on its work to the Board on several occasions. The committee's work included an update on the work carried out from 2019 as part of the succession plan foreseen in the event of incapacity of the General Management.\n\nMore recently,  this ad hoc committee has extended its work to the search for a new Chairperson of the Board of Directors and a new independent director, as Helle Kristoffersen, an independent director, resigned her position on January 31, 2022.\n\nOn March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors recommended Jacques Aschenbroich  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  replacing St\u00e9phane Richard, and Val\u00e9rie Beaulieu-James to replace Helle Kristoffersen as Director, both with effect from May 19, 2022 (see Section  6.5  Draft  resolutions  to  be  submitted  to  the  Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022, fifth and sixth resolutions).\n\n## 5.1 Composition of management and supervisory bodies\n\n## 5.1.1 Board of Directors\n\nAt February 16, 2022, the date on which the Board of Directors approved the Corporate Governance report, the Board comprised 14  members:  the  Chairman,  one  non-independent  Director, five  independent  Directors,  three  Directors  representing  the\n\npublic sector, three Directors elected by the employees and one Director representing the employee shareholders, with Ms. Helle Kristoffersen, an independent director, having resigned from her term of office on January 31, 2022.\n\n## Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\n|                  | Date first appointed   | Term ending              |\n|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| St\u00e9phane Richard | June 9, 2010  (1)      | At the close of the 2022 |\n| St\u00e9phane Richard | June 9, 2010  (1)      | Shareholders' Meeting    |\n\nSt\u00e9phane Richard ,  born  in  1961,  has  been  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer of Orange SA since March 1, 2011.

He simultaneously announced that he was appealing the decision and that he was resigning as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer before the end of his term; and\n- -no Director or Officer has been barred by a court from serving as a member of an administrative, management or supervisory body  of  a  listed  company  or  from  being  involved  in  the management or business operations of a listed company.\n\n## Family ties\n\nTo  the  Company's  knowledge,  there  are  no  family  ties  among Company Directors  and  Officers,  or  between  the  Directors  and Officers and the Executive Committee members.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nUnder Article 16 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, which may be consulted on the Group's website at www.orange. com, under the heading Group/Governance (see Section 5.2.1.4 Internal Guidelines), each Director must notify the Chairman of the Board and the Lead Director of any situation concerning them liable to give rise to a conflict of interest with a Group company.\n\nIn particular, Article 10 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors  entrusts  the  Lead  Director  with  a  specific  prevention role  regarding  conflicts  of  interest  which  could  occur,  primarily by carrying out awareness initiatives. The Lead Director informs the  Governance  and  Corporate  Social  and  Environmental Responsibility  (GCSER)  Committee  and  the  Board  of  Directors, if  the  Committee  deems  it  necessary,  of  any  potential  or  actual\n\nconflicts  of  interest  affecting  Corporate  Officers  and  the  other members of the Board of Directors. As required, the Lead Director may make recommendations to the GCSER Committee and the Board of Directors on how to manage potential conflicts of interest of which the former becomes aware or which have been reported to him or her (see Section 5.2.1.7 Lead Director).\n\nIn addition, Article 16.3 of these Internal Guidelines stipulates that for any situation concerning a Director that may create a conflict of interest, the Director concerned shall refrain from participating in the vote on the corresponding resolution.\n\nMoreover, a declaration relating to the existence or non-existence of a situation of conflict or divergence of interests (even potential) is requested annually from the Company's Directors and Officers as part of the preparation of the Universal Registration Document, as  well  as  when  taking  office  and  any  renewals  of  office.  At  its meeting of February 11, 2022, the GCSER Committee also took note of the annual declarations of the Directors and Officers (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge and as of the date of this Universal Registration Document, there is no potential conflict of interests between the duties of Directors or Corporate Officers with regard to Orange and their private interests or other duties.\n\nTo the best of the Company's knowledge, there are no arrangements or agreements with any major shareholder, customer, supplier or any  other  third  party  under  which  any  member  of  the  Board  of Directors or Corporate Officer has been appointed to the Board of Directors or Company's General Management (respectively).\n\n## 5.1.4.4 Shares and stock options held by members of the Executive Committee\n\nAs  of  the  date  of  this  document,  to  the  best  of  the  Company's knowledge,  the  members  of  Orange's  Executive  Committee, including St\u00e9phane Richard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Ramon Fernandez, Delegate Chief Executive Officer owned a total of 287,591 Orange shares, representing 0.01% of the capital.\n\nAs of the date of this document, the members of the Executive Committee do not hold any stock options, the last plan in force within the Company having expired on May 21, 2017.",

        "page_content": "## 5.2 Operation of the management and supervisory bodies\n\n## 5.2.1 Operation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors presides over all decisions relating to the Group's  major  strategic,  economic,  employment,  financial  or technological policies and monitors the implementation of those policies by the General Management.\n\n## 5.2.1.1 Legal and statutory rules relating to the composition of the Board of Directors\n\nIn  accordance  with  Article  13  of  the  Bylaws,  the  Board  of Directors  consists  of  at  least  twelve  members  and  at  most twenty-two  members,  including  three  Directors  elected  by  the employees, and one Director elected by the Shareholders' Meeting and representing  employee  shareholders.  The  term  of  office  for Directors is four years.\n\nPursuant to Government Order No. 2014-948 of August 20, 2014 relating to governance and capital transactions of companies with a  public  shareholding,  as  long  as  the  French  State  holds  more than 10% of the Company's share capital, it is entitled to appoint a representative to the Board of Directors, and a number of positions in  proportion  to  its  stake  are  reserved  for  members  that  it  may propose. The public sector has three representatives on the Board of Directors: one representative appointed by Ministerial Order and two Directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## 5.2.1.2 Independent  Directors\n\nThe annual assessment of Directors' independence was carried out  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  February  16,  2022,  on  the basis  of  a  proposal  by  the  Governance  and  Corporate  Social and  Environmental  Responsibility  Committee  (GCSERC).  In assessing Directors' independence, the Board took into account all of the criteria of the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, which state that a Director, to be considered independent:\n\n- -must not be or have been within the last five years:\n- -an  employee  or  executive  Corporate  Officer  of  the Company,\n- -an employee, executive Corporate Officer or Director of a consolidated subsidiary of the Company,\n- -an employee, executive Corporate Officer or Director of the parent company or a consolidated subsidiary of the parent company;\n- -must not be an executive Corporate Officer of a company in which the Company directly or indirectly holds a position on the Board of Directors or in which an employee appointed as such, or a person who is an Eexecutive Corporate Officer of the Company or who has been in the previous five years, hold the position of Director;\n- -must  not  be  a  customer,  supplier,  commercial  banker, investment banker or advisor:\n- -that is material to the Company or its Group, or\n- -for which the Company or its Group represents a significant share of business.\n\nThe assessment of the potential significance  of  the  relationship with Orange or its Group must be debated by the Board, and the qualitative  and/or  quantitative  criteria  used  in  this  assessment (continuity,  economic  dependence,  exclusivity,  etc.)  must  be explicitly stated in the Corporate Governance Report;\n\n- -must not have close family ties with a Corporate Officer;\n- -must not have been a Statutory Auditor of the Company within the last five years;\n- -must  not  have  been  a  Director  of  the  Company  for  more than  twelve  years.  Under  this  criterion,  loss  of  the  status  of independent Director occurs on the date at which this period of twelve years is reached.\n\nThe Afep-Medef Code recommends presenting a summary table of each Director's position with regard to independence criteria. The analysis of the GCSERC was thus carried out with regard to these criteria; the summary table appears at the end of this section.\n\nThe  three  Directors  representing  the  public  sector  and  the  four Directors  elected  by  the  employees  or  representing  employee shareholders  cannot,  by  definition,  be  deemed  independent under the Afep-Medef Code. The Orange Board of Directors met on  January  28,  2022  and  appointed  Christel  Heydemann,  an independent director at that time, as the Chief Executive Officer of Orange as from April 4, 2022. As the Board decided to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, St\u00e9phane Richard will remain a non-independent director and will continue to act as non-executive Chairman until the end of his term of office on May 19, 2022, the date of the Orange Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nWith regard to the Directors  considered  to  be  independent,  the GCSERC reviewed, firstly, their annual declarations made when preparing this document, including a section on potential conflicts of interest, and, secondly, any business relationships between the Orange group and these Directors or the companies that employ them, or in which they may hold terms of office (see Section 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).\n\nThe  GCSERC  also  examined  the  nature  of  business  dealings' volume  and  partnerships  with  listed  companies  in  which Company  Directors  hold  offices.  This  indicated  that  some  of these  companies  are  Orange  Business  Services  customers  for 'business' telecommunication services or Group suppliers in the normal course of business and for non-material amounts across the Orange group. The Board also reviewed any consultancy services declared that had been carried out the Company's Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors considered, given the nature and volume of  the  business  relationships  in  question  and  the  declaration  of independence made by each of the aforementioned Directors, that these relationships are not material either for the Orange group or for each of the groups or entities to which the Directors concerned belong. The Board of Directors concluded that these relationships are therefore not likely to call into question their independence.\n\nFollowing the discussions, Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, Alexandre Bompard,  Bernard  Ramanantsoa,  Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric  Sanchez  and  JeanMichel Severino were deemed to be independent under the criteria of the Afep-Medef Code, i.e. five of the Board's 14 members.\n\nI n  a d d i t i o n  t o  t h e  c r i t e r i a  s e t  o u t  i n  A r t i c l e  9 . 5  o f  t h e  A f e p - M e d e f  C o d e , after  having  appointed  Christel  Heydemann  as  Chief  Executive Officer of Orange as of April 4, 2022 at its meeting of January 28, 2022, the Orange Board of Directors stated, upon recommendation of the GCSREC, that, in the case in point, she could no longer be considered an independent director, even before she takes up her duties. Thus, with the exception of directors elected by employees or  representing  employee  shareholders,  who  are  not  taken  into account by the Afep-Medef Code for the purpose of calculating the proportion of independent directors, as of the date of this document the  Board  had  five  independent  directors  out  of  10,  taking  into account the resignation of Helle Kristoffersen from her directorship on January 31, 2022 (see Section 5. Corporate Governance), i.e.,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

diversity and balanced representation between women and men\n\nThe Board ensures that its membership complies with statutory provisions, specifically with regard to diversity and the balanced representation of women and men.\n\nAs of the date of this document, the Board of Directors had a total of six women out of 14 Directors. In application of the criteria resulting from the laws of January 27, 2011 (on the balanced representation of women and men on Boards of Directors and Supervisory Boards and on professional equality) and of May 22, 2019 (on growth and the transformation of companies, known as the PACTE law), the\n\nproportion  of  women  on  the  Board  was  40%  (four  women  out of 10). This percentage does not take into account the Directors elected by the employees or representing employee shareholders.\n\nFurthermore,  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-10  of  the  French Commercial  Code  and  the  Afep-Medef  Code,  Article  13  of  the Company's  Internal  Guidelines  (see  Section  5.2.1.4  Internal Guidelines) states that diversity in the membership of the Board and its committees also refers to indicators such as age, nationality, qualifications and professional experience.\n\nThis  provision  is  consistent  with  the  expectations  of  directors expressed in the 2019 evaluation of the operation of the Board and its committees regarding the need to diversify the profiles present on the Board, with expertise in the digital and international fields and in the 'directors' watch' work carried out by the GCSERC (see Section  5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).",

They  are  available  on  the  website www.orange.com, under the heading Group/Governance.\n\nThe Internal Guidelines specify, among other details, the respective responsibilities  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Chairman  and  the Chief Executive Officer, stipulating limits to his powers; they also set  the  rules  governing  the  composition,  powers  and  operating procedures of each Board committee.\n\nThe  Internal  Guidelines  also  specify  the  rules  governing  the information provided to Directors and the meetings of the Board.\n\nThe  Internal  Guidelines  have  been  updated  on  a  number  of occasions  by  the  Board  of  Directors  to  reflect  changes  in  the Company's governance.\n\n## 5.2.1.5 Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nArticle 1 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors specifies the role and duties of the Chairman.\n\nThe Chairman represents the Board of Directors and, except in unusual circumstances, is the only person authorized to act and speak in the Board's name. He organizes and steers the work of the Board of Directors and ensures the efficient running of corporate bodies in line with the principles of good governance. He serves as a liaison between the Board of Directors and the Company's shareholders, in coordination with the General Management; he monitors the quality of the Company's financial information. When\n\nthe roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  are  split,  he  may,  in  close  coordination  with  the  General Management, represent the Company in its upper-level relations with  the  public  authorities,  the  Group's  major  partners  and  key customers, both within France and internationally. In this case, he is briefed regularly by the Chief Executive Officer on the significant events  and  situations  relating  to  Group  operations,  and  he  may seek any information from the Chief Executive Officer needed to inform the Board of Directors and its committees. The Chairman may meet with the Statutory Auditors in order to prepare the work of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee. He may attend meetings of Board Committees under the conditions provided for in the Internal Guidelines.\n\nIn  accordance  with  Articles  29-1  and  29-2  of  French  Law  No. 90-568 of July 2, 1990, the Chairman of the Board of Directors also has the power to appoint and manage the civil servants employed by the Company.\n\nPursuant to the Company's Bylaws, the Chairman of the Board of Directors can hold his position until the age of 70.\n\n## 5.2.1.6 Committees of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  supported  by  expertise  from  three specialized  committees.  Their  role  is  to  provide  informed  input for the Board's discussions and assist in preparing its decisions. These committees meet as often as is necessary. Their powers and operating procedures are set out in the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors. In line with the Afep-Medef Code, significant responsibilities  are  given  to  independent  Directors.  Orange  also believes that it is important that each committee benefits from the\n\n- 5\n\n5",

At least two-thirds of members must be independent (excluding  Directors  representing  the  employees  or  employee shareholders, who are not taken into account). The Chairman of the Audit Committee is chosen from among the independent Directors.\n\nThe  composition  of  the  Audit  Committee  complied  with  the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, with the proportion of independent directors, excluding directors elected by employees or  representing  employee  shareholders,  being  three  out  of  four until the meeting of the Board of Directors on February 16, 2022, at  which time it was decided that Christel Heydemann could no longer be considered independent, even before she takes up her duties on April 4, 2022 (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent directors). Consequently, it decided, in accordance with the Afep-Medef code and the listing rules, that Christel Heydemann could no longer sit on the Audit Committee as a member. The Committee does not include any corporate officers. The composition of the Audit Committee also complies with the provisions of Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code relating to the establishment of a specialized committee to follow up questions relating to the preparation and control of accounting and financial information.\n\nIn  this  regard,  the  Committee  monitors  the  financial  reporting process  and  the  effectiveness  of  internal  control  and  risk management  systems  relating  to  accounting  and  financial reporting procedures. It issues a recommendation regarding the Statutory  Auditors  nominated  for  appointment,  organizes  their selection process and submits a reasoned recommendation to the Board regarding their choice and their compensation terms and conditions.  It  monitors  the  Statutory  Auditors'  fulfillment  of  their engagement  and  approves,  where  applicable,  the  provision  of services other than the certification of the financial statements, for such services that are not prohibited by law or Orange's rules. The Committee also studies all investment or divestment projects that meet the criteria set out in Article 2 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, and prepares related deliberations of the Board. The Audit Committee may also request that any audit or internal/ external review be carried out on any matter that it considers to fall within its remit.\n\nFurthermore, the Chairman of the Audit Committee is assigned a particular role, and reports to the Board of Directors on a regular basis on the execution of the Committee's functions, as well as the outcome of the statutory audit and the manner in which this has contributed to the integrity of the financial information, and the role the Audit Committee has played in this process. He immediately informs the Board of any difficulties encountered and submits a summary of the Audit Committee's discussions.\n\nThe responsibilities of the Audit Committee are detailed in Article 7 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Financial expertise within the Audit Committee\n\nMembers  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  required  to  have  or  to gain  financial  or  accounting  expertise.  The  Audit  Committee,  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 823-19 of the French Commercial Code and Section 407 of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act, must also comprise at least one person with specific expertise in the field of finance, accounting or statutory auditing, who must be independent (the 'financial expert').\n\nJean-Michel Severino was appointed financial expert of the Audit Committee during the Board of Directors' meeting of October 25, 2017, due to his role as Financial Inspector, his past functions as Chief Executive Officer of the Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement (AFD, French international development agency) and Vice-President of the World Bank for Asia, and his current position as Chairman of fund management company I&P.\n\n## Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Internal  Guidelines  of  the  Board  of Directors, the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC) has at least three members appointed by the Board.\n\nIts  composition is in line with the recommendations of the AfepMedef Code, as the ratio of independent Directors is 50% (excluding the Director elected by the employees, who is not included in this calculation).",

In particular, it exercises the powers of the specialized committees responsible for the appointment of Directors, and more generally of Corporate Officers, and renewal of their terms of office, as well as the compensation of these Corporate Officers. In these areas, it  is  tasked  in  particular  with  making  proposals  to  the  Board of  Directors,  as  well  as  to  the  Chairman  and,  as  necessary,  the Chief  Executive  Officer.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer  also  keeps the Committee informed of any new appointments to the Group Executive Committee; the Committee may offer its opinion on the terms and conditions for calculating the compensation of these new members, or regarding multi-year variable compensation plans (Long Term Incentive Plans) or free share award plans in place at the  Orange  group.  The  Committee  also  ensures,  with  regard  to succession plans, that a process is in place for when offices expire and in situations requiring particular attention.\n\nThe Committee also examines, in line with the Group's strategy, the  main  thrust  of  the  human  resources  and  corporate  social and  environmental  responsibility  policies  drawn  up,  based  on discussions with the Group's stakeholders. Once a year, it reviews the  Ethics  Committee's  report  on  the  Group-wide  actions  to implement ethics practices, and is informed about the rollout of the Group's compliance programs.\n\nArticle 8 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors details the responsibilities of the Committee.\n\n## Innovation and Technology Committee\n\nIn accordance with the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors, the  Innovation  and  Technology  Committee  has  at  least  three members appointed by the Board.\n\nThe  Committee  notably  reviews  the  significant  multi-annual investment  programs  and  the  major  technology  partnerships entered into by the Group, the Group's strategic policies in terms of innovation and technology, and its performance in this respect.\n\nArticle 9 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors details the responsibilities of the Committee.\n\n## Joint meeting of Board Committees\n\nIn accordance with Article 11 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of  Directors  -  and  without  constituting  a  specialized  committee of the Board itself - the Audit Committee, the GCSERC and the Innovation  and  Technology  Committee  meet  in  a  joint  forum once a year under the chairmanship of the Chairman of the Audit Committee or chaired by the oldest member present. This Joint Committee is responsible for preparing the work of the Board of Directors relative to internal control and risk management systems. Its last meeting took place on October 22, 2021.\n\nThe  Internal  Guidelines  provide  that  during  this  meeting,  the Company's General Management presents the risk mapping in the Company, in particular the effectiveness of the risk management system, the major risks facing the Group and the mechanisms for preventing and detecting fraud.\n\n## Special-purpose committees\n\nArticle 5 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provides that the Board may decide, for certain technical issues relating to the Company's operations and/or issues that may involve conflicts of interest and on which the Board of Directors is expected to give its view or make a decision, to establish a special-purpose committee to review these matters in consultation with the Company's General Management. Article 5 was amended at the request of the Board on December 5, 2018 in order to enable any Director to participate in such committees, provided that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Chairman, who is chosen from among the Committee's independent Directors.\n\nA  special-purpose  committee  consisting  of  the  Chairwoman  of the GCSERC, Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, and the Lead Director, Bernard Ramanantsoa, was set up by the Board on October 25, 2021  to  ensure,  in  close  collaboration  with  the  French  State shareholder  (Agence des participations de l'\u00c9tat),  the  process aimed at renewing the Group's governance (see Section 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).\n\n## 5.2.1.7 Lead  Director\n\nThe Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors allow the Board to appoint a Lead Director from among the independent Directors at the proposal of the GCSERC. A Lead Director must be appointed if the same person is both Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Board of Directors of February 12, 2020 appointed Bernard Ramanantsoa,  who  is  also  Chairman  of  the  Audit  Committee, as Lead Director. The powers of the Lead Director are defined in Article 15.1 of the Company's Bylaws (calling and chairing of Board meetings if the Chairman is unavailable), and in Article 10 of the Internal Guidelines, which also defines the duties.\n\n## Duties of the Lead Director\n\nThe main duties of the Lead Director are to ensure smooth relations between  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Company's  General Management. To this end, the Lead Director is responsible for:\n\n- -management of conflicts of interest: the Lead Director informs the GCSERC and, where appropriate, the Board of Directors, of  any  potential  or  actual  conflicts  of  interest  affecting  the Directors  and  Officers  of  which  the  Lead  Director  becomes aware or which are reported to him or her. Where necessary, the Lead Director makes recommendations on how to manage such conflicts;\n- -crisis situations:  at  the  request  of  the  Board  of  Directors, the  Lead  Director  ensures  that  the  Company's  Corporate Governance  enables  it  to  cope  with  any  exceptional  crisis situations it may face;\n- -assessment of the Board of Directors: the Lead Director may be called on to comment during the GCSERC's assessment of the work of the Board of Directors and its committees;\n- -report on activity: the Lead Director reports on the performance of the Lead Director's duties annually to the Board of Directors. At  Shareholders'  Meetings,  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors may invite the Lead Director to report on his or her work.\n\n## Powers of the Lead Director\n\nThe powers of the Lead Director are subject to the limits on those of the Board of Directors and its committees:\n\n- -calling meetings of the Board of Directors/Agenda: the Lead Director may, pursuant to Article 15.1 of the Company's Bylaws, ask  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  to  call  a  Board meeting on a given agenda or propose additional agenda items to the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Lead Director may call meetings of the Board of Directors if the Chairman is  unable to do so and may chair Board meetings when the Chairman is absent;\n- -information for Directors:  the  Lead  Director  ensures  that the  Directors  are  able  to  carry  out  their  duties  in  the  best possible conditions, and in particular that the Directors have all necessary information ahead of Board meetings;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

The Lead Director may, on proposal of the committee's Chairman, contribute to the work of the committees related to the Lead Director's duties;\n- -resources:  the  Lead  Director  has  access  through  the Company's  General  Management  to  all  documents  and information required to carry out his or her duties;\n- -compensation: the Board of Directors determines, when the Lead  Director  is  appointed,  the  amount  of  compensation the Lead Director receives for this role. In addition, the Lead Director can be reimbursed, upon presentation of receipts, for any expenses incurred in the execution of his or her duties, notably travel costs.\n\nIn  accordance  with  a  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of October 25, 2017, the Lead Director was identified as the General Management  contact  regarding  situations  related  to  matters  of compliance, especially in order to be able to report to all members of the Board on the effectiveness of the compliance system and its level of risk. The Lead Director participates annually in a meeting of the Risk Committee (see Section 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees).\n\n## 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year\n\n## Board activities\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  met  twelve  times  in  2021.  Its  meetings had a collective attendance rate of 97.2%. Individual attendance rates are presented in the table located at the end of this section. Information  on  the  method  for  allocating  and  the  payment  of Directors' compensation is presented in Section 5.4.2.1 Amount of compensation paid or allocated for 2021 activity. The typical Board meeting lasts around 3.5 hours.\n\nEach meeting is generally preceded by a meeting of one or more of the Board's committees with a view to preparing its work and deliberations. The issues discussed by the committees are reported on by their Chairperson to the Board of Directors.\n\nIn addition to the regular stages in the life of the Company (review of operating performance, quarterly results, half-yearly and annual financial  statements,  budget  review,  risk  factors,  setting  the compensation of Corporate Officers, etc.), in the first half of 2021, the  Board  authorized  the  conclusion  of  an  agreement  with  La Banque des Territoires (Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts), CNP Assurances and EDF Invest for the sale of 50% of the share capital and joint control of Orange Concessions and approved the principle and terms of the contribution agreement between Orange and TOTEM France. It  also  authorized  Orange  Spain  to  participate  in  the  700  MHz auction process for the rollout of 5G in Spain and to acquire the TV distribution rights to Spanish soccer for the 2021-2022 season. In September 2021, the Board approved the proposed acquisition of control of the Belgian operator VOO.\n\nAs in 2020, it paid particular attention throughout the year, in close coordination with General Management, to monitoring the Group's situation and the measures implemented in the context of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIt also voted in favor of the Orange share purchase offer reserved for employees and approved the organization of elections for directors elected by employees.\n\nThe Board of Directors also considered the findings and aftermath of the emergency numbers outage that occurred on June 2, 2021. It reviewed Orange Bank's development projects, in particular the 'One Bank' IT project.\n\nWith regard to the Group's strategy, the Board was given details of the 2023 ambitions for three of the high-growth strategic areas of Engage 2025 (Africa & Middle East, Orange Business Services and Orange Cyberdefense).\n\nIt was  also  kept  regularly  informed  of  the  Company's employee-related news (Employment & Skills Planning, signing of agreements).\n\nAfter consultation with the Central Social and Economic Committee (Central SEC) on the Group's strategic directions, its representative submitted a series of questions on these directions to the Board of Directors at its meeting on February 16, 2022, as it does every year, and the Board is currently working on a reasoned opinion in response.\n\nThe  Board  proposed  the  renewal  of  the  conditional  multi-year variable  compensation  plan  (Long  Term  Incentive  Plan,  or  LTIP) for Corporate Officers, executives and leaders for the period from 2022 to  2024.  This  system  will  be  submitted  to  the  vote  of  the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022 (see Section 5.4.1 Report of the Board of Directors on compensation and benefits paid to Corporate Officers). The Board of Directors' review of points related to  the  appointment,  compensation  and  evaluation  of  Corporate Officers is conducted in the absence of the interested parties.\n\nOn October 22, 2021, it also examined the existence and monitoring of the effectiveness of internal control and financial and non-financial risk management systems in the form of a joint meeting of the three committees.\n\nThe Board of Directors was presented with an update of the Group vigilance plan and the obligations regarding the Statement of NonFinancial  Performance.  It  also  approved  the  information  on  the corporate social and environmental issues of the Group included in the Report of the Board of Directors to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of the Afep-Medef Code relating to the policy of gender diversity in management bodies, the Board was presented with a progress report on the objectives that the Company has set for itself in terms of increasing the number of women in management bodies, in particular within the management network of the Group's executives and leaders. It approved the annual resolution on the policy of professional and salary equality between  women  and  men  (see  Section  2.2.4.2.4  Promoting diversity and inclusion - Gender equality in the workplace).\n\nThe Board also carried out a self-assessment of its operations in the second half of 2021 (see Section 5.2.1.9 Periodic review of the operations of the Board of Directors and its committees).\n\nAt the Board of Directors' meeting of February 16, 2022, Bernard Ramanantsoa reported on his role as Lead Director in 2021.\n\nThe main topics covered in his latest report are:\n\n- -the monitoring of potential crisis situations that could undermine the Company's governance;\n- -the quality of relations within the Board and between the Board of Directors and the General Management;\n- -periodic  review  of  independence  and  potential  conflicts  of interest.\n\nFinally, at its meeting of November 24, 2021, the Board of Directors took  note  of  the  decision  of  St\u00e9phane  Richard,  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer,  to  submit  his  resignation  to  the  Board following his conviction on appeal in the arbitration proceedings in the 'Tapie - Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais' case. Consequently, the Orange Board of Directors' meeting of January 28, 2022, appointed Christel Heydemann, an independent director, as Chief Executive Officer of Orange as from April 4, 2022. On this occasion, the Board of Directors decided to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.",

        "page_content": "## Committee activities\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee met ten times in 2021. Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 100%.\n\nIt  met regularly with Orange's Senior Management and the main managers  of  the  Group's  Finance  Department,  as  well  as  with the  Head  of  the  Group  Audit,  Control  and  Risk  Management Department and the Statutory Auditors in order to review with them their respective action plans and follow-up on these plans.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nIn 2021, the Committee analyzed the Statutory and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2020 fiscal year and the first half of 2021, together with the first and third quarter results for 2021. At its meeting on February 14, 2022, it reviewed the results of the fourth quarter of 2021, as well as the Statutory and Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2021 fiscal year. It verified that the processes for  producing  accounting  and  financial  information  complied with  regulatory  and  legal  requirements,  especially  in  terms  of internal control. In this respect, the Committee reviewed the draft Management Report and heard the Statutory Auditors' Reports. It also reviewed the 2022 budget. The significant risks and off-balance sheet commitments and their accounting impacts, as well as the results of the asset impairment tests were also discussed.\n\nIn addition, the Committee reviewed all financial communications before their publication.\n\n## Internal control and risk management, ethics\n\nBefore approving each set of financial statements, the Committee undertook a review of the significant disputes in which the Group is involved.\n\nMoreover,  the  Committee  examined  the  results  of  the  annual evaluation  of  the  internal  financial  control  system,  which  were presented  to  it  by  the  Group  Internal  Control  Department,  and concluded  that  the  system  was  effective  (see  Section  2.2.2.2 Summary of internal control work implemented pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act).\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the major risks that the Company believes could have a significant adverse effect on its business, financial position or earnings, particularly in light of its risk mapping. It  also  ensured  that  the  recommendations  formulated  after  the internal audit assignments by the Group Audit, Control and Risk Management Department were correctly implemented. The findings of the audit assignments as well as the schedule of upcoming audit assignments were presented. The description of material risks is presented in Section 2.1 Risk factors.\n\n## Management of debt and cash\n\nThe  Committee  regularly  reviewed  the  Group's  debt  refinancing and cash management policy and was given a presentation on the annual update of the Group's derivative counterparty and cash investment limits.\n\n## Development projects and strategic plan\n\nThe Committee was informed about the position of certain of the Group's equity interests in Europe, Africa and the Middle East and reviewed the asset impairment tests conducted at the end of 2021 at the Group's main subsidiaries and equity interests, based on the entities' updated strategic plans, in order to take the 2022 budget as well as geopolitical and macroeconomic changes into account.\n\n## Statutory Auditors\n\nThe Committee reviewed the fees of the Statutory Auditors for 2021 and the financial terms of their work during the year. In the second half of 2021, the Statutory Auditors presented their external audit plan to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC)\n\nThe GCSERC met eight times in 2021. Its meetings had a collective attendance rate of 100%.\n\n## Compensation of Directors and Officers\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  2021,  the  Committee  determined  the  target proposals and calculation methods for the variable portion of the compensation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and the two Delegate Chief Executive Officers for 2021, and the proposed objectives of the Corporate Officers for 2022 were reviewed and discussed at several meetings and defined in February 2022. These efforts have given rise to a great deal of work, within the framework of  the  GCSERC  and  with  the  support  of  the  special-purpose committee for the renewal of the Group's governance, with a view to preparing the compensation policy for Corporate Officers in respect of  their  terms  of  office  for  the  2022  fiscal  year  (see  Section  5.4 Compensation and benefits paid to Directors, Officers and Senior Management).\n\nThe Committee also monitored the implementation of the conditional multi-year variable compensation plans (Long Term Incentive Plans or LTIPs), in particular the results of the LTIP 2019-2021 and the overall terms and conditions of a new LTIP 2022-2024, the principle of  which will  be  put  to  the  vote  of  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of May 19, 2022 (see Section 5.4.1 Report of the Board of Directors on compensation and benefits paid to Corporate Officers).\n\nLastly, the Committee prepared the breakdown of compensation for  Directors  in  respect  of  the  2021  fiscal  year  and  defined the  Directors'  compensation  policy  for  the  2022  fiscal  year (see  Section  5.4.2  Board  of  Directors'  report  on  Directors compensation). In this context, the GCSERC, taking into account the recurrence of the number of Board meetings and the role played by the chairmen of the three committees, proposed to the Board to increase the compensation of the Directors for their participation in Board meetings as well as that of the committee Chairmen in their capacity as such, and to adopt a new compensation scale as of January 1, 2022.\n\n## Governance and operation of the Board\n\nThe  Committee  reviewed  the  Board's  Corporate  Governance Report attached to the Management Report.\n\nIt also examined, as it does every year, the situation of each of the independent Directors  with  regard  to  the  independence  criteria set out in the Afep-Medef Code (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nAt its meeting of February 11, 2022, the Committee took note of annual declarations made by Orange's Directors and Officers, in which certain information is required: number of Orange shares held and any related-party transactions, terms of office and positions held in 2021, personal situation, potential conflicts of interest, etc.\n\nMembers  of  the  GCSERC  noted  that  in  light  of  the  annual declarations made by Directors and Officers, no specific conflicts of  interest  had  been  identified.  This  review,  together  with  other work carried out by the Committee, made it possible to propose to the Board of Directors at its meeting of February 16, 2022 that five  Directors  be  considered  independent  within  the  meaning  of the Afep-Medef Code, Helle Kristoffersen having resigned from her position on January 31, 2022, and Christel Heydemann no longer being able to be considered independent and a member of the Audit Committee, even before she takes up her position on April 4, 2022 (see Section 5.2.1.2 Independent Directors).\n\nThe Committee also considered the annual activity report of the Lead Director.\n\nDuring  the  year,  the  Committee  was  presented  with  the operationalization and steering of Orange's corporate purpose and the establishment of a new committee called the 'Raison d'agir' Committee (Purpose of action) designed to make recommendations on implementing the corporate purpose commitments (alignment of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

The GCSERC recommended to the Board his appointment to the ITC.\n\nI n February 2021, the GCSERC reviewed the conditions for renewing the term of office of legal entity Director Bpifrance Participations, whose term expires at the close of the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021.\n\nBy ministerial order dated May 17, 2021, Orange was informed of the  appointment  of  St\u00e9phanie  Besnier  to  replace  Claire  VernetGarnier  as  the  State's  representative  on  the  Board  of  Directors, which appointed her to join the Audit Committee.\n\nIn the second half of 2021, following St\u00e9phane Richard's statement that he would not seek reappointment as Chief Executive Officer, the GCSERC began a process to search for and identify a new CEO with the support of an external firm. This process has been the  subject  of  joint  work  by  the  Chairwoman  of  the  GCSERC and the Lead Director and of regular reports to the Board. As of November 24, 2021, the date St\u00e9phane Richard announced his intention to resign, this process was extended to the search for a Chairman.\n\nIn addition, following the resignation of Helle Kristoffersen from her position as Director on January 31, 2022, the GCSERC launched a search to identify potential candidates to replace her. Accordingly, it  has  identified  a  list  of  candidates  who  meet  the  requirements of  gender  diversity  and  independence  and  who  correspond  to the  skills  profile  required  by  the  Board,  in  accordance  with  the recommendations made during the last evaluation of its operations.\n\nMore generally, the committee has continued its ongoing monitoring work ('director watch') in order to regularly review a list of director profiles that may correspond to the Board's needs and thus enable it to prepare for any necessary replacement. The Committee remains attentive to any profile with expertise in the fields of innovation and technology, internationally where appropriate, and who is or has been a Senior Manager.\n\n## CSR, ethics, compliance\n\nThe Committee reviewed the strategy and important issues related to the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility policies. It examined the  major  achievements  in  this  area  in  2021.  The  Committee reported to the Board of Directors on its work on this subject.\n\nThe Committee was presented with a report on the progress of the rollout of the Group's corruption prevention program, in particular relating  to  the  implementation  of  measures  resulting  from  the French Law of December 9, 2016, known as the Sapin II Law, and from  Government  Order  No.  2017-1180  of  July  19,  2017  on  the publication of non-financial information. In particular, the Committee examined  the  implementation  of  the  Code  of  Conduct  and  the obligations regarding the Statement of Non-Financial Performance, and the rollout of the Group's vigilance plan in 2021. The Board of Directors was informed on this matter.\n\nThe  Committee  also  examined  the  annual  report  on  ethics  and compliance  and  studied  the  Group-wide  actions  resulting  in the  implementation  of  the  ethics  and  compliance  program  (see Section  2.2  Activity and risk management framework).  It  also assessed the vigilance plan for 2022 and the obligations regarding the Statement of Non-Financial Performance.\n\nThe GCSERC was also presented with the system put in place to respond to the assessment notice from the French Anti-Corruption\n\nAgency  (AFA)  received  in  October  2021,  which  concerns  the 'Orange  Business  Services'  activities  of  Orange  SA  and  all  the subsidiaries or companies it controls. He was informed that certain Directors could be contacted as part of the interviews that AFA will request.\n\nFinally,  as  part  of  the  periodic  review  of  the  Board's  work  (see Section  5.2.1.9  Periodic review of the operations of the Board of Directors and its committees),  the  Committee  continued  its discussions on the development and monitoring of replacement plans for Corporate Officers.\n\n## Employment\n\nThe Committee monitored changes in the yearly indicators of the employee satisfaction survey. At its meeting of November 18, 2021, the  Committee was presented with a detailed annual report on workplace gender equality and equal pay at Orange, specifically covering the proportion of women in the workforce, an analysis of pay gaps, and the awareness and training initiatives undertaken in 2021, and prepared the relevant Board discussions. The gender equality policy within the governing bodies was reviewed by the GCSERC and was the subject of a recommendation to the Board, which, in accordance with the new provisions of the Afep-Medef Code,  determines  the  gender  equality  objectives  within  these bodies. This policy is supplemented by special attention paid to the percentage of women on the Boards of Directors of the Group's subsidiaries and to that of the specialized committees reporting to the Executive Committee.\n\n## Innovation and Technology Committee (ITC)\n\nThe  ITC  met  three  times  in  2021.  Its  meetings  had  a  collective attendance rate of 88.9%.\n\nAfter having carried out a debate at the beginning of 2021 on its role and function, the ITC devoted one of its meetings to the organization of innovation and technologies within Orange. It reviewed Orange's research  priorities  and  was  presented  with  the  Group's  public Cloud objectives and Orange's innovation strategy.\n\n## Joint meeting of Board Committees\n\nAt  a  joint  meeting  in  October  2021,  the  members  of  the  Audit Committee, the GCSERC and the ITC reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management system, with a review of 2021 and a focus on the Group's major risks, particularly from the point of view of security, including data and the impact of climate change.\n\n## Special-purpose committee\n\nA special-purpose committee, as provided for in Article 5 of the Internal Guidelines, consisting of the Chairwoman of the GCSERC, Anne-Gabrielle  Heilbronner,  and  the  Lead  Director,  Bernard Ramanantsoa, was set up by the Board on October 25, 2021 to carry out, in close collaboration with the French State shareholder (Agence  des  participations  de  l'\u00c9tat),  the  process  of  searching for and identifying a candidate for the position of Chief Executive Officer with a view to renewing the governance of the Group. The committee was assisted in this work by a specialized recruitment firm and by an expert firm in executive compensation. In a second phase,  this  special-purpose  committee  extended  its  work  to the search for a new Chairman of the Board of Directors and an independent director to replace Helle Kristoffersen, an independent director, who resigned from her position on January 31, 2022.\n\n## Strategic seminar\n\nAll members of the Board of Directors met with the members of the Executive Committee for a strategic seminar on December 7, 2021. This meeting provided the Directors with an overview of the Orange ecosystem as well as a projection of the decommissioning of the copper network and a focus on the Group's climate strategy.",

elected as Directors by the employees, with a start date of December 3, 2021.\n\n## 5.2.1.9 Periodic review of the operations of the Board of Directors and its committees\n\nThe  operating  procedures  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and of  its  committees  are  alternatively  assessed  internally  via self-assessment, as was the case in 2021, and externally with the help of an independent consultant, as was the case in 2019.\n\nIn the second half of 2021, the GCSERC proposed to the Board a self-assessment scheme based on the response to a questionnaire and then a one-on-one interview with the GCSERC Chairwoman and  the  Secretary  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  All  the  Directors participated in this exercise.\n\nDuring the discussions in the GCSERC and then in the Board of Directors' meetings, the responses and comments made by the Directors were very consistent. The Directors were generally very satisfied  with  the  operation  of  the  Orange  Board  of  Directors, except  for  the  length  of  the  meetings,  which  were  sometimes considered too long, and an expectation that the Board should be more involved in the Group's strategy. Its composition is considered appropriate by a majority of its members, who would nevertheless like  to  strengthen  it  with  international  profiles  and  a  focus  on technical subjects. The fact that all members' voices are heard and there is freedom of debate were unanimously emphasized. Finally, it appeared that combining the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer was now considered only 'moderately adapted' to Orange's situation.\n\nThe  main  recommendations,  some  of  which  are  already  being implemented, were submitted to the Board at its December 7, 2021 meeting and are structured around three themes:\n\n- -Strategy  and  role  of  the  Board  (deepen  the  topics  of  value creation, improve strategic visibility, periodically offer training on certain technological issues of the Company);\n- -Quality of the debates and how they function (reduction of the average length of the meetings, in particular on the subjects which do not necessarily concern the Council, more concise documentation);\n- -Practical organization of the Board (review the compensation package for Directors, encourage informal exchanges between Directors outside the framework of the Board).\n\n## 5.2.1.10 Description of the procedure for\n\n## assessing ongoing agreements in place\n\nPursuant  to  Article  L.  225-39  of  the  French  Commercial  Code as  amended  by  the  law  of  May  22,  2019  on  the  growth  and transformation  of  companies  (known  as  the  PACTE  law),  the Boards of Directors of listed companies are required to implement a  procedure  to  regularly  assess  whether  agreements  relating  to ongoing operations and entered into on an arm's length basis meet these conditions.\n\nOn December 3, 2019, the Orange SA Board of Directors adopted an internal procedure to assess whether the agreements concluded between  (i)  Orange  SA  and  (ii)  the  Directors  and  Officers  of Orange SA or the public sector (including the French government, Bpifrance Participations, central government administrations and companies controlled by the government) or any company in which an Orange SA Director or Officer holds a position, can continue to  be  described  as  agreements  'relating  to  ongoing  operations concluded on an arm's length basis'.\n\nAs part of the procedure, the Group Legal Department is responsible for  (i)  centralizing  the  recording  of  these  freely  negotiated agreements with the Legal Departments of the Orange SA divisions, and (ii) carrying out a subsequent evaluation.\n\nThis  involves  assessing  agreements  prior  to  their  signature, agreements being classified on a case-by-case basis by the Legal Department  in  question,  with  the  support  of  the  Operational, Financial  and  Compliance  Departments  of  the  Group,  on  the basis of cumulative criteria (the operation must be both ongoing and entered into on an arm's length basis), and a re-examination\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

An  annual i n-depth check is also carried out on material agreements to ensure that they continue to meet the criteria for current agreements and normal conditions at the level of Orange SA. Material agreements are  those  subject  to  significant  commitments  for  Orange  SA  or decisions made in Group Investment Committees.\n\nA report on this procedure is presented annually to the Board of Directors for approval. The Board will examine the effectiveness of the procedure for evaluating standard agreements entered into on an arm's length basis within the Group.\n\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020,  the  above-mentioned report established that the agreements identified, subject to the procedure, could continue to be classified as ongoing agreements entered into on an arm's length basis. The report was presented to  the  Audit  Committee on July 26, 2021 and was approved by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2021 on the recommendation of the Audit Committee. Its review led to the conclusion that the internal procedure was effective and that it was implemented under the same conditions in 2021.\n\n## 5.2.2 Operation of General Management\n\n## 5.2.2.1 Form of exercise of General Management\n\nOn February 23, 2011, the Board of Directors decided to combine the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and to appoint St\u00e9phane  Richard  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  with responsibility for the General Management of the Company. This management structure was considered at the time by the Board of Directors to be the best suited to the Company's organization and mode of operation, and was supplemented by the appointment of a statutory Lead Director with significant duties and powers (see Section 5.2.1.7 Lead Director).\n\nIn view of the end of St\u00e9phane Richard's term of office, the Orange Board of Directors, which met on January 28, 2022, decided to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and appointed Christel Heydemann, then an independent director, as Chief Executive Officer of Orange as from April 4, 2022. At the end of the Chairman's term of office, and under the conditions defined by the Bylaws, the Board of Directors must decide on the terms and conditions for the exercise of General Management, which is assumed either by a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, or by another natural person appointed by the Board of Directors and bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer. With the arrival of a new Chief Executive Officer, opting for this form of management is a natural evolution at a moment of change in governance and is in line with the wishes of the company's various shareholder stakeholders; St\u00e9phane Richard also expressed similar sentiments.\n\n## 5.2.2.2 Limits set on the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's or the Chief Executive Officer's powers\n\nIn accordance with the law and the Company's Bylaws, the Chief Executive Officer is invested with extensive powers to act in the Company's name. He exercises his powers within the limits of the corporate  scope  and  subject  to  those  powers  that  the  law  and Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors expressly attribute to him. He is supported in this task by the Executive Committee and any Delegate Chief Executive Officers.\n\nArticle 2 of the Internal Guidelines of the Board of Directors provides that  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  must  obtain  the  Board's  prior authorization before committing the Company to:\n\n- -investments or divestments exceeding 200 million euros per transaction falling within the consolidation scope, and when the  total  consolidated  exposure  exceeds  the  Board's  prior authorization for such an investment; or\n- -any  new  investment  (excluding  acquisitions  of  telecom spectrum) under the Group's major multi-annual technology programs in its main geographies (such as FTTH, 5G, etc.) in an average amount per annum exceeding 2.5% of the Group's investments budgeted during the year in question.\n\nIn  addition,  acquisitions  of  telecom  spectrum  by  the  Group  in geographies representing at least 10% of consolidated revenue are subject to prior presentation to the Board of Directors, which will set a maximum amount that can be bid at auction.\n\nInvestments or divestments remain, as the case may be, subject to independent review by the governing bodies of the subsidiaries in question.\n\nFurthermore, any investment or divestment that falls outside the scope  of  the  Company's  strategy  and  involves  a  transaction  in excess of 20 million euros must first be approved by the Board of Directors. Where relevant, the Board of Directors must be kept informed  of  any  significant  new  developments  regarding  such transactions.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer must also obtain the authorization of the Board of Directors annually, within ceilings determined by it, to issue sureties, endorsements or guarantees or for the Company to issue bonds or similar securities or arrange syndicated bank loans.\n\n## 5.2.2.3 Executive Committee and Group governance committees\n\nThe Executive Committee, under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for managing the Group and coordinating the implementation of its strategy. It oversees the achievement of operational, employee-related and technical objectives, as well as of those relating to the allocation of financial resources. Its meetings are generally held weekly. Its composition is set out in Section 5.1.3 Executive Committee.\n\nWithin the Company, a series of powers and signing authority is in place from the Chief Executive Officer to each of the members of the Executive Committee, each of whom has applied them in their respective area of expertise.\n\nSeveral  specialized  committees  reporting  to  the  Executive Committee were created to apply or oversee the implementation of its directives throughout the Group. The main committees that support Group governance are the Group Investment Committee, the Treasury and Financing Committee, the Tax Committee, the Claims and Commitments Committee, the Risks Committee, the Employment and Skills Committee and the Disclosure Committee. Each  committee  has  adopted  Internal  Guidelines  or  a  charter defining  their  operating  and  deliberation  procedures.  These committees are also responsible for monitoring risk management with regard to financial liabilities, thereby helping limit the Group's overall exposure.\n\nThe Group Investment Committee , on delegation from the Chief Executive Officer, is chaired by the Delegate Chief Executive Officer, Executive  Director  Finance,  Performance  and  Development, and  includes  four  other  permanent  members:  the  Deputy  Chief Executive Officer in charge of People & Group Transformation, the Chief Technology and Innovation Officer, the Senior Executive VicePresident, Strategy and Cybersecurity activities and the General Secretary.  The  Internal  Guidelines  of  this  Committee  (terms  of reference)  evolved  in  March  2020.  Its  role  is  to  review  projects implying financial commitments, off-balance sheet commitments and non-financial commitments for the Group, also focusing on value  creation.  Other  than  in  extraordinary  circumstances,  the Committee has decision-making authority on investment projects in  IT  systems  and  service  platforms  exceeding  10  million  euros as well as bids in response to calls for tender on the Enterprise",

It also rules on acquisitions and asset disposals, and the financing needs of subsidiaries in the event of an increase in the Group's financial exposure. This Committee meets as often as it deems necessary and in general once a week.\n\nThe Treasury and Financing Committee , chaired by the Delegate Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development, sets the guidelines for managing the Group's debt and financing on a quarterly basis, especially in respect of its  liquidity,  interest  rate,  exchange  rate  and  counterparty  risks. The financial monitoring of the subsidiaries is also presented to the Committee. The Committee also reviews past management (key debt figures, completed transactions, financial results, etc.). It met four times in 2021.\n\nThe Tax Committee is  chaired  by  the Delegate Chief Executive Officer, Executive Director Finance, Performance and Development. Its role is to review the major tax issues in order to determine their accounting consequences, if any. The materiality threshold for tax matters that must be submitted to the Tax Committee is 10 million euros. This Committee meets twice a year. However, the Committee may hold special meetings to assess and approve the tax options to be taken on issues that are particularly important for the Group. The Tax Committee met twice in 2021.\n\nThe Claims and Commitments Committee , which is chaired by the General Secretary, examines the Group's significant disputes and  contractual  commitments  to  ensure  that  the  related  risks are  taken  into  account  as  necessary  in  the  form  of  accounting provisions.  The  Committee's  role  also  includes  approving  the information in the notes to the financial statements on significant disputes. The Committee met seven times in 2021.\n\nThe  Risks  Committee ,  which  operates  under  the  authority of  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  is  chaired  by  the Delegate  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Executive  Director  Finance, Performance and Development. It is made up of members of the Executive Committee, ten of whom are permanent members. The Committee's role is  to  review  the  Group's  principal  risks  and  to propose to the Executive Committee all decisions regarding risk management and the quality of internal control, as well as to assist the General Management in its risk management reporting to the Audit Committee and Board of Directors. To that end, the Committee validates the risk mapping, validates and monitors the execution of the annual internal audit program and ensures the monitoring of the implementation of audit recommendations and corrective action plans. It monitors fraud and corruption prevention programs and reviews identified cases during meetings with the Lead Director. It is also informed of the main work on internal control, and ensures the consistency of the internal control and internal audit plans with the risk management objectives. The Committee met five times in 2021.\n\nThe Employment and Skills Committee ,  under the authority of the Chief Executive Officer, is chaired by delegation by the Deputy CEO, People & Group Transformation. It is made up of members of the Executive Committee or, by delegation, their representatives. The  Committee  plays  a  key  role  in  implementing  the  Group's employment  policy.  The  Employment  and  Skills  Committee examines employment forecasts and trends in the Group's sectors, divisions and countries. It also looks at all plans for external hires\n\nin  France.  It  also  issues  recommendations  on  each  candidate presented. The Committee meets several times a year.\n\nThe Disclosure Committee operates under the authority of the Delegate  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Executive  Director  Finance, Performance  and  Development.  It  is  chaired,  by  delegation,  by the  Group  Chief  Accounting  Officer,  and  includes  the  relevant department  heads  within  the  accounting,  legal,  internal  audit, management control, investor relations and communications fields. It  ensures  integrity,  accuracy,  and  compliance  with  applicable laws and regulations and recognized practices, and ensures the consistency  and  quality  of  the  Group's  financial  information.  It carries  out  this  mission  within  the  procedural  framework  for  the preparation and validation of financial information as defined by the Group. Accordingly, it examines all financial disclosures made by the Company: the consolidated financial statements, the annual and half-yearly financial reports, the Registration Document (now called the Universal Registration Document) filed with the AMF, the US Annual Report (Form 20-F) filed with the SEC, as well as any press releases containing financial information and presentations to institutional investors. In addition, the Committee looks at financial communication issued by the principal listed subsidiaries. It met 17 times in 2021.\n\nFurthermore,  in  terms  of  the  Group's  governance,  the  following committees  help  guide  strategy  in  the  area  of  non-financial performance and diversity at Orange.\n\nThe Group Ethics and Sustainable Performance Committee deals with issues of compliance, ethics and social responsibility at  Orange.  The  Committee  is  co-chaired  by  the Delegate  Chief Executive  Officer,  Executive  Director  Finance,  Performance and  Development  and  the  Executive  Director  CSR,  Diversity and  Solidarity.  The  other  members  are  appointed  by  General Management, including members of the Executive Committee, the Group's Inspector General and the Chief Compliance Officer. During a meeting in July 2019, the decision was made to expand its role to steering non-financial performance. It now constitutes the collegiate governance  decision-making  body  of  the  Executive  Committee on  in  areas  of  social  responsibility.  It  validates  the  information presented to the Directors of the Board in the GCSERC and reviews, in  particular,  the  Non-Financial  Performance  Declaration  (NFPD) and the 'Orange Group Vigilance Plan,' which are included in the Management Report presented to the Shareholders' Meeting. The Group Ethics Committee met four times in 2021.\n\nThe  Professional  Equality  Strategy  Committee ,  created  in 2011, guides Orange's policy in the area of gender equality in the workplace. It is made up of members of the Executive Committee as well as individuals representing the Group's entities, and is led by the Group's Diversity and Inclusion Department. This committee defines the main orientations of the Group's gender equality policy and monitors the implementation of this policy in five areas: gender diversity in all of the Group's businesses, particularly in the technical and digital sectors, access for women to positions of responsibility, equal  pay  for  men  and  women,  work-life  balance  and  the  fight against violence. As such, since 2020, the Committee has been informed of the implementation of the global agreement on gender equality, the fight against discrimination and violence, and work-life balance, which was signed with UNI global union on July 17, 2019. The Professional Equality Strategy Committee met twice in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

The Company hereby\n\ndeclares that it complies with the recommendations of the AfepMedef Code as of the date of this document.\n\n## Main differences with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange\n\nOrange has endeavored to take the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  Corporate  Governance  rules  into  account.  However, since the Company is not a US company, most of these rules do not  apply  to  it,  and  the  Company  is  allowed  to  follow  the  rules applicable in France instead. Accordingly, Orange has elected to refer to the Afep-Medef Code, where the recommendations differ in\n\nsome respects from the NYSE governance rules applicable to US companies listed on the NYSE.\n\nThe main differences between Orange's practices and the rules applicable to US companies are described in Orange's annual report (Form 20-F) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission of the United States.\n\n## 5.4 Compensation and benefits paid to Directors, Corporate Officers and Senior Management\n\n## 5.4.1 Report of the Board of Directors on compensation and benefits paid to Corporate Officers\n\nThe Company refers in general, and in particular with regard to compensation, to the Afep-Medef Corporate Governance Code for listed companies in its revised version of January 29, 2020.\n\nThis report presents the itemized total compensation and benefits of  any  kind  paid  to  Directors  and  Officers  during  the  fiscal  year ended December 31, 2021, or awarded in respect of that same fiscal  year,  as  well  as  the  compensation policy for Directors and Corporate  Officers  for  their  terms  of  office,  pursuant  to  Article L. 225-37-2 I. of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThis  report  was  prepared  under  the  aegis  of  the  Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility (GCSER) Committee.\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for executive and non-executive Corporate Officers\n\nOrange  aims  to  define  and  implement  a  balanced  and  socially equitable compensation policy for its Corporate Officers.\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  executive  Corporate  Officers  is in  line  with  the  Group's  strategic  priorities,  and  especially  its financial objectives. It is not only a management tool for attracting, motivating, and retaining the talent the Company needs, but also meets the expectations of shareholders and other stakeholders, particularly in terms of transparency, performance and fulfillment of CSR commitments.\n\nAll compensation and benefits are analyzed by item, then overall, to  obtain  the  appropriate  balances  between  fixed  and  variable, individual and collective, and short- and long-term compensation.\n\nOrange ensures that the criteria governing the annual and multi-year variable components for executive Corporate Officers are aligned with the criteria for all the Company's Senior Management.\n\nThe compensation policy for Corporate Officers is set by the Board of  Directors  upon  the  recommendation  of  the  GCSERC,  while taking  into  account  applicable  laws  (particularly  L.  22-10-8  and L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code), and recommendations from the Afep-Medef Code.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe  general  principles  and  criteria  for  the  compensation  and assessment of Directors and Officers are prepared and examined by the GCSERC, which then makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for decision.\n\nThe  GCSERC  may  use  external  benchmarks  to  evaluate  the positioning  of  the  Directors'  and  Officers'  compensation. In  this  respect,  surveys  are  regularly  used  to  ensure  that compensation levels and structures are competitive in relation to a  panel  of  comparable  companies,  including  companies  based in  France and internationally that are the Group's competitors in telecommunications, as well as services companies, some of which have a State shareholder.\n\nThe GCSERC listens to the comments and requests of investors and other stakeholders and takes them into account while maintaining a consistent compensation policy, subject to constraints imposed by the confidentiality of the information published.\n\nFinally,  the  GCSERC  ensures  the  proper  alignment  of  the compensation  policies  for  the  Company's  executive  Corporate Officers  and  other  Senior  Management  in  terms  of  the  annual variable  compensation  and  award  of  performance  shares,  and more generally the balance of Orange's compensation packages with the analysis of changes in internal pay ratios.\n\nThe GCSERC generally defines the structure of the compensation of executive Corporate Officers at the end of the prior year, and at the start of the current year, sets the targets and criteria governing variable compensation packages in line with the Group's strategy, the contribution demanded of these Corporate Officers as well as the compensation of the other Directors and Officers.",

        "page_content": "In 2021, the GCSERC reviewed the compensation of Directors and Officers during five meetings. In light of St\u00e9phane Richard's term of office expiring, and the separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, starting in mid-2021 through the date of this  document, the GCSERC reviewed the compensation of the Corporate Officers, in particular the executive Corporate Officers, in six meetings, primarily due to the process of finding and choosing a  new  CEO  and  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  process was led by a special-purpose committee and the GCSERC (see Section  5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year).\n\nThe topic of the compensation of Corporate Officers was addressed during three meetings of the Board of Directors in 2021. Corporate Officers  do  not  participate  in  the  discussions  of  the  Board  of Directors about their own compensation.\n\n## Compensation structure for executive Corporate Officers (Chair and CEO, separate CEO, Delegate Chief Executive Officers),\n\nThe  compensation  structure  for  each  executive  Corporate Officer  mainly  consists  of  fixed  compensation,  annual  variable compensation,  and  multi-year  variable  compensation.  Each  of these items is more fully detailed below.\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe fixed compensation of Corporate Officers is based on:\n\n- -the importance and complexity of their responsibilities;\n- -the  experience  and  background  of  the  people  holding  the various positions;\n- -a market analysis for comparable positions.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nThe purpose of annual variable compensation is to inspire executive Corporate Officers to achieve the annual performance targets set for them by the Board of Directors, in line with the Group's strategic priorities, and in particular its financial objectives. Pursuant to the Afep-Medef Code, the potential amount of variable compensation is expressed as a percentage of the fixed compensation.\n\nThe variable compensation depends on performance levels applied to  financial  and  extra-financial  indicators,  with  both  accounting for  the  overall  performance  expected.  The  entire  variable compensation is determined on the basis of precise targets, most importantly a quantitative performance measurement, including for the non-financial indicators, made on the basis of the target chosen by the Board of Directors for the needs of the measurement.\n\n## Multi-year variable compensation\n\nOrange offers executive Corporate Officers an annual performance share plan for their multi-year variable compensation to retain talent and  further  align  their  interests  with  the  company's  success  as well as with shareholder returns, in line with market practices. The Shareholders' Meeting approves the volume and major policies of the plan. The plan will include criteria that takes into account the beneficiaries' direct contributions to the company's long-term and overall performance. Employees holding key positions within the Orange group are also eligible for the plan.\n\nIn addition to the performance conditions, the vesting of the shares is  subject to the executive Corporate Officers still being in office on the date the performance conditions assessment is completed. However, the Board may decide whether a beneficiary can keep an unvested performance share plan if said beneficiary's term of office is lost.\n\nThe use of a multi-year cash incentive plan may again be considered in  the  future  if  regulatory  changes  or  any  other  circumstances were to make it difficult or impossible for the Company to use a performance share-based plan.\n\n## Exceptional compensation\n\nSpecific circumstances may result in exceptional compensation (for instance, due to how important these circumstances are for the company, the amount of involvement required, and the difficulty), in which case the Board of Directors will provide the reason for this compensation and will explain why accomplishing the event has led to payment of exceptional compensation. The Shareholders' Meeting  will  then  vote  on  this  exceptional  compensation ('say-on-pay'). The company has not used this possibility in prior years.\n\n## Directors' fees\n\nCorporate Officers  do  not  receive  Directors'  compensation  (e.g. 'Directors'  fees')  for  the  duties  and  offices  carried  out  in  the Group's companies.\n\n## Plans related to termination of service or loss of corporate office\n\nThere is no compensation or benefit due or likely to be due because of  the  termination  or  change  of  office  of  Corporate  Officers,  nor any  commitment  to  pay  any  compensation  in  consideration  for a  non-competition  clause.  Executive  Corporate  Officers  who are  not  under  an  employment  contract  are  also  not  eligible  for unemployment insurance if they lose their office.\n\nIf  an  executive  Corporate  Officer  is  appointed  from  outside  the company, the Board of Directors reserves the right to apply such provisions in keeping with the law and in compliance with the AfepMedef Code.\n\n## Supplemental retirement plan\n\nIn  addition  to  the  compulsory  standard  and  supplementary retirement  plans,  a  supplemental  retirement  plan  in  the  form  of a  defined  benefit  plan  with  acquired  rights  (called  'new  article 39 plans') or defined contribution plans (called 'article 82 plans') may be set up for executive Corporate Officers based on a yearly contribution  amount  to  be  defined.  This  contribution  will  be considered a salary, and as a result, accounted for as a benefit in kind.\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nExecutive Corporate Officers are provided, if they so desire, with a company car and driver, consulting services providing personal legal assistance related to their duties, an annual physical, Internet or  telephone  access  and  equipment,  including  IT  equipment, necessary to perform their duties. Contributions the company pays for to set up a supplemental retirement plan would also be a benefit in kind.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThe Chairman and CEO, the CEO as well as the Delegate CEO(s) are  enrolled  in  the  Orange  group's  death  and  disability  and supplemental health insurance plans (see  Section  6.7 Statutory Auditors' Special Report on related-party agreements).\n\n## Compensation structure for non-executive Corporate Officers (separate Chairman of the Board of Directors)\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nThe  compensation  of  the  separate  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors is established by comparing the compensation levels and structures of a panel of comparable companies, and particularly the compensation levels and structures of companies where the French State is the reference shareholder.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

The Board may decide that the separate Chairman of the Board will  not  receive  compensation as a Director (see Section 5.4.2.2 Compensation policy for Directors).\n\nThe separate Chairman of the Board of Directors does not receive any other compensation (particularly variable compensation, stock options  or  performance  shares)  or  benefits  in  kind.  However, the company will provide a company car and driver, an office, a secretary,  access  to  the  Internet  or  telephone  and  equipment, including  IT  equipment,  necessary  to  perform  their  duties.

the compensation of St\u00e9phane Richard remained  unchanged  at  950,000  euros  annually,  as  did  that  of Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier at 600,000 euros annually.\n\n## Annual variable compensation\n\nIn  2021,  St\u00e9phane  Richard  received  variable  compensation  of 570,000 euros in respect of the 2020 fiscal year. Ramon Fernandez and  Gervais  Pellissier  each  received  variable  compensation  of 234,000 euros in respect of the same fiscal year. The Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 approved these components.\n\nFor 2020, St\u00e9phane Richard was entitled to variable compensation of 80% of his annual fixed compensation, subject to the achievement of targets, and up to 100% for outperformance.\n\nFor  2020,  Ramon  Fernandez  and  Gervais  Pellissier  were  each entitled to variable compensation, subject to the achievement of targets, capped at 60% of their annual fixed compensation.\n\n## Reminder of targets and results achieved for 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Corporate Officers' annual variable compensation was based on the weighted average of five indicators emphasizing the Group's growth, its profitability (Organic cash flow from telecom activities & EBITDAal), service quality, and performance on employee-rel ated issues. The expected performance levels were set by the Board of Directors, with financial indicators based on the Group's budget.\n\nFor the calculation of the achievement rate, an elasticity curve is constructed so that a rate reflecting the level of achievement can be assigned for each indicator.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

For the B2B indicator, the target was 7.6; the actual figure was 7.79.\n\nThe  elasticity  curve  applied  to  the  B2C  indicator  puts  the achievement rate of this indicator at 100% for St\u00e9phane Richard, Ramon  Fernandez  and  Gervais  Pellissier.  The  elasticity  curve applied  to  the  B2B  indicator  puts  the  achievement  rate  of  this indicator at 111.9% for St\u00e9phane Richard, and at 100% for Ramon Fernandez and Gervais Pellissier.\n\n## Performance on employee-related issues - ICPS (for 33%)\n\nThe  aim  was  to  achieve  overall  progress  in  the  indicator's  five components:\n\n- -three  relate  to  results  from  the  employee  survey  with  a weighting of 70%. The employee survey is usually conducted by  an  external  body  at  the  end  of  a  given  year  and  at  the beginning of the next year. Results are reviewed based on the employees' perceptions in connection with the three themes: skills, collective agility, commitment;\n- -two  relate  to  changes  in  HR  indicators,  with  a  weighting  of 30%: the training access rate and the percentage of women in management networks;\n\nthe result for each component is measured in the following way:\n\n- -Target not achieved: result of -1;\n- -Target achieved: result of 0;\n- -Target exceeded: result of +1.\n\nAs part of the company's renewal of its governance at the corporate body level, of which St\u00e9phane Richard has been at the helm for more than 11 years, most notably keeping the Group steady during the employee crisis, following a ruling handed down by the courts against St\u00e9phane Richard on November 24, 2021, in a case that had nothing to do with his position or duties at Orange and not relating to the Company, St\u00e9phane Richard submitted his resignation as Chairman and CEO to the Board of Directors. The employee survey, which  covers  topics  related  to  the  Chairman  and  CEO  and  this person's relationship with the company, was not conducted during the 4th quarter of 2021.\n\nThe surveys carried out in 2021 among the social body highlighted in particular that the measures put in place for several years around training and skills development, as well as social support and local management continued to play a key role and enabled the teams to cope with the context of the health crisis.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Board decided to renew the results of the previous employee survey that was completed in early 2021.\n\nHuman resources indicators are on target.\n\n| Criterion       | 2021 employee experience results   | 2021 employee experience results          | 2021 employee experience results          | Scoring                                                       |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                 | Minimum                            | Actual                                    | Maximum                                   |                                                               |\n| Employee survey | -3                                 | 3                                         | 3                                         | Delegate CEOs 70%;

Each criterion is scored +3% if the target is achieved and -3% if not.\n\nTotal Shareholder Return (TSR)\n\nThe TSR target was not met for the 2019-2021 period. Orange's TSR was -20.011%, less than the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index  TSR,  which  was  +7.486%,  which  gives  this  indicator  an achievement rate of 0%.\n\nOrganic cash flow (telecom activities), as defined by the plan\n\nThe target was achieved for 2019, 2020 and 2021. This gives a valuation of 50%.\n\n## Adjustment criteria\n\nThe combined results of the five adjustment criteria gave a total result of -3%:\n\n| Criterion                    | Weighting   | Result       | Scoring   | Targets                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CO2 per customer use         | 3.00%       | achieved     | 3.00%     | 20% decline in 2021 vs 2006                                                                                              |\n| Diversification revenue      | 3.00%       | not achieved | -3.00%    | \u20ac1.5bn                                                                                                                   |\n| Mobile and fixed data speeds | 3.00%       | achieved     | 3.00%     | Mobile speeds: 33 Mps   fixed speeds: 260 Mps                                                                            |\n| Brand power                  | 3.00%       | not achieved |           | -3.00% Increase in at least 2/3 of countries vs 2018 Be a leader in 75% of our countries  accounting for at least 66.67% |\n| NPS                          | 3.00%       | not achieved | -3.00%    | of the customer base.                                                                                                    |\n| Total adjustment             |             |              | -3%       |                                                                                                                          |\n\n## Valuation in number of shares\n\nAdding the results on the two indicators, with an adjustment of -3%, gives a result of 48.50%.\n\n| Corporate Officer   | Target   | Achievement  rate  (%)   | Shares  vested LTIP  2019-2021   |\n|---------------------|----------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| St\u00e9phane Richard    | 35,000   | 48.50%                   | 16,975                           |\n| Ramon Fernandez     | 18,000   | 48.50%                   | 8,730                            |\n| Gervais Pellissier  | 18,000   | 48.50%                   | 8,730                            |\n\n## Breakdown of benefits in kind in 2021\n\nCorporate Officers received the following benefits in kind in 2021:\n\n| Benefits in kind   | Company   car   | Health   check   | Legal   advice   | Internet/ telecom- munications   |\n|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------------------|\n| St\u00e9phane Richard   | X               |                  |                  |                                  |\n| Ramon Fernandez    |                 | X                | X                | X                                |\n| Gervais Pellissier | X               | X                | X                | X                                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

After this date, he will continue his term of office as  a  non-independent  Director  and  when  the  new  CEO  arrives will  continue  to  carry  out  the  duties  of  non-executive  Chairman until the end of his term, on May 19, 2022 - the date of Orange's Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Board of Directors took into account:\n\n- -by  what  margin  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  approved  the resolutions relating to the compensation of Corporate Officers for 2021;\n- -investor comments and requests as well as views on separating the Chairman and CEO functions;\n- -the  appointment of a new CEO, Christel Heydemann, as an external candidate and the elements of compensation she was entitled to in her previous role;\n- -the upcoming appointment of a new Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nThese factors led the Board of Directors to establish several different compensation  structures  for  Corporates  Officers  for  2022,  with stable compensation for Corporate Officers until the two executive functions are separated, then a change to take into account the arrival of the external Corporate Officers.",

This  compensation  will  only  be  paid  at  the  end  of  the  Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 (ex post 'say-on-pay').\n\n## Multi-year variable compensation\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  decided  to  implement  a  new performance  share-based  LTIP  for  2022-2024  in  line  with  the previous plans. A resolution on this bonus share allocation plan will be submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022, to authorize the Board of Directors to award bonus shares to Corporate Officers and to certain Employees holding key positions within  the  Group  (see  Section  6.5  Draft resolutions, eighteenth resolution).\n\nIf the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022 does not approve the eighteenth resolution, the Board of Directors may decide to pay sums due in respect of the LTIP 2022-2024 in cash.\n\n## Performance indicators\n\nThe Board of Directors has selected the following indicators for the new LTIP, which still has a term of three years:\n\n- -a  market  indicator,  Total  Shareholder  Return  (TSR),  based on the relative performance over three fiscal years compared with the Stoxx Europe 600 Telecommunications index, with a weighting of 30%;\n- -organic  cash  flow  (telecom  activities),  for  which  growth  is measured on a multi-year basis over the term of the plan, with a weighting of 50%;",

However, should the Orange TSR reach the target but be negative, the result would be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval,\n- -if the change in Orange TSR is below that of the index: no award;\n- -composite CSR indicator, for each CSR criterion:\n- -if the result is lower than the target defined by the Board of Directors: no award,\n- -if  the  result  is  equal  to  or  above  the  target:  100%  of  the award.\n\n## Condition of continued employment\n\nThe final vesting of the shares is subject to the beneficiary executive Corporate Officers still being in office on the date the performance conditions assessment is completed.\n\nHowever,  if  the  beneficiary  stops  performing  their  functions before the three-year LTIP period ends, the Board may decide to maintain the unvested performance share plan under the following conditions:\n\n- -If  the  beneficiary's  functions  are  terminated  due  to  death  or disability, the TSR, organic cash flow and CSR indicator targets will be considered achieved over the three-year period;\n- -If the beneficiary's functions are terminated due to the loss of his or her office:\n- -performance  conditions  will  be  assessed  by  taking into  account  changes  approved  for  each  year  until  the plan  ends,  meaning  without  changing  the  performance conditions,\n- -the award of shares will be pro-rated to his or her effective time with the Company as an executive Corporate Officer.\n\nIt is also stipulated that if the beneficiary is no longer an executive Corporate Officer  while  remaining  in  the  Group  during  the  LTIP period, he or she shall retain their right to shares awarded under the plan.\n\n## Maximum award\n\nThe CEO, Christel Heydemann, will be awarded 70,000 performance shares and the current Delegate Chief Executive Officer, Ramon Fernandez,  will  be  awarded  18,000  shares  under  the  LTIP 2022-2024. This is  the  maximum amount that can be awarded, subject to performance and presence conditions.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Richard will not be eligible for the LTIP 2022-2024 either as Chairman and CEO (until April 3, 2022) or as a non-executive Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  like  a  future  non-executive Corporate Officer.\n\n## Lock-up period\n\nWhen  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  authorizes  the  award  of performance shares, Corporate Officers must keep at least 50% of the shares they will receive as registered shares until the end of their term of office. Moreover, Corporate Officers have made the formal commitment not to use hedging instruments on these shares until the end of their term of office.\n\n## Loss of the Chairman and CEO's office\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  decided,  for  awards  that  it  had  already approved for Chairman and CEO St\u00e9phane Richard (LTIP 2020-2022 and LTIP 2021-2023), namely a maximum 35,000 Orange shares for each of these plans, that these plans will be maintained even though they are not yet vested, with the presence condition waived, without changing  the  performance  condition,  and  prorating  his  actual presence in the company as Chairman and CEO, i.e. until April 3, 2022.  As  a  result,  the  maximum  amount  awarded  to  St\u00e9phane Richard subject to performance conditions would be 26,250 shares for the LTIP 2022-2022 (considering 27 months actually serving as Chairman and CEO out of 36 months of the plan) and 14,583 shares for the LTIP 2021-2023 (considering 15 months actually serving as Chairman and CEO out of 36 months of the plan), without changing any performance conditions or vesting dates (March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively).\n\n## Annual exceptional income for the Chairman and CEO\n\nOn November 24, 2021, St\u00e9phane Richard submitted his resignation as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer to the Board of Directors. His  compensation  package  did  not  include  any  severance  pay for  loss  of  office,  nor  is  he  eligible  for  unemployment  or  similar compensation.\n\nThe  Orange  Board  of  Directors  met  on  January  28,  2022  and decided to separate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at this meeting. It also decided at this time that St\u00e9phane Richard  will  continue  his  term  of  office  as  a  non-independent Director (May 19, 2022) and when the new CEO arrives will continue to  carry  out  the  duties  of  non-executive  Chairman  until  a  new Chairman  arrives.  The  Board  also  appointed  St\u00e9phane  Richard Honorary Chairman of Orange.\n\nSt\u00e9phane  Richard's  employment  contract  with  Orange  was terminated on March 1, 2010 when he was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Orange over 11 years ago. The Board of  Directors  highlighted  his  commitment  at  the  helm  of  Orange during  sometimes tumultuous times, and always working in the company's best interests, including the appeasement following the employee crisis and successfully leading Orange's transformation into a leading multi-services operator in Europe and Africa.\n\nIn the process of finding and choosing a candidate to take over as Chief Executive Officer in order to renew the Group's governance, St\u00e9phane Richard has been committed to maintaining the Group's proper  governance  and  preparing  for  the  transition  in  the  best possible conditions. Not only did he identify potential candidates, but throughout the entire process, he followed up regularly with the  special-purpose  committee  and  the  various  stakeholders involved. He also got involved with the Company's employees and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n- 5",

In order to protect the Company's interests  and  ensure a smooth transition, and as part of regular discussions, he began supporting the new CEO as she started her  functions,  considering  his  intimate  knowledge  and  vision  of the global telecoms ecosystem and the challenges Orange faces, the  history  of  strategic  issues  he  has  worked  on  and  the  close relationships he has been able to forge throughout his 11 years with the Group's many internal and external partners.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Richard also agreed to continue his functions, both as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until the new CEO arrives on April 4, 2022 and as non-executive Chairman until his legal term of office ends, even though his corporate term of office as Chairman and CEO was initially to end on January 31, 2022.\n\nDue  to  the  work  described  above,  the  Board  decided  to grant  St\u00e9phane  Richard  exceptional  gross  compensation  of 475,000 euros.\n\nNo other exceptional compensation is being considered, particularly regarding the transition of the new CEO.\n\n## Plans related to termination of function or loss of corporate office of the CEO\n\nAs part of the process of finding and choosing a CEO candidate to renew the Group's governance, (see Section 5.2.1.8 Board and committee activities during the fiscal year),  which  led  to  hiring Christel Heydemann from outside the Company, two specialized firms-Spencer  Stuart,  a  recruitment  firm,  and  an  executive compensation firm, Mercer-assisted the special-purpose committee (consisting of the Chair of the GCSERC, Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner and  the  Lead  Director,  Bernard  Ramanantsoa)  in  reviewing  the chosen candidate's current compensation package and external benchmarks (see Section 5.4.1.1 Compensation policy for Executive and Non-Executive Corporate Officers). The Company realized that Chairman and CEO St\u00e9phane Richard's compensation package did not include any severance pay should he lose his term of office (including  income  replacement  benefits  equal  to  unemployment benefits), which does not align with market practices. This led the Board to institute severance pay, a non-compete agreement, and a specific private unemployment insurance policy for executives (Garantie Sociale des Chefs et Dirigeants d'Entreprise) for Christel Heydemann that the Company will pay for.\n\nIn accordance with Afep-Medef Code recommendations, the total amount of severance pay and non-competition compensation that would be paid may not exceed two years of compensation (annual fixed and variable).\n\n## Severance pay\n\nIf  her office is revoked or not renewed and it is not due to gross misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  Orange  will  pay  CEO  Christel Heydemann  gross  severance  pay  equal  to  12  months  of  fixed compensation  and  annual  variable  compensation  calculated\n\nbased  on  the  last  fixed  compensation  plus  the  annual  variable compensation paid, with the latter being calculated based on the average annual variable compensation paid for the last 24 months prior to leaving the Company. This compensation will only be due if performance conditions for the annual variable compensation of the past two years prior to leaving the Company were achieved at an average of at least 90%.\n\n## Non-compete agreement\n\nIn order to protect the Group's legitimate interests, and considering her duties and the strategic information Christel Heydemann has access to as CEO, she undertakes, for a period of one year starting from the day she ceases to perform CEO functions, to not work for or manage a telecommunication operator in the European Union, directly or indirectly, personally or through a third party in any way or for any purpose, on her own behalf or on behalf of a third party.\n\nThe non-compete compensation will be a gross amount equal to 12 months fixed compensation and annual variable compensation, with  the  variable  compensation  being  calculated  based  on  the average annual variable compensation paid for the last 24 months prior to leaving the Company. Subject to the Board of Directors' approval,  Orange  may  decide  to  release  the  CEO  from  this commitment at its sole discretion.\n\n## Loss of corporate office\n\nOrange will take out a specific insurance policy (Garantie Sociale des Chefs et Dirigeants d'Entreprise) for its CEO, Christel Heydemann. This policy will provide the CEO replacement income (subject to the policy's terms and conditions) if the Company ever decides to revoke the CEO's office. Orange will pay for the entire premium and it will be treated as a benefit in kind.\n\n## Supplemental retirement plan\n\nExecutive  Corporate  officers  do  not  receive  a  supplemental retirement  plan  for  their  term  of  office  beyond  the  basic  and supplementary pension plans that are compulsory by law.\n\nTo  match  what  Christel  Heydemann  received  in  previous  roles, the Board of Directors decided to set up what is called an 'article 82' supplementary defined benefit retirement plan for executive Corporate Officers. Orange will contribute an amount equivalent to 20% of the executive Corporate Officers' annual fixed and variable compensation to the plan per year and it will be treated as a benefit in kind.\n\n## Benefits in kind\n\nIn  addition  to  paying  for  the  insurance  premium  on  the  private executive  unemployment  insurance  policy  for  CEO  Christel Heydemann,  and  premiums  for  the  supplementary  retirement plan (see above), executive Corporate Officers may also receive a company car with driver, personal legal assistance related to their duties, an annual health check, Internet or telephone access and equipment,  including  IT  equipment,  necessary  to  perform  their duties, if they so desire.",

The Chairman and CEO waived his right to receive the compensation allocated to him in respect of his directorship (as has been the case since his appointment).\n\nThe  variable  share  of  this  compensation,  linked  to  attendance and  participation  in  the  work  of  the  Board  and  its  committees, represents 80.5% of the sums to be paid in respect of fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe  payment  of  the  compensation  of  non-executive  Directors will  be  made  in  the  month  following  the  Shareholders'  Meeting of May 19, 2022, subject to approval. Compensation allocated to Directors representing the French State will be paid to the State budget. In addition, the Directors elected by the employees have requested that the compensation for their terms of office be paid to their trade union.\n\n| Compensation for activity  (in euros)   | Gross

State, whose compensation is paid to the French State budget.\n\nN/A: not applicable.\n\n## 5.4.2.2 Director compensation policy\n\nIn accordance with the law, the maximum amount of compensation that can be paid annually to Directors is set by the Shareholders' Meeting. The resolution approved remains valid until a new decision is made by the Shareholders' Meeting. The Shareholders' Meeting of May 27, 2014 set this amount at 750,000 euros. The Board of Directors is asking the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022 to vote to increase this amount to 1,050,000 euros, considering the large number of Board and Committee meetings every year with high attendance rates, the amount of work and time the chairs of the three committees dedicate to their duties. Additionally, benchmarks were created based on the practices and director compensation of similar major French companies. The Board used all of the above when formulating this proposal.\n\nAt  the  beginning  of  every  year,  the  Board  of  Directors  sets  the compensation policy for Directors based on their term of office for  the  fiscal  year  within  the  amount  limit  decided  on  by  the Shareholders' Meeting, and upon a proposal by the Governance and Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Committee (GCSERC).  Then  it  is  put  to  vote  at  the  Shareholders'  Meeting ('say-on-pay' ex ante).\n\nAt its meeting on February 16, 2022, the Board of Directors set the compensation policy for Directors. It decided to use the following points as a scale for the 2022 fiscal year:\n\n- -a fixed amount of 10,000 euros per Director per year calculated prorata temporis where applicable;\n- -an amount directly related to attendance and participation in the work of the Board and its committees, namely:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5\n\n5",

Executive Committee.\n\nThe  overall  gross  amount,  excluding  employer  social  security contributions, of compensation due for the 2021 fiscal year from Orange SA and controlled companies to all members of the Orange Executive Committee is 13,112,682 euros.\n\nThis amount includes all compensation due in respect of the 2021 fiscal  year:  gross  salaries,  bonuses  (including  annual  variable compensation), granted shares, benefits in kind, profit-sharing and incentive bonuses (excluding any employer's matching contribution as regards the last two items).\n\nThe  annual  variable  portions  included  are  the  target  amounts for  2021  to  be  paid  in  2022  concerning  Executive  Committee members, but not including Directors and Officers. For Directors and Officers, the variable portion included is the part due for 2021 and to be paid in 2022.\n\nThe  employment  contracts  of  the  members  of  the  Executive Committee (excluding Corporate Officers), signed from January 1, 2015,  include  a  clause  providing  for  contractual  severance  pay not exceeding 15 months of salary based on total annual gross compensation  (including  any  termination  pay  provided  for  by contractual agreements).\n\nThe members of the Executive Committee do not receive Directors' compensation  for  their  positions  as  Directors  or  Officers  of  the Orange group's subsidiaries.\n\nThey did not receive any stock options during the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nThe Board of Directors set up share-based Long-Term Incentive Plans  (LTIP)  that  also  apply  to  Executive  Committee  members subject to the terms and conditions voted on by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe LTIP 2019-2021 allowed for 15,000 shares to be awarded to the Delegate CEOs and executive officers who are divisional heads and 10,000 shares to the other senior executives.\n\nThe thirty-first resolution submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 related to the LTIP for the 2021-2023 period, which applies to members of the Executive Committee with the same share-based compensation levels as the LTIP 2019-2021.\n\n## Stock options awarded to the top 10 employees and options exercised by them\n\nDuring the 2021 fiscal year, neither Orange SA nor any other Group company awarded any stock options to employees.\n\nThere have been no stock option plans in effect since 2017, the date the last Orange SA stock option plan matured.

It was divided into 2,660,056,599 fully paid-up shares with a par value of four euros each. The share capital has not increased over the last two fiscal years.\n\n## 6.1.2 Securities giving access to the capital\n\nUnder  the  terms  of  the  settlement  agreement  signed  in  2002 that  ended  the  partnership  with  MobilCom  to  develop  the mobile business in Germany, on March 3, 2003, Orange issued 430,705 perpetual bonds redeemable for shares (TDIRAs) with a par value of 14,100 euros, for an overall amount of 6,073 million euros,  reserved  for  members  of  the  banking  syndicate  and  for creditor equipment suppliers of MobilCom. At December 31, 2021, there were 44,880 TDIRAs outstanding with a total nominal value of 633 million euros. See Note 13.4 TDIRAs to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Potential issuance of new shares\n\nThe table below shows the number of new shares that would be issued if all securities giving access to the capital outstanding at December 31, 2021 were converted or redeemed in shares and all stock options existing on the same date were exercised, as well as the number of shares that would comprise the Company's capital following the issuance of such shares.\n\n|                                            | Corresponding  shares   |   % of the capital  (on a fully diluted  basis) |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Perpetual bonds redeemable for shares  (1) | 27,243,371              |                                            1.01 |\n| Share subscription options  (2)            | 0                       |                                            0    |\n| Subtotal                                   | 27,243,371              |                                            1.01 |\n| Capital at December 31, 2021               | 2,660,056,599           |                                           98.99 |\n| Total                                      | 2,687,299,970           |                                          100    |\n\n- (2) See Section 5.4.1.2 History of stock-option grants (table No. 8) and Note 6.3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nNote  15.7  Earnings per share to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Section 3.3) presents the weighted average number\n\nof outstanding and dilutive shares, calculated in accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per share.\n\n## 6.1.3 Authorizations to carry out capital increases\n\nThe Orange SA Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 approved various  financial  authorizations  that  delegated  to  the  Board  of Directors  the  authority  to  increase  the  capital  of  the  Company by issuing shares or other securities, with or without preferential subscription rights (public offering, contribution of securities, etc.) and  subject  to  certain  conditions  (outside  the  periods  of  public tender offers for the Company's securities, ceilings, etc.).\n\nThe Orange SA Shareholders' Meeting also delegated authority to the Board of Directors to carry out capital increases reserved for members of the Group savings plan.\n\nCurrent  delegations  granted  to  the  Board  of  Directors  by  the Shareholders' Meeting in terms of capital increases and the use made of these delegations are mentioned in Section 6.6 Report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions.\n\nThe  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  19,  2022  will  once  again  be asked  to  authorize  the  Board  of  Directors  to  carry  out  capital increases (see Section 6.6 Report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions).\n\n## 6.1.4 Treasury shares - Share Buyback program\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021 renewed the share Buyback program for 18 months within a limit of 10% of the share capital outstanding at the date of this Meeting. On February 16, 2022  the  Board  of  Directors  resolved  to  ask  the  Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022 to renew this authorization under the same conditions.\n\nA description of the program for 2022 appears in the Report of the Board of Directors on the fifteenth resolution submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting of May 19, 2022 (see Section 6.6 Report of the Board of Directors on the resolutions).\n\nIn the context of French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) decision no. 2021-01 of June 22, 2021, Orange and Rothschild Martin Maurel entered into a new liquidity contract on February 11, 2019, replacing the contract executed in May 2007. This latter agreement reduced the resources allocated to  the  liquidity  account  which,  on  the  date  of  implementation of  the  new  contract,  amounted  to  950,000  Orange  shares  and 37,913,500  euros.  At  December  31,  2021,  the  liquidity  account contained no Orange shares but 50,809,592.11 euros in cash.",

Actions mutual fund of the Group savings plan invested in Orange shares have double voting rights for their shares held in registered form for over two years (see Section 6.4.1 Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to shares).\n\nThe  French  State  and  Bpifrance  Participations  hold  in  concert 22.95% of the capital and 29.41% of voting rights at Shareholders' Meetings, taking into consideration the double voting rights.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the mutual funds of the Group savings plan invested in Orange shares represented 6.83% of the Company's capital  and  10.05%  of  voting  rights  at  Shareholders'  Meetings. The  regulations  governing  the  mutual  funds  state  that  voting rights  attached  to  securities  held  as  fund  assets  are  exercised by  the  Supervisory  Boards  of  these  funds.  In  the  absence  of an  express  reference  in  the  regulations  to  the  cases  where  the Supervisory Boards must gather the prior opinions of unit holders, the Supervisory Boards decide on the tender of securities held as fund assets to public tender or exchange offers, in accordance with Article L. 214-164 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nAs  of  the  date  of  this  document,  to  Orange's  knowledge,  no shareholder other than the French State, Bpifrance Participations and Group employees (in particular via the Orange Actions mutual fund)  held,  directly  or  indirectly,  more  than  5%  of  the  capital  or voting rights.\n\n## 6.2.1.1\n\n## Changes in the distribution of capital held by major shareholders over the last three fiscal years\n\nIn  the  last  three  fiscal  years,  the  Company has bought and sold treasury  shares  to  meet  obligations  related  to  employee  share allocation  programs.  In  December  2021,  Orange  sold  26  million existing shares to employees as part of the Together 2021 Employee Offering. To Orange's knowledge, there has been no major change in the distribution of capital and voting rights since December 31, 2021.\n\n## 6.2.1.2 Information on shareholders' agreements\n\nOn  February  23,  2016,  the  French  Financial  Markets  Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers  -  AMF)  was  notified  of  the execution, on February 18, 2016, of a new shareholders' agreement between the French Republic and Bpifrance Participations. This agreement replaces the previous shareholders' agreement signed between  the  same  parties  on  December  24,  2012,  formalizing the  existing  concert  action  between  them  with  respect  to  their shareholding in Orange.\n\nThe shareholders' agreement has been established for a period of two years (renewable), and stipulates that the parties will:\n\n- -consult  on  the  vote  of  resolutions  put  to  the  Shareholders' Meeting, with a commitment to exchange respective views and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6\n\n6",

As  of December 31, 2021, institutional investors held 63.0% of the capital (down by 1.9 points compared to 2020) and individual investors 6.6% (up by 0.6 points).\n\n## Geographical distribution of institutional investors at December 31, 2021\n\n| France                   | 25%   |\n|--------------------------|-------|\n| United Kingdom           | 12%   |\n| Other European countries | 21%   |\n| Europe Total             | 58%   |\n| North America            | 36%   |\n| Rest of the world        | 6%    |\n| Total                    | 100%  |\n\nSource:IBS survey.\n\n## 6.2.2 Direct or indirect control of Orange SA\n\nAs of the date of this document, the public sector (French State and Bpifrance Participations) has three representatives out of a total of 14 members on the Board of Directors of Orange (see Section 5.1.1 Board of Directors).\n\nOrange's main shareholder is the public sector: the French State, which, in concert with Bpifrance Participations, held 22.95% of the share capital and 29.41% of voting rights at December 31, 2021. As is the case with all Orange's shareholders, these shares carry double  voting  rights  when  held  in  registered  form  for  over  two years  (see  above  Sections  6.2.1.2  Information on shareholders' agreements and 6.2.1 Distribution of capital and voting rights). While not giving it as such the ability to exercise control over the Company, this level of holding could, based on the attendance rate at Shareholders' Meetings in the past, allow the public sector to block the adoption of resolutions requiring a qualified majority vote by the shareholders.\n\nIn light of the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, revised in January 2020, Orange has put in place Corporate Governance rules  to  ensure  the  proper  operation  of  the  Board  of  Directors and  its  specialist  committees  in  respecting  the  interests  of  all shareholders. The Board of Directors comprises 5 independent Directors including a Lead Director (See section 5.2 Operation of the management and supervisory bodies). Orange therefore feels there is no risk that the French State may exercise control in an abusive manner.\n\nNo other natural or legal persons exercise or could exercise control over Orange, be it directly or indirectly, or individually, jointly or in concert.\n\nTo  Orange's  knowledge,  there  is  no  agreement  which,  if implemented, could, at a later date, entail a change in its control.\n\n## 6.3 Dividend distribution policy\n\nFor the 2020 fiscal year, Orange distributed a dividend of 0.70 euros per share, plus 0.20 euros linked to the favorable decision of the French Conseil d'\u00c9tat concerning a long-standing tax dispute.\n\nFor  the  fiscal  year  2021,  the  Shareholders'  Meeting  of  May  19, 2022 will decide on the distribution of a dividend of 0.70 euros per share. Taking into account an interim dividend of 0.30 euros paid on  December 15, 2021, the balance of  the  dividend,  subject  to approval by the Shareholders' Meeting, will amount to 0.40 euros per share and will be paid in cash on June 9, 2022. The ex-dividend date will be June 7, 2022.\n\nWith respect to the 2022 fiscal year, the payment of a dividend of 0.70 euros per share will be proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting in 2023. An interim dividend of 0.30 euros per share will be paid in December 2022.\n\n## Past dividend payments\n\n| Fiscal year                   |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |   2017 |   2016 |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Dividend per  share (in euro) |    0.9 |    0.5 |    0.7 |   0.65 |    0.6 |",

Each share shall entitle its holder to a portion of the corporate profits and assets proportional to the amount of capital represented thereby. Furthermore, each share  shall  entitle  its  holder  to  vote  and  be  represented  in  the Shareholders' Meetings in accordance with provisions of the law and  of  the  Bylaws.  Ownership  of  one  share  implies,  ipso jure, adherence to the Bylaws and the decisions of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThere is no clause in the Bylaws providing for double or multiple voting rights for Orange shareholders. However, in accordance with legal stipulations, double voting rights are automatically granted to all  shares held in registered form by the same holder for at least two years.\n\nThe shareholders shall only be liable for losses within the limits of their contributions to the Company's capital.\n\n## Payment of dividends\n\nThe terms and conditions for the payment of the dividends approved by the Shareholders' Meeting are determined by the Shareholders' Meeting,  or  in  lieu,  by  the  Board  of  Directors.  However,  cash dividends must be paid within a maximum of nine months after the close of the fiscal year, unless extended by court order. The\n\nOrdinary Shareholders' Meeting may grant each shareholder, for all  or  part  of  the  dividends  to  be  distributed,  an  option  between payment of  the  dividends  in  cash  or  in  shares,  subject  to  legal requirements.\n\nInterim  dividends  may  be  distributed  before  the  approval  of  the financial  statements  for  the  fiscal  year  when  the  balance  sheet established during or at the end of a fiscal year and certified by a Statutory Auditor shows that the Company has made a profit since the  close  of  the  last  fiscal  year,  after  recognizing  the  necessary depreciation, amortization and provisions and after deducting prior losses, if any, and the sums to be allocated to reserves, as required by  law  or  the  Bylaws,  and  including  any  retained  earnings.  The amount of such interim dividends may not exceed the amount of the profit so defined.\n\nDividends not claimed within five years after the payment date shall be deemed to expire and revert to the French State.\n\n## Disposal and transfer of shares\n\nShares  are  freely  negotiable,  subject  to  applicable  legal  and regulatory provisions. They shall be registered in a share account and are transferred by means of a transfer order from account to account.\n\n## 6.4.2 Actions necessary to modify shareholders' rights\n\nShareholders' rights may be modified as allowed by law. Only the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting is authorized to amend any and all provisions of the Bylaws. The Meeting may not, however, increase shareholder commitments, except for properly executed transactions resulting from a share consolidation.\n\n## 6.4.3 Rules for participation in and notice of Shareholders' Meetings\n\n## Access to, participation in and voting rights at Shareholders' Meetings\n\nShareholders'  Meetings  are  composed  of  all  shareholders whose shares  are  fully  paid-up  and  for  whom  a  right  to  attend Shareholders'  Meetings  has  been  established  by  registration  of their shares in an account in the name either of the shareholder or of the intermediary holding their account, where the shareholder is  not resident in France, by midnight (Paris time) on the second business day preceding the Meeting.\n\nThe  shares  must  be  registered  within  the  time  limit  specified  in the preceding paragraph either in an account in their own name maintained  by  the  Company,  or  in  the  bearer  share  accounts maintained by the authorized intermediary.\n\nIf  it  sees  fit  to  do  so,  the  Board  of  Directors  may  distribute personalized admission cards to shareholders and require them to produce these cards at the Meeting.\n\nShareholders participating via video-conferencing or other means of telecommunication which meet legal and regulatory conditions and allow identification shall be deemed present for the calculation of  quorum  and  majority  at  Shareholders'  Meetings.  The  Board of  Directors  organizes,  in  accordance  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements,  the  participation  and  vote  of  the  Shareholders'\n\nMeeting, assuring, in particular, the effectiveness of the means of identification.\n\nAny  shareholder  may,  in  accordance  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements, vote without attending the Meeting or grant a proxy to  any other physical person or legal entity of his or her choice. Shareholders  may,  in  accordance  with  legal  and  regulatory requirements, send their vote or proxy, either by hard copy or via electronic means of telecommunication, until 3:00 pm (Paris time) the day before the Shareholders' Meeting. Transmission methods are set forth by the Board of Directors in the notice of Meeting and the notice to attend.\n\nShareholders sending in their vote within the time limit specified under this section, by means of the form provided by the Company to shareholders, are deemed present or represented at the Meeting.\n\nThe forms for sending in a vote or a proxy, as well as the certificate of attendance, can be completed in electronic format duly signed under  the  conditions  provided  for  in  the  applicable  laws  and regulations.  For  this  purpose,  the  recording  of  the  electronic signature on the certificate can be made directly on the Internet site established by the organizer of the Meeting.\n\nShareholders who are not resident in France may be represented at a Shareholders' Meeting by a registered intermediary who may participate subject to legal requirements.\n\n- 6\n\n6",

It should also be noted that the statutory reserve are already equal to the minimum required and therefore do not require any additional funds.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  decided  to  propose  a  dividend  of 0.70  euros  per  share.

It will be paid in cash.\n\nThe  balance  will  be  paid  on  June  9,  2022  to  holders  of  shares entitled  to  receive  a  dividend,  i.e.  those  holding  Orange  shares with dividend rights for fiscal year 2021 on the ex-dividend date (in France, that being two business days before the payment date, i.e. June 7, 2022).\n\nThe  interim  dividend  paid  on  December  15,  2021  amounted  to 797,327,111.40 euros and, based on the number of shares eligible to  receive  dividends  at  December 31, 2021, the total amount of the balance of the dividend amounted to 1,063,218,839.60 euros. Treasury shares are not eligible to receive dividends.\n\nAs the number of shares eligible to receive dividends may change up until the payment date, the Shareholders' Meeting grants full authority  to  the  Board  of  Directors  to  determine  the  final  total amount of the dividend, the balance of the distributable income and,  consequently,  the  amount  to  be  entered  under  'retained earnings.'.\n\nPursuant to Article 117 quater of the French General Tax Code, natural persons domiciled in France for tax purposes are subject to a flat-rate levy on dividends received (currently 12.8%), plus the contributions provided for in Article L. 136-7 of the French Social Security  Code  (currently  17.2%).  However,  as  an  express  and irrevocable option, such individuals may request that the dividend be included in their overall income under the conditions provided for in paragraph 2 of Article 200 A of the French General Tax Code in order to benefit from the 40% tax allowance pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 158 of the French General Tax Code.\n\nThe table below summarizes the amount of dividends paid with respect to the last three fiscal years, which were fully eligible for the tax allowance provided for in Article 158-3-2 of the French General Tax Code:\n\n|   Fiscal Year | Number of shares   | Dividend per share   | Share of dividend eligible   for the 40% tax allowance   |\n|---------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n|          2018 | 2,652,992,864      | \u20ac0.70                | 100%                                                     |\n|          2019 | 2,658,562,160      | \u20ac0.50                | 100%                                                     |\n|          2020 | 2,659,279,906      | \u20ac0.90                | 100%                                                     |\n\n## Fourth resolution\n\n## Agreements provided for in Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial Code\n\nThe fourth resolution proposes to the Shareholders' Meeting, after having  reviewed  the  Statutory  Auditors'  Special  Report  on  the regulated agreements described in Articles L. 225-38 et. seq. of the French Commercial Code, to approve a new agreement entered into by your Company.\n\nIn the plan to create Orange Concessions to support the growth of  Orange  in  fiber  in  rural  areas  and  enhance  the  value  of  its infrastructures, the Board of Directors of Orange SA authorized, at its meeting of January 22, 2021, the finalization of an exclusive agreement between the consortium comprising the Banque des\n\nTerritoires (Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations), CNP Assurances and EDF Invest, on one side, and the company Orange SA and its subsidiary Orange Participations, on the other. The term of this exclusive agreement enabled the disposal in November 2021 of 50% of the share capital and voting rights of Orange Concessions to the consortium.\n\nThe  details  of  this  regulated  agreement  can  be  found  in  the Statutory Auditor's Special Report.\n\nIn this respect, the French State will not join in voting on the fourth resolution  proposed  to  the  Shareholders'  Meeting,  pursuant  to Article L. 225-40 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nLastly,  previously  authorized  agreements  that  were  still  in  effect during  the  last  fiscal  year  are  also  dealt  with  in  the  Statutory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6\n\n6",

In  particular, he ensured that, in accordance with the law, the gender balance on  the  Board  (excluding  directors  elected  by  employees  and director  representing  employee  shareholders)  was  respected and that this person had solid experience in the management of large groups, was capable of forming an operational tandem with Christel  Heydemann,  and  had  a  real  strategic  vision  for  Orange that would enable it to unite the various shareholders on common long-term objectives. Finally, the proposed candidate must have a good knowledge of the digital sector or of companies with a state shareholding.\n\nThis screening process led to the GCSERC's recommendation at the meeting of March 24, 2022, approved by the Board of Directors' Meeting of March 30, 2022. This process has led to the proposal, at the next Shareholder's Meeting, of Mr. Jacques Aschenbroich as a candidate.\n\nThis appointment shall be made under the conditions set out in Article  13  of  the  Bylaws  for  a  period  of  four  years,  set  to  expire at the end of the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025. This new director would then be proposed to the Board of Directors to become the non-executive chairperson of the Group.\n\nJacques Aschenbroich born in 1954, is Chairman of the Board of Directors of Valeo since the 26th January 2022. He was Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Group from March 20, 2009 until February 18, 2016, then Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until January 26, 2022Before joining Valeo, he held several positions in  the  French  administration  and  served  in  the  Prime  Minister's office in 1987 and 1988.

The previous budget had been granted by the Shareholders' Meeting of May 27, 2014 and was unchanged since that date. This proposal takes account of the recurrence of the number of Board meetings and the role played by the chairpersons of the three committees (to find out more about Board and committee activities during the fiscal year, please refer to  Section  5.2  Operation of the Management and Supervisory Bodies of the Company's Universal Registration Document for the  2021  fiscal  year).

On the basis of this new budget, the attendance compensation may be granted to directors in office as of fiscal year 2022, according to the allocation decided by the Board of Directors.

The maximum amount proposed of 1,050,000 euros for the current fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year is in the lower range observed for CAC 40 companies, particularly when considering the number of directors.\n\n## Eighth to eleventh resolutions\n\nApproval of the information mentioned in I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code relating to the compensation of Directors and Officers presented in the Report on Corporate Governance approved by the Board of Directors, as presented in the Universal Registration Document\n\nPursuant to I of Article L. 22-10-34 of the French Commercial Code, shareholders  are  asked  to  vote  on  certain  information  included in  the  Report on Corporate Governance approved by the Board of Directors' Meeting of February 16, 2022 and mentioned in I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.

The maximum amount of funds allocated to the share Buyback program is therefore set at 6,384,135,837.60 euros.\n\nThis authorization will be valid for a period of 18 months from the date of the Shareholders' Meeting and may be implemented at any time except in the event of a public tender offer for the Company's shares.\n\nThe  purpose  of  the  Buyback  program  would  be  to  (i)  enable  the Company to fulfill obligations related to securities giving access to the capital or to stock option programs or any other type of share allocation to employees (in particular, free share awards or employee shareholding  plans),  (ii)  ensure  the  liquidity  of  Orange  shares pursuant to a liquidity contract with an investment services provider in compliance with French Financial Markets Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s financiers - AMF) decision no. 2021-01 of June 22, 2021,\n\n(iii)  retain  shares  to  deliver  in  exchange  or  in  payment  for  external growth transactions, and (iv) reduce the Company's capital.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  have  full  powers  to  implement  this delegation and set the terms.\n\nThe adoption of this resolution would terminate the authorization to  buy  back  shares  granted  by  the  Combined  Ordinary  and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May 18, 2021.\n\nThis authorization was used to purchase and sell treasury shares to  honor  obligations  related  to  the  share  allocation  programs to  employees  and  in  the  context  of  the  liquidity  contract  with the  independent  investment  service  provider  (ISP)  (Rothschild). This contract was revised in February 2019 further to changes in regulation regarding liquidity contracts. In December 2021, Orange transferred to employees existing shares for the requirements of the Together 2021 Employee Offering (see Section 6.1.4 Treasury shares - Share Buyback program).\n\nThe Board of Directors will inform you, in its Annual Report, of share purchases, transfers or cancellations and, as the case may be, of the allocation of shares acquired for the various objectives pursued.\n\n## Presentation of resolutions within the competence of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting\n\n## Sixteenth resolution\n\n## Amendment of the Bylaws: amendment of Articles 2, 13, 15 and 16 of the Bylaws\n\nFor  reasons  of  consistency  or  updates  in  accordance  with  the applicable legislation or regulations, this resolution proposes:\n\n- -the  amendment of  Article  2  of  the  French  language  Bylaws (Corporate Scope and Purpose) for the purpose of updating the reference to the French Postal & Electronic Communication Code (formerly the Postal & Communication Code);\n- -the amendment of Article 13.7 of the French language Bylaws (Board  of  Directors)  in  order  to  change  the  term  jetons de pr\u00e9sence  (Director's  fees)  to  r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration  de  pr\u00e9sence (attendance compensation);\n- -the amendment of Article 15.1 of the French language Bylaws (Board deliberations) regarding procedures for convening the members of the Board of Directors by email;\n- -the  addition  of  point  5  (decisions  of  the  Board  of  Directors through written consultation) to Article 15 of the Bylaws (Board deliberation)  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  Article L. 225-37 of the French Commercial Code; and\n- -the amendment of Article 16 of the Bylaws (Powers of the Board of Directors) in accordance with Article L. 225-35 paragraph 1 of the French Commercial Code (formal reference in the powers of the Board of Directors to the taking 'into consideration the social and environmental issues of its activity').\n\n## Seventeenth resolution\n\n## Amendment to the Bylaws regarding the age limit for the Chairperson of the Board of Directors\n\nIn the absence of explicit provision of the Bylaws, the age limit for the performance of the office of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors is 65 years (article L. 225-48 of the French Commercial Code). The age limit for the Chairperson of the Board of Directors of your Company is set by the terms of paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the Bylaws which states that this age limit is 70 years and that the Chairperson shall be considered to have resigned from office on the anniversary date if this age limit is reached during their term of office.\n\nYou are asked to amend the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 14 of the Bylaws of your Company to allow a Chairperson of the Board of Directors who reaches the age of 70 while in office to continue until the end of their term. In a context where the Chairperson does not exercise operational functions, these new provisions would avoid depriving the Company of high caliber candidates as a result of extending the exercise of operational professional duties.\n\n## Eighteenth resolution\n\nAuthorization granted to the Board of Directors to allocate free shares of the Company to Corporate Officers and certain Orange group employees and involving the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights\n\nShareholders  are  once  again  asked  this  year  to  authorize  the allocation of free Orange shares in the form of performance shares to Corporate Officers and certain employees of the Company or companies or groups affiliated with the Company (subsidiaries and shareholdings).  This  scheme  is  intended  to  offer  Orange  group Senior  Management  comparable  schemes  to  those  offered  to managers holding comparable positions in other major groups.\n\nAwards  of  this  nature  would  fall  within  the  framework  of  the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) established for Corporate Officers of the Company and members of the Executive Committee who are not Corporate Officers of the Company for the 2022-2024 period. This LTIP extends to employees designated as 'Executives' and 'Leaders' under the same terms (excluding the number of shares) and conditions. These terms and conditions are described in the Report on remuneration and benefits of corporate officers drawn up by your Board (see Section 5.4.1.3 Structure of the compensation of corporate officers for 2022).\n\nThe  characteristics  of  this  allocation  have  been  reviewed and  approved  by  your  Board  on  the  basis  of  the  GCSERC's recommendations:\n\n- -the number of shares allocated is limited to 0.07% of the share capital including the shares awarded to Corporate Officers of the Company, it being stated that the total number of these latter shares shall be limited to 100,000;\n- -they will either be existing shares or newly issued shares;\n- -the duration of the authorization is limited to 12 months. The Board of Directors' aim is to award the free shares soon after",

        "page_content": "the Shareholders' Meeting in order to allow an assessment of the performance conditions over the 2022-2024 period.\n\nThis  authorization  is  accompanied  by  performance  conditions, similar to those presented last year to the Shareholders' Meeting for approval, related to:\n\n- -the amount of organic cash flow (for 50% of the final entitlement);\n- -the relative change in the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) (for 30% of the final entitlement); and\n- -CSR criteria  (for  20%  of  the  final  entitlement),  half  of  which relates to CO2 emission reductions compared to 2015 (reduction targeted for this indicator) and the other half to the increase in the proportion of women in the Group's management networks (increase targeted for this indicator) (see below).\n\nThe achievement of the organic cash flow target will be assessed on a multi-year basis over the entire 2022-2024 period. Its achievement will  be  measured  in  relation  to  the  organic  cash  flow  target established for that period as part of the Engage 2025 strategic plan. This criterion will be verified by applying a graduated system where achieving or exceeding this organic cash flow target over the period will result in 100% of the final entitlement for this criterion.\n\nThe  relative  change  in  the  Orange  Total  Shareholder  Return (TSR)  will  be  assessed  in  comparison  with  the  change  in  the telecommunication sector's TSR. Change in the Orange TSR will be calculated by comparing the average Orange Share price between September 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 (i.e. 9.47 euros) with the average Orange Share price between September 1, 2024 and December 31, 2024. The change in the telecommunication sector's TSR will be calculated according to the same methodology using the  Stoxx  Europe  600  Telecommunications  index  or  any  other index replacing it as a benchmark. This criterion will then be verified according to the 'hit or miss' principle.\n\nThe CO2 emission reduction criterion (Scopes 1 & 2) compared to 2015, as established under the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) Protocol covering greenhouse gases within the Kyoto Protocol, is measured at  Group  level.  It  allows  the  Group's  progress  to  be  measured against  the  commitment  made  in  its  strategic  plan  to  reduce its CO2 emissions by 30% compared to 2015 (Scopes 1 & 2). This commitment is set out on an annual basis in the environmental roadmaps  developed  by  the  CSR,  Diversity,  Partnerships  and Solidarity Department with each Group entity, which are themselves an integral part of the budget process and the Company's strategic plan. This criterion will then be assessed according to the 'hit or miss' principle.\n\nThe  calculation  is  based  on  the  aggregation  of  the  energy consumption of each country in the Group's scope of consolidation, which  is  then  translated  into  CO2  emissions,  to  which  the  IEA (International  Energy  Agency)  conversion  factors  are  applied  for electricity  consumption and those of the GHG Protocol for fuels (gas, fuel oil, coal, gasoline, diesel and LPG). Energy consumption from renewable sources (produced by Orange or from consumption contracts with a guarantee of origin certificate from their suppliers) is subtracted from this calculation. The level of emissions used as a reference for 2015 is 1,451,012 metric tons of CO2.\n\nThe criterion of increasing the proportion of women in the Group's management networks will be established using  the  proportion of  women who occupy given key positions and who are part of the  'Leaders'  and  'Executives'  management  networks.  An\n\nannual target is set, with the target for 2025, in accordance with the  Engage  2025  strategic  plan  and  the  global  agreement  on gender equality in the workplace signed on July 17, 2019 with the UNI  global  union  (international  trade  union  federation),  being  a proportion of 35% women, in line with the proportion of women in the Group's workforce, which stood at 35.9% at the end of 2021. This  criterion  reflects  Orange's  strong  intention  to  manage  and prioritize this change. It necessitates specific efforts by the Group in terms of support and training, including technical training, for the Company's female employees, both in France and abroad, and confirms the positioning of diversity and gender balance as levers for value creation.\n\nThe  vesting  of  shares  (delivery  of  these  shares  to  beneficiaries) cannot occur before the vesting date, set at March 31, 2025, and under any circumstance may not be less than two years, with no mandatory minimum holding period for shareholders. However, the Company's Corporate Officers beneficiaries must hold at least 50% of the shares they receive until the end of their office.\n\n## Nineteenth resolution\n\nDelegation of authority to the Board of Directors to issue shares or complex securities reserved for members of savings plans and involving the waiver of shareholders' preferential subscription rights\n\nThe purpose of this resolution is to permit the issue of shares or securities giving access to shares of the Company, to be subscribed in  cash,  in  favor  of  members of the Orange group savings plan. Where applicable, under such issuance, shares or securities giving access to shares of the Company could be allocated free of charge, to replace all or part of the discount provided for hereinafter and/or the employer's contributions.\n\nThe nominal amount of an immediate or future capital increase of the Company, resulting from all issuances carried out pursuant to this delegation, would be set at 200 million euros, without taking into  account  the  nominal  value  of  the  shares  to  be  issued,  to preserve, in accordance with the law, the rights of the holders of the securities giving access to the shares.\n\nThe subscription price of the new shares would be equal to the average quoted share price during the 20 trading days preceding the  day  of  the  decision  establishing  the  opening  date  of  the subscription, reduced by the maximum discount provided for by law on the day the Board of Directors makes its decision, it being specified that the Board of Directors could reduce this discount if  it  deems  appropriate,  particularly  in  the  event  of  a  securities offering on the international and/or foreign market in order to meet in particular the requirements of applicable local rights.\n\nShareholders' preferential subscription rights to shares thus issued would be waived in favor  of  the  members  of  the  Orange  group savings plan.\n\nThe term of this delegation would be 18 months.\n\nAt  December  31,  2021,  Group  employees  held,  via  the  mutual funds of the Group savings plan, 6.83% of the capital and 10.05% of the voting rights. At December 31, 2021, some employees also held  Orange  shares  in  registered  form  resulting  from  previous transactions  (free  share  award  plan),  representing  0.55%  of  the capital and 0.76% of voting rights.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 6\n\n6",

The transition from data on a historical basis to data on a comparable basis consists of keeping the results for the fiscal year ended and restating the previous fiscal year in order to present financial data with comparable methods, scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods. The method used applies  the  data  of  the  corresponding  period  of  the  preceding fiscal  year,  the  methods  and  the  scope  of  consolidation  for  the period  ended,  as  well  as  the  average  exchange  rates  used  for the Consolidated income statement in the consolidated financial statements  for  the  period  ended.  Changes  on  a  comparable basis enable organic business changes to be reflected. Data on a comparable basis is not a financial indicator defined by IFRS and may not be comparable to similarly titled indicators used by other groups (see Section 3.1.5 Financial indicators not defined by IFRS).\n\nData on a historical basis : data for past periods as reported in the consolidated financial statements of the current financial period.\n\nEBITDAaL or 'EBITDA after Leases' : operating income (i) before depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, effects resulting from business combinations, reclassification  of  cumulative  translation adjustment from liquidated entities, impairment of goodwill and fixed assets, share of profits (losses) of associates and joint ventures, (ii) after interest on lease liabilities and interest on debts related to financed assets, and (iii) adjusted for significant litigation, specific labor expenses, review of fixed assets, investments and businesses portfolio  review,  restructuring  programs  costs,  acquisition  and integration costs and, where appropriate, other specific items that are systematically specified in relation to income and/or expenses (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements).

Furthermore, financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges included in net financial debt are set up to hedge items that are not included therein, such as future cash flows. As a consequence, the portion of these components related to unmatured hedging instruments recorded in other comprehensive income is added to gross financial debt to offset this temporary difference (see Note 13.3 to the consolidated financial statements).
