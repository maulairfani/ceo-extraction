        "page_content": "## Editorial\n\nI n 2021, Amundi continued on a trajectory of profitable growth that continues to benefit from strategic initiatives the company has brought to fruition over the past years. Newly signed partnerships and newly launched subsidiaries - notably in China, alongside Bank of China as well as acquisitions like that of Sabadell Asset Management in Spain, have increased the geographical diversity of Amundi's activities. Further examples of the Group's ability to combine organic and external growth can be found in the successful launch of Amundi Technology, a new business line positioned on a high potential market, and in the integration of Lyxor, which catapults Amundi's passive management platform into first place among European ETF providers.\n\nThis dynamic growth goes hand in hand with sustaining a high level of operational efficiency, reflected in a cost/income ratio of 48%. As a result, Amundi's net income rose considerably (+37%). Together with demonstrated financial strength, these results have prompted the Board of Directors to propose dividend of 4.10 euros per share to the Annual General Meeting. This represents a 41% increase compared to 2020 and remains, as always, in line with the policy announced when Amundi went public, namely 65% of net income.\n\nAmundi has diligently shouldered its societal commitments. The targets of our 2018-2021 ESG plan have been fully met. 100% of open-ended funds (1) managed by Amundi now boast an ESG score better than that of their reference universe. Shareholder engagement has been generalised, and we systematically take into account companies' contributions to environmental and societal challenges in our exchanges with management\n\n'Amundi will continue along a path fully aligned with the project of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, enhancing its trajectory in the years ahead.'\n\n## Yves Perrier\n\nChair of the Board of Directors of Amundi\n\nI\n\nand the exercise of voting rights. Amundi has thus\n\nestablished its leadership in this area. Fully aligned with the societal commitments of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group in support of environmental transition and social cohesion, Amundi will continue along this path, further enhancing its trajectory in the years ahead.\n\nThe economic environment for 2022 is likely to prove highly uncertain due to fallout from the conflict in Ukraine. Nonetheless, Amundi holds all the cards necessary to continue along the path of profitable growth that the company has featured since it was created, now helmed by Val\u00e9rie Baudson, who succeeded me as CEO on 10 May 2021. I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate my confidence in her leadership.\n\n(1) Where it is technically possible to apply an ESG methodology.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, Amundi\n\npassed the milestone of 2 trillion euros in assets under management. Above and beyond the acquisition of Lyxor, Amundi demonstrated strong momentum, in particular due to a strong commitment to a more responsible finance. This is an area where the company is today showing true leadership. Amundi's adjusted net income (2) increased by +37% versus 2020, meaning we have more than achieved the targets of our medium-long term strategic plan for 2018-2022.\n\nTo continue on the path of profitable growth, Amundi has set itself ambitious new goals. The first of these is already part of the firm's DNA: to continue and amplify its commitment to a fair environmental transition. The '2025 Ambition' plan aims to increase our ESG involvement in multiple ways, from the savings and investment solutions we offer our clients and the engagement we undertake with companies to our own internal commitments. This plan rests on a conviction as well: that increasing involvement in ESG will be Amundi's number one lever for growth in the coming years, in every geography.\n\n'Increasing commitments across environmental, social and governance issues will be Amundi's number one lever for growth in every geography.'\n\n## Val\u00e9rie Baudson\n\nChief Executive O/fficer of Amundi\n\nAmundi furthermore aims to continue its international expansion. In Europe, for one. But also in Asia, our second-largest domestic market, and one with tremendous potential for growth.\n\nLastly, in order to continue responding effectively to the changing needs of global investors and, more broadly, to serve all the players that make up its ecosystem, Amundi intends to strengthen its traditional business lines while adding new areas of expertise.\n\nIn its asset management business, Amundi has established two priorities. The acquisition of Lyxor will allow the Group to further ramp up growth on the fast-rising ETF segment. The other high-potential area where Amundi will be strengthening its capabilities is real assets.\n\nThe new business line Amundi Technology took off in 2021. This successful development provides a strong foundation for its ambition to become the technology partner of choice for its clients.\n\nIn an environment where uncertainty now abounds due to the war in Ukraine, Amundi's many advantages see the Group ready to show its resilience and sustain its momentum of sustainable growth, thanks to a business model that is diversified in every respect: clientele, expertise and geography.\n\n(2) Adjusted data: excluding amortisation of distribution agreements and, in 2021, excluding costs associated with the integration of Lyxor and excluding the impact of A/ffrancamento.\n\nI",

In Asia, the joint ventures continued to grow. Our results are very good, in a buoyant environment, which explains in particular the exceptional level of performance fees.\n\n## From a strategic perspective, what were the highlights of the year?\n\n2021 was marked by a number of major achievements and strategic initiatives: development of activities in Asia and a good start for the joint venture with Bank of China, exceeding the ESG objectives of the 20182021 plan and announcing new objectives for 2025, ramping up of Amundi Technology and finalisation of the Lyxor acquisition.",

This strategic positioning,  which  has  not  changed  since  Amundi  was created,  is  part  of  an  asset  management  industry  that  has undergone some profound changes.\n\n## 1.1.1 A unique positioning as a European leader with a global focus\n\nSince its creation at the beginning of 2010, Amundi has been able to combine growth and profitability, becoming the European leader in asset management with a global presence. Between 2009 and 2021, Amundi's assets under management have trebled, primarily through organic growth. Acquisitions, particularly those of Pioneer in 2017 and Lyxor at the end of 2021, have helped to accelerate this growth trajectory.\n\n## Development of Amundi's assets under management (3) from 2010 to 2021\n\nA CAGR (4) of +9.8%\n\nThis  growth  was  accompanied by the successful transformation of Amundi from a captive asset manager into a global player, with particularly strong growth outside France (notably in Asia and Europe), and outside of the Group networks (5) , particularly with third-party distributors and institutional clients .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI",

As  a  result  of  this  value-creating transaction,  Amundi  has  become  the  European  leader  in ETFs, with a combined  market  share  of  14% (1) , and complements its active management offering , particularly in the area of liquid alternative assets, as well as in consultancy and OCIO (2) .\n\nLyxor's performance in 2021 was solid, with \u20ac12.1 billion of inflows ,  taking  assets  to  \u20ac148  billion  at  the  end  of  2021, including  \u20ac101  billion  in  ETFs  and  \u20ac46  billion  under  active management  (including  \u20ac25  billion  under  liquid  alternative management).  Net  income  for  the  financial  year  was \u20ac42  million (3) , significantly  higher  than  the  net  income forecast when the transaction was announced in April 2021. See  section  6  of  Chapter  4  of  this  Universal  Registration Document.\n\nIn an index-based management market where size is of vital importance,  the  new  combined  amount  of  assets  managed by  Amundi's  passive  platform  (\u20ac310  billion  at  the  end  of 2021)  is  a  major  advantage.  Building  on  these  foundations and given its growth prospects in the passive management market, Amundi  announced  that  it  was  aiming  to  achieve significant  growth  (+50%)  of  its  assets  under  passive management,  with  a  target  of  \u20ac420  billion  by  the  end  of 2025 (4) .\n\nThe  beginning  of  January  2022  saw  the  launch  of  the integration phase (combination of team). Its implementation (IT migration, legal mergers, etc.) is expected be completed quickly, during the second and third quarters of 2022.\n\nThe  synergies  generated  by  this  integration  will  be  in  line with those announced in April 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 full-year  pre-tax  cost  synergies  are  expected  to  be \u20ac60 million from 2024;\n- \u00b7 full-year pre-tax revenue synergies are expected to reach \u20ac30 million in 2025.\n\nGiven  the  high  potential  for  synergies,  this  transaction  will create significant value:\n\n- \u00b7 an  acquisition  price  representing  a  P/E  2021e  multiple  of ~9x (5) (with cost synergies alone);\n- \u00b7 a Return on Investment of more than 10% over three years (with cost synergies alone).\n\n## 1.1.3 Organised around two client segments\n\nAmundi  focuses  on  two  client  segments:  retail  and institutional.\n\n- \u00b7 The retail  segment  includes  the  distribution  of  savings solutions for private clients of partner networks in France and  abroad  and third-party  distributors. Joint  Ventures rely on strong banking networks (particularly in China and India) to distribute local products that are managed locally.\n- \u00b7 The institutional segment includes direct sales to institutional  investors (sovereign  funds  and  central  banks, insurers, pension funds, etc.) and businesses (cash management, employee savings and retirement plans), as well as the management of mandates on behalf of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Group insurers in connection  with  their  general  life  insurance  funds  (eurodenominated contracts), and non-life insurance assets.\n\nI\n\nEach  client  segment  has  its  own  sales,  marketing  and customer  service  teams  which  are  often  located  in  close proximity  thanks  to  Amundi's  presence  in  more  than 35  countries. These  teams  are  tasked  with  designing products  and  services  that  address  the  specific  needs  of clients. They accomplish this with the support of management  platforms,  back-office  and  risk  management functions and an integrated IT infrastructure.\n\nThis type of organisation facilitates client access to Amundi's international  expertise,  a  high  level  of  customisation  in  the products offered, and economies of scale.",

Given  its origins, it has developed a unique partnership approach with distribution networks (particularly banking networks), thereby  positioning  the  Group  internationally  as  the  key player  in  this  segment. Most  notably,  Amundi's  value proposition  is  based  on  a  range  of  products,  services  and tools adapted to each partner distribution network. Locallybased  (local  networks)  or  centralised  (for  cross-border flagship funds) teams exclusively serve partner networks and third party distributors to provide the best response to their specific  needs,  including  the  deployment  of  innovative  and customised  digital  tools  to  adapt  to  changes  in  the distribution environment.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi  is  the  market  leader  in  France (1) thanks  to  the quasi-exclusivity  partnership  it  has  with  the  Group's networks  (Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole,  LCL)  and  its  partnership  with the  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  Group,  which  was  renewed  for  a further  five  years  in  November  2020.  The  terms  of  this partnership are that Amundi will remain the main supplier of  savings  products  and  solutions  for  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's networks.\n- \u00b7 Outside  France, at  the  time  of  the  Pioneer  acquisition  in 2017, Amundi entered into a 10-year distribution agreement with the UniCredit networks in Italy, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. Amundi also remains the preferred  supplier  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale networks in Italy (CA Italie), the Czech Republic (Komer\u010dni Banka) and Poland (CA Polska). Amundi is also in partnership with BAWAG P.S.K. in Austria and Resona in Japan. In July 2020, Amundi embarked on a new long-term (10-year)  strategic  partnership  in  Spain  with  Banco Sabadell,  alongside  the  acquisition  of  Sabadell  AM.  In China,  Amundi  created  a  joint  subsidiary  with  Bank  of China Wealth Management.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

The Amundi model relies on  dedicated  sales  teams  from  nearly  200  vendors  in 27 countries. In 2021, these distributors accounted for more than half of Amundi's Retail assets (excluding JVs), including Lyxor.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi has expanded these partnerships by enhancing its solutions,  services  and  consultancy  services  offering  to meet the increasing needs of these third-party distributors which seek value-added solutions, while operating in open architecture.  In  a  rapidly  changing  market  with  all-new demands,  Amundi  is  ideally  positioned  thanks  to  its expertise in supporting distribution networks.\n\n## Successful launch of the new subsidiary in China with Bank of China\n\nWith  the  creation  at  the  end  of  2020  of  the new  joint venture  subsidiary  with  BOC  Wealth  Management, a subsidiary of Bank of China (China's fourth largest bank (4) ) , Amundi is in a unique position in China, allowing it to cover the  main  segments  of  the  Chinese  asset  management market, thanks to partnerships with two major banks: ABC (over 400 million Retail clients and 23,000 branches) and BOC (300 million Retail clients and 11,000 branches).\n\nThis subsidiary, of which Amundi holds 55%, was the first majority foreign-capital company in China to offer Wealth Management products. It had a very strong first year, with inflows  of  \u20ac10.1  billion  in  2021  from  the  Bank  of  China networks.\n\nI\n\n- \u00b7 In  order  to  better  respond  to  the  expectations  of  thirdparty  distributors,  a  new  Wealth  &  Distribution  business unit  was  created  in  2020  to  bring  together  products  and services  tailored  to  the  needs  of  these  stakeholders. Furthermore, a subadvisory platform (Fund Channel Investment  Partners) was  launched  at  the  end  of  2021  to meet the needs for the selection and construction of openended investment solutions.\n\n## Joint Ventures\n\nIn addition, Amundi  has  joint ventures, which are predominantly Asian, operating in India with SBI (State Bank of India, the largest bank in the country (1) ), in China with ABC (Agricultural Bank of China, the third largest Chinese bank (2) ), in  South  Korea  (with  Nonghyup  Bank,  one  of  the  top  five banking groups in the country (3) )  and  in  Morocco  (with  the Wafa banking group).\n\n## Developments in Asia, a driver of growth\n\nIn  Asia,  a  rapidly  developing  region  that  is  becoming increasingly  significant  in  the  global  asset  management market, Amundi has, for many years, held solid positions in all  the  region's  major  markets  (\u20ac369  billion  in  total assets (5) for  Amundi,  up  24%  compared  to  the  end  of 2020), focusing on high-growth countries: India (assets of \u20ac189 billion for Amundi) and China (assets of \u20ac98 billion (6) for Amundi).\n\nThe  development  strategy  has  been  pragmatic,  with  a two-pronged approach combining joint venture partnerships  with  large,  market-leading  retail  banks  and wholly-owned  subsidiaries.  This  ambitious  policy  in  Asia has paid off: Amundi's assets have multiplied nearly ninefold  in  11  years  and  represented  18%  of  its  total  assets  at the end of 2021 including Lyxor.\n\nFor the record, the planned SBI FM stock exchange listing was announced on 12 December 2021. This listing will take place  on  the  Indian  stock  exchange (7) and  is  expected  to make  up  10%  of  SBI  FM's  share  capital.  As  part  of  this listing,  Amundi  intends  to  sell  approximately  4%  of  the share capital. SBI FM maintained its leading position in the Indian market with a market share of 16.4% at the end of 2021, compared to 15.4% at the end of 2020 (8) .",

These services represent a significant market, valued at more than  \u20ac1.5  billion (1) worldwide  with  annual  growth  of  more than  10%,  which  benefits  from  the  trend  among  financial service players to refocus on their core business.\n\nOffered  in  all  countries  in  which  Amundi  operates,  these technology solutions are available in Cloud mode and cover portfolio  management,  with  ALTO (2) Investment , wealth advisory,  mandate  management  with  ALTO Wealth  & Distribution and Employee Savings and insurance with ALTO ESR;  this  ALTO  range  was  expanded  in  2021  with  the addition  of  two  offerings  (ALTO Sutainability and  ALTO Asset Servicing ). All of these offerings are intended for asset managers,  retail  banks  and  private  banks,  as  well  as institutional  clients  and  'asset  servicers'.  They  can  be supplemented, as with other offerings, by modular services, such  as  market  data  management,  order  execution  and middle office services.\n\nThe ALTO offering, which is based on modern technologies ( cloud , open  source , artificial  intelligence  in  particular),\n\nprovides  savings  providers  with  effective  and  low-cost solutions,  enabling  them  to  increase  their  digitalisation  and meet all regulatory requirements in an integrated manner.\n\nThe  ALTO  range  benefits  from  the  expertise  and  skills  of Amundi  Technology:  800  R&D  and  project  management engineers  and  a  dedicated  sales  force  that  is  mostly concentrated  in  two  hubs  (Dublin  and  Paris)  but  includes teams in 19 countries.\n\nIn  2021,  Amundi  Technology  continued  its  internationalisation (ALTO is marketed in nine countries on three continents) and continued its ramp-up (39 clients at the end of 2021, including 15 new clients).\n\nALTO's success was further illustrated in 2021 when Bank of New York Mellon chose the ALTO Asset Servicing offering to ensure  the  global  management  of  its  'depositary  control' activity. Bank of New York Mellon is the third customer in two years, after CACEIS and SGSS.\n\nIn  2021,  Amundi  Technology's  revenue  totalled  \u20ac36  million, representing  strong  growth  in  line  with  the  target  of \u20ac150 million announced in 2025.\n\n## 1.1.5 Amundi, a responsible investor and company\n\nAs a pioneer in the field of responsible investment, since its creation in 2010, Amundi has adhered to a policy that aims to incorporate Environmental, Social and good Governance (ESG)  criteria into its investment  processes, beyond traditional financial analysis. Amundi  is  committed  to supporting  sustainable  transitions  through  an  ambitious shareholder  engagement  policy  and  responsible  investment strategies.\n\nAmundi's  responsibility  is  also  to  apply  the  principles  of sustainable development to its own operations.\n\nIn  2018,  an  ambitious  plan  was  announced  to  boost  this programme (3) .  Amundi has delivered on its commitments in two key areas:\n\n## Savings and investment solutions (4)\n\n- \u00b7 ESG criteria have been integrated into all actively managed open-ended funds, with the aim of achieving a higher ESG rating than the benchmark (5) .\n- \u00b7 Responsible investment assets under passive management now stand at \u20ac95 billion (6) thanks to the development of a dedicated ESG and Climate offering.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n- \u00b7 Assets dedicated to specific initiatives, promoting energy transition or social cohesion, now total \u20ac35 billion (7) .\n- \u00b7 The Amundi Solidarit\u00e9 fund invested \u20ac440 million (8) in the social and solidarity economy.\n- \u00b7 An  ESG  advisory  offering  dedicated  to  supporting institutional investors and  distributors in their ESG transition has been deployed.\n\n## Actions with corporates\n\n- \u00b7 We  have  systematically  considered  businesses'  level  of contribution to environmental and social issues in discussions  with  them  and  in  how  voting  rights  are exercised.  Amundi  voted  at  more  than  7,000  General Meetings  in  2021  and  engaged  in  dialogue  with  nearly 900  businesses  on  topics  such  as  the  transition  to  a low-carbon economy, preservation of natural capital, social cohesion and good governance.\n\nBy the end of 2021, thanks to the roll-out of its plan, Amundi held almost \u20ac847 billion (9) in  Responsible Investment assets, including more than \u20ac780 billion classified under Article 8 or 9,  in  compliance  with  the  Sustainable  Finance  Disclosure Regulation, representing some 850 funds and mandates.",

In December  2021,  Amundi  presented  a  new  ESG  strategic plan  for  2022-2025. The  aim  of  this  new  action  plan  is  to increase  its  commitments  through  savings  and  investment solutions offered to its clients, actions taken with businesses and measures to align its employees with its new ambitions.\n\nThis plan comprises ten objectives:\n\nWith regard to its savings or technology solutions offering, Amundi has committed to achieving the following by 2025:\n\n- 1. incorporate  a  new  environmental  transition  rating  into those  of  its  open-ended  active  management  funds  that have an ESG performance target. This rating will be used to  assess  corporates  based  on  their  decarbonisation\n\n- \u00b7 dividend: the dividend payment policy was in line with the objective  for  the  2018-2020  period  (distribution  rate  of 65% of net income), with the exception of the dividend for 2019  due  to  the  ECB's  recommendation  that  institutions under its supervision should suspend all payments.\n\nefforts and the development of their green activities. The stated objective of these portfolios will be to have a better environmental  transition  profile  than  their  benchmark investment universe;\n\n- 2. offer open-ended funds with a 'Net-zero 2050' investment objective across all major asset classes;\n- 3. reach \u20ac20 billion in 'impact' fund assets that will invest in corporates or finance projects that seek to deliver positive environmental or social performance;\n- 4. ensure that 40% of its range of ETF funds are made up of ESG funds;\n- 5. within Amundi  Technology,  develop  ALTO ESG a technological solution to aid analysis and decision-making for investors on environmental and societal issues.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under  such  a  scenario,  the  Company will inform its shareholders through a press release.",

It  is  proposed  that  the  AGM  delegates  to  the Board of Directors, in the event of a change in the par value of  the  share,  a  capital  increase  via  the  capitalisation  of reserves,  the  allocation  of  performance  shares,  the  split  or\n\nreverse split of securities, the distribution of reserves or any other  assets,  the  redemption  of  share  capital,  or  any  other transaction  involving  the  share  capital  or  equity,  the  power to  adjust  the  aforementioned  maximum  purchase  price  to take  into  account  the  impact  of  these  transactions  on  the value of the share.\n\n## Duration of the share buyback programme\n\nThe  share  buyback  programme  may  be  implemented  for  a period of 18 months from the date of the AGM of 18 May 2022.\n\nThe authorisation presented to shareholders during this AGM will  supersede,  effective  18  May  2022,  any  prior  delegation, up  to  its  unused  portion  where  applicable,  granted  to  the Board of Directors to transact on the Company's shares.\n\nI\n\nsubsequent  assignment  under  the  terms  of  a  merger, demerger  or  contribution  may  not  exceed  5%  of  the Company's share capital; and (ii) when the shares are bought back  to  promote  liquidity  under  the  conditions  defined  by the AMF General Regulation, the number of shares taken into account  to  calculate  the  10%  limit  stipulated  above  is  the number  of  shares  purchased,  minus  the  number  of  shares resold during the validity of the authorisation.\n\nThe  overall amount  allocated  to  the  share  buyback programme  cannot  exceed  \u20ac1  billion.  The  securities  that Amundi intends to acquire are exclusively shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

Only  Jean-Michel Forest,  Chair  of  Caisse  R\u00e9gionale  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Loire Haute-Loire, continues in his term of office as a non-voting member.\n\nThe General Meeting of May 2021 also renewed the term of office of the following three directors for a period of three years:\n\n- \u00b7  Mich\u00e8le Guibert;\n- \u00b7 William Kadouch-Chassaing;\n- \u00b7 Michel Mathieu.\n\nThe Meeting also decided not to renew Henri Buecher, Chair of Caisse R\u00e9gionale du Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Alsace Vosges, who is retiring,  as  a  director  and  to  appoint  as  his  replacement Patrice  Genti\u00e9,  Chair  of  the  Caisse  R\u00e9gionale  du  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole d'Aquitaine.\n\n\u00c9ric Taz\u00e9-Bernard, director elected by the employees stepped down in May 2021 and his place was taken by his deputy, Estelle M\u00e9nard, Deputy Head of Global Thematic Equity Management at CPR Asset Management, an Amundi Group company.\n\nLastly, Christine Gandon, Chair of Caisse R\u00e9gionale du Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Nord-Est, was co-opted as a director by the Board of Directors in July 2021 to replace Andr\u00e9e Samat, who also retired.  Ms  Gandon's  co-option  will  be  submitted  to  the General Meeting of 2022 for ratification.\n\nThe table below summarises the changes described above:\n\n## CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE COMMITTEES DURING THE YEAR\n\nAppointment/\n\n| Name                                                                                           | Office held in the Company                      | Departure                                                  | Renewal Co-option             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Gianni Franco Papa Non voting member                                                           |                                                 | Board meeting 09/02/2021                                   |                               |\n| Xavier Musca                                                                                   | Chair of the Board of Directors                 | Board meeting 10/05/2021 Xavier Musca remained a  director |                               |\n| Yves Perrier                                                                                   | Chief Executive Officer  and Executive Director | Board meeting  10/05/2021                                  | Board meeting                 |\n| Henri Buecher                                                                                  | Director                                        | AGM 10/05/2021                                             |                               |\n| Patrice Genti\u00e9                                                                                 | Director                                        |                                                            | AGM 10/05/2021                |\n| Mich\u00e8le Guibert Director, Member of the Risk  Management Committee                             |                                                 |                                                            | AGM 10/05/2021                |\n| William Kadouch-Chassaing Director                                                             |                                                 |                                                            | AGM 10/05/2021                |\n| Michel Mathieu Director                                                                        | AGM 10/05/2021                                  |                                                            |                               |\n| Andr\u00e9e Samat                                                                                   | Director                                        | Board meeting 10/05/2021                                   |                               |\n| Eric Taz\u00e9-Bernard Director elected by the employees,  member of the Risk Management  Committee |                                                 | AGM 10/05/2021                                             |                               |\n| Estelle M\u00e9nard member of the Risk Management  Committee                                        | Director elected by the employees,              |                                                            | Board meeting  10/05/2021 (1) |\n| Director                                                                                       |                                                 |                                                            | Christine Gandon              |\n|                                                                                                |                                                 |                                                            | Board meeting  29/07/2021     |\n\nThus, as at 31 December 2021, the Board is composed of 12 directors, including 4 independent directors, 6 women, 1 director elected by the employees and 1 non-voting member, in accordance with the summary tables below:\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.1.1.3 Changes subsequent to the 2021 financial year\n\nOn the recommendation of its Appointments Committee, in February  the  Board  of  Directors  resolved  to  submit  to  the General  Meeting  of  May  2022  the  renewal  of  the  terms  of office of the following four directors for three financial years:\n\n- \u00b7 Yves Perrier, current Chair of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Xavier  Musca,  Deputy  CEO  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole,  majority shareholder in the Company;\n- \u00b7 Robert Leblanc, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Aon France; and\n- \u00b7 Virginie Cayatte, Financial Director of Adisseo.\n\nEstelle  M\u00e9nard,  who  replaced  Eric  Taz\u00e9-Bernard  as  director elected  by  the  employees  in  2021,  stepped  down  on 1  January  2022  due  to  her  move  within  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group. New  elections were held in March, Joseph Ouedraogo, Head of Investment Risk Business Analyst team, was elected on March 25, 2022, with 35,99% of the votes.\n\n## 2.1.1.1.4 Directors appointed by the General Meeting\n\nIn line with its diversity policy, the Board of Directors ensures that the skills of its members are balanced and varied in light of  the  challenges  facing  Amundi.  It  maintains  a  diversity  of experience and gender, while ensuring that all members are committed to the company's core values.\n\nSkills: each director has their own individual skill set, listed in section  2.2  'Individual  overview  of  the  Directors  and  the Non-Voting Member'.\n\nOn a more collective basis, the Committee has endeavoured to identify the knowledge that must always be present within\n\nthe  Board  of  Directors  to  enable  it  to  carry  out  its  tasks under the best possible conditions. First, it has brought in the knowledge and experience  recommended by the  European banking authorities, and has added an ongoing requirement for  skills  in  the  fields  of  asset  management  and  social  and environmental issues.\n\nIn  accordance  with  banking  regulations,  the  profile  of  each director was thoroughly examined by the European Central Bank  (ECB)  at  the  time  of  their  appointment.  The Appointments Committee takes this opportunity to carefully analyse  the  suitability,  availability  and  skills  in  advance,  so that the individual skill sets of the selected candidate match the collective needs of the Board.\n\nThis means that each director selected contributes individually  to  building  up  the  Board's  diverse,  balanced collective  skill  set.  The  Appointments  Committee  strives  to improve the overall balance as it analyses and recommends candidates, as well as assessing the development of the skills of existing directors through  the  training  sessions  it organises. With this in mind, expertise in IT security and ESG has specifically been developed over the last two years.\n\nIn 2021, the collective skill set of Amundi's Board of Directors remained  similar  to  the  previous  year's  profile.  It  was characterised  by  in-depth  expertise  in  the  areas  of  finance, governance  and  compensation,  strategic  planning  and  risk management,  with  a  balanced  level  of  expertise  in  other areas.  Skills  in  IT  and  security  remain  somewhat  less  well represented, although this has recently improved.\n\nThus,  the  collective  skill  set  of  the  Board  presented  below appears balanced and tailored to the needs of the Company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Accounting  and financial  information   | Social and  environmental  issues   | Risk  management,  compliance  and internal  audit   | Information  security and  technology   | Asset  management  and financial  markets   | Strategic  planning   | Governance  and  compensation   |         | Sales and  marketing   | Banking regulations   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------|------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 9                                        | 6                                   | 8                                                    | 3                                       | 5                                           | 8                     | 9                               |         | 6                      | 6                     |\n| experts                                  | experts                             | experts                                              | experts                                 | experts                                     |                       | experts                         | experts | experts                | experts               |\n\nBoard  Diversity  Policy: the  Board  of  Directors'  diversity policy seeks to ensure an adequate balance and appropriate distribution  of  experience,  skills,  cultures  and  seniority,  in order to best meet the needs of the Company .  The profiles of  each  Board  member  are  presented  in  section  2.2 'Individual  overview  of  the  Directors  and  the  Non-Voting Member'.\n\nWith  regard  to cultural  diversity it  should  be  emphasised that  although  all  members  of  the  Board  are  of  French nationality, some of them have genuine international cultural or  professional  experience,  particularly  in Asia  and  Europe, which aligns perfectly with Amundi's development strategy. For  instance,  Virginie  Cayatte  is  Financial  Director  of\n\nAdisseo, a subsidiary of Chinese group BlueStar Chemchina, listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE).\n\nThis  diversity  policy  also  incorporates  a gender  equality policy in  the  composition  of  the  Board  and  its  committees. The  Board  includes  five  women  out  of  12  directors  and  six women  out  of  13  directors,  when  account  is  taken  of  the director elected by employees. At 42% (1) ,  this  rate  is  higher than the applicable French legal requirements.\n\nIn addition,  the  membership  of  each  of  the  Board's specialised committees includes at least one woman and two of the committees are chaired by women ( see 2.1.3 - Overview of the Specialised Committees and their activities in 2021).\n\nI",

        "page_content": "This desire for balanced gender representation also extends to  the  Company's  internal  organisation  (see  section  2.3.4  Overview  of  the  Group's  management  bodies).  The  gender equality policy, and specifically the objectives of this policy, the  methods  of  implementation  and  the  results  achieved\n\n## Independent directors:\n\nThe  process  of  evaluating  the  independence  of  directors  is overseen by the Appointments Committee.\n\nIn  fact,  having  taken  into  account  the  individual  statements of  each  member,  every  year  the  Appointments  Committee analyses, for each independent director, the criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code, including any business relationships with  the  companies  in  which  they  hold  other  positions  or functions  and  identifies  any  potential  financial  flows.  This dual  approach  enables  it  to  confirm  to  the  Board  that  no such connections exist.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  8  February  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors, upon  hearing  the  recommendations  of  its  Appointments Committee, noted that all the criteria scheduled in the AFEPMEDEF  Code  for  directors  presenting  as  independent  had been  met,  and  in  particular the  absence  of  any  financial flows  between  the  Company,  its  subsidiaries  and  the directors'  related  companies  and  persons .  With  regard  to this  last  criterion,  it  is  specified  that  a  general  threshold  of significance  of  \u20ac20,000  was  taken  into  account  where\n\nduring the past financial year, are discussed each year by the Board of Directors when  reviewing the Report on Professional  Equality,  after  an  in-depth  analysis  conducted by the Compensation Committee.\n\nappropriate,  in  light  of  the  individual  situations  of  the directors. Given  this  threshold,  only  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne  Molinari's situation  was  examined  in  depth  in  view  of  a  business relationship  identified  between  a  subsidiary  of  the  Amundi Group and the Albingia company, where H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Molinari is a director. In terms of both quantitative criteria (financial flows are  less  than  0.001%  compared  to  the  revenues  of  both companies) and qualitative  criteria  related  to  the  nature  of the  contract  (current  management  mandate  entered  into under normal market conditions), the Board found that there were  no  commitments  constituting  dependence  or  that would  generate  conflicts  of  interest.  As  such, Virginie Cayatte,  Laurence  Danon-Arnaud,  Robert  Leblanc  and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Molinari continue to meet the requirements to qualify as  independent  members  pursuant  to  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe Board also noted that the investments made as part of asset management activities for third parties, in companies in which  a  director  may  hold  office,  are  not  included  in  its analysis.\n\nNote  that  the  Board  of  Directors  refers  to  the  following  eight  criteria  as  stipulated  by  Article  9  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code presented below:\n\n## Summary of Article 9.5 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code:\n\nCriterion 1. Employee or Company Officer in the last five years: Not to be or have been in the last five years:\n\n- \u00b7 an employee or executive officer of the Company;\n- \u00b7 an employee, executive officer or director of a company consolidated by the Company;\n- \u00b7 an employee, executive officer or director of the parent company  or  a  company  consolidated  by  the  parent company.\n\nCriterion  2.  Cross-directorships: Not  to  be  an  executive officer  of  a  company  in  which  the  corporation  holds  a directorship, directly or indirectly, or in which an employee appointed as such or an Executive Company Officer of the corporation  (current  or  having  been  for  less  than  five years) has held a directorship.\n\nCriterion 3. Significant business relations: Not be a client (1) , supplier, commercial banker, investment banker or advisor that  is  material  to  the  Company  or  its  Group,  or  for  a significant  part  of  whose  business  the  Company  or  its Group accounts. The evaluation of the significant or nonsignificant  relationship  with  the  Company  or  its  Group must be debated by the Board, and the quantitative and qualitative  criteria  that  led  to  the  evaluation  (continuity, economic dependence, exclusivity, etc.) must be explicitly stated in the report on corporate governance.\n\nCriterion 4. Family ties: Not to be related by close family ties to a Company Officer.\n\nCriterion 5. Statutory Auditor: Not to have been an auditor of the Company within the previous five years.\n\nCriterion 6. More than 12 years' service: Not to have been a director of the Company for more than 12 years. Loss of the status of independent director occurs on the date on which this period of 12 years is reached.\n\nCriterion  7.  Status  of  non-executive  Company  Officer: A non-executive  Company  Officer  may  not  be  considered independent if they receive variable compensation in cash or securities or any compensation linked to the performance of the Company or Group.\n\nCriterion 8. Status of major  shareholder: Directors representing  major  shareholders  of  the  Company  or  its parent  company  may  be  considered  as  independent  so long as these shareholders do not participate in the control of  the  Company.  However,  above  a  10%  threshold  of capital or voting rights, the Board, on the basis of a report from  the  Appointments  Committee,  shall  systematically query whether the person can be considered as independent,  taking  into  account  the  composition  of  the Company's  capital  and  the  existence  of  any  potential conflict of interest.\n\nI",

by the employees\n\nIt  should  be  remembered  that  under  Article  L.  225-27-1 paragraph 3 of the French Commercial Code, the Company is not  required  to  include  a  director  representing  employees on  its  Board  of  Directors,  as  the  parent  company,  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.,  is  itself  subject  to  this  obligation.  Amundi  is therefore exempt from the AFEP-MEDEF Code requirements on this point.\n\nNevertheless,  the  Board  of  Directors  wished  to  use  the optional  regime  set  out  in  Article  L.  225-27  of  the  French Commercial Code, under which a director may be elected by the  Company's  employees,  if  permitted  by  the  Company's Articles of Association. As the General Meeting of 12 May 2016 approved the amendment to the Articles of Association to this end, the Board includes a Director elected by the employees. The  aforementioned  article  also  states  that  the  director elected  by  the  employees  should  not  be  taken  into  account when applying the rules relating to the requirement for gender balance under Article L. 225-18-1 of the same Code.\n\nEstelle  M\u00e9nard,  Deputy  Head  of  Global  Equity  Thematic Management  at  CPR  Asset  Management,  a  subsidiary  of Amundi,  took  over  from  Eric  Taz\u00e9-Bernard  as  director\n\n## 2.1.1.2 Declarations concerning company officers\n\nAll the statements below have been drawn up on the basis of the  individual  statements  by  each  director  and  non-voting member.\n\n## 2.1.1.2.1 No family ties\n\nTo  the  Company's  knowledge,  as  of  the  filing  date  of  this Universal  Registration  Document,  there  are  no  family  ties among the members of the Board of Directors listed above and the members of the Company's Senior Management.\n\nI\n\nelected  by  the  employees  in  May  2021.  Estelle  M\u00e9nard  was called  upon  to  take  up  the  position  of  Director  of  Private Management at LCL and was forced to resign from her post at  the  end  of  the  year.  Consequently,  new  elections  were organised and Joseph Ouedraogo, Head of Investment Risk Business Analyst team, was elected on March 25, 2022, with 35,99% of the votes.\n\n## 2.1.1.1.6 Non-voting member\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Board of Directors included one non-voting  member,  Jean-Michel  Forest,  Chair  of  Caisse R\u00e9gionale  de  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Loire  Haute-Loire.  Under  the Articles  of  Association,  non-voting  member,  nominated  by the  Board,  is  invited  to  attend  meetings  of  the  Board  of Directors  and,  where  applicable,  Committee  meetings  in  a consultative  capacity.  In  this  way,  non-voting  member  fulfil his  role  as  advisor  to  the  Board  of  Directors  and  may  give advice and recommendations.\n\nNon-voting members are considered to be full members of the Board  and  accordingly  comply  with  all  rules  applicable  to directors (Stock Market Ethics Charter and Directors' Charter).\n\n## 2.1.1.2.2 No convictions\n\nTo  the  Company's  knowledge,  during  the  last  five  years: (i)  none  of  the  above  persons has been convicted of fraud, (ii) none of the above persons has been associated with any bankruptcy,  receivership  or  liquidation,  (iii)  no  accusation and/or  official  public  sanctions  have  been  pronounced against any of the above persons by statutory or regulatory authorities  (including  designated  professional  bodies),  and (iv)  none  of  the  above  persons  has  been  disqualified  by  a court  from  acting  as  a  member  of  the  administrative, management or supervisory body of any company, or from being  involved  in  the  management  or  performance  of business of any company.",

In  this  capacity,  William  Kadouch-Chassaing  was  appointed to  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Company,  even  though under the renewed agreement, this is no longer an obligation. During 2021, William Kadouch-Chassaing occasionally found himself  faced  with  conflicts  of  interest  and  thus  abstained from  participating  in  certain  Board  deliberations,  mainly during the Board's discussions on the acquisition of Lyxor. It should be noted that William Kadouch-Chassaing left Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale to join the Eurazeo Group from March 2022.\n\nA number of directors were appointed in their own name based on  a  proposal  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole,  the  majority  shareholder:\n\n## Appendix 1 to the Rules of Procedure - Article 9 Conflicts of interest and inside information\n\nThe  director  reads  and  complies  with  Amundi's  Market Ethics Charter.\n\nFurthermore,  the  director  informs  the  Board  of  any conflicts of interest including potential ones, in which they could be directly or indirectly implicated. They refrain from participating in the discussions and taking decisions on the subjects concerned.\n\nThe director refrains from using for their personal benefit or for the benefit of whomsoever the inside information to\n\nXavier Musca, Yves Perrier, Christine Gandon, Patrice Genti\u00e9, Mich\u00e8le Guibert, Michel Mathieu, Christian Rouchon. Furthermore, it  should  be  noted  that  a  partnership  agreement,  described in  section  2.1.2,  was  renewed  between  Amundi  and  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole during the 2021 financial year.\n\nAt the filing date of this Universal Registration Document no restrictions  have  been  accepted  by  the  members  of  the Board of Directors or the members of the Company's Senior Management  on  the  sale  of  their  shares  in  the  Company, other than the following: (i) rules to prevent insider trading and (ii) recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code obliging directors to hold shares (except the director elected by the employees), translated as the requirement to hold 200 shares set out in Article 10 of the Articles of Association.\n\nFinally, no service agreement has been signed that binds any members of the administrative or management bodies to the issuer  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries,  or  provides  for  benefits  on expiry  of  such  an  agreement,  with  the  exception  of  the suspension  agreement  for  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson's  employment contract concluded on 10 May 2021, described in section 2.1.1.4.\n\nThe specific case of the new Chair of the Board, who could find himself in a potential conflict of interest situation due to his  former  position  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the Company,  has  been  identified.  The  Risk  Management Committee  will  be  specifically  tasked  with  monitoring  this situation and ensuring compliance with the rules adopted on managing  conflicts  of  interest.  These  are  identical  to  the rules applicable to any director and are mainly contained in the Company's Directors' Charter, as follows:\n\nwhich they have access. The director refrains from carrying out any transaction on Amundi shares during the 30 calendar days that precede the publication of the yearly and half-yearly results  and  during  the  15  calendar  days  that  precede  the publication of the quarterly financial information, as well as the day of the said publications.\n\nThe director must, in application of the Market in Financial Instruments  Directive  (MiFID  II),  declare  any  personal transaction  on  a  financial  instrument  if  they  consider  that they potentially are in a situation of conflicts of interest or if they hold confidential information likely to be considered as inside information and acquired in relation to their duties as director.\n\n## 2.1.1.3 Role and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  role  of  the  Board  is  that  of  a  Board  of  Directors  of  a French  public  limited  company:  in  accordance  with  Article L. 225-35 of the French Commercial Code, it ' determines the strategies  for  the  Company's  business  and  ensures  their implementation,  in  accordance  with  its  corporate  interest, taking  into  consideration  the  social  and  environmental challenges  of  its  business.  [...]  Subject  to  powers  expressly reserved for Shareholders' Meetings, and within the limits of the corporate purpose, the Board of Directors may deal with any issue concerning the smooth operation of the Company and will take decisions on matters concerning the Company .'\n\nThe tasks and operation of the Board of Directors are set out in  the  Board's  rules  of  procedure  and  in  the  Articles  of\n\nAssociation,  more  specifically  Articles  12  and  14  of  the Articles of Association, as well as Articles 2 and 3 of the rules of  procedure,  which  are  set  out  in  full  in  Chapter  8  of  this Universal Registration Document.\n\nRules of Procedure: The Rules of Procedure of the Board of Directors  are  also  available  on  the  Company's  website: https://about.amundi.com/Shareholders/Our-group  -  see 'The governance'.\n\nThey consist of four main sections, related to the powers of the Chair of the Board, the powers of the Board and of the Chief Executive Officer, the functioning of the Board, and to its specialised committees.\n\nI",

All directors and non-voting members are required to accept these regulations individually when taking office.\n\nDuring  the  2021  financial  year,  the  Board  of  Directors updated the Charter of Stock Exchange Ethics appended to the Rules of Procedure.\n\nDuration  and  staggering  of  terms  of  office: In  accordance with  recommendation  13.2  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  the expiration  of  the  three-year  terms  of  office  of  directors  is appropriately spread over time. Each year, the term of office of  four  directors  expires,  allowing  for  the  renewal  of  the entire Board over time.\n\nTraining/Seminars: The  directors  are  usually  asked  to  take part in two training sessions during the year, which aim both to  enhance  their  knowledge  and  skills  and  to  give  them  a more  thorough  understanding  of  the  Company's  business lines and strategic challenges. The themes change each year, depending  on  the  regulatory  situation,  the  Company's business  topical  matters,  or  the  needs  expressed  by  the members of the Board. The two sessions held in 2021 kept directors  abreast  of  regulatory  developments  and  the impacts  of  these  developments  on  their  roles  as  directors. They  also  enhanced  their  knowledge  of  the  activities  and organisation of the Business, Support and Operations team, which  is  responsible  for  the  middle  office.  In  addition,  they were able to analyse the positive results of the Amundi brand awareness  barometer  and  to  reflect  on  carbon  neutrality, including  possible  options  for  achieving  this  by  2050.  A strategic seminar day was also held in November 2021 during which  members  of  the  Board  focused  on  changes  in  the global  asset  management  market  and  ensured  that  the strategy  implemented  by  the  Board  was  appropriate  for these  changes.  This  day  also  provided  an  opportunity  to develop the specific avenues for implementation of the new \"Ambition 2025\" Social Plan defined by the Board.\n\nMeetings without senior executives and company officers in attendance: The  two  training  sessions  held  during  2021 provided  the  opportunity  for  directors  to  meet  without senior  executives  and  company  officers  in  attendance.  The meetings  were  attended  by:  Virginie  Cayatte,  Christine Gandon,  Patrice  Genti\u00e9,  Mich\u00e8le  Guibert,  Robert  Leblanc, Estelle  M\u00e9nard,  H\u00e9l\u00e8ne  Molinari,  Christian  Rouchon,  and Laurence Danon.\n\nAssessments: In 2021, the Board carried out two formal selfassessments at the initiative of the Appointments Committee and  as  recommended  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  One  of these  assessments  related  to  the  functioning  of  the  Board (collective  self-assessment)  and  the  other  consisted  of  an individual  self-assessment  of  competencies,  supplemented again this year by an individual declaration by each director, including  the  Chair  of  the  Board.  The  assessment  took  the form of online panels of theme-based questions.\n\nResponses to the assessment of the collective functioning of the Board remain strictly anonymous to maintain freedom of expression. This assessment of the functioning of the Board measures  the  effectiveness  of  its  functioning,  composition\n\nI\n\nand  organisation.  For  2021,  each  director  thus  gave  their assessment  of  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the Board's work, through, among others, an assessment of the frequency and quality of meetings and of their support. This year, they also commented on the quality of the work of the Committees  and  the  training  sessions,  as  well  as  on  the quality  and  completeness  of  the  documents  provided.  The Appointments Committee prepared a summary and presented  it  to  the  Board:  this  summary  highlighted  an overall  satisfaction  rating  that  was  higher  than  last  year (100%  vs.  98.93%).  The  average  number  of  'very  satisfied' responses  (70.88%)  is  down  slightly  on  last  year  (74.20%). There  were  no  'unsatisfactory'  ratings  awarded  this  year, indicating an improvement on last year.\n\nFor the 2021 financial year, members of the Board continue to praise  the  availability  and  quality  of  the  Board's Secretariat  teams,  the  way  they  are  made  to  feel  welcome and  the  setting,  as  well  as  the  regard  for  confidentiality  of the  Board's  debates  (100%  very  satisfied  responses).  The quality and completeness of the information provided to the directors in connection with matters for discussion, as well as the conduct of meetings by the Chair, also feature highly. A more historical analysis of results over the past five years has revealed a significant improvement in satisfaction ratings in terms  of  the  added  value  of  the  work  carried  out  by  the committees, as well as general approval of the way in which the Board functions, reflecting an improvement over time in the good level of cooperation between its members.\n\nThe  directors  also  welcomed  the  organisation  of  a  Board seminar in 2021, suggesting it be repeated over time, with a view  to  further  reflection  on  the  company's  strategy  and development while improving the Board's sense of collective responsibility.\n\nThe  self-assessment  and  individual  declaration  pertain  to their skills and to any needs or issues in respect of training, availability, independence, conflicts of interest, good character, or compliance  with  ethics  rules.  Individual feedback enables the Appointments Committee to back up its  analysis  of  the  collective  skills  of  the  Board  and  the effective contribution of each of its members ( see 'Individual overview  of  the  Directors  and  the  Non-Voting  Member'  in section  2.2  below  and  the  paragraph  on  'Skills'  in  section 2.1.1.1.4  above).  The  feedback  from  each  member also helps to  refine  the  training  programmes  according  to  the  needs that have been conveyed.\n\nSuccession  plan: In  addition  to  its  use  during  the  2021 financial year on the appointment of the new Chief Executive Officer,  the  procedure  relating  to  succession  planning  for senior  executives,  company  officers,  and  holders  of  key positions  was  updated  during  2021,  in  particular  to  take account of regulatory changes. Henceforth, any proposal to dismiss the heads of the Risk Management, Compliance and Internal  Audit  functions,  representing  key  positions,  will  be subject  to  prior  approval  by  the  Board.  It  should  be  noted that this succession planning procedure provides for actions by the Appointments Committee that depend on whether or not the corporate officer to be recruited is independent.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.1.4 Reference to and Compliance with a Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Company refers to the Corporate Governance Code for Listed  Companies,  published  by  AFEP  and  MEDEF  (the 'AFEP-MEDEF  Code'  as  updated  in  January  2020).  The Code can be viewed at  www.afep.com  or  www.medef.com. The Company complies with all the recommendations in this Code.\n\nAt the end of the 2021 financial year, and after an in-depth analysis by the Appointments Committee, it was noted that an  issue  that  had  required  further  clarification  in  previous years  had  disappeared  with  the  appointment  of  the  new Chief Executive Officer. However, this last event necessitates two clarifications for the 2021 financial year:\n\n## ARTICLE 22\n\n## TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS FOR COMPANY OFFICERS\n\n'When an employee is appointed as an Executive Company Officer, it is recommended that his or her employment contract with the company or with a company affiliated to the group be terminated, whether through contractual termination or resignation.'\n\n## ARTICLE 23\n\n## OBLIGATION OF SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND COMPANY OFFICERS TO HOLD SHARES\n\n'The Board of Directors specifies a minimum number of registered shares that senior executives and company officers must retain through to the end of their term of office. This decision is reviewed at least on each extension of their term of office.'\n\nThe Company's Articles of Association set a minimum holding for directors of 200 shares of the  Company,  which  allows  for  a  particularly  effective  sanction  whereby  directors  shall  be deemed to have resigned in the event of a breach. The decision to acquire additional shares is to be made by each director individually.\n\nAs  the  requirement  to  hold  a  minimum  number  of  shares  is  imposed  by  the  Articles  of Association,  this  number  is  not  reviewed  at  each  reappointment.  As  such,  it  concerns  all directors, including the Chair of the Board of Directors. As the Chief Executive Officer is not a director, she is not subject to this obligation. It should be noted, however, that until the end of her term of office, Ms Val\u00e9rie Baudson is required to retain 20% of the performance shares that have vested under each plan awarded in payment of her deferred variable compensation. In  addition,  a  significant  portion  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  compensation depends on and/or is indexed to, the performance of Amundi shares.\n\n## 2.1.2 Activities of the Board of Directors during 2021\n\nIn 2021, the activities of the Board of Directors carried on at a sustained level, with seven Board meetings and one written consultation,  in  accordance  with  the  temporary  provisions authorised in connection with the health crisis. The directors\n\nwere  genuinely  involved,  with  an  overall  attendance  rate  of 96.94%  at  22  Committees  and  Board  meetings  during  the course  of  the  year.  The  attendance  records  of  each  of  the directors are given in the summary table set about above.\n\n## Governance, gender equality and compensation\n\nThe Board of Directors made significant decisions in terms of governance  in  2021 (1) .  It  decided  on  the  succession  of  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and,  after  a  thorough  process conducted  by  its  Appointments  Committee,  appointed\n\nVal\u00e9rie  Baudson  as  the  new  Chief  Executive  Officer, replacing Yves Perrier. It also decided to appoint Yves Perrier as  Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  thus  demonstrating  its desire to manage the transition so as to maintain continuity.\n\nI\n\nArticle  22  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code,  as  interpreted  by  the  High  Committee  on  Corporate Governance  in  its  application  guide,  recommends  outright  termination  of  the  employment contract when an employee becomes an Executive Company Officer.\n\nPursuant to authorisation granted by the Board on 10 May 2021, a suspension agreement for Ms Baudson's employment contract was concluded on 10 May 2021. In view of Ms. Baudson's 25 years of service within the Group, the Board did not feel it was appropriate to deprive her of the benefits she could derive from her employment contract, which she would no longer be able to enjoy if it were terminated. In accordance with the doctrine of the Autorit\u00e9 des march\u00e9s  financiers  (French  Financial  Markets  Authority,  AMF)  and  the  Haut  Comit\u00e9  du Gouvernement  d'Entreprise  (High  Committee  for  Corporate  Governance),  the  Board  thus considered  that  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson's  length  of  service  and  personal  situation  were  sufficient grounds to maintain her employment contract, while arranging for its suspension.\n\nTo this end, it is made clear that this agreement does not provide for the suspension period to  be  taken  into  account  when  calculating  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson's  length  of  service. The suspension agreement also modifies the non-compete commitment provided for by the employment contract, increasing it from six months to one year, while the other conditions of this non-compete commitment remain unchanged. This employment contract suspension specifically  means  that  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  will  not  be  entitled,  during  her  term  of  office, to  any  related  items  of  compensation,  whether  arising  from  her  employment  contract, the  applicable  contractual  stipulations  or  the  legal  and  regulatory  provisions  in  force. She will thus only receive compensation in respect of her corporate office, in line with the terms and conditions described below. This agreement will be the subject of a resolution submitted  to  the  General  Meeting  called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the financial year ended 31 December 2021 in respect of regulated agreements.\n\nLastly,  it  should  be  noted  that,  in  the  event  that  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson's  duties  are  terminated, under no circumstances may the total amount of any severance pay and any indemnities that may  be  paid  as  a  result  of  termination  of  the  employment  contract  exceed  an  amount corresponding to two years' fixed and variable annual compensation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "As  part  of  these  changes,  the  Board  of  Directors  was  also required to decide on new compensation policies applicable to these new senior executives and company officers.\n\nIn addition to these significant matters, and the usual matters that  arise  during  the  preparation  of  General  Meetings  that each  year  requires  work  on  adapting  the  Board  and  its operating rules to regulatory changes, the work of the Board of Directors  on  governance  and  compensation-related matters focused on the following topics in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 the  co-opting  of  Christine  Gandon  as  director  to  replace Andr\u00e9e Samat, who retired;\n- \u00b7 approving  the  principles  of  the  compensation  policy for 2021, as well as ensuring it complies with the applicable regulations in the area of asset management and banking with regard to the categories of identified staff;\n\n## Business, non-financial challenges and strategy\n\nEach quarter the Board of Directors examined the change in overall  performance  of  the  products  managed  by  all  the management  companies  of  the  Amundi  Group,  as  well  as changes in the inflow of the various client segments. It also carefully monitored the contribution to earnings made by the joint ventures.\n\nIn  the  non-financial  field,  the  Amundi  Board  of  Directors wished  to  go  even  further,  building  on  the  progress  made following its previous ESG plan and aware of the efforts that are  still  required  to  ensure  that  all  sectors  and  businesses adopt  a  strategy  in  line  with  the  Paris  Agreements  while ensuring  that  social  cohesion  is  preserved.  In  addition  to joining the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative in July 2021 , it endorsed  a new  action  plan  for  2022-2025 with  three objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 increase  the  level  of  ambition  in  terms  of  responsible investment of its savings solutions;\n- \u00b7 engage as many businesses as possible in defining credible strategies for alignment with the Net Zero 2050 target; and\n- \u00b7 align  its employees  and  shareholders  with  its  new ambitions.\n\nIn this regard and among the commitments made, the Board of  Directors  has  decided  to  submit a  'Say  on  Climate' resolution to  the  next  Shareholders'  Meeting,  allowing  it  to obtain  its  shareholders'  advisory  opinion  on  its  vision  and ambition on this matter.\n\n- \u00b7 the compensation of senior executives and company officers as  well  as  the  allocation  of  compensation  among  the members of the Board;\n- \u00b7 implementing a capital increase reserved for employees;\n- \u00b7 analysing  the  Report  on  gender  pay  equality  and  the progress  made  in  2021  in  the  area  of  gender  equality,  as well as recording the progress made in relation to setting objectives in the gender equality policy ;\n- \u00b7 changes  to  the  succession  plan  to  take  account  of  the need to obtain the Board's approval prior to the removal of those with responsibility for internal control functions.\n\nWith regard to strategy, the Board also expressed its opinion during 2021 on major organic or external growth transactions.\n\nIn fact, 2021 saw the acquisition of Lyxor for a total price of \u20ac825 million, two months in advance of the scheduled date. Founded in 1998, Lyxor is one of the major players in the ETF market  in  Europe  and  has  also  developed  acknowledged expertise  in  active  management,  specifically  through  its liquid  alternative  fund  platform.  Thanks  to  this  acquisition, completed  in  December  2021,  Amundi  benefits  from powerful leverage, not only to speed up its development in the buoyant ETF segment, but also to supplement its active management  offer,  particularly  in  the  area  of  liquid alternative  assets,  as  well  as  in  the  area  of  consulting  and Outsourced CIO (OCIO) .\n\nThe Board of Directors was also asked to decide at the end of  2021  on  the  proposal  by  State  Bank  of  India  (SBI)  to explore the possibility of an IPO of SBI Funds Management Private  Limited  (SBI  FMPL),  a  company  in  which  Amundi holds 36.78% of the capital. The Board resolved to support this initiative and to divest approximately 4% of SBI FMPL's share  capital  in  the  IPO,  which  is  expected  to  complete  on the  Indian  Stock  Exchange  in  2022  (subject  to  regulatory approvals and market conditions).\n\n## Examination of financial statements and financial information, and relations with the Statutory Auditors\n\nIn  addition  to  preparing  the  annual  parent  company  and consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Board  also  examined the half-yearly and quarterly results for 2021. On each of these occasions it heard from the Statutory Auditors, who presented their  findings.  It  approved  all  the  financial  documentation\n\n## Risks and internal control\n\nEach  quarter,  the  Board  of  Directors  examines  in  detail  the changes and events of internal control via a presentation by the Head of the Support and Control division and the report from the Risk Management Committee, presented by its Chair.\n\nIt  also  approves the annual internal control report prepared pursuant to banking regulations and provided to the ACPR, as well as the half-year report on internal control provided to the majority shareholder.\n\nI\n\nprepared in this regard, having taken into account the proposed improvements put forwards by the Audit Committee.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Board of Directors also made decisions on  the  presentation  of  the  2022  budget  and  the  financial trajectory of the Company for the 2023-2025 period.",

        "page_content": "During 2021, the Board also monitored the developments and conclusions  of  the  AMF  file  and  the  strengthening  plan implemented by the Company following this file. It should be remembered  that  on  completion  of  an  investigation conducted from 2017 to 2019, the French Financial Markets Authority  (Autorit\u00e9  des  March\u00e9s  Financiers  -  AMF)  notified grievances to Amundi on 12 June 2020. The grievances relate to the management of certain transactions carried out by two\n\nAmundi employees between 2014 and 2015. On 4 August 2021, the  AMF  Sanctions  Committee  sanctioned  these  former employees  and  two  Amundi  Group  companies  for  various breaches of compliance. In this regard, and in addition to the regular  review  of  its  internal  control  system,  the  Board  is ensuring that a specific strengthening plan is implemented to ensure  that  such  an  incident  cannot  be  repeated.  This  plan has also been reviewed by an external auditing firm.\n\n## Regulated agreements and the procedure for evaluating current agreements\n\nDuring the course of the 2021 financial  year,  two  regulated agreements  within  the  meaning  of  Article  L.  225-38  of  the French Commercial Code were signed (1) .\n\nThe Board of Directors of Amundi, meeting on 10 May 2021, on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee and after  approval  by  the  General  Meeting  of  10  May  2021, authorised, as necessary, the conclusion of an agreement to suspend  the  employment  contract  of  Ms  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson between the person concerned, Amundi Asset Management and  Amundi,  its  sole  shareholder,  signed  on  the  same  day. The  Board  considered  this  mechanism  relevant  in  terms  of access  to  senior  responsibilities  of  Group  employees  who have  contributed  significantly  to  its  development,  thereby promoting  sustainable  management  of  the  Group's  human resources, without hindering the ability to freely dismiss Ms Val\u00e9rie Baudson. The Board of Directors considered that the termination of her employment  contract  would  have effectively  deprived  her  of  those  previously  established rights  attached  to  the  performance  of  said  contract  that were associated with her length of service within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group (severance pay except in the event of gross or serious misconduct, retirement benefits, financial compensation associated with the non-compete clause).\n\nFurthermore,  on  30  July  2021,  the  Company's  Board  of Directors authorised Amundi (the Company) to enter into an agreement  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  which  is  governed  by the  rules  on  regulated  agreements  as  a  result,  firstly,  of Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.'s  status  as  a  majority  shareholder  and, secondly, the existence of a common representative for both contracting parties, since Mr Xavier Musca is both a director of  Amundi  and  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nUnder  this  agreement,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  undertakes  to distribute Amundi products on a preferential basis to clients in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Bank and LCL networks. The agreement renews and adapts the agreements entered into in 2009 and renewed in 2015.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considered  that  the  renewal  of  this agreement was necessary for its activity.\n\nFurthermore,  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  adopted in 2020 on assessing agreements relating to current transactions and  concluded  under  normal  conditions,  the  Board  verified that  the  Audit  Committee  had  carried  out  the  work necessary to implement it properly.\n\nIt  should  be  remembered  that  the  procedure  approved  by the  Board  of  Directors  is  based  on  the  following  key principles:\n\n- \u00b7 the Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring compliance with this procedure;\n- \u00b7 the procedures to be performed to evaluate the agreements are  based  on  criteria  set  by  the  Audit  Committee  which refer  to  those  established  by  the  Commission  Nationale des commissaires aux comptes (French National Board of Auditors);\n- \u00b7 individuals who may have a direct or indirect interest in an agreement are excluded from the evaluation process;\n- \u00b7 the Company's Statutory Auditors or the Audit Committee are consulted over legal disputes;\n- \u00b7 finally,  the  Board  of  Directors  shall  oversee  any  work carried out by the Audit Committee in this regard.\n\n## 2.1.3 Overview of the Specialised Committees and their activities in 2021\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association and the applicable banking regulations, the Board has set up specialised  Committees  that  are  tasked  with  carrying  out detailed  examinations  of  specific  matters  relating  to  the Board  of  Directors'  mandate.  These  Committees  have  no decision-making  powers.  Their  task  is  to  study  any  issue relating  to  the  Company  that  is  submitted  to  them  by  the Board  or  by  the  Chair,  to  carry  out  preliminary  work  and prepare for the decisions by the Board in the form of reports, proposals, opinions, information or recommendations.\n\nThe  Committee  members  are  appointed  by  the  Board  of Directors, which may remove them at any time. A member of a Committee may resign his or her functions at any time. All\n\nmembers  of  the  committees  and  anyone  attending  the Committee meetings are bound by professional confidentiality.\n\nThe  Chair  of  each  Committee  will  call  the  meetings  and validate the meeting agenda or the main purpose, taking into consideration  the  requests  of  members,  and  in  accordance with  the  committee's  powers.  The  Board  of  Directors  may also  make  a  specific  request  to  each  committee  within  the scope of its powers, and may ask the Committee Chair to call an exceptional meeting on that topic.\n\nEach Committee may meet by any means, including via video or  teleconference.  It  may  also  give  its  opinion  by  written consultation.\n\nI",

This Chief Executive Officer is assisted in the performance of his  general  duties  by  two  management  bodies:  a  General Management Committee and an Executive Committee.\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 511-58 of the French Monetary and  Financial  Code,  which  stipulates  that  the  Board  of Directors  of  a  credit  institution  cannot  be  chaired  by  the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors, at its meeting on 15 September 2015, decided that the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and of Chief Executive Officer of the Company would remain separate.\n\n## 2.3.1 Chair of the Board and his duties\n\nSince  10  May  2021,  Yves  Perrier  has  chaired  the  Board  of Directors  of  the  Company,  which  he  previously  headed, replacing Xavier Musca who remains a director.\n\nIn  fulfilment  of  his  legal  duties,  the  Chair  of  the  Board  of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 organises and directs the work of the Board and reports on this to the General Meeting;\n- \u00b7 the Chair oversees the proper functioning of the Company's  management  bodies  and  more  particularly ensures that directors are able to complete their duties;\n- \u00b7 draws  up  the  agendas  for  Board  meetings  and  ensures directors have the information they need to make informed decisions;\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, Yves Perrier decided to hand over  the  senior  management  of  the  Company.  Following  a comprehensive review by the Appointments Committee, the Board  of  Directors  resolved  to  follow  the  joint  proposal  of the  majority  shareholder  and  the  Appointments  Committee in  appointing  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson,  a  member  of  staff  from  the Amundi Group, to Senior Management.\n\nIn  parallel  with  this  appointment  and  to  ensure  a  smooth transition in these developments so as to maintain continuity, the  Board  of  Directors  also  accepted  the  resignation  of Xavier Musca as Chair, appointing Yves Perrier as Chair.\n\nAs part of the Group's internal structure, the Chief Executive Officer  is  also  assisted  in  the  performance  of  her  general duties  by  two  management  bodies:  a  General  Management Committee and an Executive Committee (1) .\n\n- \u00b7 encourages and promotes discussion within the Board;\n- \u00b7 ensures that the decisions taken by the Board are clear.\n\nYves  Perrier  is  also  a  member  of  the  Strategic  and  CSR Committee. To ensure the best possible transition, the Chair and the Chief Executive Officer meet weekly.\n\nIn addition, in 2021 Yves Perrier made a major contribution to the  Board's  work  on  his  succession  and  the  strategic external growth considerations that led to the completion of the  acquisition  of  Lyxor  and  the  communication  of  the Company's 'Ambition 2025' Social Plan.\n\nPersonal  information  about  Yves  Perrier  is  provided  in section  2.3.3  on  'Individual  information  regarding  senior executives and company officers'.\n\n## 2.3.2 The Chief Executive Officer and her powers\n\nVal\u00e9rie  Baudson  was  appointed  Chief  Executive  Officer  of the  Company  on  10  May  2021  for  an  indefinite  period.  The Board  did  not  wish  to  take  this  opportunity  to  change  the scope of the CEO's powers, which therefore remain identical to those previously exercised by Yves Perrier.\n\nIn accordance with the Articles of Association (Article 15) on the  powers  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer, 'The  Chief Executive  Officer  has  the  broadest  powers  to  act  in  all circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company.  They  exercise these powers within the limit of the corporate purpose and subject to those powers that the law expressly grants to the shareholders'  meetings  and  the  Board  of  Directors.  They represent the Company in its dealings with third parties.'\n\nFurthermore,  the  Rules  of  Procedure  of  the  Board  of Directors (Article 2.2) make clear that ' However, they must obtain  the  prior  approval  of  the  Board  of  Directors  for  the following operations:\n\n- \u00b7 the establishment, acquisition or disposal of any subsidiaries or investments in France or abroad where the overall investment is over \u20ac100 million;\n- \u00b7 any other investment or divestiture of any kind whatsoever of over \u20ac100 million.\n\nI",

It thus contributes to the sustainability of the Company in the interest  of  all  stakeholders  alike:  investors, shareholders, customers and employees.\n\nAmundi's  compensation  policy  applies  to  all  Amundi employees, including senior executives, and is based on the principle  of  equal  compensation  for  male  and  female employees for the same work or for work of equal value.\n\nAll  employees  are  entitled  to  all  or  some  of  the  following items  of  compensation,  depending  on  the  responsibilities held and place of work:\n\n- \u00b7 the fixed compensation rewards the missions, responsibilities  and  ongoing  achievements  as  part  of  the position held by the employees;\n- \u00b7 individual variable compensation  measures  individual contributions  to  collective  performance  and  is  broken down into two parts:\n- \u00b7 the annual bonus recognising individual performance,\n- \u00b7 the performance share plan (known as the LTI) aimed at motivating  certain  executives  to  achieve  the  sales, financial and implementation of Amundi's ESG trajectory objectives, as communicated to the market;\n- \u00b7 the  collective  variable  compensation  ensures  employees' share in the returns of financial performance generated by Amundi;\n- \u00b7 the employee benefits offer protection to employees and their families and help them prepare for retirement.\n\nThe overall amount of variable compensation is approved by the  Board  of  Directors  after  review  by  the  Compensation Committee and is determined on the basis of a percentage of the gross operating income before variable compensation.\n\nThe  allocation  of  this  overall  amount  within  the  different business  lines  and  entities  is  based  on  the  contribution  of each team to the collective performance.\n\nThe individual allocation of items of variable compensation is determined  on  a  discretionary  basis  and  is  based  on management's assessment of individual risk-adjusted performance.  To  this  end,  Amundi's  variable  compensation scheme:\n\n- \u00b7 takes  into  account,  when  allocating  individual  bonuses, respect of risk limits and client interest;\n- \u00b7 foresees objective, quantitative and qualitative criteria, as well  as  an  appropriate  timescale  (short-  to  long-term), depending on the office held;\n- \u00b7 sets quantitative criteria for investment managers that link risk to performance (Information Ratio/Sharpe Ratio at 1, 3 and 5 years);\n- \u00b7 takes into consideration the opinion of an ad hoc committee in  the  allocation  and  the  vesting  of  deferred  variable compensation,  which  makes  it  possible  to  adjust  variable compensation according to the risk recorded ex post .\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

The highest variable compensation amounts are therefore partly deferred and spread over a period of  at  least  three  years.  They  are  only  paid  if  the  performance  conditions  are  met  and  in  the  absence  of  risky  professional behaviour during this period.\n\n## 2.4.1.2 Governance\n\nAmundi  oversees  the  compensation  policies  and  practices applicable  to  all  Amundi  entities  to  ensure  consistent compliance with Group-wide guidelines of the compensation policy  and  their  rigorous  application  in  compliance  with applicable  regulations  in  force  (AIFM/UCITS  V,  IFD,  CRD  V and SFDR).\n\nThe  Human  Resources  Department,  under  the  direct supervision  of  the  Senior  Management,  is  responsible  for implementing the compensation policy.\n\nI\n\nIn  accordance  with  regulatory  requirements,  permanent control  functions  play  a  role  in  the  process  of  reviewing variable compensation, specifically for 'identified staff'. This applies  primarily  to  the  Risk  Management  Department  and Compliance Department.\n\nAn ad hoc committee that includes the executives from the Investment business line, the Human Resources Department and the control functions reviews compliance with risk limits and  the  compliance  procedures  implemented  for  the investment management and negotiating functions.",

        "page_content": "These  items  are  referred  to  Senior  Management  and  the managers  concerned  so  that  the  implementation  of  the compensation policy takes them into account.\n\nAmundi's  Compensation  Committee,  which  met  four  times during  the  2021  financial  year,  provides  an  opinion  on  the compensation  policy  to  enable  the  Board  of  Directors  to make informed decisions. It monitors the implementation of this  compensation  policy  in  particular  for  the  'identified staff' referred to below.\n\n## 2.4.1.3 Main achievements in 2021\n\n## Employee share ownership\n\nIn  order to involve the Group's employees in the growth of the  Company  and  in  the  creation  of  economic  value,  on 10  May  2021  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  use  the delegation  of  powers  granted  by  the  General  Meeting  held that  day  to  carry  out  a  capital  increase  reserved  for  all Amundi  employees.  This  transaction,  called We  Share Amundi  2021 ,  was  a  success,  with  more  than  one  in  three employees  worldwide  (33.7%)  taking  part,  with  a  peak subscription of 51.4% in France. More than 1,690 employees in  15  countries  subscribed  to  this  capital  increase  for  an amount  close  to  \u20ac25  million,  an  increase  of  34%  on  the amount subscribed in 2020.\n\n## Long-term incentive plans\n\nThe  General  Meeting  held  on  16  May  2019  authorised  the Board of Directors to grant performance shares (existing or to  be  issued)  to  some  or  all  of  the  Group's  employees  and company officers. This authorisation was given for up to 2% of  the  maximum  share  capital.  For  each  year,  the  total number of shares granted to senior executives and company officers  under  this  authorisation  cannot  exceed  10%  of  the performance  shares  granted  during  that  year.  Pursuant  to this  authorisation,  the  Board  of  Directors  at  its  meeting  of 28 April 2021 decided on the terms, detailed conditions and beneficiaries  of  a  performance  share  plan  by  the  name  of Plan 2021. The shares thus allocated will vest after a vesting\n\nEach  year,  Amundi's  Risk  Management  Committee  also ensures  the  compatibility  of  the  compensation  policy  with the Company's economic and prudential situation.\n\nIn addition, the  implementation  of  policies  applicable pursuant to the CRD V regulation falls within the scope of the compensation governance introduced by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nperiod  of  three  years,  and  will  all  be  conditional  on  the absence of risky professional behaviour, continued employment on the acquisition date, and the achievement of performance conditions  defined  by  the  Board  of  Directors  in  connection with the objectives of the 2021-2023 Business Plan. Performance conditions  relate  to  Amundi's  financial  results  (net  income, Group share, cost-to-income ratio, net inflows) and Amundi's commitment to ESG matters. Their level of achievement will be assessed over the entire length of the plan.\n\nIn  addition,  three  long-term  incentive  plans  were  delivered in  2021  which  had  been  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors pursuant to the authorisations given by the General Meetings of 18 May 2017 and 16 May 2019, with the Board of Directors noting at its meeting on 9 December 2021 that the collective performance  conditions  had  been  met.  The  following tranches were delivered to beneficiaries:\n\n- \u00b7 the  third  and  final  tranche  of  the  plan  decided  by  the Board of Directors on 13 December 2017;\n- \u00b7 the  second  and  final  tranche  of  the  plan  decided  by  the Board of Directors on 1 August 2018;\n- \u00b7 the  sole  tranche  of  the  plan  decided  by  the  Board  of Directors on 12 December 2019.\n\nIn  the  'Significant  events'  section  of  the  notes  to  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  detailed  information  is given regarding the capital increase reserved for employees and in Note 6.5 regarding the performance share plans.\n\n## 2.4.2 Compensation of 'Identified staff' (AIFM/UCITS V and CRD V)\n\nSince  asset  management  represented  the  majority  of  the Group's  business,  Amundi's  2021  policy  is  aligned  with  the regulatory  framework  specific  to  this  business  sector. Accordingly, for management companies, the compensation policy  applicable  to  all  of  Amundi's  'identified  staff'  is determined in accordance with the AIFM/UCITS V Directives applicable to them. For some Amundi Group entities with the status  of  credit  institutions  or  investment  firms,  a  limited number of employees are governed by the CRD V regulation as  described in section 2.4.2.1.2.  The  banking entities  within the  Amundi  scope  are  subject  to  the  same  compensation policies  as  the  banking  entities  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A. Group. These policies provide for:\n\n- \u00b7 rules and thresholds for deferred compensation in line with CRD V;\n- \u00b7 the indexation of deferred variable compensation according to the principles defined in section 2.4.2.2;\n- \u00b7 linking the payment of the deferred bonus to the absence of risky professional behaviour.\n\nThe  compensation  of  CRD  V  'identified  staff'  whose professional  activities  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  risk profile  of  the  relevant  entities  for  2021  is  the  subject  of  an 'Annual  report  on  the  compensation  policy  and  practices applicable to CRD V identified staff' prepared in accordance with the applicable regulations presented in section 2.4.2.3.\n\nIn  addition,  Amundi  has  put  in  place  a  mechanism  allowing for the non-payment of deferred compensation in the event of serious events arising involving questionable and unlawful practices, particularly in terms of risk-taking.\n\nI",

This  process  is supervised by the Compensation Committee.\n\nUnder EU Directives AIFM 2011/61 of 8 June 2011 and UCITS V 2014/91  of  23 July  2014,  the  'identified  staff'  of  asset management  companies,  alternative  investment  funds  and UCITS are defined as those who simultaneously:\n\n- \u00b7 belong to a category of employees that has an impact on the risk  profile  of  the  Group's management companies managing AIFs or UCITS-type funds, by virtue of the positions held;\n- \u00b7 receive a high variable compensation.\n\n## 2.4.2.1.2 CRD V 'Identified staff'\n\nAmundi's 'identified staff' within the meaning of CRD V are identified based on the consolidated scope (Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.)  and  the  sub-consolidated  scope  (Amundi)  under  the joint responsibility of the Human Resources, Risk Management and Compliance departments.\n\nThe  following  are  therefore  defined  as  'identified  staff' within the Amundi Group in accordance with the qualitative and quantitative identification criteria established by CRD V:\n\n- \u00b7 the members of the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer and the Head of the Business Support  and  Control  functions  of  Amundi,  who  are  both executive directors of Amundi S.A.;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy CEO of Amundi Interm\u00e9diation;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy CEO of Amundi Finance.\n\nDirective 2019/2034 ('IFD') has created a specific compensation  regime  for  investment  companies,  which  will be applicable specifically to Amundi Interm\u00e9diation from the 2022  financial  year.  Consequently,  the  scope  of  'identified staff'  within  the  Amundi  Group  governed  by  the  CRD  V regulations will be redefined in 2022.\n\n## 2.4.2.2 Compensation policy for 'Identified staff' (AIFM/UCITS V AND CRD V)\n\nAmundi's compensation policy aims at ensuring an adjustment of compensation to performance in the medium- to long-term and effectively preventing conflicts of interest.\n\n## Rules for deferred payments applicable to bonuses\n\nVariable  compensation  awarded  to  'identified  staff'  is deferred for a minimum of 50% of the amount awarded as of the first euro, by tranches over a minimum of three years, as soon  as  it  attains  a  materiality  threshold  agreed  upon  with the regulator.\n\n'Identified  staff'  are  also  subject  to  bonus  vesting  and indexation conditions.\n\nEach  deferred  compensation  tranche  only  becomes  vested based  on  performance  conditions,  the  absence  of  risky professional  behaviour  and  continued  employment  on  the vesting date. The non-achievement of these conditions may lead to a decrease, or even a definitive loss of the amount to be vested.\n\nThe deferred portion of the bonus is indexed on a basket of funds that are representative of the activity of the Group or of  its  entities,  thus  encouraging  the  alignment  of  employee compensation  with  the  Company's  performance  in  the medium-  to  long-term.  The  employees  concerned  are  not authorised  to  use  personal  hedging  strategies  intended  to counteract the effects of this indexation on the risk that is part of the management of deferred variable compensation.\n\n## Specific rules applicable to CRD V 'identified staff' regarding deferred bonuses\n\nThe  variable  compensation  awarded  to  CRD  V  'identified staff' may not exceed 100% of their fixed compensation; this ratio may be increased to a maximum of 200% if the General Meeting votes in favour.\n\nVariable  compensation  is  deferred  when  it  reaches  the threshold of \u20ac50,000 or if it exceeds one-third of the total compensation (1) :\n\n- \u00b7 40% to 60% depending on the level of compensation;\n- \u00b7 for  a  period  of  4  to  5  years  depending  on  the  level  of responsibility.\n\nAt  least  50%  of  the  variable  compensation,  deferred  or acquired immediately, is:\n\n- \u00b7 awarded  in  the  form  of  instruments  (performance  shares and/or cash indexed on the Amundi share price evolution);\n- \u00b7 and  subject  to  a  minimum  holding  period  of  6  months, which is increased to 12 months for those persons with the highest levels of responsibility.\n\nI",

Individual variable  compensation  is  awarded  on  a  discretionary  basis and is based on management's evaluation of performance:\n\n- \u00b7 based on objective, quantitative and qualitative criteria;\n- \u00b7 involving, depending on the position held, a short- or longterm timescale;\n- \u00b7 and  taking  into  account  compliance  with  risk  limits  and client interest.\n\nThe  criteria  used  in  evaluating  performance  and  awarding variable  compensation  depend  on  the  type  of  functions performed,  as  illustrated  in  the  table  in  2.4.1.1.  of  this Universal Registration Document.\n\nFinally,  Amundi's  compensation  policy  is  consistent  with sound and controlled risk management.  Accordingly, Amundi's  variable  compensation  system  ensures  its  sound financial condition:\n\n- \u00b7 by  establishing  the  total  variable  compensation  amount according to the Group's financial performance;\n- \u00b7 by making the payment of deferred variable compensation conditional upon the achievement of the Group's financial performance objectives.\n\nThe Amundi variable compensation system is consistent with sound and controlled risk management:\n\n- \u00b7 by specifying, as criteria used in the awarding of individual bonuses,  that  risk  and  compliance  regulations  must  be respected  as  well  as,  for  investment  managers,  the quantitative criteria combining  risk and  performance (Information ratio/Sharpe ratio at one, three and five years);\n- \u00b7 by  including  the  opinion  of  an ad  hoc committee  in  the allocation and the vesting of deferred variable compensation,  which  makes  it  possible  to  adjust  variable compensation according to the risk recorded ex post.\n\nThe  allocation  of  variable  compensation  is  subject  to deferred payment procedures specified below.\n\n## Scope of identified staff\n\nThe scope of Amundi CRD V 'identified staff' is described in section 2.4.2.1.2 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Rules for deferred payments applicable to 'identified staff'\n\n## Rules for deferred payments applicable to bonuses\n\nThe  deferred  payment  rules  applicable  to  bonuses  for identified  staff  are  described  in  paragraph  2.4.2.2  of  the Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Vesting conditions of the rights attached to performance share plans\n\nThe  vesting  conditions  of  the  various  Amundi  performance share plans are described in section 2.4.2.2  of  the  Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Limitation of guaranteed bonuses\n\nThe conditions for payment of guaranteed variable compensation  are  described  in  paragraph  2.4.2.2  of  the Universal Registration Document.",

Taking  into  account  the approval rate of 99.89% for the resolution voted on by the General Meeting, compensation will be paid to the Directors for the financial year 2021 in May 2022.\n\n## 2.4.3.1.1 Reminder of the general principles of the 2021 policy\n\nThe  compensation  policy  for  Directors  was  drafted  by  the Board  of  Directors  on  the  recommendation  of  and  after review by the Compensation Committee. It was approved by the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  2021  by  99.98%  (Resolution 7). In accordance with Article 21.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, it features a predominantly variable portion, according to the effective participation of the directors in the various meetings of  the  Board  and  its  Committees  (with  the  exception  of  the Chair of the Board, who is subject to a specific policy, whose principles are described in section 2.4.3.2).\n\nThis  policy  was  deemed  reasonable  in  relation  to  common practice among both SBF 120 companies and the Company's European peers.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  maximum  annual  amount  allocated  to Directors  was  set  at  \u20ac700,000  at  the  General  Meeting  of 30 September 2015 and has not changed since.\n\nDirectors'  compensation for a given year is paid during the following year. As such, the amounts shown below in 2.4.3.1.2 are therefore those:\n\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2019 financial year and paid in 2020;\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2020 financial year and paid in 2021; and\n- \u00b7 allocated for the 2021 financial year, to be paid in 2022.\n\n## 2.4.3.1.2 Compensation awarded or paid to the Directors and the Non-Voting Member\n\nOn 8 February 2022, the Board of Directors, acting on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, implemented the compensation policy approved by the 2021 General Meeting and decided to allocate the total compensation package for 2021 in accordance with said policy.\n\nThe table below summarises the list of beneficiaries and the amount of compensation allocated to them for the last two financial years in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 2.4.3.1.1.\n\nI\n\nThe compensation policy approved by the Meeting provides for the following allocation rules:\n\n- \u00b7 an  amount  of  \u20ac3,500  per  director  per  Board  meeting attended;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,000 per director per committee meeting attended, up to an annual maximum of \u20ac15,000 per committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,000, allocated to the Chair of the Audit Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac15,000, allocated to the Chair of the Risk Management Committee;\n- \u00b7 an annual lump-sum of \u20ac10,000, allocated to the Chair of the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Chair  of  the  Strategic and  CSR  Committee  and  the  Chair  of  the  Appointments Committee.\n\nThe  non-voting  member  shall  receive  the  same  amount  as the directors, deducted from the annual fixed sum allocated to the directors by the General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Val\u00e9rie Baudson took up her position as Chief Executive Officer on 11 May 2021.\n\nThe compensation policies applicable to them were drafted by  the  Board  of  Directors,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Compensation Committee. They were approved by shareholders  at  the  General  Meeting  on  10  May  2021 (Resolutions 8 and 9).\n\n## 2.4.3.3.2 Compensation awarded or paid to Yves Perrier, Chief Executive Officer from 1 January 2021 to 10 May 2021\n\nIn accordance  with  Article L. 22-10-34 II of the  French Commercial Code, the General Meeting of Shareholders must approve  the  fixed,  variable  and  exceptional  components constituting the total compensation and benefits in kind paid or awarded in respect of the period from 1 January 2021 to 10 May 2021, to Yves Perrier as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThese items arise from the application of the compensation policy  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  the  period  from 1 January 2021 to 10 May 2021 as approved by 97.59% by the General Meeting of Shareholders of 10 May 2021 in its eighth resolution. These items are detailed in full in the table below.\n\n## Employment contract\n\nYves  Perrier,  CEO  of  the  Company,  had  an  open-ended employment contract with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and received no  direct  compensation  from  the  Company  for  his  work  as CEO.  This  contract  was  maintained  insofar  as  Yves  Perrier held other positions within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group. He was  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee  and  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole S.A.  Group  in charge of the Savings and Real Estate division (1) .\n\nSince  80%  of  the  compensation  and  benefits  that  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.  paid  to  Yves  Perrier  under  his  employment contract  was  charged  back  to  Amundi  on  an  annual  basis (excluding  pension  expenses),  with  the  remaining  20% charged  to  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  (as  well  as  all  pension expenses), this section describes Yves Perrier's compensation  as  set  out  in  the  said  employment  contract. The information presented below therefore represents 100% of the compensation awarded to or paid to Yves Perrier.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

It noted that these objectives were significantly exceeded and established the Chief Executive Officer's variable compensation on this basis.\n\nThe total achievement rate (detailed below) is 142.5%, which would result in theoretical variable compensation  of  \u20ac1,026,274  by  applying  the  performance  criteria  for  the  period.  However, pursuant  to  the  CRD  V  regulation  and  the  compensation  policy  approved  by  the  General Meeting,  the  Board  capped  total  variable  compensation  at  twice  the  amount  of  fixed compensation, i.e. \u20ac720,000 .\n\nVariable  compensation  awarded  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  for  the  period  from 1 January 2021 to 10 May 2021\n\n|                                                             |       | Weighting Threshold Target   |      | Upper limit   | Achievement  rate of objectives Base 100%   | Achievement  rate of weighted objectives   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|------------------------------|------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Amundi economic criteria (financial statements for Q1 2021) | 70%   |                              |      |               | 139.3%                                      | 97.5%                                      |\n| NBI (in millions of euros)                                  | 10.5% | 50%                          | 100% | 150%          | 150.0%                                      | 15.8%                                      |\n| Cost-to-income ratio  (%)                                   | 14.0% | 50%                          | 100% | 150%          | 132.7%                                      | 18.6%                                      |\n| Adjusted NIGS (in \u20ac millions)                               | 35.0% | 50%                          | 100% | 150%          | 150.0%                                      | 52.5%                                      |\n| Net inflows (in \u20ac billions)                                 | 10.5% | 50%                          | 100% | 150%          | 102.0%                                      | 10.7%                                      |\n| Amundi management criterion                                 | 30%   |                              |      |               | 150.0%                                      | 45.0%                                      |\n| Contribution to managing  the succession process            | 30.0% |                              |      | 150%          | 150.0%                                      | 45.0%                                      |\n| Overall completion rate                                     | 100%  |                              |      |               |                                             | 142.5%                                     |\n\nTHEORETICAL TOTAL VARIABLE COMPENSATION (FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1 JANUARY TO 10 MAY 2021) (in \u20ac)\n\n## TOTAL VARIABLE COMPENSATION AWARDED AFTER CAPPING (FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1 JANUARY TO 10 MAY 2021) (in \u20ac)\n\n1,026,274\n\n720,000\n\nOn  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors,  in  strict application  of  the  compensation  policy  approved  by  the  General  Meeting  of  10  May  2021, compared the results achieved with the target objectives (3) set on the basis of the 2021 budget. It noted that the economic criteria, assessed on the Amundi financial statements published for the  first  quarter  of  2021,  had  been  achieved  at  a  level  of  139.3%  on  a  100%  basis,  or  97.5% given the 70% weighting.\n\nAs regards the level of achievement of the management criterion ,  on  the  recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board considered that Yves Perrier had made a very positive contribution to the succession process by taking into account the following items in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 he  was  particularly  involved  in  the  selection  phase,  to  inform  the  Board's  decision  on  the choice of successor;\n- \u00b7 among other things, he ensured that Val\u00e9rie Baudson took good charge of Amundi's various governance bodies;\n- \u00b7 he positioned her as a leader in the finalisation of the Lyxor transaction and in the preparation of  the  integration  process,  and  organised  the  communication  around  and  introduction  of Val\u00e9rie Baudson to the main stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 he ensured that Val\u00e9rie Baudson was well onboarded on all Amundi Group's sensitive issues.\n\nThese factors led the Board to set the level of achievement of the management objective at 150% on a 100% basis, i.e. 45% taking into account the 30% weighting.\n\nThe payment of the variable compensation items is conditional upon the approval of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nI",

They  simply  specify  the  terms  and  conditions  for  payment  of  the  deferred portion  of  the  variable  compensation.  The  variable  compensation  was  already  subject  to  a performance assessment by the Board of Directors and its payment remains subject to the ex post vote of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nIn accordance with the compensation policy, in the event that risky professional behaviour is observed during the five-year vesting period, the Amundi Board of Directors has the option of reducing  all  or  some  of  any  deferred  variable  compensation  not  yet  received,  even  if  the performance conditions are met.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

The beneficiary will receive payment of a retirement supplement once  he  is  able  to  demonstrate  entitlement  to  his  pension under a mandatory pension plan.\n\nYves Perrier was a beneficiary of vested pension rights under this  plan,  the  amount  of  which  was  based  on  the  accrued savings converted into a lifetime payment starting the day of entitlement. Contributions to this scheme, calculated on the basis  of  the  gross  salary,  capped  at  eight  times  the  annual social security ceiling, stood  at  5%  paid  by  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.  and  3%  by  Yves  Perrier.  They  also  included contributions  to  the  supplementary  retirement  plan  for agricultural  organisations  resulting  from  the  agreement  of 31 January 1996 (the so-called '1.24% plan'). Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s  contributions  to  the  retirement  plan  were  exempted from  social  security  contributions  and  charges,  within  the limits  set  in  Article  L. 242-1  of  the  French  Social  Security Code,  and  may  be  deducted  from  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.'s taxable income.\n\n## Defined-benefit retirement plan\n\nThe  defined-benefit  retirement  plan  consists  of  contingent rights subject to a condition of continued employment within the Company at retirement.\n\nThe  retirement  pension  benefit  under  the  defined-benefit retirement plan is reserved for participants who:\n\n- \u00b7 have at least five years of service within the Group;\n- \u00b7 have  reached  the  age  of  retirement  at  the  rights entitlement  date  or  who  are  60  years  old  and  can demonstrate  that  they  are  entitled  to  full  pension  rights according to the general social security regime;\n- \u00b7 are  eligible  for  the  plan  the day  before  they  become entitled to pension rights;\n- \u00b7 are already entitled to basic and supplementary individual retirement pensions under all mandatory retirement plans in and  outside  France  and  from  the  international organisations  from  which  they  might  benefit,  (excluding any rights under the Agirc category C plan).\n\nThe  scheme  complies  with  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the  previous  provisions  of  Article L. 225-4-1  of  the  French  Commercial  Code  (repealed  by Order  No.  2019-1234  of  27 November  2019),  on  the conditions of acquisition of the conditional annual supplementary defined-benefit pension rights.\n\nWith regard to Yves Perrier, until 31 December 2019 (date of crystallisation  of  rights),  the  annual  vesting  of  rights  was subject  to  the  Amundi  Group  achieving,  during  the  year considered, at least 50% of the Group's budgeted objective for  consolidated net income Group share, it being specified that this condition was nevertheless deemed satisfied if the Amundi Group did not achieve this objective as a result of an adverse market environment that affected Amundi's competitors in a similar manner.\n\nThe  pension  rate  was  equal  to  0.3%  of  the  reference compensation as defined above for each confirmed quarter up  to  a  maximum  of  120  quarters,  corresponding  to  an annual increment of 1.2% maximum per year.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  the  PACTE  Law  and Order No. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019, no additional rights were granted for periods of employment after 1 January 2020.\n\nManagement  of  the  defined-benefit  retirement  plan  is outsourced  to  an  organisation  governed  by  the  French Insurance  Code.  Funding  of  the  outsourced  assets  is accomplished via annual premiums entirely funded by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and subject to the 24% contribution required by Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code, in return for exemption from social security contributions and charges provided  for  in  the  same  article.  These  premiums  do  not generate any tax charges for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nI",

As  set  forth  in  2.4.4.4,  an agreement  to  suspend  her  employment  contract  was concluded on 10 May 2021, after authorisation by the Board of Directors under the regulated agreements. In accordance with  the  provisions  of  Article  L.225-40  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  this  agreement  will  be  submitted  to  the next  General  Meeting,  which  will  vote  on  the  statutory auditor's special report relating to regulated agreements.

Thus,  the  achievement  rate  for  each  of  these three criteria was set at the cap of 150% stipulated in the compensation policy;\n- \u00b7 the  cost-to-income  ratio improved  significantly  (falling  3.8  points  compared  to  2020),  and exceeding the target objective that had been set, though it did not reach the maximum level, resulting in an achievement rate of 141.2%.\n\nGiven  the  weighting  of  each  criterion, the  overall  achievement  rate  for  Amundi's  economic objectives is 148.2% on a 100% basis, or 88.9% taking into account the 60% weighting .\n\nConcerning\n\nnon-economic  criteria  within  the  Amundi  scope,\n\non  the  recommendation  of  the\n\ncompensation Committee, the Board set the level of achievement by taking into account the following\n\nelements:\n\n## \u00b7 Quality of position taking up:\n\nGiven the objectives that had been set to the Chief Executive Officer, the Board decided that the  achievement  rate  for  this  objective  was  115 %,  taking  into  account  the  following accomplishments:\n\n- \u00b7 the acquisition of Lyxor was completed two months ahead of schedule;\n- \u00b7 the ESG strategic plan for the 2022-2025 period has been drawn up and presented to the market;\n- \u00b7 relationships with Amundi's main customers and partners have been maintained by means of 70 interviews conducted since May;\n- \u00b7 a major external communication plan has been rolled out: at least ten interviews with the press (including Les Echos and Agefi) have been conducted, a large-scale press campaign about Amundi and ESG products has been launched to highlight Amundi's leading market position and press conferences have been organised in relation to major projects (Ambition 2025 and Lyxor);\n- \u00b7 Amundi's  senior  leadership  was  managed  proactively:  the  membership  of  the  Senior Leadership Team (SLT) was reviewed and succession plans put in place for key positions, Lyxor managers were successfully integrated and a management seminar was organised, in addition monthly virtual conferences were held for the SLT to discuss key Amundi news.\n\n## \u00b7 Implementation of the ESG policy:\n\nThe Board set the achievement rate for this criterion at 125% , noting that the objectives initially set under the 2018-2021 plan had been exceeded overall:\n\n- \u00b7 the integration of ESG criteria into all actively managed open-ended funds, with the aim of achieving a higher ESG rating than the benchmark. At the end of 2021, ESG criteria had been incorporated into 100% of the funds;\n- \u00b7 the  expansion  of  assets  under  passive  management  to  reach  \u20ac70  billion.  These  assets amounted to \u20ac58 billion at the end of 2020 and nearly \u20ac95 billion at the end of 2021, i.e. 136% of the plan's initial objective;\n- \u00b7 the development of thematic initiatives promoting energy transition or social cohesion, to reach \u20ac20 billion. These thematic initiatives amounted to \u20ac22 billion at the end of 2020 and increased to \u20ac35 billion at the end of 2021, i.e. 174% of the target;\n- \u00b7 the  promotion  of  investments  in  the  social  and  solidarity  economy  with  a  target  of \u20ac500  million.  These  investments  amounted  to  \u20ac331  million  at  the  end  of  2020  and \u20ac440 million at the end of 2021, i.e. 88% of the initial goal.\n\nIn  addition, a new strategic partnership was established with the World Bank on social bonds (BEST funds).\n\n## \u00b7 Feminisation of management bodies\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer had been set the objective (3) of achieving a feminisation rate of 30% in all  Amundi's  management  bodies  as  of  31  December  2021.  The  percentage  of  women  in  each body  has  increased  compared  to  2020.  It  increased  by  more  than  4  points  within  the  SLT's managerial  circle,  to  34.5%.  Feminisation  rate  on  the  General  Management  Committee  also increased  sharply,  from  21.4%  in  2020  to  28.6%  in  2021.  Female  representation  continued  to increase on the Executive Committee, reaching 29.6% as of 31 December 2021 (compared to 28.6% at the end of 2020). Given the feminisation rate that has been achieved across all three bodies, i.e. 30.9%, the Board of Directors has set the target for the criterion of feminisation of management bodies at 100%.\n\nGiven the weight of each criterion, the  overall  achievement  rate  for  Amundi's  non-economic objectives is 113.3% on a 100% basis, i.e. 22.7% given the weighting of 20%.\n\n- (1) With regard to the amounts paid, the only amounts paid to Val\u00e9rie Baudson in respect of her office during the period from 11 May to 31 December 2021 correspond to her fixed compensation. They are listed in Table 2 of section 2.4.3.5.\n- (2) The target objectives for economic criteria cannot be made public owing to their confidential nature. It should be noted that for each Amundi and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. economic criterion, the target objective corresponded to the amount set in the 2021 budget.\n- (3) This objective is in line with the gender diversity policy approved by the Board of Directors (see section 2.3.4.2).\n\nI",

The Group's digital transformation, bolstered by its employee engagement, has helped it maintain its position as one of the top three companies in terms of customer service;\n- \u00b7 the Engagement and Recommendation Index (ERI) posted a record participation rate of 81% for the Group and a commitment rate that has increased from 13 points since 2016. On a human level, in 2021, all group executives benefited from programs aimed at transforming the leadership, while female representation on the Group's Executive Committee increased significantly (from 6.5% in 2016 to 31% in 2021);\n- \u00b7 finally, the Group continued to pursue its commitment to the energy transition with the launch of new offerings. At the end of 2021, the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group had \u20ac12 billion in Green Loan assets under management (an increase of 57% since 2019) and \u20ac31 billion in Green Assets.\n\nIn line with the compensation policy approved by the General Meeting of 10 May 2021, total variable compensation is allocated:\n\n- \u00b7 in  the  form  of  a  bonus  worth  \u20ac620,953;  corresponding  to  the  maximum  bonus  amount  of \u20ac960,000 set out in the compensation policy, on an annual basis;\n- \u00b7 in the form of performance shares in the amount of \u20ac258,730, resulting from the pro rata temporis application of the \u20ac400,000 annual cap.\n\nThe payment of the variable compensation items is conditional upon the approval of the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe  payment  structure  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  annual  variable  compensation  may  be represented as follows :\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayment in cash\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayment in cash indexed to the Amundi and CASA share price\n\nPerformance shares\n\n| Of which  non-deferred  variable  compensation   | \u20ac175,936   | The non-deferred portion with immediate payment of the total variable compensation, i.e. 20%, will be paid in May 2022 subject to approval by the 2022 Annual General Meeting.                |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Of which  variable                               | \u20ac175,937   | The portion  of  the  total  variable  compensation  with  a  one-year  delay  payment,  i.e.  20%,  will  be  paid in March 2023 subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting 2022. |\n| compensation  paid with  a one-year  delay       |            | 85% of this payment is indexed on the Amundi share price evolution and 15% on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price evolution.                                                                 |\n\n- (1) With regard to the amounts paid, the only amounts paid to Val\u00e9rie Baudson in respect of her mandate over the period from 11 May to 31 December 2021 correspond to her fixed compensation.

The compensation policy for 2021 provided for a period of 20 days. However, the period of 40 days before the Board meeting was selected in order to align the granting methods applicable to Val\u00e9rie Baudson with those that apply to the other beneficiaries under the plan.\n\nOn the same day, the Board will allocate the 2022 plan to a select group of key executives, based on the same price.\n\nHowever, with regard to Val\u00e9rie Baudson, the Board will not grant the shares until the end of the 2022  Annual  General  Meeting,  subject  to  the  approval  by  this  Meeting  of  the  total  variable compensation awarded to Val\u00e9rie Baudson for 2021.\n\nNote that the General Meeting of 10 May 2021, in its twenty-sixth resolution, resolved that, for each financial  year,  the  total  number  of  shares  awarded  to  Executive  Company  Officers  may  not represent more than 0.1% of the share capital.\n\nProvided  that  the  performance  conditions  outlined  below  are  met,  these  shares  will  vest  in  five tranches over five years. Each tranche is subject to a compulsory holding period of one year from the vesting date.\n\nThe number of Amundi shares fully vested for each tranche will be determined each year by the Board of Directors,  acting  on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee,  based  on  the  level  of achievement of the performance conditions set out in the table below:\n\n|                                   |           | Achievement rate          | Achievement rate           | Achievement rate             |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Indicator                         | Weighting | Threshold (0%)            | Target (100%)              | Upper limit (125%)           |\n| Adjusted net income,  Group share | 40%       | 50% of the target  amount | 100% of the target  amount | 112.5% of the  target amount |\n| Cost-to-income ratio              | 20%       | Target rate  + 20%        | Target rate                | Target rate  - 5%            |\n| Net inflows                       | 20%       | 0% of the target  amount  | 100% of the target  amount | 125% of the target  amount   |\n| Ambition 2025 ESG Plan            | 20%       | 50% of the  objective     | 100% of the  objective     | 125% of the  objective       |\n\nFor the three economic criteria, the rate of achievement will be determined by comparing the result obtained with the annual budget target approved by the Board of Directors (2) .  With regard to the criterion  relating  to  the  'Ambition  2025'  ESG  plan,  each  year  the  Board  of  Directors  will  assess Amundi's progress towards implementing the ten commitments set out in this plan (3) on the basis of quantitative and qualitative criteria.\n\nFor each tranche, the overall performance is equal to the weighted average of the achievement rates for each performance condition, with this average being capped at 100%. It should be noted that the above conditions do not give rise to any additional compensation. They simply specify the terms and conditions  for  payment  of  the  deferred  portion  of  the  variable  compensation.  The  variable compensation was already subject to a performance assessment by the Board of Directors and its payment remains subject to the ex post vote of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe number of vested shares for each tranche will be equal to one-fifth of the number of shares initially granted, multiplied by the overall achievement rate.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer will be required to hold 20% of the vested shares in respect of each plan until the end of her term of office. Furthermore, she will make a formal commitment not to use any hedging or insurance strategies until the availability date of the performance shares.\n\n- (2) The target objectives cannot be made public owing to their confidential nature.\n- (3) The ten commitments set out under the 'Ambition 2025' ESG plan are described in the press release dated 8 December 2021.\n\nI",

The bonus paid in indexed cash of \u20ac5,175 is paid over five years in five equal tranches of \u20ac1,035.\n\nThe payment of each tranche is subject to the achievement of performance objectives at the level of Amundi and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as set out below.\n\nCondition for payment corresponding to Amundi's performance for 85%:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                               |           | Achievement rate          | Achievement rate          | Achievement rate          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Indicator                                                                                                                                                     | Weighting | Threshold  (0%)           | Target  (100%)            | Upper limit  (120%)       |\n| A djusted Amundi net  income, Group share for  each reference period Reference period  for 1 st  tranche: 2022 Reference period for  2 nd  tranche: 2022-2023 | 85%       | 25% of the  objective (2) | 50% of the  objective (2) | 60% of the  objective (2) |\n| Reference period for  3 rd  tranche: 2022-2024                                                                                                                | 85%       | 25% of the  objective (2) |                           | 60% of the  objective (2) |\n| Reference period for  4 th  tranche: 2022-2025                                                                                                                | 85%       | 25% of the  objective (2) |                           | 60% of the  objective (2) |\n| Reference period for  5 th                                                                                                                                    | 85%       | 25% of the  objective (2) |                           | 60% of the  objective (2) |\n| tranche: 2022-2026                                                                                                                                            | 85%       | 25% of the  objective (2) |                           | 60% of the  objective (2) |\n\nConditions  for  payment  related  to  the  performance  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  for  15%: The  performance  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  will  be  measured  by  three  complementary  criteria  each accounting for 5%, the intrinsic economic performance, the market relative performance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the societal performance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\nIt  is  specified that, for each year, the overall performance is equal to the weighted average of the achievement  rates  for  each  performance  condition,  with  this  average  being  capped  at  100%.  It should be noted that the above conditions do not give rise to any additional compensation. They simply  specify  the  terms  and  conditions  for  payment  of  the  deferred  portion  of  the  variable compensation. The variable compensation was already subject to a performance assessment by the Board of Directors and its payment remains subject to the ex post vote of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe portion of the bonus paid in indexed cash, i.e. \u20ac5,175, is 85% indexed on the Amundi share price evolution  and  15%  on  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  share  price  evolution,  and  subject  to  a  one-year holding period.\n\n## Conditions  applicable  to  the  deferred  portion  of  total  variable  compensation  in  the  event  of departure\n\nIn the event of her departure, Val\u00e9rie Baudson will not be able to retain the rights to the payment of the unvested tranches of deferred compensation (in cash or in the form of shares), except in the event of retirement or exceptional circumstances with a justifiable explanation from the Board of Directors. In these cases, the unvested tranches of deferred variable compensation will be paid on their normal due date pro-rated to the level of achievement of the performance conditions originally set.\n\n## Clawback clause applicable to the deferred portion of total variable compensation\n\nFurthermore, in line with the compensation policy, if it is discovered, within a period of five years after  delivery  of  a  tranche  of  deferred  compensation,  whether  in  cash  or  shares,  that  the  Chief Executive Officer: (i) is responsible for or has contributed to significant losses to the detriment of Amundi or (ii) has engaged in particularly risky behaviour, the Board of Directors reserves the right to demand the restitution of all or some of the shares already delivered or the sums already paid out, subject to any legal constraints that may apply under French law.\n\nNo exceptional compensation was granted to Val\u00e9rie Baudson for the period from 11 May 2021 to 31 December 2021, or paid during that period.\n\n- (2) The target objectives cannot be made public owing to their confidential nature.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

Benefits  in  kind  were excluded  due  to  their  non-material  nature  for  both  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and  all  employees,  as  well  as  the difficulty of consolidating this information across the entire scope (for the Chief Executive Officer, this represents less than  \u20ac7,000  over  one  year  for  company  car  benefits).

This calculation, which is based on financial data (salaries and wages, average headcount) relating to the compensation awarded to the Chair of the Board of Directors (1) and the Chief Executive Officer, also allows comparison with other businesses. Based on the compensation awarded to Yves Perrier in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer, this global equity ratio was 18.7 for 2021, down 2.2 points compared to 2020. On the basis  of  the  compensation  awarded  to  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  in  her  capacity  as  Chief  Executive  Officer,  in  2021  it  was  13.5.

2.4.4 Compensation policy for Amundi's Company Officers for the 2022 financial year\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 II  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the  Annual  General  Meeting  called  to  approve  the  financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 will be asked to approve the compensation policy for company officers for the 2022 financial year.\n\n## 2.4.4.1 Principles common to all Company Officers\n\nThe  compensation  policy  applicable  to  company  officers  is set by the Board of Directors on the recommendation of the Compensation Committee and then submitted to the vote of the  General  Meeting  of  Shareholders  through  separate resolutions, thus allowing the shareholders to vote specifically  on  each  of  them,  and  the  Company  to  take greater account of the result of these votes. The compensation  policy  is  consistent  with  Amundi's  corporate interest,  contributes  to  its  sustainability  and  aligns  with  its strategy,  both  from  a  commercial  standpoint  and  as  a responsible investor, as set out in chapter 1 of this Universal Registration  Document.  To  this  end,  it  forms  part  of  and complies  with  the  general  framework  described  in  section 2.4.1, particularly for Executive Company Officers. Regarding the Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer,  various  mechanisms,  such  as  the  indexation  of deferred compensation to the share price and/or representative  baskets  of  funds,  promote  the  alignment  of interests.\n\nI\n\nWhere  performance  criteria  are  established  for  variable compensation and share-based  compensation,  performance is  evaluated  based  on  the  comparison  between  the  result achieved  and  the  defined  target.  This  applies  to  the  Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nDetailed proposals on the implementation and revision of this policy  are  analysed  by  the  Compensation  Committee.  Two thirds  of  the  members  of  this  committee  are  independent directors  and  it  is  chaired  by  an  independent  director.  The proposals  are  then  discussed  by  the  Board  of  Directors, which  is  responsible  for  drafting  the  compensation  policy. The  Board  is  required  to  comply  with  the  principles  laid down  in  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the  Company's Directors' Charter, particularly with regard to the management of potential  conflicts  of  interest.  These  Board decisions  relate  both  to  the  items  of  compensation  for  the past  financial  year  and  to  the  compensation  policy  for  the upcoming  financial  year.  They  take  into  account  the  votes and possible opinions expressed by the shareholders during the  previous  General  Meeting.  The  work  of  the  Board  of",

        "page_content": "Directors is based on analyses that enable a comparison to be drawn with the compensation of other executives. For the Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  the  Board  refers  to executives from SBF 120 listed companies and for the CEO to executives from a panel of more than 20 international asset managers holding an average of one trillion dollars in assets under  management.  The  Board  of  Directors  also  takes  into account  the  compensation  and  employment  conditions  of the  employees  when  taking  decisions  regarding  company officers.  In  particular,  it  analyses  changes  in  the  Company's performance over the past five years, as well as employees' average and median compensation.\n\nThis policy and the components of its implementation have been  submitted  to  the  vote  of  the  General  Meeting  of Shareholders of the Company since 2018.\n\nIn this context, the Company complies with the provisions of the following regulations:\n\n- \u00b7 the  AFEP-MEDEF  Corporate  Governance  Code  for  Listed Companies (AFEP-MEDEF Code), as revised in January 2020, and all the guidelines contained therein;\n- \u00b7 the regulatory framework set by the French Monetary and Financial  Code  for  credit  institutions  relating  to  the compensation of identified staff, which includes Amundi's Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 the provisions of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  provisions  of  the  compensation  policy  applicable  to Company Officers,  subject  to  their  approval  by  the  Annual General  Meeting  of  Shareholders  called  to  approve  the financial  statements  for  the  year  ended  31  December  2021, are intended to apply to newly appointed company officers or  those  whose  appointment  is  renewed  after  the  General Meeting,  on  the  understanding  that  the  Board  of  Directors, on  the  recommendation  of  the  Compensation  Committee, reserves the right to decide on the adjustments required to take  account  of  the  individual  situation  of  the  executive officer  in  question  and  of  the  responsibilities  conferred  by their  appointment.  These  items  will  apply  until  the  next General  Meeting  of  Shareholders  called  to  approve  the compensation  policy  for  Company  Officers  in  accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 II of the French Commercial Code.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances (such as an exceptional change in market conditions or unforeseen changes that substantially  affect  the  Company's  business),  the  Board  of Directors  may  allow  an  exception  to  the  application  of  the compensation policy. In accordance with Article L. 22-10-8 III\n\nof  the  French  Commercial  Code,  this  exemption  must  be temporary, in line with the corporate interest, and necessary to guarantee the continuity or viability of the Company. The Board of Directors shall rule, after seeking the advice of the Compensation Committee and after obtaining any necessary or  useful  advice  if  required,  in  order  to  decide  on  the principle  and  procedures  of  this  exception  in  line  with  the applicable rules. The policy items to which an exception may apply  are,  exclusively,  the  variable  items  allocated  to  the Chief  Executive  Officer  and/or  the  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer,  with  the  sole  objective  of  taking  into  account,  as fairly as possible, the impact of the exceptional circumstance in  question on the calculation of the quantitative objectives set  out  in  this  compensation  policy,  in  compliance  with  the cap  set  for  total  variable  compensation.  Where  appropriate, the  use  of  this  option  will  be  communicated  by  the  Company and, in any event, will be described in the corporate governance report for the year in question, along with an explanation of the nature  of  the  exceptional  circumstances  and  an  indication  of the  items  to  which  the  exception  has  been  applied,  in accordance with point 10, section I of Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  main  changes  planned  to  the  compensation  policy  for Amundi's company officers for 2022, compared to the policy for 2021, are linked to the change in governance:\n\n- \u00b7 in 2022, the compensation policy is no longer intended to apply to different persons holding successive positions as Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  Chief  Executive Officer, as it was the case in 2021;\n- \u00b7 another  change  to  the  compensation  policy  consists  of adjusting the non-economic criteria of the Chief Executive Officer's  variable  compensation  to  take  into  account Amundi's strategic priorities;\n- \u00b7 finally,  it  contains  details  on  the  compensation  of  the Deputy Chief Executive Officer appointed to this position from 1 April 2022.\n\nAs  part  of  this  proposed  policy  changes,  the  Board  of Directors  took  into  account  the  votes  cast  by  the  General Meeting of Shareholders of 10 May 2021 and, in particular, the approval  of  the  compensation  policies  applicable  to  the Chair  of  the  Board  of  Directors  (Resolutions  10 and 11, approved by 99.87% and 99.10% respectively), the members of the Board of Directors (Resolution 7, approved by 99.98%) and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (Resolutions  8 and  9, approved by 97.59% and 98.05% respectively), as well as the information referred to in Article L. 22-10-9, I of the French Commercial Code (Resolution 5, adopted by 99.89%).\n\n## 2.4.4.2 Compensation policy applicable to Directors and to the Non-voting member\n\nThe compensation policy for directors (1) comprises, firstly, the elements  common  to  all  Company  Officers  as  set  out  in section 2.4.4.1, and, secondly, the specific elements set out below.\n\nDirectors  are  paid  exclusively  via  a  fixed  annual  sum allocated  by  the  General  Meeting  and  distributed  by  the Board of Directors.\n\nThis aggregate amount was set at \u20ac700,000 at the General Meeting of 30 September 2015.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  compensation  in  respect  of  one  year  is paid during the following year. Accordingly, the compensation policy applicable to directors in 2022, subject to approval by the General Meeting, will be paid in 2023 for the 2022 financial year.\n\nI",

In accordance with the doctrine of  the  Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers  (French  Financial Markets Authority, AMF)  and  the  Haut  Comit\u00e9  du Gouvernement d'Entreprise  (High  Committee  for  Corporate Governance),  the  Board  thus  considered  that  Val\u00e9rie Baudson's  length  of  service  and  personal  situation  were sufficient  grounds  to  maintain  her  employment  contract, while arranging for its suspension.\n\nIn  this  regard,  pursuant  to  an  authorisation  granted  by  the Board meeting of 10 May 2021, a suspension agreement was entered  into  on  10  May  2021  to  organise  the  arrangements for revaluation of compensation in respect of Ms. Baudson's employment contract and the conditions for reclassification when the said contract is reactivated. It should be noted that this  agreement  does  not  provide  for  the  suspension  period to  be  taken  into  account  in  calculating  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson's length  of  service.  The  suspension  agreement  also  modifies the non-compete commitment  provided for by the employment contract, increasing  it  from  six  months  to  one year,  while  the  other  conditions  of  this  non-compete commitment  remain  unchanged.  This  employment  contract suspension specifically  means  that  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson  will  not be entitled, during her term of office, to any related items of compensation, whether arising from her employment contract, the applicable contractual stipulations or the legal and regulatory provisions in force. She will thus only receive compensation in respect of her corporate office, in line with the  terms  and  conditions  described  below.  This  agreement will  be  the  subject  of  a  resolution  submitted to the General Meeting  called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the financial  year  ended  31  December  2021  in  respect  of regulated agreements.\n\nI",

This fixed compensation had been determined  at  the  time  of  Val\u00e9rie  Baudson's  appointment.  In  accordance  with  Article  25.3.1  of  the  AFEP- MEDEF Code, this compensation should in principle only be reviewed at relatively long intervals.                            |\n|                              | The  Compensation  Committee  analyses  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  compensation  once  a  year,  with  no presumption that the review will result in any change.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                              | Payment of the fixed compensation items is not conditional on the  ex-post  approval of the General Meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Total variable  compensation | Type of total variable compensation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n\nTotal variable compensation will be awarded:\n\n- \u00b7 partly in the form of a bonus;\n- \u00b7 partly in the form of performance shares according to the procedures set out in detail below.\n\n## Target level of total variable compensation\n\nThe target total variable compensation is \u20ac1,200,000, i.e. 150% of fixed compensation.\n\nUp to this target amount, the said variable compensation is allocated:\n\n- \u00b7 for two thirds of the total in the form of cash bonus, i.e. \u20ac800,000 for the target amount;\n- \u00b7 for one third in the form of performance shares, i.e. \u20ac400,000 for the target amount.\n\n## Ceiling for total variable compensation\n\nAny allocation above the \u20ac1,200,000 target will be made exclusively in the form of cash bonus. Total variable compensation  may  reach  a  maximum  of  \u20ac1,360,000  in  the  event  of  outperformance,  i.e.  170%  of  fixed compensation.\n\nThis is also in line with the application of Article L. 511-78 of the French Monetary and Financial Code, which provides that the General Meeting may increase the total variable compensation to a maximum of 200% of the annual fixed compensation, including in the event that objectives are exceeded.\n\nThe structure of the compensation proposed for Val\u00e9rie Baudson, Chief Executive Officer, can be summarised as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI",

For each criterion, the target objective to be achieved has been set on the basis of the budget approved by the Board of Directors (the values of which are confidential). It is specified that the values set out in the budget correspond to the target values.\n\n## Non-economic criteria\n\nThe  Amundi  non-economic  criteria  selected  by  the  Board  of  Directors  are  in  line  with  the  Company's strategic priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 the growth of ESG will be decisive for Amundi's medium-term growth;\n- \u00b7 the  swift  integration  of  Lyxor  is  crucial  to  enabling  Amundi's  expansion  into  the  ETF  and  alternative management sectors.\n\nAt the end of the 2022 financial year, the Board will evaluate the achievement of:\n\n- \u00b7 the  criterion  relating  to  ESG  projects,  by  measuring  Amundi's  progress  at  the  end  of  2022  towards implementing the ten commitments set out in the 'Ambition 2025' plan (as detailed in the press release dated 8 December 2021), on the basis of quantitative and qualitative results;\n- \u00b7 the criterion relating to the completion of the Lyxor integration, based on compliance with the scheduled integration timetable and the synergies achieved at the end of 2022.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s non-economic criterion, which also concerns the Executive Company Officers of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.,  relates  to  the  rollout  of  the  Group's  Customer,  Human  and  Societal  Project,  with  particular emphasis on the societal aspect. The Board will assess the level to which this criterion has been fulfilled on the basis of the achievements in 2022.\n\nAccordingly, given the criteria relating to the implementation of Amundi's ESG projects and the rollout of the Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  Group's  Customer,  Human  and  Societal  Project,  20%  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's variable compensation relates to CSR and ESG issues.\n\nThe criteria  for  variable  compensation  for  2022,  based  on  the  annual  financial  statements,  and  subject  to approval by the 2022 Annual General Meeting, are as follows:\n\n|                                                            | Weighting   | Threshold   | Target   | Upper limit   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|---------------|\n| AMUNDI SCOPE                                               | 80%         |             |          |               |\n| Economic criteria  (annual financial statements)           | 60%         |             |          |               |\n| NBI (net banking income)  ( \u20acm) (1)                        | 9.0%        | 50%         | 100%     | 150%          |\n| CIR (cost-to-income ratio) (%) (1)                         | 12.0%       | 50%         | 100%     | 150%          |\n| Adjusted NIGS (adjusted net income, Group share)  (\u20acm) (1) | 30.0%       | 50%         | 100%     | 150%          |\n| Net inflows  (\u20acbn) (1)                                     | 9.0%        | 50%         | 100%     | 150%          |\n| Non-economic criteria                                      | 20%         |             |          |               |\n| Implement ESG projects (2)                                 | 10.0%       |             |          | 150%          |\n| Complete the integration of Lyxor (2)                      | 10.0%       |             |          | 150%          |\n| CR\u00c9DIT AGRICOLE S.A.

It will apply to total variable compensation as a whole, capped at 113.3%. The maximum total variable compensation will be \u20ac1,360,000, i.e. 113.3% of the target compensation or 170% of the fixed compensation.\n\n## Terms and conditions for deferral and indexation of total variable compensation\n\nThe deferral and indexing procedures applicable to total variable compensation are defined in compliance with the CRD V Directive, which stipulates that:\n\n- \u00b7 50% of the total variable compensation awarded is paid in the form of instruments;\n- \u00b7 60% of the total variable compensation awarded is deferred over a five-year period;\n- \u00b7 tranches paid in the form of instruments (indexed cash or performance shares) are subject to a holding period of one year.\n\nThe  calculation  of  the  compensation  to  be  deferred  in  respect  of  the  financial  year  is  based  on  the  total variable compensation including performance shares awarded in respect of that year.\n\n## Non-deferred portion of total variable compensation, accounting for 40% of the total, paid entirely in cash\n\n40% of the total variable compensation is acquired immediately at the time it is awarded by the Board of Directors, subject to the ex-post approval of the General Meeting. This non-deferred portion will be paid in two tranches:\n\n- 1. one half, i.e. 20% of the total, within 15 days after the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year in which this compensation is awarded, i.e. May 2023 for compensation awarded in respect of the 2022 financial year;\n- 2. the other half, i.e. 20% of the total, will be paid one year after it is awarded, i.e. in March 2024 for the compensation awarded in respect of the 2022 financial year.\n\nThis second portion of variable compensation will be 85% indexed on the Amundi share price evolution and 15% on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. share price evolution.\n\n## Deferred portion of annual variable compensation, accounting for 60% of the total\n\nThe total variable deferred compensation, accounting for 60% of the total compensation, equals to the sum of:\n\n- \u00b7 the performance shares awarded to the Chief Executive Officer, representing a maximum of two-thirds of the target total variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 the bonus paid in cash for the remainder.\n\n## Performance shares\n\nTo encourage the Chief Executive Officer to create long-term value and to align her interests with those of the Company and its shareholders, a portion of her total variable compensation will be awarded in the form of shares subject to performance conditions. It should be noted that in accordance with the 26th resolution of the 2021 Annual General Meeting, the total number of shares awarded to Executive Company officers may not represent more than 0.1% of the share capital.\n\n## Number of shares initially granted\n\nThe number of Amundi shares corresponding to the portion of the variable compensation awarded for 2022 in the form of performance shares will be determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of the average price of Amundi shares over the 40 business days prior to the Board meeting. As these performance shares represent a form of payment of the variable compensation, their effective grant will only take place after the ex post vote of the Annual General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2022 financial year.\n\n## Terms and conditions for performance shares vesting\n\nSubject  to  the  performance  conditions  being  met,  these  shares  will  vest  in  five  tranches  over  five  years.  Each tranche is subject to a compulsory holding period of one year from the vesting date.\n\nThe number of Amundi shares fully vested for each tranche will be determined each year by the Board of Directors, based on the level of achievement of the performance conditions defined at the time of the initial grant. These conditions will encompass the adjusted NIGS, the cost-to-income ratio, net inflows and criteria reflecting  the  implementation  of  Amundi's  ESG  trajectory.  The  precise  terms  and  conditions,  such  as  the weighting and vesting scale, will be decided by the Board of Directors at the time of the grant and described in the report on the compensation granted to the Chief Executive Officer for 2022, which will be submitted to the ex-post vote of the General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the 2022 financial year.\n\n## Other provisions applicable to performance shares\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer will be required to hold 20% of the vested shares in respect of each plan until the end  of  her  term  of  office.  She  will  also  make  a  formal  commitment  not  to  use  any  hedging  or  insurance strategies until the availability date of the performance shares.\n\n## Total variable compensation\n\nTerms and conditions of deferral and indexation\n\nI",

Performance conditions applicable to severance pay This severance payment will depend on the achievement of budget targets of Amundi Group's business lines over the two financial years preceding the date of termination of the corporate office, based on indicators, taking into account the growth of its business as well as its results, namely: net banking income, net inflows, cost-to-income ratio and adjusted NIGS.   |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-compete  compensation    | Val\u00e9rie Baudson is not subject to a non-compete clause in respect of her office.

This commitment applies for a 12-month period as of the termination of her employment contract. In exchange, she will receive for the duration of the prohibition, an indemnity equal to 50% of the fixed compensation set in connection with the reactivation of her employment contract, as described above.                                                                                                         |\n| Unemployment  insurance      | As indicated above, any amount to be paid in respect of this non-compete fee will be taken into account when calculating the severance pay in order to meet the two-year compensation ceiling set by the AFEP- MEDEF Code.

Only  a  few  adjustments,  taking  into  account the specific nature of the term of office of the Deputy Chief Executive Officer, are proposed and described below.\n\n## Employment contract\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  noted  that  on  the  date  of  his appointment,  Nicolas  Calcoen  had  a  total  of  over  11  years' service  within  the  Group,  reflecting  his  contribution  to  the Group's development since 5 July 2010.\n\nAs such, it did not seem appropriate to the Board to deprive Nicolas  Calcoen  of  the  potential  benefits  arising  from  his employment contract, which he would no longer be able to enjoy if it were terminated. In accordance with the doctrine of  the  Autorit\u00e9  des  march\u00e9s  financiers  (French  Financial Markets  Authority)  and  the  Haut  Comit\u00e9  du  Gouvernement d'Entreprise  (High  Committee  for  Corporate  Governance), the Board considered that Nicolas Calcoen's length of service and personal situation are sufficient grounds to maintain his employment  contract.  However,  this  contract  will  be suspended,  which  specifically  means  that  Nicolas  Calcoen will  not  benefit,  during  his  term  of  office,  from  any  related compensation, whether arising from his employment contract, the applicable contractual stipulations or the legal and regulatory provisions in force. He will thus only receive compensation in respect of his corporate office, in line with the terms and conditions described below.\n\nIn  this  regard,  following  the  approval granted by the Board of  Directors,  a  suspension  agreement  for  Nicolas  Calcoen's employment contract was entered into on 28 March 2022 to organise  the  arrangements  for  revaluation  of  compensation under  the  employment  contract  and  the  conditions  for reclassification when the said contract is reactivated.\n\nThe  compensation  conditions  set  out  in  the  suspension agreement, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the fixed compensation will be equal to the average of the fixed  compensation  granted  to  members  of  the  Amundi General Management Committee (or any other equivalent body), excluding company officers, during the last financial year preceding the termination o his term of office;\n- \u00b7   the  overall  variable  compensation  will  be  equal  to  twothirds  of  the  average  of  the  total  variable  compensation awarded to this same scope.\n\nIn  any  case,  this  compensation  may  not  be  lower  than  that awarded to Nicolas Calcoen for the 2021 financial year.\n\nIt should be noted that this agreement does not provide for the suspension period to be taken into account in calculating Nicolas Calcoen's  length  of  service.  In  addition,  this suspension agreement provides for a non-compete\n\ncommitment under the employment contract for a period of 12 months following the effective date of its termination. This commitment is accompanied by a financial indemnity equal to 50% of the fixed compensation to which Nicolas Calcoen would  be  entitled  upon  reactivation  of  his  employment contract. The agreement also includes a non-poaching clause of Amundi Group employees.\n\n## Items of compensation\n\nThe  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  benefits  from  the following items of compensation:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed compensation;\n- \u00b7 total variable compensation;\n- \u00b7 benefits in kind (company car and private unemployment insurance);\n- \u00b7 severance payment;\n- \u00b7 non-compete compensation;\n- \u00b7 health and provident insurance schemes identical to that of other employees;\n- \u00b7 retirement  benefits  under  the  Amundi  social  framework agreement applicable to all employees.\n\nUnless  specifically  stated  below,  the  items  of  compensation proposed for the Deputy Chief Executive Officer are identical to those applicable to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## Fixed compensation\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  proposals  of  the  Compensation Committee,  the  annual  fixed  compensation  for  2022  would be \u20ac420,000.\n\n## Total variable compensation\n\nThe  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  would  be  eligible  to variable  compensation  under  conditions  identical  to  those applicable  to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  (determination, deferral  and  indexation,  rules  applicable  to  performance shares  and  cash,  payment  terms,  departure  and  clawback clause), subject to further details below.\n\nAs with the Chief Executive Officer:\n\n- \u00b7 the total variable compensation would amount to 150% of fixed compensation, i.e. \u20ac630,000 on an annual basis;\n- \u00b7 up to this  target  amount,  the  said  variable  compensation would be allocated:\n- \u00b7 for two thirds of the total in the form of a cash bonus, i.e. \u20ac420,000 on an annual basis for the target amount;\n- \u00b7 for  one  third  in  the  form  of  performance  shares,  i.e. \u20ac210,000 on an annual basis for the target amount;\n- \u00b7 the  total  variable  compensation  of  the  Deputy  Chief Executive  Officer  would  be  capped  at  170%  of  his  fixed compensation, i.e. \u20ac714,000 on an annual basis.\n\nFor 2022, the amount of total variable compensation will be determined on a pro rata temporis basis from 1 April 2022.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

Amundi  is  committed  to supporting sustainable transitions by means of an ambitious shareholder  engagement  policy  and  responsible  investment strategies.\n\nAmundi's  responsibility  is  also  to  apply  the  principles  of sustainable  development  to  its  own  operations.  Reducing and managing its environmental impact, eliminating discrimination, promoting equal opportunity, ensuring transparency  and  integrity  in  its  governance,  developing  a long-term  philanthropic  policy  and  encouraging  the  social involvement of its  employees  are  Amundi's  CSR  objectives. This policy is carried out both in France and abroad.\n\nThis  is  reflected  by  Amundi's  participation  in  securities market practices, and by the signing of charters to which it is committed  (see  3.6).  In  addition,  Amundi  benefits  from heightened  recognition  as  a  benchmark  player  through  its non-financial ratings.\n\nFurthermore,  considering  the  general  issues  inherent  to  asset managers, Amundi's specific challenges, the commitments of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and the analysis of the direct and indirect impacts of its activities, the Company has made three principal commitments:\n\n- \u00b7 commitment  to  our  clients:  act  as  a  responsible  financial institution and keep the promise we make to our clients;\n- \u00b7 commitment  to  our  employees:  make  individual  and collective  development central to our responsibility as an employer;\n\nIn  line  with  this  philosophy  and  these  principles,  in  2018 Amundi decided to move forward with an ambitious plan to adopt a fully responsible approach .\n\nThis plan, which required very significant mobilisation from all teams, was completed in 2021 with great success, pushing Amundi,  with  some  \u20ac850  billion  of  assets in  Responsible Investment,  to  the  forefront  of  responsible  management companies,  and  establishing  an  unprecedented  level  of integration within the organisation.\n\nBased  on  this  progress,  and  conscious  of  the  efforts  that remain to be made to ensure that all sectors and companies adopt  a  strategy  to  align  with  the  Paris  Agreements  while ensuring that social cohesion is preserved, Amundi wishes to go even further.\n\nAs well as joining the Net Zero coalition of asset managers in July 2021, Amundi is rolling out a new 2022-2025 action plan with a threefold objective: to increase its ambition regarding the responsible investment of its savings solutions; to encourage as  many  companies  as  possible  to  commit  to  defining credible  alignment  strategies  aimed  at  achieving  carbon neutrality by 2050; and to ensure alignment of its employees and shareholders with its new ambitions.\n\nThis  plan  is  part  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's  collective commitment to its Social Project, focusing on three priorities: climate  change,  social  cohesion,  and  agricultural  and  agrifood transitions.\n\n## Amundi's participation in the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group's (1) FReD initiative\n\nSince 2012, the Group has deployed the FReD initiative in its various  entities,  including  Amundi.  This  tool  for  managing and measuring progress in the area of CSR makes it possible to  manage  the  challenges  of  CSR  and  promotes  the involvement  of  the  executives  and  of  the  entire  workforce. Since  2019,  FReD  has  acted  as  a  support  tool  in  the appropriation and operational rollout of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's CSR challenges. The participative approach consists of defining six projects each year to be implemented in each entity  in  the  three  areas  of  CSR:  respect  for  the  client, respect for the employee and respect for the planet.\n\n- \u00b7 commitment  to  society  and  the  world  around  us:  act  as  a community-minded, eco-aware citizen.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

This choice is based on two fundamental  convictions.  The  first  corresponds  to  a  clear awareness of the social responsibility borne by economic and financial  stakeholders.  Through  their  management  activity, asset  managers  can  in  fact  have  a  positive  impact  on  the company, by directing capital towards productive, responsible  investment  and  by  exercising  a  policy  of influence with the companies they finance, their clients and other  stakeholders.  The  second  conviction  is  that  taking  ESG criteria into account in investment choices provides a source\n\n## 3.2.1 Ambitious action plans\n\n## Commitments upheld from 2018-2021\n\nFollowing  three  years  of  work  and  transformation,  Amundi has become a leader in responsible investment , with:\n\nIn terms of its savings and investment solutions:\n\n- \u00b7 ESG  criteria  integrated  into  all  actively  managed openended funds, with the aim of achieving a higher ESG rating than the benchmark (1) ;\n- \u00b7 responsible  investment  assets  under  passive  management which  now  stand  at  some  \u20ac95  billion (2) thanks  to  the development of a dedicated ESG and Climate offer;\n- \u00b7 assets  of  \u20ac34.8  billion  dedicated  to  specific  initiatives promoting energy transition or social cohesion (3) ;\n- \u00b7 the Amundi Solidarit\u00e9 fund, which has invested \u20ac440 million (4) in the social and solidarity economy, and is the largest solidarity fund in France;\n\nof  performance  in  the  long  term.  As  such,  it  places responsible investment at the centre of fiduciary responsibility in relation to our  management  activity, allowing  us  to  preserve  and  maximise  our  clients'  long-term interests.\n\nAmundi's commitment is reflected in its various management processes through challenges associated with ESG integration,  exclusion  and  voting  policies,  and  of  course  in the range of responsible solutions and services that Amundi has  developed  to  support  its  various  clients  in  their  ESG strategy.\n\nIn terms of its actions with businesses:\n\n- \u00b7 systematic consideration of their level of contribution to environmental and social issues in discussions with  them and  in  how  voting  rights  are  exercised.  Amundi  voted  at more than 7,000 General Meetings and engaged in dialogue with nearly 900 businesses on issues such as the transition to a low-carbon economy, preserving natural capital, social cohesion, sound governance, and so on.\n\nBy the end of 2021, thanks to the rollout of its plan, Amundi held  almost  \u20ac850  billion  in  Responsible  Investment  assets, including  more  than  \u20ac780  billion  in  some  850  funds  and financial  products  categorised  under  Article  8  or  9,  in compliance with the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation.\n\n- \u00b7 an ESG advisory offer dedicated to institutional investors and distributors to support them in their ESG transition.\n\n## Commitments strengthened by committed, innovative product launches\n\nIn 2021, Amundi continued to deepen its range of sustainable investment solutions.\n\n- \u00b7 Equity  management: thanks  to  the  success  of  its  ESG Improvers range (5) , Amundi made this offer available within its  equities  range.  BFT  IM  also  launched  an  innovative equity  fund,  BFT  France  Emploi  ISR,  which  promotes  the most  virtuous  businesses  in  terms  of  employment  in France.  Furthermore,  at  the  end  of  November  2021,  CPR launched  a  thematic  investment  strategy  in  international equities dedicated to the hydrogen sector, a major energy transition challenge.\n- \u00b7 Interest rate management: Amundi  implemented  a  new investment strategy within the Amundi  Responsible Investing  Sicav  via  the  'Just  Transition  for  Climate'  fund.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nThis  aims  to  support  the  energy  transition  while  ensuring social cohesion.\n\n- \u00b7 Passive  management: Amundi  has  launched  the  first  ETF aligned  to  the  Paris  Aligned  Benchmark  (PAB)  which boasts the Austrian eco-label.\n- \u00b7 Emerging markets management: In  collaboration with the IFC,  Amundi  launched  the  'Build  Back  Better  Emerging Markets  Sustainable  Transition'  (BEST)  fund,  a  $2  billion bond strategy  aimed  at  supporting  a  green,  resilient  and inclusive recovery.\n- \u00b7 Structured  management: launch  of  the  first  responsible structured funds: S\u00e9lection France Environnement and LCL Impact Social 2021.",

This  analysis  methodology consists  of  rating  companies  based  on  their  ESG  practices. Each  company  is  assessed  by  a  numerical  score  scaled around the average for its sector, thus making it possible to distinguish  between  the  best  and  worst  practices  in  the sector.  Amundi's  assessment  is  based  on  a  combination  of external  non-financial  data  and  qualitative  sectoral  and thematic analyses. Amundi allocates its ratings on a scale of A for the best practices to G for the worst. Companies that are rated G are excluded from our actively managed funds.\n\nOur analysis methodology is based on 38 criteria, including 17  generic  criteria,  common  to  all  sectors,  and  21  specific criteria,  relevant  to  the  challenges  of  the  various  sectors. These  criteria  are  designed  to  assess  the  impact  of  ESG issues on companies as well as how fully companies integrate them.  Both  the  impacts  on  sustainability  factors  and  the quality of ESG risk mitigation measures taken by companies are considered in the analysis. All these criteria are available in the portfolio managers' management tools.\n\nThe  ESG  analysis  carried  out  by  Amundi  systematically targets the most material criteria according to the company's activity and sector. The weighting allocated to the selected criteria  is  a  crucial  element  of  the  ESG  analysis.  In  each sector,  ESG  analysts  weigh  four  to  five  key  criteria  more heavily. The more the company faces a major risk for a given criterion,  the  more  demanding  the  ESG  analysts  will  be  in terms of the quality of its practices.\n\nThe ESG rating is a weighted average of the ratings for the E, S and G aspects. Each aspect is itself the weighted average of the benchmark criteria that comprise it, with each of the 38  analysis  criteria  rated  from  A  to  G.  Ultimately,  the company is awarded an overall rating ranging from A to G. A single  rating  is  given  to  each  issuer,  regardless  of  the selected  benchmark  universe.  The  ESG  rating  given  to companies is thus 'sector neutral', i.e. no sector is favoured or penalised. The  ESG  ratings  are  updated  monthly according to the data provided by our rating agencies. News\n\nI\n\nfrom issuers is monitored continuously and controversies and alerts  are  taken  into  account  for  updating  the  analysis. Analysts  regularly  readjust  their  analysis  methodology according to the environment and current events, particularly controversies.\n\n## A targeted exclusion policy\n\nAmundi applies a targeted exclusion policy, which is one of the pillars of its fiduciary responsibility. It is applied in all its active  management  strategies  (as  well  as  in  some  of  its passive  strategies)  and  consists  of  excluding  companies whose practices do not comply with ESG convictions or with international agreements and frameworks and their transposition  into  national  laws.  These  targeted  exclusions are  applied  subject  to  compliance  with  applicable  laws  and regulations,  and  unless  other  contractual  provisions  are agreed  for  the  dedicated  products  or  services.  Amundi therefore excludes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 any  direct  investment  in  businesses  involved  in  the manufacture,  trading,  stocking  or  servicing  of  antipersonnel  mines  or  cluster  munitions,  in  accordance  with the Ottawa and Oslo conventions;\n- \u00b7 businesses  producing,  stocking  or  marketing  chemical, biological and depleted uranium weapons;\n- \u00b7 businesses that seriously and repeatedly contravene one or more of the 10 principles of the Global Compact without a clear remediation plan.\n\nThese  are  G-rated  issuers  according  to  Amundi's  rating system.\n\nFurthermore, Amundi implements targeted sector exclusions specific  to  the  coal  and  tobacco  industries.  These  sector exclusions  apply  to  all  active  management  strategies  over which  Amundi  has  full  discretion  in  terms  of  portfolio management.  The  principles  of  our  exclusion  policy  are determined  by  the  ESG  and  Climate  Strategy  Committee, and the rules of application are approved by the ESG Rating Committee. Excluded companies are flagged in front  office tools,  allowing  these  transactions  to  be  blocked  upstream. Amundi's  Risk  Management  Department  is  responsible  for the second level of control.\n\nIn  2021,  833  issuers  (Corporates and States) were excluded from the managed portfolios.",

        "page_content": "## Thermal coal policy\n\nAs  coal  is  the  largest  single  contributor  to  human-induced climate  change,  Amundi  has  implemented  a  sector-specific policy on thermal coal since 2016, resulting in the exclusion of  certain  companies  and  issuers.  Every  year  since  2016, Amundi has gradually strengthened its coal exclusion policy. These commitments result from the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's climate  strategy.  In  accordance  with  the  United  Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the 2015 Paris Agreement,  this  strategy  is  based  on  the  research  and recommendations of a Scientific Committee, which takes into account  the  energy  scenarios  of  the  IEA  (International Energy  Agency), Climate  Analytics and Science-Based Targets .  In  2020,  as  part  of  an  update  to  its  policy  on  the thermal  coal  sector,  Amundi  further  broadened  its  coal mining exclusion policy, which now covers any company that develops  or  plans  to  develop  new  thermal  coal  operating capacities. Amundi thus excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 companies developing or planning to develop new thermal coal  capacity  along  the  entire  value  chain  (producers, extractors, power stations, transport infrastructure);\n- \u00b7 companies that make more than 25% of their income from thermal coal mining;\n- \u00b7 companies extracting 100 MT or more of thermal coal with no intention of making reductions;\n- \u00b7 all companies whose income from thermal coal mining and thermal coal-powered electricity generation exceeds 50% of the total income without analysis;\n- \u00b7 all coal-fired electricity generation  and  coal  mining companies with a threshold of between 25% and 50% and a degraded energy transition score.\n\n## Tobacco policy\n\nSince October 2018, Amundi has limited the ESG ratings of companies in the tobacco sector to E, on a scale from A to G (with G-rated companies being excluded). This limit aims to penalise investment in this type of company, which should be offset by investments in more virtuous companies. Amundi's policy applies to the tobacco sector as a whole, particularly suppliers,  cigarette  manufacturers  and  distributors.  In  May 2020,  Amundi  became  a  signatory  to  the Tobacco-Free Finance  Pledge and  extended  its  exclusion  policy  to  the producers of cigarettes and complete tobacco products. The decision  to  strengthen  the  tobacco  policy  has  taken  into account  concerns  related  to  public  health,  as  well  as  the violation of human  rights,  poverty,  the  environmental consequences and the considerable economic cost associated with tobacco, estimated at over USD 1,000 billion per year worldwide,  according  to  the  World  Health Organisation.\n\nAmundi thus applies the following rules:\n\n- \u00b7 exclusion rules: companies manufacturing complete tobacco products (application thresholds: income greater than 5%) are excluded;\n- \u00b7 limit  rules:  companies  involved  in  tobacco  manufacturing, supply  and  distribution  activities  are  limited  to  an  ESG rating  of  E  (ranging  from  A  to  G)  (thresholds  for application: income above 10%).\n\n## Extension of Amundi's sector-specific exclusion policy to unconventional oil and gas\n\nFollowing  the  announcements  of  the  ESG  Ambition  2025 Plan, Amundi will (1) extend its sector-specific exclusion policy to unconventional  oil and  gas.  Amundi  will  exclude companies  from  a  30%  threshold  of  activity  in  the exploration and production of unconventional oil and gas.\n\n## An active commitment policy\n\nA  major  pillar  of  Amundi's  vision  as  a  responsible  investor, engagement  is  exercised  during  analysts'  exchanges  with companies throughout the year, and through engagement on major sustainable development issues, through individual or collaborative  actions.  It  is  essential  to  promote  concrete changes and contribute effectively to the transition towards an inclusive, sustainable and low-carbon economy.\n\nAmundi  has  implemented  a  commitment  policy  based  on three  main  approaches:  thematic  commitment,  ongoing commitment  and  shareholder  dialogue.  This  policy  is  an essential component of Amundi's fiduciary responsibility and its role as a responsible investor.\n\nAmundi's  commitment  strategy  covers  a  range  of  ESG themes that  have  a  strong  impact  on  the  major  challenges that  society  faces.  However,  two  themes  are  given  priority because they are systemic risk vectors for our societies and opportunities  for  companies  that  can  incorporate  them positively:\n\n- \u00b7 global warming and the deterioration of ecosystems, which threaten to cause destructive chain reactions;\n- \u00b7 growing inequality that leads to social divisions endangering  the  economic  and  political  stability  of democracies. In this period of health crisis, fair distribution of added value seems even more necessary.\n\nIn  2021,  we  engaged  in  dialogue  with  848  issuers  on  the subjects of ESG analysis, commitment and voting.\n\nAmundi has a policy committing it on specific issues, helping companies move towards better practices. The ESG analysis and  Corporate  Governance  teams  publish  this  work  in  an annual commitment report, available at www.amundi.com.\n\nIn 2021, specific thematic commitments included the circular economy, for which a specific report was published on our website (2) ,  biodiversity, strategy for alignment with the Paris agreements, the Just Transition, human rights, living wage as well as fair distribution of added value within companies.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shareholder commitment is an increasingly influential driver of climate and social issues. Amundi intends to play its full role as a responsible investor and is thus gearing itself up to support resolutions on climate or social issues.\n\nThe voting policy is reviewed annually at the start of the year for implementation at the start of the voting campaign. It is based  on  the  lessons  of  the  previous  campaign.  Corporate Governance  analysts  submit  proposals  for  changes  to  their voting  practices  to  Amundi's  Senior  Management  (Voting Committee) on the main pillars: Shareholders' rights, Boards, Committees and Executive Bodies, Financial Operations and\n\nExecutive Compensation Policies. At the end of this iterative process, the integration of new principles, the abandonment of  others  and  their  implementation  in  the  form  of  rules  of application are validated by the Voting Committee.\n\nIn  the  context  of  exercising  the  voting  rights  of  its  UCIs (1) , Amundi  may  be  faced  with  situations  where  there  are conflicts of interest. To avoid this contingency, a procedure has been set up allowing those conflicts to be resolved. It is primarily formulated around a pre-established list of issuers where a potential conflict of interest has been identified. For these companies, the proposals for voting on resolutions will, in  line  with  Amundi's  voting  policy,  be  submitted  to  the Voting Committee (led by the Sustainable Investment Manager on  the  Amundi  Management  Committee)  for  validation ahead of the Shareholders' Annual General Meeting.\n\n| Voting campaign        | 2021   |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| AGMs dealt with        | 7,309  |\n| Resolutions dealt with | 77,631 |\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, Amundi has sent voting instructions for all  issuers  in  the  funds'  portfolios  from  the  first  euro, regardless of the geographical investment area.\n\nWe focused on checking that the compensation policies and/ or  the  compensation  reports  submitted  for  voting  included an  ESG  criteria  component.  In  addition,  we  very  often supported shareholder resolutions demanding greater transparency  on  matters  of  ecological  and  the  energy transition.  We  thus  record  86%  of  votes  in  favour  of shareholder resolutions on climate at the General Meetings of companies in which Amundi participated as an investor.\n\n## ESG investment solutions offering\n\nAmundi  offers  its  clients  active  or  passive  management solutions, covering all asset classes and regions, to implement an ESG strategy: best-in-class funds, labelled funds, thematic funds  and  impact  funds.  In  2021,  Amundi  continued  to innovate by developing these product ranges and deploying its ESG advisory and service offering for the Institutional and Retail client segments in Europe, Asia and the US:\n\n- \u00b7 ESG Mainstream or  SRI  funds  constructed  according  to  a best-in-class selection approach ;\n- \u00b7 funds constructed  according  to  an ESG  Improvers approach;\n- \u00b7 ESG ETF and index funds;\n- \u00b7 funds constructed using a thematic approach targeting an environmental  objective:  green  bonds,  green  equities, index  funds  aligned  with  the  PAB/CTB,  real  green  assets and  green  private  debt,  or  assets  with  a  decarbonisation objective;\n\nI\n\n- \u00b7 funds  constructed  using  a  thematic  approach  targeting  a social objective: social bonds,  social  shares,  impact investments;\n- \u00b7 funds  with  specific  labelling:  SRI  label,  Greenfin  label, Febelfin label, Luxflag, etc.;\n- \u00b7 bespoke ESG/climate solutions for mandates and dedicated funds.\n\n## Innovative partnerships\n\nLastly,  through  innovative  partnerships  with  major  public investors,  Amundi  is  developing  solutions  to  finance  the energy  transition.  We  encourage  initiatives  that  stimulate both supply and demand, contributing to the development of sustainable  capital  markets  and  the  growth  of  responsible financing and investment solutions.\n\n## The implementation of Amundi's ESG policy\n\n## 1. Dedicated governance\n\nThe Board of Directors ensures that Amundi fulfils its role as a responsible financial player. At each meeting of the Board of  Directors,  progress  made  on  key  ESG  performance indicators is discussed, and at least one meeting per year is devoted  to  the  ESG  strategy.  Members  of  the  Board  of Directors  receive  regular  training  on  climate  issues  -  for example, on Amundi's voting and commitment policy in 2021 -  and  are  supported  in  their  decision-making  processes  by internal experts.",

Amundi's responsible investment players\n\nAmundi's  Responsible  Investment  business  line  defines  and implements  Amundi's  sustainable  finance  strategy  in  all  its aspects,  for  various  management  types:  analysis  and  rating of  companies,  commitment  and  voting,  integration  of  ESG factors  and  design  of  sustainable  investment  solutions,  key indicators  of  portfolio  sustainability,  ESG  promotion  and participation in local work and initiatives.\n\nBringing together 40 people at the end of 2021, the business unit is focused around four distinct teams:\n\n## Research, Commitment and Votes team\n\nThis  international  team  is  based  in  Paris,  Dublin,  London, Singapore  and  Tokyo.  ESG  analysts  meet  and  engage  with companies, maintain a dialogue with them to improve their ESG  practices, and  are  responsible  for  rating these companies, selecting the relevant indicators to assess them, and  defining  exclusion  rules.  ESG  analysts  work  alongside  a team of dedicated voting policy specialists and in dialogue prior to  meetings.  Based  in  Paris,  they  define  the  voting  policies  of the companies in which Amundi invests on behalf of its clients.\n\n## ESG Solutions and Methodology Team\n\nThis  team  of  quantitative  analysts  and  financial  engineers  is responsible for maintaining and developing Amundi's proprietary  ESG  rating  system  and  ESG  data  management systems (including the selection of external data providers to generate  ESG  ratings).  They  help  analysts  and  portfolio managers  to  incorporate  ESG  considerations  into  their investment decisions as well as sales development teams to create  innovative  solutions  by  incorporating  sustainability data into financial products (ESG ratings, climate data, impact indicators,  controversies,  among  other  data).  They  oversee the  development  and  integration  of  ESG  tools  within Amundi's portfolio management systems and client reporting systems,  and  are  also  responsible  for  implementing  clientspecific ESG exclusion rules.\n\n## ESG Promotion and Business Development\n\nThis  team  is  in  charge  of  developing  and  promoting  ESG solutions  tailored  to  the  needs  and  challenges  of  investors, and offering ESG advice and services to all Amundi clients. It is also  responsible  for  managing  ESG  promotion  and collaboration  efforts  in  sustainable  finance  initiatives,  and developing training programmes for our clients.\n\n## COO Office team\n\nThis  team  is  in  charge  of  producing  items  to  help  manage activity  (Business,  Budget,  IT,  Audit,  projects),  coordinating the governance bodies within the business unit, and working in support of management on major cross-functional projects and strategic ambitions.\n\nMany departments are  also  involved  in  supporting  Amundi's responsible investment approach.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

These  commitments  are  part  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group's  Climate  strategy  and  the  governance  implemented for that purpose. As of 31 December 2021, assets supporting the energy transition and green growth reached \u20ac33.6 billion, a significant increase over 2020 (+53%).\n\nThe  asset management  industry  faces  financial risks associated with climate change. For Amundi, these risks are not specific, as they are covered by the ESG approach that Amundi  has  placed  at  the  heart  of  its  raison  d'\u00eatre (1) as  a responsible investor. Indeed, the ESG approach implemented since  the  creation  of  Amundi  and  expanded  since  2018  is based in particular on integrating non-financial criteria (ESG) into management processes, on a targeted exclusion policy, through  specific  initiatives  on  the  energy  transition  and portfolio decarbonisation.\n\nAmundi  offers  turnkey  investment  solutions  in  the  form  of either open-ended funds or bespoke funds run as investment mandates or dedicated funds. These solutions form part of a range of financial innovations: index-based solutions aligned with the Paris agreements, green bond funds, thematic funds, joint management company with EDF, etc., and of a series of measures,  such  as  strategic  partnerships  sealed  with  major public institutions and participation in initiatives such as the Green Bond Principles, the IIGCC (2) and  the  AIGCC (3) ,  aimed at  engaging  investors  in  the  transition  to  a  low  carbon economy.\n\n## Financing the just energy transition and net zero emissions\n\nAmundi  has  developed  an  extensive  range  of  investment solutions  for  investors  seeking  to  mitigate  climate  change risks,  promote  a  transition  to  sustainable  business  models,\n\nI\n\nand  assess  climate  impact.  In  2021,  Amundi  sped  up  the development  of  innovative  solutions  to  finance  climatefriendly developments and the energy transition, in line with its three-year Responsible Investment Action Plan.\n\nIn  July  2021,  Amundi confirmed the strategic importance of tackling  climate  change  and  financing  a  just  transition  by announcing  its  goal  of  net  zero  emissions  by  2050,  thus strengthening  the  full  integration  of  ESG  into  overall strategic objectives and management processes.\n\nAmundi will support global carbon neutrality goals through:\n\n- \u00b7 a  policy  of  explicit  commitment  to  net  zero  emission trajectories in line with its historic commitment to climate change;\n- \u00b7 significant  mobilisation  of  capital  into  ambitious  climate strategies that support global carbon neutrality goals.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  Amundi  focused  on  initiatives  that stimulate  both  supply  and  demand  and  help  to  create  a dynamic  market  for  responsible  investment  instruments. Addressing  social  issues  is  also  a  top  priority  for  Amundi, which recently developed innovative social theme funds.\n\nIn  April  2021,  Amundi  implemented  a  new  investment strategy within the Amundi Responsible Investing SICAV via the  ' Just  Transition  for  Climate '  fund.  This  European  bond fund has the quantifiable objective of supporting the energy transition while ensuring social cohesion. The Just Transition for Climate fund is the very first fund:\n\n- \u00b7 to be aligned with the energy transition, incorporating an ambitious target to reduce its carbon footprint;\n- \u00b7 to  be  socially  inclusive,  by  integrating  a  'just  transition' rating that incorporates the various social components of a transition to a low-carbon economy: having an impact on workers, consumers, territories and society in general;\n- \u00b7 to be  dynamic  and  forward-looking,  based  on  an engagement  policy  created  to  support  issuers  in  their transition,  in  line  with  the  environmental  and  social objectives of the strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Innovative partnerships\n\nAmundi instigated many major innovations to develop green asset financing, through major partnerships to generate both supply and demand for new green financing projects.\n\nIn  2018  and  2021,  Amundi  launched  four  climate  and development funds with:\n\n- \u00b7 the  IFC  (World  Bank  International  Finance  Corporation): the launch of the largest emerging green bond fund in 2018 ($2  billion),  the  announcement  of  a  new  partnership  in 2021  to  support  green  and  resilient  recovery  efforts following the Covid-19 pandemic (see below);\n- \u00b7 the European Investment Bank (EIB): to accelerate energy transition  projects  in  Europe  with  the  'Green  Credit Continuum' fund (\u20ac1 billion);\n- \u00b7 the  AIIB  (Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank):  bond portfolio  of  USD  500  million  aimed  at  combating  climate change.\n\nIn  2020,  Amundi  and  the  AIIB  developed  an  innovative framework,  the  Climate  Change  Investment  Framework, which considers three variables - green financing, limitation of climate risks and resistance to climate change - to analyse the ability of issuers to confront climate change. In addition to  this  bond  portfolio,  the  programme plans to leverage an additional  USD  500  million  from  institutional  investors wishing to take part in the fight against climate change.\n\nIn 2021, the IFC and Amundi launched a new fund to mobilise up  to  $2  billion  of  private  investment  in  sustainable emerging  market  bonds  that  support  Covid-19  relief  efforts and  promote  a  green,  resilient  and  inclusive  recovery  from the pandemic.\n\nUnveiled during the twenty-sixth United Nations Conference of the Parties on Climate Change  (COP26) in Glasgow, the BuildBack-Better Emerging Markets Sustainable Transition ('BEST')  strategy  will  channel  capital  from  institutional investors  into  investments  in  sustainable  corporate  and financial  bond  issues  on  emerging  markets.  In  turn,  this strategy  will  increase  the  financing  of  these  transactions, strengthen  the  asset  class  and  provide  more  resources  in priority areas such as climate and gender.\n\nThe new IFC / Amundi initiative is designed to help increase the  availability  of,  and  demand  for,  other  segments  of  the sustainable  bond  market  that  still  have  room  to  grow  in terms of green bonds. The BEST strategy, which will have an expected  lifetime  of  10  years,  follows  the Amundi  Planet Emerging  Green  One  Fund green  bond  fund,  launched  by Amundi and the IFC in 2018.\n\n## Measuring and managing climate risks and opportunities related to the transition\n\nAmundi has defined and developed numerous indicators to identify  and  effectively  manage  climate-related  risks  and opportunities:  carbon  footprint  for  portfolios,  alignment  of companies  based  on  data  from  the Science  Based  Targets Initiative ,  energy  transition  rating,  just  transition  rating,  and\n\n## Actions to promote biodiversity\n\nEcosystem protection is one of Amundi's major ESG themes of analysis. This  issue  is  specifically  assessed  in  the Biodiversity  &  Pollution  criterion  of  our  company  rating methodology and is a particular  focus  in  our  dialogue  with companies.\n\nIn  2021,  Amundi  continued  its  actions  to  better  integrate biodiversity into internal analysis and investment processes. In  particular,  Amundi  joined  the  ' Finance  for  Biodiversity Pledge '  initiative  and  thus  committed  to  collaborate  and share its knowledge, to engage with businesses and to assess its  impacts and set targets about biodiversity, as well as to disclose them publicly. This collective investor initiative works to implement a consistent, effective approach to the analysis and  integration  of  biodiversity,  which  remains  a  complex subject that is still poorly understood by companies.\n\nso on. Using this wide range of indicators, Amundi is able to set short, medium and long-term climate targets.\n\nAll these climate-related indicators are set out in section 3.6 of  this  document,  as  well  as  in  Amundi's  annual  climate report, available on Amundi's website (legroupe.amundi.com).\n\nAt  the  fifteenth  United  Nations  Conference  on  Biodiversity (COP15), Amundi represented the signatories of this initiative and  the  financial  sector  as  a  whole,  in  reiterating  the financial  community's will to participate in the fight against biodiversity loss, and to encourage the setting of ambitious targets for the Global Biodiversity Framework, supported by an appropriate regulatory framework.\n\nMoreover,  this  year  Amundi  launched  a  major  commitment campaign  on  biodiversity  with  over  50  companies  in  eight different  sectors.  Due  to  a  lack  of  concrete  data  on  the subject, the first objective of this commitment is to draw up an  inventory  of  how  companies  take  biodiversity  into account,  and  to  provide  recommendations  aimed  at  better integrating this theme into their strategy.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Amundi Finance  et  Solidarit\u00e9  fund  confirmed  its  position  as  the leading social and solidarity investment fund in France with \u20ac440 million in assets under management at the end of 2021.\n\n2021  saw  things  'get  back  to  normal'  for  some  economic players, with an end to lockdowns and curfews across France and  Europe.  However,  the  situation  remained  fragile  as  a result of the health crisis. In this climate, Amundi continued to  support  the  companies  in  its  portfolio  as  a  matter  of priority, allocating  some  \u20ac60  million,  in  particular  to solidarity  property  companies,  which  saw  the  majority  of reinvestments  (Homnia,  Habitat  &  Humanisme,  France Beguinage  and  Resid  Social).  More  than  \u20ac10  million  was allocated  to  companies  new  to  the  fund,  namely  Novetape and  Homeblock  (housing),  Family  Founders  (third-party), Fastroad (employment) and Okeena (health).\n\nWith  a  growth  of  30%  in  its  assets  under  management, Amundi's social impact management continued to develop in 2021; this momentum is explained, as in 2020, by a growing interest  on  the  part  of  private  individuals, via solidarity-based employee  savings  which  continued  to  grow  (accounting  for three-quarters  of  the  fund's  liabilities),  and  on  the  part  of institutional investors for meaningful investments.\n\nThe five investment themes are unchanged and in 2021 they seek to address the fundamental needs of men and women: to have access to proper housing, recognised work, healthcare, education and appropriate training, to protect the environment  and  to  support  solidarity  entrepreneurship. These factors combined  help  ensure  stronger  social cohesion.\n\nAmundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 invests mainly in companies in the  social  and  solidarity  economy  (SSE)  by  supporting  the change in  size  and  scaling  up.  In  2021,  we  strengthened  our partnerships  with  ADIE,  a  micro-credit  player,  a  regional solidarity financier and Microfinance Solidaire. These partnerships  also  allow  Amundi  to  reach  a  large  number  of beneficiaries  indirectly,  be  they  small  and  medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs)  and  very  small  enterprises  (VSEs)  in France  or  in  developing  countries  on  projects  related  to agriculture or energy access.\n\nThe website https://amundi.oneheart.fr makes it possible to identify each of the companies financed and to keep up with their  news  throughout  the  year;  the  companies  in  the portfolio  are  represented  in  a  playful  way  within  a  virtual village  showing  pathways  to  help  revitalise,  organise  and include.  Lastly,  the  Partners'  Club,  organised  every  year  by the Impact management team, allows our whole ecosystem to meet,  interact  and  develop  synergies  and  common  ways  of thinking.\n\n| Solidarity-based savings - Key figures   | 31 December 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| AuM                                      | \u20ac4.7 billion       |\n| Variation 2021/2020                      | +23.8%             |\n| Number of social companies financed      | 48                 |\n| Number of Finansol certified funds       | 3                  |\n\n## 3.2.5 The commitment of the Real and Alternative Assets division\n\n2021  marked  a  new  milestone  in  the  integration  of  ESG  at Amundi  Real  Assets (ARA)  with  the  allocation  on  the Management Committee of ESG responsibility to the Head of Development,  and  the  recruitment  on  the  platform  of  an ESG employee for activities other than real estate, with two people assigned to this area for Amundi Immobilier. This new arrangement  strengthens  the  close  ties  in  place  for  several years  between the ARA platform's management teams and the ESG Research, Commitment and Voting team within the independent ESG business unit at Amundi.\n\nAmundi  Real  Assets  also  conducted  in-depth  analysis  of market  practices  for  each  of  its  asset  classes  (real  estate, private debt, private equity, green infrastructure) in terms of both  direct  investment  and  fund  selection,  thus  initiating  a reflection on the ESG strategy within ARA as a whole, in line with Amundi's new 'Ambition 2025' Social Plan.\n\nIn  order  to  help  mobilise  all  business  units  with  regard  to ESG,  to  communicate  and  share  information  and  best practices on various subjects, a lead group of some 15 people was created within ARA, bringing together a member from each  team  (management,  sales,  marketing/communication, and legal) and the persons responsible for ESG within ARA,\n\nI\n\nalong  with  the  persons  dedicated  to  ARA  within  the  ESG business unit.\n\nFinally,  on  1  January  2021,  it  was  decided  that  the  team dedicated  to  Social  and  Solidarity  Impact  would  report  to ARA, thus providing all of ARA's teams with its solid skills in impact  investing  and  its  experience,  which  is  recognised  in the  marketplace  thanks  to  its  managing  of  the  Amundi Finance et Solidarit\u00e9 fund for over 10 years.\n\n## Amundi Immobilier\n\nWith \u20ac42.8 billion in assets under management (1) ,  making it the world #10 (2) , Amundi Immobilier has seen its commitment to  incorporating  non-financial  Environmental,  Social  and Governance (ESG) criteria into its investment processes and into  the  real  estate  sector  enshrined,  a  commitment  going back  more  than  ten  years.  Amundi  Immobilier  has  been committed to ESG since 2010 when it implemented an ESG charter,  becoming  one  of  the  founding  members  of  the Sustainable Real Estate Observatory (Observatoire de l'Immobilier Durable,  OID),  where  Amundi  also  acts  as Secretary.",

        "page_content": "In  2021,  to  further  strengthen  this  commitment,  Amundi Immobilier was one of the instigators of two working groups led by the OID:\n\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity  Impulsion  Group  (BIG),  which  aims  to develop a common  framework  of  indicators and measurement tools to define and improve the biodiversity footprint  of  property  projects, to  inform  the  selection  of project  owners and investors, and to better reconcile the urban and ecological functions of territories. This approach will help to inform investors' strategies and to participate in the  convergence  of  economic  and  financial  performance with  the  socio-environmental  performance  of  economic players;\n- \u00b7 European Sustainability Real Estate Initiative (ESREI), an initiative  launched  in  June  2021  that  aims  to  expand  the scope of the OID's actions at European level, in  particular to  strengthen  technical  and  regulatory  intelligence  in European  Union  countries  and  the  European  Commission as  well  as  the  creation  of  a  network  of  European sustainable real estate players.\n\nIn 2021, after actively contributing to the various commissions  in  market  associations  such  as  the  French Management  Agency  (AFG)  and  the  French  Association  of Real  Estate  Investment  Companies  (ASPIM)  to  help  roll  out the SRI label to real estate funds, Amundi Immobilier began work to label its funds:\n\n- \u00b7 OPCIMMO,  the  French  property  fund  (OPCI)  for  the general  public,  has  been  doubly  recognised  for  its  ESG approach  firstly  via  the  French  state's  SRI  label,  and secondly  via  the  award  of  5  Stars  and  the  Green  Star (1) rating, the highest rank awarded by The Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (GRESB (2) ).\n- \u00b7 Amundi Immobilier gained an SRI label for Amundi Immo Durable, the  new  offer  launched  in  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Assurances  life  insurance  policies  in  September  2021 intended for its banking networks.\n- \u00b7 Amundi Immobilier is continuing this accreditation process, particularly with regard to SCPIs.\n\nFor the first time in 2021, Amundi Immobilier carried out a dedicated  ESG  review  of  each  of  its  funds  for  individual investors, which is featured in the annual report. This means we can provide our clients with:\n\n- \u00b7 the asset strategy;\n- \u00b7 the objectives set for the Fund and the level of progress;\n- \u00b7 a detailed factsheet for the five highest ESG-rated assets as  well  as  the  five  lowest-rated  buildings  and  the  five highest-rated by value.\n\nThese  reports  are  available  on  the  Amundi  Immobilier website (https://www.amundi-immobilier.com).\n\nTo  strengthen  its  approach  to  transparency  in  terms  of governance for its stakeholders, Amundi Immobilier, for the first  time  in  2021,  organised  a  series  of  online  conferences open to all investors in funds aimed at individual investors currently being marketed, just before the General Meetings in June, providing them with the opportunity to talk directly with  the  management  company given that the health  crisis means General Meetings cannot be held physically.\n\n## Amundi Private Equity Funds (3)\n\n## 1. Amundi PEF (Private Equity Funds) continues to integrate ESG within its investment processes\n\nSince 2014, Amundi PEF has incorporated the ESG approach as a lever for creating value in its investment decisions and throughout the holding period for its investments.\n\nFor its fund-of-funds (4) activity, the ESG policies of managers are reviewed carefully and are part of the overall appraisal of the investment  proposal.  To  expand  this  approach  during  the investment period, Amundi PEF analyses pertinent quantitative and qualitative ESG indicators, across managers and across their underlying investments.\n\nFor its  direct  fund  activity,  ESG  criteria  are  incorporated  at each stage of the investment process via ESG due diligence that  allows  the  analysis  and  assessment  of  ESG  criteria specific to the company in which Amundi PEF is investing. As an active shareholder participating in corporate governance, Amundi  PEF  (direct  fund  activity)  makes  ESG  a  subject  of shareholder  dialogue  and  ensures  that  ESG  issues  are addressed  at  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or Supervisory  Board,  and  that  the  company  makes  progress throughout  the  investment.  Our  commitment  approach involves  recommendations  covering  periods  that  vary  in length, adapted to the company and its sector.\n\n2021  was  an  opportunity  to  significantly  improve  ESG reporting,  in  particular  through  the  use  of  a  tool  allowing faster and easier consolidation of ESG data. It also allowed us to take a new look at the performance of direct holdings and management companies for the fund of funds business and to  present  the  results  to  the  Investment  Committee  and  to our clients, through dedicated reporting brochures (5) .\n\n## 2. Amundi PEF works with its stakeholders to promote ESG\n\nIn  2021,  the  Associate  Director  of  Amundi  Private  Equity Funds became Chairman of the Board of Directors of France Invest (6) .  One of the three pillars of her mandate is dedicated to ESG and aims to speed up the construction of a sustainable economy for private equity-backed companies, as well as the promotion of gender diversity in private equity (7) .\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWe have become an active member of France Invest's ESG Commission, whose aim is to support private equity players in taking ESG issues into account, in particular by providing two  ESG  performance  monitoring  questionnaires  -  one  for investment holdings, the other for general partners .  We took an active  part  in  the  2021  version  with  the  drafting  of  new questions  to  take  into  account  the  latest  regulations ('Disclosure'  regulation (1) ,  Article  29  of  the  Energy-Climate Law, etc.).\n\nThese  two  questionnaires  are  now  widely  used  by  private equity  players  and  serve  as  a  reference  in  terms  of  ESG reporting.\n\n## Amundi Private Debt\n\nConsideration of ESG criteria is an integral part of the private debt  investment  process,  from  the  investment  selection phase and until the loans and bonds mature.\n\nEach opportunity presented to the Investment Committee is subject to due diligence relating to the ESG risks identified and the improvement commitments made by the company. This due diligence is an integral part of the analysis criteria and helps to inform credit analysis, conducted concurrently. It is primarily a way for investors to guard against long-term risks (financial, regulatory, operational and reputational) and to  fully  exercise  their  responsibility.  ESG  due diligence  is carried  out  by  Amundi's  ESG  Research  team  and  the  ARA ESG  team  in  collaboration  with  analysts  and  portfolio managers,  and  includes  sending  questionnaires,  discussions with  management  and  the  review  of  sectoral  studies  from non-financial  rating  agencies.  However,  Amundi's  Private Debt  team  is  also  increasingly  committed  to  helping companies improve their ESG practices.\n\nIn  2021,  Amundi's  Private  Debt  platform  continued  to develop  its  strategies.  It  currently  manages  \u20ac7  billion  in corporate senior debt, real estate debt and acquisition debt.\n\nThis  year  for  the  first  time,  an  ESG  report  was  sent  to investors in the main corporate senior debt funds. This report will be updated each year and extended to all new funds that will subsequently be launched.\n\nIn this context, the automation of ESG data collection, which is  a  major  issue  in  our  private  markets,  will  be  gradually phased in from next year, which should make it possible to increase  the  coverage  rate  of  the  data  collected,  enrich  the content  and  thus  strengthen  transparency  as  regards  our investors on these non-financial aspects.\n\nDuring  the  year,  the  Private  Debt  team  initiated  and participated  with  the  ESG  team  in  market  working  groups, primarily on the theme of Sustainability-Linked Loans (bonds whose margin is partly indexed on ESG indicators) in order to define market standards. This type of financing has in fact grown  rapidly  in  private  debt  markets,  but  the  diverging range of practices means we must be uncompromising about the ESG ambition of these new instruments.\n\nI\n\n2021  also  saw  new  strategies  focusing  on  the  impact  and improvement  of  ESG  practices  emerge  within  the  Private Debt business: after an initial recovery fund approved by the French Insurance Federation (FFA), launched in the second half of 2020, the fourth round of corporate private debt was launched at the end of 2021 with the challenge of equipping all issuers with carbon footprints and action plans to reduce their carbon emissions.\n\nFinally,  this  year,  the  Private  Debt  team  from  Amundi  Real Assets garnered  two  portion  management  mandates  in  the context of Equity Loan Stimulus (Pr\u00eats participatifs relance, PPR) and Bond Stimulus (Obligations relance, OR) programmes under the impetus of the French government to help support French companies through the impacts of the Covid  crisis.  In  particular,  the  OR  programme  aims  to promote the green transition and employment by implementing impact measures.\n\nAs  regards  real  estate  debt,  the  close  ties  with  Amundi Immobilier's ESG teams made it possible to draft an in-depth assessment for each property financed, as per the commitment  made  at  the  launch  of  the  first  round  of  real estate  private  debt,  which  completed  its  fundraising  period in 2021. This has already been widely rolled out.\n\n## Amundi Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique\n\nFive years ago, Amundi entered into a partnership with EDF as  part  of  the  financing  of  the  energy  transition.  'Amundi transition  \u00e9nerg\u00e9tique'  (ATE)  is  an  asset  management company dedicated to  green  infrastructure  and  the  energy transition,  which  aims  to  establish  a  robust  and  sustainable energy  model  in  the  face  of  energy  supply  issues,  price changes,  resource  depletion  and  environmental  protection requirements.\n\nATE has \u20ac2 billion in investment capacity. At the end of 2021, the investment already made in cogeneration units, solar and wind  farms  in  France,  Belgium,  Sweden,  Spain  and  Italy make up more than 350 assets with a total installed capacity of 1.5 GW.\n\n## Amundi \u00c9nergies Vertes - an award-winning innovation in 2021\n\nBased on its experience with institutional clients, in June 2020 Amundi  launched  an  offer  allowing  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's private banking clients to invest directly in green infrastructure  contributing  to  the  energy  transition  such  as wind  farms  or  photovoltaic  farms,  and  thus  invest  in  the financing of the energy transition in France and more widely in Europe.\n\nThis  diversification  solution,  designed  in  partnership  with Predica, won two awards for its innovation. Indeed, it is the first  unit-linked  life  insurance  policy  in  the  marketplace  that allows individual clients to invest directly in these assets.\n\nIn  order  to  provide  investors  with  maximum  transparency,  a dedicated  interactive  map  has  been  designed  with  the geographical  location  of  each  asset  with  photos  and  an indication of its energy output.

In joining  the Net  Zero  Asset  Managers  Initiative ,  Amundi  is showing  its  support  for  global  carbon  neutrality  goals,  and taking steps to accelerate investment aligned with the goal of net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. This is a key step in Amundi's  commitment  to  make  a  positive  contribution  to addressing global social challenges and a major milestone in its plan to mobilise for climate action before COP26.\n\n## What is the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative?\n\nThe NZAM initiative is a group of 220 global asset managers responsible  for  $57  trillion  in  assets  under  management\n\n## Climate Report 2020\n\nIn 2021, Amundi published its first Climate Report, meeting the requirements of:\n\n- \u00b7 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD report);\n- \u00b7 law on Energy Transition for Green Growth (Article 173).\n\n## Amundi's 'Say on Climate' initiative\n\nA  'Say  on  Climate'  is  a  resolution  presented  for  opinion added to the agenda of general meetings. It may be added by the company itself, or by its shareholders. It aims to get shareholders  to  vote  each  year  on  the  company's  climate policy  (i.e.  its  greenhouse  gas  emission  reduction  targets, and  the  policies  implemented  to  this  end)  and  to  ensure  a recurring dialogue on the subject.\n\nSince 2020, Amundi has supported the development of such resolutions,  particularly  for  companies  in  sectors  where  the most greenhouse gas (GHG) is emitted. Since 2021, Amundi has engaged a number of companies in sectors emitting the most greenhouse gas by routinely requesting the filing of a 'Say  on  Climate',  along  with  recommendations  on  their content.  In  2022,  Amundi  will  apply  a  voting  policy  on  the 'Say  on  Climate'  for  the  sectors  concerned  based  on  the credibility  of  the  strategy  in  line  with  criteria  specified  to issuers.\n\nIn  2022,  Amundi  will  apply  a  voting  policy  on  the  \"Say  on climate\" of the sectors concerned, which will be based on the\n\n## Amundi's 'Say on Climate'\n\nSince  its  creation,  responsible  investment  has  been  one  of Amundi's founding pillars, based on three convictions:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial players bear a social responsibility;\n- \u00b7 the  integration  of  Environmental,  Social  and  Governance dimensions in investment choices is a source of long-term performance;\n- \u00b7 ESG will be a growth driver for Amundi worldwide.\n\n(as of December 2021), committed to supporting the goal of zero  net  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  2050  or  earlier, consistent with global efforts to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C, and to  support  investment  aligned  with  this  goal.  This  initiative has  mobilised  the  asset  management  industry,  which  is showcasing  leading  transition  practices  and  implementing ambitious measures and investment strategies to achieve the net zero emissions goal. It also provides a forum on which to share best practice. The initiative is managed by six founding partner  investor  networks:  Asia  Investor  Group  on  Climate Change  (AIGCC),  CDP,  Ceres,  Investor  Group  on  Climate Change  (IGCC),  Institutional  Investors  Group  on  Climate Change  (IIGCC)  and  Principles  for  Responsible  Investment (PRI).\n\nThis  report  describes  the  governance  structure  in  place  to address  climate  issues,  risk  management  and  initiatives  to support transitions to a low-carbon economy. This report is available on the Amundi website.\n\ncredibility  of  their  strategy  and  evaluated  according  to criteria that will be specified to the issuers.\n\nThis  policy  will  take  into  account  the  search  for  energy independence  and  competitiveness  of  all  the  countries  in which Amundi invests, as well as the resulting social impacts.\n\nAs  a  pioneer  in  responsible  investment  and  a  committed player on climate issues, Amundi wishes to participate in the transparency movement concerning climate strategies, in line with  its  expectations  towards  the  companies  in  which  it invests.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  Amundi  has  decided  to  table  a  \"Say  on Climate\" resolution at its 2022 General Meeting as one of the ten commitments of its Ambition 2025 plan, which will be a world first for an asset manager.\n\nThis action allows it to reaffirm its conviction regarding the role  that  the  financial  sector  can  play  in  supporting  the transition  and  to  recall  the  principles  that  guide  its  actions, seeking a balance between ambition and pragmatism.\n\nAchieving a successful energy transition requires aligning key players on short, medium, and long-term strategies:\n\n- \u00b7 states, which  must  define  public,  industrial  and  fiscal policies as well as coherent regulations;\n- \u00b7 companies, which must design the technological solutions needed for the transition and plan for it;\n- \u00b7 the  financial  system, which  must  support  companies  by allocating the necessary capital.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nBased on its progress following its previous ESG plan (20182021) and especially aware of the efforts that still need to be made  to  ensure  that  all  sectors  and  companies  adopt  a strategy  of  alignment  with  the  Paris  Agreements, Amundi wishes to go further, on the theme of Climate.\n\nClimate change is undoubtedly the greatest challenge of our time.  Through  the  Glasgow  Financial  Alliance  for  Net  Zero, the financial sector has committed to a common goal: to use its  own  resources  to  support  a  low-carbon  global  economy and meet the objectives of the Paris Agreements.\n\nAware  of  the  challenges  and  the  means  required  for deployment, Amundi believes that shareholders must be fully informed  of  the  way  in  which  companies  intend  to contribute to this collective effort.\n\nAs a shareholder, Amundi therefore strongly encourages the companies  in  which  it  invests  to  submit  their  climate strategy to an advisory vote at their General Meetings.\n\nAs  a  listed  company,  Amundi  also  believes  that  it  has  a responsibility to be transparent with its shareholders about its climate strategy.\n\nIn  addition,  the  presentation  of  this  strategy,  its  ambitions and  its  annual  progress  is  an  exercise  that  we  believe  is essential to a balanced dialogue with shareholders.\n\nGiven  that  shareholders  may  have  multiple  motives  at  the time  of  such  a  vote,  we  state  that  in  the  event  that  the resolution is not adopted, the Board of Directors would use any  means  at  its  disposal  to  discuss  with  and  gather information  from  its  shareholders  regarding  the  reasons behind  their  decision  not  to  support  the  proposed  draft resolution, should  this  occur.  It  would  inform  all  its shareholders of the outcome of this process and put forward the measures to take into consideration these conclusions.\n\nTherefore, Amundi wishes to submit its climate strategy to the annual advisory vote at its 2022 General Meeting. From 2023,  Amundi  will  also  request  an  advisory  vote  on  the progress made in implementing this strategy.\n\n## Amundi's approach: a progressive and evolving process\n\nAware  of  its  responsibility  and  obligations  to  the  clients  it invests  for,  Amundi  must  adopt  a progressive  approach in setting  the  ambitions  of  a  long-term  climate  strategy, with intermediate steps.\n\nDetermining  a  company's  alignment  with  the  objectives  of the Paris Agreements remains a challenge to date. Scientific knowledge and methodologies continue to grow and evolve. The broad spectrum of asset classes and regions of the world in  which  Amundi  invests  does  not  yet  benefit  from  the analytical frameworks and data necessary for a comprehensive  action  plan.  Nevertheless,  the  means  can already be deployed.\n\nAmundi's climate strategy will therefore evolve in line with methodological developments, protocols for defining ambitions, regulatory frameworks and the data available for assessing alignment with a 2050 carbon neutrality objective.\n\nIn  addition,  recent  circumstances,  linked  to  the  conflict  in Ukraine, will have consequences for the evolution of energy systems. In particular, they require a strengthening of energy independence  in  Europe  as  in  all  the  countries  in  which Amundi invests. While it is too early to measure the impact, short-term adjustments in energy trajectories are likely  and will  influence  the  strategy  of  progressive  alignment  of investment portfolios.\n\nWhile the financial system can in no way substitute for action by  States  and  governments  to  combat  the  climate  crisis, Amundi nevertheless considers that it is part of the solution.\n\nBased  on  our  commitment  to  climate  issues  and  our responsibility  to  our  clients,  Amundi's  climate  strategy  is dynamic and steady, with shortand medium-term objectives.\n\nI\n\nIt is based on three convictions:\n\n- 1. The  need  for  a  scientific  approach : transition  is  a fundamental issue that calls for an industrial revolution based on both established scientific findings and the development of proven technological solutions.\n- 2. The need to support the transition of companies in which we invest rather than excluding them or divesting from them, a  method  which  must  be  restricted  to  businesses  that compromise this transition. The transition involves supporting  the  transformation  of  high  carbon-emitting business models into models of decarbonised development.\n- 3. The search for  social  and  economic  progress :  we  are  of the  opinion  that  the  transition  will  only  be  achieved  if  it  is deemed socially acceptable.\n\nIn addition to joining the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, Amundi is putting in place a Climate 2022-2025 Action Plan based on three key mechanisms:\n\n- 1. The  integration  of  climate  change  within  its  business operations, namely  the  resources  implemented  within  its organisation, the alignment of its employees, its governance and  its  commitments  to  reducing  direct  greenhouse  gas emissions.\n- 2. The integration of climate change within its management for  third  parties, describing  its  commitments  in  regard  to savings and investment solutions.\n- 3. The  integration  of  climate  change  within  its  actions targeting  the  businesses  in  which  it  is  invested ,  describing its  exclusion  policy,  shareholder  dialogue  and  policy  on  the use  of  voting  rights  in  order  to  accelerate  the  transition  of these businesses to a decarbonised business model associated with the objectives of the Paris agreements.",

Putting climate at the centre of governance, aligning and empowering\n\n## Role of the Board of Directors\n\nAt  the  end  of  2020,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to integrate social and environmental issues within its governance,  in  addition  to  putting  them  at  the  heart  of  its strategy.Accordingly, since May 2021 in particular, the Board has  been  analysing  the  progress  made  against  key  climate and ESG indicators on at least a quarterly basis. Concerned with developing their skills in this area, every year since 2020 members  of  the  Board  have  received  training  on  topics related to climate issues.\n\nLastly, for the first year in 2021, a one-day strategic seminar allowed members of the Board to focus on the strategy to be deployed in this area and to develop specific ways in which to implement the new 'Ambition 2025' Societal Plan.\n\nIn implementing governance, the Board is also supported by its Strategic and CSR Committee, chaired by an independent director  who  annually  reviews  the  progress  made  in  the annual  report  with  regard  to  social,  environmental  and societal  data,  including  that  related  to  climate  issues, constituting Chapter 3 of the Universal Registration Document.\n\nIn  2021,  and  through  its  work  on  strategy,  it  was  asked  to recommend  to  the  Board  of  Directors  the  adoption  of  the Group's plan relating to strategic climate and ESG ambitions.\n\nIn  the  future,  the  Strategic  and  CSR  Committee  will  also check the quality of Amundi's progress report on the climate and ESG strategy.\n\nGovernance implemented at Board level  is  also  part  of  the Company's internal organisation..\n\n## ESG & Climate Strategic Committee\n\nThis  monthly  committee,  chaired  by  the  Chief  Executive Officer, defines and validates the ESG and climate policy thus applicable  to  investments,  as  well  as  Amundi  Group's strategic guidelines in this area. It is intended to:\n\n- \u00b7 manage, monitor and validate Amundi's ESG and Climate strategy in terms of investment;\n- \u00b7 validate the strategic guidelines of the responsible investment policy and the voting policy;\n- \u00b7 manage the main strategic projects.\n\nThis committee draws upon the ESG Rating Committee,chaired by the Director of the ESG Department, in charge  of  the  responsible  investment  policy  and  associated methodologies,  and  on  the  Voting  Committee,  chaired  by  a member of senior management in charge of the voting policy.\n\n## Employee Alignment System, through a new compensation policy\n\nAs implementation of the climate strategy is only possible by raising  awareness  among  all  Amundi's  stakeholders,  an employee alignment system is currently being rolled out on Amundi's ESG and climate strategy.\n\nThus,  the  integration  of  ESG  and  climate  criteria  into  the remuneration policy will be done in two stages:\n\n\u00b7 as of 2022, and subject to approval by the General Meeting, the  performance  evaluation  and  remuneration  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer  will  take  into  account  ESG  and  CSR objectives up to 20%. In addition, the implementation of the Ambition  2025  plan  will  account  for  20%  of  the  criteria supporting  the  performance  share  plan  for  Amundi's 200 senior managers;\n\n- \u00b7  from  2022  onwards,  Amundi  will  progressively  integrate ESG objectives into the performance evaluation of sales staff and  portfolio  managers,  so  that  the  determination  of  their variable remuneration includes this dimension.\n\n## B. Setting objectives for reducing direct emissions\n\n## Aligning the CSR Policy with 2050 Net Zero Challenges\n\nAs  part  of  its  Ambition  2025  Plan,  Amundi  has  set  itself  two objectives for controlling its direct environmental footprint:\n\n- \u00b7 a 30%  reduction  in  its  CO2  emissions  from  energy consumption  (scopes  1  and  2)  and  from  business  travel (scope  3),  between  now  and  2025  in  comparison  with  the 2018 reference year;\n- \u00b7 elements relating to climate change and aiming to reduce the carbon footprint generated by purchasing (scope 3) will be included in the purchasing policy from 2022 and suppliers will be engaged in an approach to evaluate their CO2 emissions with a view to setting decarbonisation objectives.\n\n## C. Deploying the resources necessary to achieve the objectives\n\n## Deployment of resources dedicated to our ESG and climate commitments\n\nIn  a  context  where  the  methodological  and  analytical frameworks at industry level are still only partial, building up as and when scientific advances and technologies are made available for understanding the impact of climate change, the need  for  research  is  crucial  so  that  our  investment professionals can make informed decisions and so that climate issues can be incorporated into investment strategies.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAs such, Amundi has almost doubled the size of its ESG team over  the  past  three  years,  reaching  40  employees,  and  its target  is  to  increase  it  by  a  further  40%  in  2022,  thereby strengthening  its  research  programme  efforts  in  terms  of analysing  the  risks  and  opportunities  related  to  the  climate and  the  carbon  neutrality  objectives  at  macroeconomic scenario, sector and business level. Although it is already part of  our  ESG  sector  analysis  for  the  sectors  that  are  highly exposed to climate change, it remains dependent on available data and credible net zero trajectory methodologies. Amundi therefore allocates resources to continuing its research efforts in order to improve these analyses.\n\nTo supplement and complement this effort, Amundi invests massively  in  data  and  the  development  of  decision-making tools. In order for investment professionals to have access to the  information  necessary  to  make  informed  decisions, Amundi  has  significantly  expanded  its  data  coverage  by increasing  the  number  of  ESG  data  providers  from  4  to  14, thus giving access to 100 million items of non-financial data per month. Furthermore, Amundi has increased the IT budget fivefold over  the  last  three  years.  In  particular,  the management  tool  has  been  enhanced  by  more  efficient calculation  engines  and  a  set  of  new  climate  and  ESG functionalities.\n\nAmundi  is  strengthening  the  teams  both  in  terms  of  the integration  and  processing  of  non-financial  data  and  at  IT level, and plans to enhance analytical equipment on climate issues on a continuous basis by incorporating functionalities designed by our internal experts.\n\n## Continuous training of employees\n\nWhile  it  is  necessary  to  engage  Amundi's  entire  workforce and roles in the implementation of this climate strategy, the training  issue  is  key  and  should  complement  the  resource strengthening plans.\n\nIn  2021,  several  training  sessions  were  held  on  climate,  net zero and ESG  issues more  globally for investment professionals. An enhanced training offer was made available to all staff and implemented during the year.\n\nFrom 2022 onwards, a climate and ESG training programme created  with  Amundi  experts  and  covering  all  staff  will  be implemented,  with  modules  tailored  to  different  levels of expertise ,  to ensure that over time every employee receives bespoke climate and ESG training.\n\nIn addition, ensuring that senior executives and members of key  committees  have  the  necessary  climate  knowledge  is essential to enabling the robust, high-quality implementation of  a  climate  strategy.  Amundi  is  thus  developing  a  specific training programme for this audience.\n\n## Contribution to industry efforts\n\nAmundi  values  collaboration  with  its  peers  as  a  way  to contribute  to  best  practices  in  its  ecosystem.  Amundi  is\n\nI\n\nactively  involved  in  market  initiatives  that  are  essential  for improving market standards (1) .\n\nFurthermore,  Amundi is  committed  to  helping  its  clients  as they align their investment portfolios. To this end, Amundi is making  available  its  research (2) and  education  documents relating  to  the  climate  challenge  and  the  terms  of  net  zero trajectories, and is gradually offering its existing institutional clients  the  opportunity  to  manage  their  portfolios  with alignment in mind.\n\nLastly,  to  better  contribute  to  the  empowerment  of  its clients  on  climate  issues,  and  as  part  of  its  Ambition  2025 Plan, Amundi announced the launch of Alto Sustainability, a technological  analysis  and  decision-making  solution  for investors on environmental and societal issues.\n\n## D. Implementing this strategy in a fully transparent manner\n\nTransparency  remains  the  cornerstone  of  our  approach  to implementing  this  strategy.  All  our  policies  and  reports relating  to  ESG  and  the  climate  can  be  consulted  on  our website (3) .\n\n## Voting and responsible investment policies\n\nThe  manner  in  which  Amundi  integrates  the  climate challenge and ESG issues within its investment policy, as well as  within  its  use  of  voting  rights,  is  explained  in  various documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the  responsible  investment  policy  sets  out  Amundi's approach to responsible investment, including a description of  our  ESG  assessment  methodology,  which  comprises several  climate-related  components,  and  our  exclusion policy;\n- \u00b7 the  voting  policy (4) sets  out  the  principles  that  guide  our voting,  and  in  particular  how  we  integrate  both  ESG  and climate issues.\n\n## The Stewardship Report\n\nThis report , which meets the standards of the UK Stewardship Code (5) as  well  as  other  similar  codes  (in  particular  the Japanese,  Australian,  Canadian  and  Italian  codes),  provides an annual summary of actions implemented in the delegation of  management  for  third  parties  in  order  to  fully  enhance our  clients'  interests.  The  Engagement  Report  and  Voting Report (6) , both published annually, summarise the campaigns conducted  by  Amundi  in  its  shareholder  dialogue,  and  the use of its voting rights (votes also published on our website (7) ).\n\n## The Climate Report - TCFD\n\nThis annual report, which meets the requirements of the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures), describes  the  governance  structure  in  place  to  address climate  issues,  risk  management  and  initiatives  to  support transitions to a low-carbon economy.",

        "page_content": "## 2. Integrating climate change into its management for third parties\n\nAmundi works proactively to speed up the alignment of its investments  with  the  Net  Zero  by  2050  target,  thus contributing  to  the  collective  effort  required  for  the transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy.  Though  Amundi  has  a policy  of  excluding  issuers  exposed  to  certain  activities ,  its philosophy  is  clearly  to  accompany,  support  and  influence the transition of issuers in order to have a positive impact on the real economy. To do so, Amundi has developed and intends to continue developing a wide range of actions.\n\n## A. Systematically incorporating the assessment of transition into actively-managed open-ended funds\n\nAmundi  has  developed  its  own  ESG  rating  methodologies  to measure an issuer's non-financial performance, which specifically  include  climate-related  performance  indicators, selected according to sector and the materiality of their impact. Since  2021,  all (1) open-ended  active  management  funds  have incorporated  an  ESG  rating  target  which  exceeds  that  of  the investment universe.\n\nAs part of its Ambition 2025 Plan, Amundi announced that it wanted to further  integrate  non-financial  objectives  into  its active portfolio management in relation to the climate issue. Amundi  is  thus  working  on  the  implementation  of  a  rating methodology in order to assess, via a best-in-class approach, the  transition  efforts  of  issuers  in  relation  to  a  net  zero scenario, specifically through the effort made to decarbonise their  business  and  develop  their  green  activities. By  2025, the stated objective of the portfolios in question will be to have  a  better  environmental  transition  profile  than  their benchmark investment universe.\n\n## B. Developing Net Zero 2050 transition funds on major asset classes\n\nBy  2025,  Amundi  will  also  offer  open-ended  funds  for  all major asset classes asset classes, open-ended funds for the transition to the Net Zero 2050 objective. By providing an active  range  of  transition  funds,  Amundi  aims  to  guide savings towards investment solutions that will support issuer transitions, while offering our clients the means to align their portfolios  with  the  net  zero  commitments  they  have  made. Savers will thus have the choice of investing their savings in funds that fully incorporate this net zero transition objective. Amundi  is  also  continuing  to  develop  its  passive  climate management range.\n\n## C. Contributing to the energy transition financing effort\n\nA sharp increase in capital and R&D spending is needed if we are to reach the Net Zero by 2050 target. To contribute to this  financing,  Amundi  has,  over  the  past  three  years, accelerated  its  development  of  innovative  solutions  to finance climate-friendly developments  and  the  energy transition.  These  solutions  are  part  of  a  range  of  financial innovations  and  strategic  partnerships  with  major  public institutions  to  generate  both  supply  and  demand  for  new green  financing  projects.  At  the  end  of  2021,  green  bond solutions  totalled  \u20ac5.3m,  covering  developed  and  emerging markets.\n\nIn  2022,  Amundi  will  continue  its  efforts  to  develop  solutions aimed at investing in businesses or financing projects that make a positive environmental contribution.\n\n## 3. Integrating climate change into its actions targeting businesses in order to accelerate their transition towards to a carbon-free business model\n\nConvinced  that  we  must  support  the  transition  of  the businesses we invest in, rather than encouraging divestment, our  action  plan  for  issuers  is  based  on  the  rollout  of ambitious means in terms of 'engagement' , to help support them  and  to  back  the  necessary  transformations  towards decarbonised development models. Accordingly, the use of exclusion  policies  linked  to  climate  issues  is  considered relevant  when  such  policies  target  businesses  exposed  to activities that jeopardise the transition.\n\nAmundi applies a range of exclusion policies, which is one of the  pillars  of  its  managerial  responsibility.  They  consist  of excluding  businesses  that  do  not  comply  with  our  ESG policy, international agreements and internationally recognised  frameworks,  along  with  national  regulatory frameworks (2) . Moreover, Amundi implements targeted sector exclusions  specific  to  industries  that  compromise  the achievement of net zero objectives and the environment in general, through its shareholder investment.\n\n## Coal\n\nAs  coal  is  the  largest  single  contributor  to  human-induced climate  change,  Amundi  has  implemented  a  sector-specific policy on thermal coal since 2016, resulting in the exclusion of  certain  companies  and  issuers.  Every  year  since  2016, Amundi has gradually strengthened its coal exclusion policy. In 2020, Amundi further extended its exclusion policy to any company  developing  or  planning  to  develop  new  thermal coal operating capacities.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

    {
        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAccordingly, today Amundi (1) excludes:\n\n- \u00b7 businesses developing or planning to develop new thermal coal  capacity  (producers,  extractors,  power  stations, transport infrastructure);\n- \u00b7 companies that make more than 25% of their income from thermal coal mining;\n- \u00b7 companies extracting 100 MT or more of thermal coal with no intention of making reductions;\n- \u00b7 all companies whose income from thermal coal mining and thermal coal-powered electricity generation exceeds 50% of the total income without analysis;\n- \u00b7 all coal-fired electricity generation  and  coal  mining companies with a threshold of between 25% and 50% and a degraded energy transition score.\n\nAmundi is committed to being coal-free by 2030 in OECD countries  and  by  2040  in  other  countries.  To  this  end, Amundi  has  committed  all  the  businesses  in  its  coalexposed portfolios to provide a gradual exit plan by 2030/ 2040,  depending  on  the  location  of  their  activities.  This engagement will continue and will be complemented by the addition of voting rights, in line with the progress made in terms of this dialogue.\n\n## Unconventional hydrocarbons\n\nFurthermore, Amundi  is  committed  to  publishing  its exclusion  policy  for  the  oil  and  gas  sector,  following  the announcement of its intention to divest from unconventional hydrocarbons (2) by  the  end  of  2022  across  all  active strategies where Amundi has full discretion.\n\n## A. Establishing an active dialogue to speed up and further urge the transformation of models\n\nA  major  pillar  in  our  vision  as  a  responsible  investor, engagement occurs via discussions between analysts and the businesses  in  which  we  are  invested  throughout  the  year, and through individual or collaborative engagement actions on  major  sustainable  development  issues,  in  order  to promote  real  change  and  the  shift  towards  an  inclusive, sustainable  and  low-carbon  economy.  Global  warming  and the  deterioration  of  ecosystems,  which  threaten  to  cause destructive  chain  reactions,  are  a  priority  theme  in  our engagement campaigns.\n\nAmundi engaged with 472 and 547 businesses respectively in  2020 and 2021 on climate issues. As part of its Ambition 2025  Plan,  Amundi  will  begin  a  cycle  of  engagement  with 1,000 additional businesses by 2025. As part of this dialogue, Amundi requests that businesses publish a detailed climate strategy based on specific indicators and objectives for each carbon  emission  scope,  and  on  the  corresponding  capital expenditure (investment plan).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  commitment,  since  2019  Amundi  has included the consideration of climate issues in the exercise of its  voting  rights  as  one  of  its  priority  themes,  based  on  the conviction  that  the  consideration  of  these  challenges  by Boards of Directors is essential for the sound management of a company.\n\nIn  this  sense,  Amundi  supports  the  resolutions  that  aim  to implement better reporting and transparency on businesses' climate strategies.\n\nThe  voting  policy  aims  to  check  that  the  compensation policies  and/or  the  compensation  reports  submitted  for voting include a non-financial component. For businesses in the  energy  sector  (oil  and  gas,  power  utilities  and  mining companies),  a  climate  criterion  must  be  included  in  the variable compensation parameters.\n\nIt also consists of voting against the discharge of the Board or  the  Management,  or  against  the  re-election  of  the Chairman  and  certain  Directors  within  a  scope  of  targeted businesses  excluded  from  the  investment  universe  covered by  Amundi's  Responsible  Investment  Policy  or  with  an insufficient  climate  strategy  despite  operating  in  sectors  in which the transition is essential.\n\n## B. Promoting a socially acceptable energy transition\n\nAmundi believes that the transition to a low-carbon economy must  be  inclusive  and  sustainable.  We  must  thus  consider the social impact as well as the impact on preserving natural capital. Given that the impact analysis for these issues is still in  its  infancy,  Amundi  has  decided  to  dedicate  specific engagement  programmes  to  these  themes  based  on proprietary research.\n\nIn addition,  Amundi  co-founded  ' Investors  for  a  Just Transition ', the first investor coalition on the just transition, in order to support collaborative efforts to rise to this complex challenge.\n\nAmundi also launched two major engagement programmes around  the  circular  economy  and  biodiversity  (as  well  as related  research)  to  raise  awareness  of  this  topic,  their exposure  and  impact,  and  to  ask  issuers  to  set  out  a  solid strategy (3) .\n\nThe  social  dimension  of  the  energy  transition  remains  an important  focus  for  Amundi,  which  will  continue  to  invest resources in terms of both research and commitment.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAmundi  will  continue  to  adjust  its  climate  strategy  in  the coming years, according to the scientific reference scenarios and in close connection with its clients' objectives, both by investing  in  solutions  to  accelerate  the  transition  and  by progressively aligning its portfolios with the 2050 neutrality objective.\n\n(2) See Glossary.\n\n(3) See commitment report: https://www.amundi.com/institutional/Responsible-investment-documentation.\n\nI",

The Amundi teams work closely with each of the partner networks in  identifying  the  needs  and  the  most  appropriate  resources and services for their clients. For example, nearly 130 people at Amundi in  France  are  dedicated  to  the  relationships  with  the four long-standing partners.\n\nBeyond the partner networks, Amundi is developing a growing business  with  other  French  and  foreign  distributor  networks (banks,  insurers,  asset  managers, IAMA networks  (IFAs) (1) , digital  platforms,  etc.)  which  most  often  distribute  savings solutions  built  by  Amundi  using  open  architecture  and intended  for  their  clients.  More  than  200  Amundi  vendors serve these clients in 27 countries.\n\nAmundi's dedicated teams responsible for partner networks, such as  those  in  charge  of  third-party  distributors,  deploy  their support and proposals, taking into account the variety of the needs  of  the  various  client  segments  specific  to  each network.  They  work  closely  with  their  correspondents  on identifying the investment vehicles and services that are best suited to the needs of their clients.\n\n## Know the needs of individual clients\n\nAmundi  maintains  an  active  regulatory  and  competitive watch centrally from Paris, as well as locally  in  each  of  the markets where its partner and distributor client  networks  roll out  their  offers.  The  objective  is  to  remain  informed  of  local developments  on  each  of  its  markets  in  terms  of  savings behaviour and potential new savings solutions made possible by  regulatory  developments,  and  to  monitor  the  offerings  of competitors  in  order  to  help  our  contacts  to  offer  their private clients the products that best meet their needs.\n\nFor  instance,  the  topic  of  responsible  savings  is  receiving increasing  interest  from  savers.  For  the  past  two  years, Amundi  has  thus  conducted  an  annual  survey  on  investors and  responsible  investment.  This  study  lets  us  identify  the expectations  of  private  individuals  and  use  operational elements to guide our action.\n\n## Supporting our partner networks and third-party distributor networks in France and abroad\n\nFor  Amundi,  developing  the  expertise  of  the  teams  of advisors  of  our  partner  networks  when  it  comes  to  our savings products and solutions is a priority. In the particular healthcare  context  of  2021,  Amundi  continued  to  adapt  its support  system  for  networks  and  their  clients  by  favouring digital  formats,  particularly  web  conferencing.  The  teams  in charge of distribution networks have adapted their communication plan, by providing numerous web conference training sessions and by setting up regular videoconference calls  with  their  clients.  Online  awareness  campaigns  were also  deployed  with  client  advisors  and  all  events  were digitalised.  For  instance,  the  web  conferences  intended  for clients of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Regional Banks were attended by nearly 100,000  people,  an  interactive  format  that  is particularly well suited to the current health context.\n\nAmundi also offers its third-party distributor clients support, allowing them to boost the skills of their advisors and to share with their clients their views on the financial markets and their recommendations  for  savings  solutions  tailored  to  their needs: web conferences, digital training tools (in the form of a game or modules associated with certification), marketing support and help in organising their distribution networks.\n\n## Launch of a 'Services and Solutions' business unit to support third-party distributors\n\nThe needs of our third-party distributor clients are changing in line with the major trends seen in the market: pressure on margins,  digitalisation  of  client  journeys  and  relationships, increased  regulatory  requirements,  deeper    client  support requirements,  and  of  course  awareness  of  the  need  to incorporate an ESG dimension into the solutions offered.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

This platform makes it possible to optimise open architecture by  using  Amundi's  expertise  in  risk  management  and selection.  It  complements  the  services  offered  by  our subsidiary Fund Channel along the entire fund distribution chain;\n- \u00b7 technological tools in line with the need to outsource certain services (management, client experience, training, etc.);\n- \u00b7 development of a responsible offer.\n\n## Specific actions carried out with networks to promote responsible finance\n\nSince  2020,  the  challenging  health  situation  has  increased citizens' sensitivity to social and environmental considerations, in all  areas  including  savings.  Regulatory  changes  are  also intensifying. In 2021,  Amundi  broadened  its  range  of responsible solutions with the launch of new ranges for LCL: 'LCL impact Climat', a selection of funds to act for the good of the planet, and respond to environmental challenges and 'LCL  Impact  Soci\u00e9tal  et  solidaire',  a  selection  of  funds  to reconcile values and financial investment. A range of labelled funds has been developed for Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, finding their place  within  the  new  Responsible  Funds  range  launched  in February 2021.This offer consists of funds with environmental themes  or  that  have  been  awarded  either  SRI  or  Greenfin certification, and covers the various money market, bond and equity  asset  classes.  New  discussions  have  begun  with  a view  to  expanding  this  range  by  introducing  funds  with  a social theme in the near future. Responsible investment was also given priority at events organised by Amundi or in which Amundi participated and spoke throughout the year.\n\nIn 2021, many distributors set up responsible ranges for their clients.  Amundi  supported  them  in  this  process  by  helping them  to  define  their  range,  by  labelling  new  funds  and  by providing  regular  support  on  regulatory  developments  in Europe.\n\nI\n\n## Launch of the 'Engag\u00e9e et responsable' committed and responsible range for Cr\u00e9dit Agricole\n\nIn  2021,  alongside  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group,  Amundi expanded  its  range  of  solutions  with  the  launch  of  a  new committed  and  responsible  range  for  Regional  Banks.  This innovative,  meaningful  range  capitalises  on  all  of  Amundi's areas of expertise (equities, themes, structured funds, etc.). It is  accessible to all clients (retail, asset managers, companies), simple  and  educational.  It  relies  on  essential  drivers  such  as support  for  the  French  economy,  contribution  to  social changes, participation in climate and environmental challenges, or sustainable real estate.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  solutions  offered,  this  launch  included major  dedicated  support  and  communication  tools,  all  of which were digitised: product videos, podcasts, sales pitches, an educational guide, a communication kit for advisers, and so  on.  In  2021,  more  than  \u20ac1  billion  was  collected  on  this range from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Regional Bank clients.\n\n## Product validation\n\nThe  Products  and  Services  Committee,  a  decision-making and  governance  body  chaired  each  month  by  the  Head  of Marketing and Products, formally validates the creation and development of investment vehicle ranges and the associated  services  offered  by  Amundi.  No  product  can  be marketed without the favourable opinion of the Risk,  Legal and Compliance business lines represented on this committee. Approval requests to supervisory authorities are then  completed  before  the  teams  responsible  for  the product's  distribution  deploy  all  the  necessary  resources  in conjunction with the partner networks.\n\n## Measuring client satisfaction\n\nAmundi is mindful of the opinions of  its  distributors  and  in 2021 it continued to regularly measure the satisfaction of its distribution  networks  through  the  client  recommendation index  (IRC).  In  2021,  campaigns  were  conducted  in  seven countries,  with  nine  partner  networks:  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Regional  Banking  and  LCL  networks  in  France,  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and UniCredit in Italy, KB and Unicredit in the Czech Republic, UniCredit in Slovakia and, for the first time in 2021, the Bawag PSK network in Austria and Sabadell in Spain. This satisfaction survey carried out among our partner networks provides operational elements to guide our action. The CRI survey conducted by Amundi on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and LCL networks  in  2021  shows  very  positive  levels  and  ongoing significant  progress:  the  CRI  for  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  rose  from 31 in 2020 to 48 in 2021, and for LCL from 65 to 76.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3.2 Establishing relationships of trust with our corporate and institutional clients and offering them solutions tailored to their needs\n\nInstitutional  clients  (Sovereign,  Institutional,  Corporate)  expect an  asset  manager  to  have  a  detailed  and  thorough understanding  of  their  specific  needs  and  to  provide appropriate  solutions,  all  within  a  relationship  of  trust  built over time.\n\n## Understanding the needs of institutional clients\n\nIn  2021,  the  Institutional  Division  acquired  a  number  of external studies. In addition, specific studies are carried out with  clients  and  prospective  clients.  The  annual  Amundi CREATE  survey  of  European  Pension  Funds,  launched  in 2014, was repeated. It was conducted with over 150 pension funds,  covering  the  challenges  faced  by  defined  benefit funds,  asset  allocation  in  times  of  low  profitability,  and  the progress made by ESG in investments.\n\n## Supporting our institutional clients\n\nIn the  still uncertain  health  context  of  2021,  Amundi maintained  its  support  for  its  clients,  prioritising  digital formats for events, communication and content. For the first time, the annual investment forum was fully digital, allowing a larger audience to attend. This year's theme was 'Alternative Roads: Mirage or Regime Shift'.\n\n## Specific actions to promote responsible finance\n\nMany actions were undertaken in 2021 to promote Amundi's responsible  finance  approach  and  its  solutions.  Specific training courses on this topic were organised for our clients, including  the  annual Executive  Training  Programme on  the theme  'Net  Zero  Objective'.  Amundi  is  prompt  to  promote the  responsible  finance  theme  whenever  it  communicates and  when  organising  events.  Awareness  of  responsible finance is also raised through the publication of documentary series, research papers, and so on. In this year when COP26 was  held, Amundi  specifically organised a worldwide roadshow entitled 'On the Road to Glasgow' to explain the ambitions  of  this  summit,  and  to  present  our  climate solutions, also launching a series of 'ESG Thema' publications tackling the main issues in this sphere.\n\nAmundi  also  continued  to  expand  its  range  of  responsible investment  solutions  for  its  institutional  clients  with,  in particular, the extension of the ESG Improvers campaign and the  launch  of  the  Amundi  Just  Transition  for  Climate strategy,  while  continuing  to  promote  previously  launched products  and  solutions  (range  of  ESG  ETFs,  Amundi  Social Bond Fund, specific green bond funds).\n\nLastly, in order to help its institutional clients in their work to promote  the  energy  transition,  Amundi  continued  to promote  its  partnership  with  AIIB,  a  benchmark  tool  for assessing  the  risks  associated  with  climate  change  in  line with the objectives of the Paris agreement.\n\n## Quality of client service\n\nAmundi offers client service that meets the expectations and needs of its clients, whether in setting up a dedicated fund or mandate,  or  as  part  of  the  operational,  administrative  and reporting aspects of its day-to-day client relationships.\n\nThe Client Service Department stands behind the quality of the service rendered, the responsiveness and the honouring of the Group's commitments to its clients and partners through its  everyday  interactions  with  all  the  links  in  the  Amundi value chain. The company carries out a continuous effort to improve the quality of its services. To date, this discipline and ongoing  involvement  have  meant  that  Amundi  receives  a very small number of complaints.\n\nAmundi is committed to handling complaints as promptly as possible and to providing consistent and systematic quality in  its  answers.  Where  necessary,  the  implementation  of action plans is monitored  by  the  Risk  Management Department's  Permanent  Control  team.  The  complaints monitoring process is part of the set of monthly performance indicators.  More  than  90%  of  complaints  in  2021  related  to the quality of the offering (dissemination of Net Asset Values or  reporting),  with  the  remainder  linked  to  one-off  or specific issues.\n\nIn 2021, Client Services introduced a new  product implementation  monitoring  tool  to  enhance  the  quality  of service provided to our institutional clients.\n\nMoreover, Amundi again achieved ISAE 3402 certification, an internationally  recognised  standard  for  the  quality  of  a  risk management  policy, through the assessment of the operational  relevance  and  efficiency  of  its  key  controls pertaining to services provided to clients, thereby reflecting ongoing rigour in process organisation and application.\n\n## Measuring the satisfaction of institutional clients\n\nAmundi  continues  its  efforts  to  improve  the  quality  of  its services  by  measuring  the  satisfaction  of  its  institutional clients,  by  means of client satisfaction questionnaires. Once analysed, the feedback obtained allows corrective actions to be  rolled  out,  ensuring  the  continuous  improvement  of services  provided  to  Amundi's  institutional  clients.  These questionnaires  include  the  Client  Recommendation  Index (CRI) measurement, launched in 2019 for our major European clients, and also extended to Asia in 2021. This tool is now in place for the long term.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

In this way,  the  Risk  and  Compliance  functions  help strengthen the reliability of Amundi's products and services and help us meet our obligations to our clients.\n\n## Compliance\n\nThe  Compliance  teams  play  an  essential,  preventive  role ensuring compliance with regulations, Good Conduct Codes and professional standards, which they safeguard. They look after the clients' interest, ensure the integrity of the market and the independence of our activities.\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  that  clients  are  protected,  Compliance validates all newly created products and  substantial modifications  of  existing  products  above  and  beyond  the regulatory requirements. For partner networks, this responsibility also extends to sales and marketing documents intended for  the  networks'  clients  or  prospects  and  for  the advisors. For client complaints, the Compliance Department ensures  that  all  complaints  are  handled  and  processed  in accordance with the law, regulations and procedures.\n\nTo  conduct  its  mission,  the  Compliance  Department  has formalised  a  'Set  of  Compliance  Procedures'  detailing  the compliance rules that apply, particularly those laid out in the Code of Professional Ethics, the Compliance Manual and the Anti-Money  Laundering  Manual,  and  that  are  carried  out through  written  procedures.  This  set  of  procedures  is distributed to local managers and applies to all Group entities.\n\n## Key Compliance highlights of 2021\n\nFollowing an investigation into trades executed in 2014 and 2015  on  the  Euro  Stoxx  50  futures  market  (FESX)  by  two former Amundi employees (both of whom have since been dismissed),  the  AMF  Enforcement  Committee  sanctioned these former employees and two Amundi Group companies for  various  failures  in  compliance  relating  to  the  trades  in question, and for weaknesses in the internal control system, as the failures were not properly detected.\n\nOrganisation  of  Compliance  has  since  been  amended,  with the  review  and  implementation  of  new  first-level  controls within  Management  and  Trading.  A  dedicated  Compliance team in charge of market integrity controls for Trading has now integrated Amundi Interm\u00e9diation. Amundi AM's central Market  Integrity  team  now  includes  a  Monitoring  team  in charge of creating controls and an 'Advisory' team in charge of  defining  procedures  or  policies  in  collaboration  with business units, and disseminating these procedures to Group entities.\n\nAmundi's  new  entities  (Sabadell  Asset  Management  and Amundi-BOC Wealth Management) use the Actimize market integrity  monitoring  tool,  and  have  received  training  in  the said tool.\n\nAction  plans  have  been  rolled  out  at  the  first  and  second levels to help strengthen the existing third-party knowledge base  (clients,  counterparties,  suppliers,  issuers,  etc.),  to ensure  operational  and  technical  monitoring  and  to  share information,  expectations  or  guidelines  as  best  as  possible. These  Action  Plans  continued  in  2021  to  achieve  the expected results.\n\nThe ISO 37001/2016 certification of Amundi's anti-corruption scheme was also renewed.\n\n## Regulatory training\n\n'Compliance' culture is an essential aspect of best practice in asset  management and contributes to Amundi's reputation. It  is  structured  around  four  themes:  respect  for  market integrity,  financial  security,  including  international  sanctions and  anti-money  laundering/combating  the  financing  of terrorism, professional ethics and the prevention of fraud and corruption. All employees  (permanent  and  fixed-term, international volunteering, work-study or equivalent depending  on  local  legislation)  of  Group  entities  in  France and abroad are affected.\n\nTraining  by  e-learning  was  prioritised,  with  the  rollout  of courses  on  ethics,  International  Sanctions,  GDPR,  FATCA, market abuse, and fraud prevention.\n\n## Regulatory training provided in 2021 (France scope)\n\n| % employees trained                   | 113    |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|\n| Number of employees trained           | 2,655  |\n| Number of training hours              | 8,934  |\n| Number of training sessions           | 16,850 |\n| Number of training hours per employee | 3.36   |\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## Ethics\n\nCompliance with ethical standards is an essential element of the quality of service that Amundi is committed to delivering to its  clients.  All  Group  employees and managers undertake to  comply  strictly  with  the  applicable  ethical  standards  in accordance with the law, and with the regulations and codes of conduct in force.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2020, the rules of procedure for Amundi's 13  French  entities,  the  IT  charter  and  the  associated Compliance Ethics annex, were updated. A strategic priority for  the  Group,  ethics  was  the  subject  of  an  awareness  and ownership  campaign  across  all  entities  in  Q4  2020  to strengthen employees' ethical culture. The training initiative launched in August 2021 on four ethical themes (introduction to ethical culture, the primacy of client interests, professional standards and practices, protecting the Group), helped boost the scheme. A knowledge check quiz entitled 'Ethics and you' was proposed in Q4 2021.\n\nFollowing  the  update  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  Code  of Conduct, Amundi updated its Code of Conduct in Q4 2021. First published in 2019, the Amundi Code of Conduct aims to guide  employees  in  their  daily  actions,  decisions  and conduct,  in  full  compliance  with  the  law,  ethical  rules  and Amundi's values. It is composed of 27 themes, presented in four  sections:  'Client  and  supplier  relations',  'Social  and environmental', 'Anti-corruption' and 'Protecting the Group and  its  reputation',  the  Code  sets  out  the  behaviours  to adopt,  as  well  as  those  to  avoid.  Each  factsheet  includes examples to illustrate the principles. It applies to all members of  the  company,  whether  they  are  directors,  managers  or employees, whatever their position and role within Amundi, in  France  or  abroad.  Some  specific  features  may  apply locally.  It is available  to  the  public,  shared  with  our stakeholders (employees, suppliers, clients, investors, etc.) in particular  via  the  Amundi  website  and  in  the  HR  section  of the Viamundi France intranet.\n\n## Whistle-blowing\n\nAs part of its commitment to preventing unethical, criminal and delinquent  behaviour  and  its  legal  obligations  in  this  area, Amundi  introduced  a  tool  for  'whistleblowers'  in  October 2020.  This  tool,  BKMS,  makes  it  possible  to  support  any company employee, external employee or supplier wishing to exercise their right to alert in accordance with the law.\n\nThis  tool,  also  deployed  within  all  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group entities,  guarantees  an  environment  of  strict  confidentiality that allows the facts to be exposed and discussed with the person  designated  to  handle  whistle-blowing via a  secure dialogue box, while protecting the whistle-blower's identity.\n\n## Risk management\n\nControlling  risks  and  honouring  its  obligations  are  basic  to the  relationship  of  trust  that  Amundi  has  with  its  clients. Amundi's Risk Management function is highly integrated, in order to give the Group a consistent, systematic approach to measuring and monitoring risks for all its activities.\n\nThe  function  is  based  on  a  worldwide  online  business  line organisation  and  the  sharing  of  methodologies  and  tools common  to  all  Risk  teams.  The  organisation  and  controls deployed  evolve  regularly  to  ensure  a  risk  management continually  adapted  to  the  Company's  challenges  and provide  customers  with  the  assurance  that  our  explicit commitments and compliance with regulatory obligations are being  implemented.  Investments  are  audited  by  staff  who are  independent  of  fund  management  personnel.  It  is integrated  with  Amundi's  Business  Support  and  Audit Division,  whose  main  mission  is  to  protect  the  client's interest. Its role is to ensure, through a dedicated information system, that the investment constraints requested by clients or required by regulations are observed.\n\nRisk control personnel install and monitor an internal system to regulate management processes, in three phases:\n\n- \u00b7 devising,  in  systematic  fashion,  internal  control  rules  and regulations specific to each investment strategy, based on a preliminary identification of the risk factors that underlie performance;\n- \u00b7 overseeing on a daily basis the management actions taken, to  check  that  the  investment  decisions  and  the  positions in the portfolios are in keeping with the management rules and the objectives sought;\n- \u00b7 evaluating  ex  post  the  quality  of  the  management processes,  based  on  independent  measurements  made using proven methodologies.\n\nTo  ensure  its  adherence  to  principles  of  fiduciary  duty, Amundi prepares and sends two documents to its clients, the prospectus and the KIID (Key Investor Information Document), describing the conditions under which the fund is managed, as well as the relationship between yield and the level  of  risk  associated  with  such  management.  Several indicators  reflecting  the  risk  level  of  funds  are  included  in these documents. They are calculated independently by the Risk Management Department.\n\nAmundi regularly updates its risk management system in the light of new  regulations, new  activities and  market challenges.  More  specifically,  for  2021,  as  part  of  its  ESG commitment, Amundi strengthened the framework of its risk monitoring  system  to  ensure  that  constraints  linked  to French and European regulations and labels were taken into account, in the interest of its retail and institutional clients.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

These risks and  opportunities  associated  with  ESG  will  vary  depending on  the  country,  the  business  sector  and  characteristics specific to an issuer, such as size and geographical footprint. In this respect,  risk  management  strategies,  including investment  and  risk  rules,  are  established  individually  for each  investment  process  or  investment  process  group\n\nmanaged  by  an  investment  team  or  office.  This  formalised approach aims to ensure that  the  Company  meets  both  its explicit  and  implicit  commitments  (including  ESG).  A  risk strategy  is  used  to  identify  and  monitor  all  risks  (ESG investment  risk,  liquidity  risk,  credit  risk,  operational  risk, etc.)  associated  with  an  investment  process  or  group  of investment  processes  from  the  perspective  of  investors  or from the Company's point of view.\n\n## 3.3.4 Data protection (GDPR)\n\nIn  a  context  where  everybody communicates personal data in  an  online  environment,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  has drawn up a charter for using its clients' personal data based on five principles: usefulness and loyalty, ethics, transparency and education, security and clients'  control  over  the  use  of their  data.  The  charter  provides  all  employees  with  a reference  framework  both  in  France  and  internationally.  It underlines  the  commitments  made  by  the  Group  and  the good practices that need to be observed.\n\nAmundi  provides  its  clients  with  information  on  the implementation of rights and procedures for processing the personal data it collects.\n\nAs an employer, Amundi guarantees that the personal data of its employees will be protected and that their private life will  be  respected  by  means  of  an  employee  charter.  A charter for job applicants is also available.\n\nI\n\nSince  2020,  Amundi  has  increased  staff  awareness  of  the protection of personal data by reminding internal auditors of the  obligations  related  to  these  regulations  so  that  they  can systematically monitor compliance with this regulation during their audits. Amundi, which implemented a training module on the  processing  of  personal  data  as  soon  as  the  regulation took effect, made it compulsory for all staff in 2021.\n\nIn the extended context of the Covid-19 health crisis, Amundi remains particularly attentive:\n\n- \u00b7 protection  of  employees'  and  visitors'  personal  data processed in order to comply with the protocol defined by the Government;\n- \u00b7 security  of  transactions  carried  out  remotely  on  personal data.",

There  is  a  focus  on  internal  staff,  which allows  for  long-term  investment  in  the  company's  human resources.  Amundi's  employment  policy  must  also  allow employees to develop skills and maintain their employability over the long term.\n\n## Change in headcount\n\nThe change in the Group's headcount reflects the continuation of its development strategy.\n\nAt  the  end  of  December  2021,  Amundi  had  a  total  of 4,811 internal FTEs, i.e. a net increase of 184 FTEs since the end of 2020, reflecting:\n\n- \u00b7 the  international  development  strategy:  External  growth with the acquisition of SABAM in Spain, organic growth with\n\nthe creation of a JV in China with BOC WM and finally the full  consolidation  (at  the  beginning  of  2021)  of  Fund Channel,  a  subsidiary  with  a  dedicated  distribution platform;\n\n- \u00b7 the creation of the new Amundi Technology business unit dedicated  to  technology  services  (+110  FTEs  including Anatec);\n- \u00b7 strengthening  of  our  activities with high development potential  in  particular,  management  of  real  and  alternative assets,  passive  management  and  responsible  investment (ESG) (~+ 25 FTEs) and in our support functions (~+ 20 FTEs).\n\nIn total, we recruited 439 people and recorded 277 departures. Recruitment on a permanent contract basis is  split  between  France  (37%)  and  abroad  (63%).  Support activities in terms of FTEs accounted for 46%, mainly in IT/ middle office.\n\nThe  resignation  rate  stands  at  1.7%  for  2021  in  France  and 6.1% internationally. Recruitment was supported by a positive employer brand overall.\n\nYoung people under the age of 30 comprise 42.4% of new hires.\n\n| Permanent/fixed-term recruitment  (in number)   |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Worldwide                                       |    439 |\n| of which France                                 |    152 |\n| Permanent/fixed-term departures  (in number)    |    277 |\n| - of which permanent                            |    248 |\n| - of which fixed-term                           |     29 |\n| - of which France                               |     74 |\n\n## Internal mobility\n\nFor  Amundi, internal  mobility  is  a  priority  tool  for  adapting employment:\n\n- \u00b7 functional mobility to anticipate changes in business lines and  encourage  employees  to  move  towards  developing sectors;\n- \u00b7 geographical  mobility  to  support  the  development  of certain places of business and promote cross-functionality between countries.\n\nIn  2021,  despite  a  difficult  public  health  situation,  Amundi recorded 185 (1) internal transfers and 76 transfers internationally.  Our  HR  policies  and  tools  aim  to  support employees,  with  special  monitoring  for  those  who  change business  line,  and  to  enhance  all  the  company's  business lines.  Management  Committees  comprised  of  the  human resources  managers  of  each  business  line  regularly  review the positions that need to be filled and the employees being transferred,  thereby  promoting  the  coordination  of  supply and  demand.  In  terms  of  individual  support,  in  addition  to interviews and career management, Amundi makes a virtual coaching  tool  (JobMaker)  available  to  employees,  which helps them prepare their personal development.\n\nTo develop international mobility, a Mobility Committee has been set  up  specifically  at  international  level,  thereby  encouraging better management of the Group's various employment pools.\n\n## Training\n\nProfessional training is an important driver for the company's development.  It  implements  a  set  of  actions  with  the following objectives, which are directly linked to its strategic ambitions:\n\n- \u00b7 to maintain a high level of performance in the position by ensuring  a  match  between  the  activities,  responsibilities and skill level required for each employee;\n- \u00b7 to  develop  employability  regarding  professional  projects and the company's needs.\n\nThe skills development plan is set annually to meet individual and  collective  needs  in  line  with  the  company's  structuring projects  and  the  regulatory  and  technical  developments  in each business line.\n\nAs  a  contributor  to  both  development  and  commitment, professional mobility is monitored on an individual basis and supported  through  dedicated  training.  Similarly,  employees returning  from  long-term  leave  are  trained  without  prior arbitration  and  over  the  course  of  the  year  as  soon  as  the need is reported.\n\nIn  2021,  the  company  continued  to  deliver  a  high  level  of training  while  capitalising  on  the  lessons  learned  from  the health crisis period. Thus, the courses proposed were mainly held  remotely  with  solid  technical  solutions  and  tailored teaching methods.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

In October 2021, this programme was supplemented by a new development scheme (Amundi Management Spirit - Remote), whose principles are based on our management convictions, in  line  with  Amundi's  four  values,  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.'s human  project  and  the  social  dimensions  of  our  ESG convictions.  This  system,  which  is  compulsory  for  Amundi France  managers,  is  based  on  questioning  managerial practices  as  an  initial  driver  for  development.  It  also promotes  peer-based  sharing  to  co-construct  solutions tailored to issues, and accounting for individual needs. Made up  of  short  modules  to  integrate  operational  constraints,  it offers  a  self-assessment  questionnaire,  a  virtual  class  to strengthen managerial practice in hybrid mode, and a hybrid workshop  to  co-construct  a  team  charter  involving  each manager  and  their  team  as  they  create  their  own  rules  of operation for the collective.\n\nIn  addition,  a  rich  offer  of  individual  and  collective  support (classic  coaching,  boosted  coaching,  feedback  workshops, co-development workshops) is made available to round off this approach.\n\nThe specific ESG training offer was bolstered in 2021 with the addition  of  specialist  business  training  (particularly  in  the property  sector).  The  range  of  ESG  certifications  has  been extended  (CFA,  SFAF,  AF  in  the  near  future)  to  allow  the employees concerned to acquire a high level of competence in  the  integration  of  ESG  criteria  within  their  professional practice and with clients.\n\nIn 2022, two major priorities will be agreed: the development of the managerial support offer via the rollout of our 'Amundi Management Spirit' philosophy in France and internationally, and the continued enrichment of ESG training programmes with the  creation  of  an  e-learning  module  focusing  on  Amundi's convictions.  This  training  will  be  provided  to  all  Amundi employees and is compulsory for all new hires.\n\n| Training (excluding regulatory training)                |   2021 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| % of employees trained                                  |  67    |\n| In France                                               |  67    |\n| International                                           |  66    |\n| Average number of training actions per employee trained |   3.1  |\n| In France                                               |   2.01 |\n| International                                           |   4.13 |\n| Average number of training hours per employee trained   |  13.91 |\n| In France                                               |  15.17 |\n| International                                           |  12.71 |\n\n## Compensation\n\nAmundi's compensation policy is based on three pillars that combine individual and collective performance. It takes into account the economic environment, competitiveness and the labour  market,  factors  that  may  differ  from  one  country  to another. It is also tailored to local situations and regulations. The  compensation  policy  is  reviewed  annually  by  the Compensation  Committee  chaired  by  an  independent director and  composed  of  directors  that  are  either independent or who do not hold an executive function within Amundi.  It  complies  with  regulatory  standards  (AIFMD/ UCITS V, MIFID, CRDV and SFDR).\n\nThe key components of Amundi's compensation scheme are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a fixed salary in  line with duties and responsibilities, taking into account specific local and market conditions;\n- \u00b7 variable compensation which breaks down into an annual bonus  determined  by  the  manager,  and  a  long-term incentive:\n- \u00b7 the annual bonus rewards an employee's contribution to Amundi's performance and is based on both individual and collective factors,\n- \u00b7 the  Long-Term  Incentive  or  'LTI'  is  granted  to  a  select group of key executives in the form of Amundi performance shares,  designed  to  motivate  managers  to  achieve commercial and financial targets such as those set out in the  Amundi  Business  Plan  and  the  implementation  of the ESG pathway. Pursuant to the authorisation granted\n\nby the General Meeting on 16 May 2019, Amundi's Board of  Directors  resolved  on  28  April  2021  to  grant performance  shares  to  certain  beneficiaries  under  the 2021 Plan;\n\n- \u00b7 collective variable compensation which ensures employees  in  France  share  in  the  profits  of  Amundi's financial performance. The total amount is set as a function of a benchmark figure adjusted for changes in net income, in  assets  under  management,  and  in  the  cost-to-income ratio.  In  2021,  the  average  amount  of  collective  variable compensation  was  more  than  \u20ac9,000,  in  line  with Amundi's 2020 results.\n\nIn 2021, Amundi's priorities in implementing the compensation policy were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 to  promote  the  development  of  young  employees  and those who take on new responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 to ensure equal pay for women and men;\n- \u00b7 to implement measures to protect initial pay brackets given the  fall  in  the  overall  2020  results-based  compensation package;\n- \u00b7 lastly, for the  second  year  running,  an  exceptional purchasing power bonus in the amount of \u20ac450 was paid to employees who received, over the 12 months preceding the  payment  date,  an  overall  gross  annual  compensation less  than  three  times  the  annual  value  of  the  SMIC (minimum wage), i.e. \u20ac55,965.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 3.4.3 Social cohesion, Quality of life at work and Commitment\n\n## Diversity and non-discrimination\n\nAmundi  is  a  company  that  considers  promoting  equal opportunities not only to be a question of ethics but also a performance  factor.  In  2008,  Amundi  signed  the  Diversity Charter, in which it committed to comply with and promote the principle of non-discrimination. Amundi has a policy that respects professional diversity. This commitment is specifically  reflected  in  the  requirement  for  fairness  in  the main human resources procedures: recruitment, compensation, training, evaluation and professional promotion.\n\n## Gender equality in the workplace\n\nWith regard to gender equality in the workplace, our actions are driven by two key points:\n\n- \u00b7 vigilance regarding equal pay for the same job.\n\nThe actions carried out by Amundi in 2021 dealt with two aspects: the static aspect and the dynamic aspect.\n\n- \u00b7 The  static  aspect  comprises  the  initiatives  aimed  at determining  whether  there  is  a  difference  in  the treatment of men and women, by means of a calculation of  the  Gender  Equality  Index.  Since  its  implementation in  2019,  the  Amundi  Index  has  increased  each  year.  In 2021,  this  index  returned  a  score  of  84  out  of  a maximum  of  100  points,  based  on  the  following indicators: equality of rates of individual wage increases (excluding  promotions),  promotion  rate,  proportion  of female  employees  whose  wages  were  increased  after returning from maternity leave.\n- \u00b7 The  dynamic  aspect  comprises  all  the  actions  aimed either  at  reducing  unfair  gaps  or  at  preventing  them. This aspect comes into play through initiatives that have been in place for several years:\n- -specific  financial  packages  aimed  at  reducing  unfair pay gaps,\n- -a  guarantee  to  female  employees  returning  from maternity leave of a pay increase equal to at least the average increase granted during the period of leave, as  part  of  the  annual  compensation  campaign.  All female  employees  returning  from  maternity  leave benefit from this measure,\n- -the non-prorating of women's bonuses for the period corresponding to statutory and conventional maternity leave (excluding nursing leave);\n- \u00b7 encouragement of women into management positions.\n\nFor  this  theme,  our  actions  aim  to  eliminate  all  the obstacles (trust, visibility,  representations,  maternity)  that could slow down women's careers.\n\n- \u00b7 Each year,  leadership  training  programmes  are  offered to  female  talent  with  a  view  to  accessing  positions  of responsibility.  Given  the  singular  nature  of  both  2020 and  2021,  some  15  women  were  supported  via  the various training programs.\n- \u00b7 We have also consolidated our efforts to take account of gender diversity in all HR processes: talent pools are now 43% women, consistent  with  the  percentage  of  women in  the  company;  one  in  three  people  in  the  succession plans for key posts in the company are women. Finally, the issue of diversity is now systematically addressed at People Reviews for all employees.\n- \u00b7 Internationally, action is also taken to support women to take  up  positions  of  responsibility,  and  to  strengthen their  visibility  in  the  finance  professions.  In  the  United Kingdom,  Amundi  is  committed  to  gender  equality  by complying  with  the  Women  in  Finance  Charter, particularly on the theme of gender equality in positions of  responsibility.  In  the  US,  Amundi  participates  in  the Women in Investing (WIN) conference, organised by SC Johnson  College  at  Cornell  University,  which  aims  to raise  awareness  of  investment  management  careers among  female MBA  students, and to facilitate networking and mentoring opportunities between female MBA students and partner firms.\n\nAmundi  is  continuing  its  commitment  to  the  '30%  Club France Investor Group', which was set up in November 2020 with six French management companies in order to promote better  gender  diversity  within  the  governing  bodies  of  the companies in  the  SBF  120.  This  group  of  investors  calls  on French large caps to draw up an action plan to ensure that their  governing  bodies  comprise  at  least  30%  women  by 2025.\n\nFor its part, Amundi's objective is to achieve 30% women in its  Executive  Committee  in  2022  and  35%  in  the  Senior Leadership  Team (1) in  2025.  In  2021,  the  rate  of  female representation  on  Amundi's  Executive  Committee  remained at  29.6%,  while  the  rate  of  female  representation  on  the governing bodies (SLT) exceeded 30%.\n\n| Percentage of women in the company   | 31/12/2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|\n| In workforce                         | 41.5%        |\n| In management                        | 35.2%        |\n| In the Senior Leadership Team (1)    | 34.5%        |\n| On Executive Committee               | 29.6%        |\n| On Management Committee              | 28.6%        |\n| In country management                | 40.0%        |\n| On Board of Directors                | 41.7%        |\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

To  this  end,  Amundi  has  decided,  from 1  January 2020, to introduce 16 weeks of maternity leave in all  its  places  of  business worldwide, and to supplement this scheme with a systematic HR interview to prepare the return from maternity leave, as well as paid paternity leave. These measures  fall  within  the  framework  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group's  Human  Project  and  that  of  the  International Framework  Agreement  signed  in  July  2019  by  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.  and  UNI  Global  Union.  This  agreement  covers human rights, fundamental labour rights and the development of employer-employee social dialogue. It aims to  allow  all  the  Group's  employees  to  take  advantage  of  a single  base  of  social  benefits,  regardless  of  the  country where  they  work,  through  a  number  of  commitments  to support  people  with  disabilities,  as  well  as  parenthood  and provident schemes.\n\nAmundi,  aware  of  the  difficulties  encountered  by  parents  in 2020/2021 during the health crisis associated with the Covid-19 pandemic,  has  covered  part  of  its  employees'  childcare  costs (whether the parent is working remotely or at the office). It also provided  educational  assistance  for  employees'  children  and conferences on work-life balance.\n\n## Awareness actions\n\nTraining,  awareness,  communication  and  the  fight  against unconscious  bias  and  stereotypes  are  an  integral  part  of Amundi's  global  action  plan  to  achieve  progress  on  the issues of diversity and non-discrimination.\n\nIn  2021,  in  France,  the  company  continued  to  deliver  a training  programme  aimed  at  raising  awareness  of  various forms  of  workplace  discrimination  among  employees  and managers via  a  serious  game  available  to  all  on  Phileas.  A 'Diversity  management'  module  is  included  in  the  training pathway  for  all  managers  taking  up  new  positions.  In  Ireland, Amundi  launched  a  mandatory  inclusive  leadership  and recruitment  training  campaign  aimed  at  members  of  the Management  Committee,  HR  staff  and  managers.  In  2021, Amundi US partnered with the NeuroLeadership Institute to train managers and employees to combat unconscious bias.\n\nAmundi supports the Amundi Women Network, which, as of 2021,  has  more  than  500  members  in  France,  including 142 men. The network has also expanded into Ireland thanks to the creation of the Amundi Women's Network Ireland. In France,  Diversity  Month  saw  the  organisation  of  several events  to  raise  employee  awareness  of  non-discrimination and  diversity,  including  a  campaign  that  placed  stickers  on the floor so that employees could 'stamp out preconceived ideas'.  In  Ireland,  diversity  and  inclusion  took  centre  stage with  the  appointment  of  10  ambassadors  to  the  D&I Committee. The Dublin and Boston offices came together to create  a  programme  of  'Speaker  Series'  conferences spotlighting individuals from different backgrounds, in order to open up dialogue on diversity-related topics. Amundi also celebrated  International  Women's  Day  by  sharing  stories from Amundi employees around the world about the women who inspire them most.\n\n## Cultural diversity\n\nAmundi  also  promotes  cultural  diversity  within  its  various entities. In the United States, a different culture is celebrated every  month:  events  are  organised  and  publications  are circulated to teach employees about these different cultures. The entities  based  Ireland,  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  US also shared intercultural best practice with one another.\n\n## Employer-employee communication\n\nAmundi's social policy is to engage in constructive dialogue with  the  various  employee  representative  bodies,  whether through  formal  or  ad  hoc  bodies.  Amundi  recognises  that social dialogue and healthy employee representative bodies contribute to its development.\n\nIn  France,  in  2021,  employer-employee  communication  was exemplified in the Lyxor integration project and the Amundi Village development project. Social dialogue continues to be dominated by the Covid pandemic crisis.\n\nFive  agreements  and  two  amendments  have  been  signed with Amundi's social partners:\n\n- \u00b7 agreement on mandatory annual negotiation for 2021;\n- \u00b7 agreement on the procedures for taking leave in the first half of 2021;\n- \u00b7 amendment No. 1 to the PEE agreement;\n- \u00b7 agreement on the method to be used in the next stages of the social process in the context of the Lyxor acquisition project;\n- \u00b7 agreement on remote working;\n- \u00b7 amendment  no.  1  to  the  retirement  planning  agreement within the Amundi UES (economic and social entity);\n- \u00b7 agreement on the exceptional  purchasing  power  premium  for 2022.\n\nSocial dialogue remains an essential driver in addressing the health  crisis  and  adapting  work  organisation.  The  objective: ensure business continuity while protecting employees' health and  helping  to  limit  the  spread  of  the  pandemic.  Social dialogue  has  particularly  intensified  with  trade  unions  and within  the  ESC (1) and  occupational  health  and  safety (CSSCT) (2) bodies. The  quality  and  regularity  of  the discussions  enabled  the  implementation  of  specific  measures tailored  to  employee  protection  on  the  following  themes: remote  working,  prevention,  psychosocial  risks,  protection measures,  return  to  site,  taking  leave,  etc.  All  measures implemented are in compliance with government instructions.\n\nMandatory,  widespread  remote  working  during  the  first lockdown gave way to long-term, voluntary remote working. The  open-ended  remote  working  agreement  signed  on 6  September  2021  replaces  the  remote  working  charter  of 2018  and  sets  out  the  methods  for  organising  remote working. Employees can work remotely for two days a week.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## Quality of life in the workplace\n\n## Psychosocial risks (PSR) prevention policy\n\nAmundi's policy on the prevention of PSR and on quality of life  in  the  workplace  is  one  of  ongoing  improvement  and integration into HR policies. It is notable for its interdisciplinary approach - relying on managers, the Human Resources Department, occupational medicine, and employee representatives (1) .\n\nIn  France,  specific  governance  of  psychosocial  risks  in  the workplace  is  entrusted  to  a  Monitoring  Committee,  which meets quarterly to identify the right preventative actions to put  in  place  and  track  the  various  indicators,  and  to  a monthly  management  committee  dedicated  to  the  HR monitoring of at-risk employees.\n\nIn  2021,  the  actions  undertaken  in  previous  years  were continued (a listening space, monitoring of long absences in coordination  with  the  Occupational  Health  Department, management training on the prevention and management of stress,  Responsage  information  and  advice  platform  for caregiving  staff).  These  actions  have  been  enhanced  to provide a suitable response to the potential consequences of the  health  crisis  and  new,  hybrid  working  models:  isolation, loss  of  community  involvement,  work  overload/underload, hyperconnectedness/disconnection, work/life balance, stress, etc.\n\nA remote-working  support  system  for  managers  and employees is  currently  in  place  and  aims  to  a  maintain  the collective  bond  between  colleagues  and  strengthen  remote management. The support system includes self-diagnosis, a virtual  remote  management  class,  a  hybrid  team  charter workshop, a co-development course, coaching for managers, a  remote  working  guide,  webinars  on  remote  and  hybrid work patterns and inspiring conferences for employees.\n\nOther specific mechanisms, opened during the health crisis, are offered to employees:\n\n- \u00b7 remote medical consultation: at no additional cost, Amundi employees  can  take  advantage  of  a  remote  medical consultation service for any general medical problem;\n- \u00b7 a  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  psychology  unit:  in  addition  to  the traditional  listening  space  that  already  existed,  this  remotely accessible unit provides 24/7 moral support to employees.\n\nInternationally, entities are also committed to the prevention of  psychosocial  risks  by  offering  management  training  and by  launching  awareness  campaigns.  In  Ireland,  increasing mental health awareness was a priority in 2021. The 'Mental Health  Champion/Mental  Health  First  Aiders'  programme that  was  launched  in  2019  continues  to  promote  and  raise awareness of mental health. In the United Kingdom, training on  how  to  achieve  work-life  balance  and  manage  stress  has been put in place.\n\n## Health policy\n\nAs a result of the health crisis, most of the health measures in the workplace scheduled for the year were heavily impacted or  even  cancelled.  However,  in  January,  Amundi  was  able  to organise seven hours' training for 14 employees, enabling them to  update  their  knowledge  of  first  aid.  Blood  drives  were organized in partnership with the \u00c9tablissement Fran\u00e7ais du Sang (the French blood bank service). In November, seasonal flu  vaccines  were organised and provided to approximately 500 people.\n\nTo combat the pandemic, the Occupational Health Department set  about  implementing  measures  tailored  to  the  health situation:\n\n- \u00b7 installation  of  thermographic  cameras  at  the  entrance  to each building (in 2020);\n- \u00b7 distribution  of  individual  health  kits  containing  surgical masks, a sanitising solution and a disinfectant spray for all volunteer employees present on site (in 2020);\n- \u00b7 distribution  of  a  batch  of  five  public-use  Afnor  UNS1standard fabric masks (washable 100 times);\n- \u00b7 office  equipment  such  as  screens  and  chairs  sent  to employees whose state of health justified it;\n- \u00b7 creation of a dedicated Covid-19 unit and implementation of  a  protocol  for  detecting,  tracing  and  tracking contacts and symptomatic/confirmed cases;\n- \u00b7 employees  with  disabilities  and/or  at  risk  monitored  and supported with telephone calls and email exchanges;\n- \u00b7 from March, organisation of a vaccination campaign by the inter-company  centres  responsible  for  employee  health monitoring  in  Paris  and  Valencia.  As  soon  as  the government authorised the occupational health services to provide  vaccines,  Amundi's  OH&S  department  organised an  extensive  campaign  that  ran  from  late  May  until  midJuly  to  provide  both  doses.  A  booster  vaccine  campaign began  in  December.  In  total,  more  than  1,600  people received  Covid-19  vaccines  at  our  offices  in  Paris  and Valencia;\n- \u00b7 email communications throughout the year concerning the health protocol in force and the guidelines to follow.\n\n## Well-being at work\n\nFor  several  years  now,  Amundi  has  established  measures intended to improve quality of life in the workplace and to help employees achieve a better work-life balance.\n\nExceeding  the  legal  requirements  in  France,  the  Company acts through:\n\n- \u00b7 the  organisation  of  work:  meetings  that  comply  with  the team's  working  hours,  defined  planning  ahead  of  time, periods when accessible in the context of remote working, etc.;\n- \u00b7 measures  to  make  parenthood  easier:  standard  breastfeeding  leave, children's sick days, paternity leave, maternity and parenthood guides, etc.;\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  Austria,  an  annual assessment  of  the  working  environment,  and  particularly  of individual workstations, is carried out. In Ireland, virtual events and webinars were organised on the theme of well-being to celebrate National Workplace Wellbeing Day in April.\n\n## Commitment\n\n## Talent commitment\n\nTo  facilitate  the  implementation  of  an  employment  policy that  places  priority  on  internal  mobility,  and  to  allow\n\neverybody  to  evolve  and  develop  within  the  Group,  each employee  has  an  assigned  HR  business  partner  and individualised employee management.\n\nIn collaboration with the management, employee management contributes both to the adaptation of resources to the  needs  of  the  business  and  to  the  individual development  of  employees.  The  organisation  of  employee management is aligned with the management structure and incorporates  matrix  management.  It  is  set  at  an  initial  local level with a direct hierarchy, then organised by business line with dedicated contacts and a cross-sectional vision.\n\nThe  role  of  the  HR  business  partner  includes  several  levels  of support:\n\n- \u00b7 employee  reviews  between  HR  business  partner  and management covering all scopes;\n- \u00b7 succession plans put in place to ensure succession for key positions;\n- \u00b7 support for employees in difficult circumstances.\n\nThese  exchanges  between  HR  and  management  are  an opportunity  to  identify  employees  with  high  potential  for development  within  the  business.  Talent  management continued  in  2021  as  it  adapted  to  the  health  crisis.  The NOVAMUNDI  (young  talent  development  programme) cohorts  have  completed  their  work  digitally  and  several  of their projects are being implemented within the Group.\n\n2021 also saw the development of the 'Amundi Management Spirit'  managerial  support  programme.  This  programme  is aimed at all categories of managers, and helps them to apply Amundi's  values  to  everyday  situations,  particularly  in  the context of hybrid management.\n\n## Measurement of employee commitment\n\nEvery  year,  Amundi  carries  out  a  survey  to  measure  the commitment  of  its  employees.  Known  as  the  'Engagement and  Recommendation  Index  (ERI)'  this  approach  is  used within  all  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  entities.  In  2021,  Amundi carried out the survey in France and in all its other places of business around the world. More than 4,700 employees were surveyed,  giving  a  participation  rate  of  77%.  The  Amundi commitment score was 81% favourable responses, up 1 point from 2020.\n\n| Commitment survey       | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Participation rate      | 76%    | 73%    | 77%    |\n| Amundi commitment score | 72%    | 80%    | 81%    |\n\n## Employee share ownership\n\nThe development of employee share ownership is an integral part  of  Amundi's  compensation  and  social  benefits  policy. As  has  been  the  case  every  year  since  2018,  a  capital increase transaction reserved for employees was carried out in  mid-2021.  This  transaction  allowed  eligible  employees  to subscribe  to  Amundi  shares  with  a  30%  discount  on  the\n\nreference price. More than 1,690 employees, in 15 countries, have subscribed to this capital increase. Employee ownership in  Amundi's  share  capital  represents  0.8%,  compared  to 0.6%  before  the  transaction.  A  director  elected  by  the employees  for  a  three-year term is responsible for representing the employees on the Board of Directors.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 3.5 ACTING AS A COMMUNITY-MINDED, ECO-AWARE CITIZEN\n\n## 3.5.1 Inclusion\n\nAmundi formalised its commitment to social inclusion at the end of 2018 by signing the PAQTE agreement. The Pact with the  Neighbourhoods  for  all  Companies  ( Pacte  Avec  les Quartiers  pour  Toutes  les  Entreprises, PAQTE)  supports actions already initiated and encourages businesses to work for  the  residents of priority urban policy districts ( Quartiers Prioritaires de la Politique de la Ville , QPV).\n\n## Policy for hosting young people in training\n\nAmundi  contributes  significantly  to  the  training  of  young people  primarily  through  internships  offered  to  recently graduated students from diverse areas of study and through work-study,  which  enables  a  young  person  to  both  finance his or her education and gain his or her first work experience. In  2021,  Amundi  expanded  its  capacity  to  welcome  young people into the company, both in France and internationally, at all levels of training (internships, work/study programmes, international volunteering (VIE) or training through research (CIFRE)).  As  a  result,  it  welcomed  and  trained  more  than 1,000 young people, including 30% outside France.\n\nAmundi  has  strengthened  its  commitment  to  supporting young people through two new partnerships:\n\n- \u00b7 in order to support young people's entry into professional life, in  the  summer  of  2021,  Amundi  became  a  member  of  the EngagementJeunes platform, which helps students increase their  visibility  at  the  end  of  their  time  with  Amundi  and improves their access to employment (via references and information-sharing with other companies);\n- \u00b7 Amundi  has  decided  to  take  action  to  promote  equal opportunities  and  has  entered  into  a  new  partnership  with the  T\u00e9l\u00e9maque  organisation  to  provide  mentoring  to secondary  school  students.  Through  this  partnership, 20  employee  volunteers  are  dedicating  their  time  to helping a young  person  discover  the  cultural  and professional world and develop their potential, in order to give them all the opportunities they deserve.\n\nAmundi  also  undertakes  initiatives  as  part  of  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group Youth Plan: a global and collective plan that aims to use all the levers at its disposal to support youth inclusion and employment.\n\nAmundi  was  awarded  the  HappyTrainees  label  for  the  eighth consecutive  year  in  2021;  this  recognises  companies  for  the quality of the welcome and assistance they offer young people.\n\nLocal entities across the globe are also embracing the Youth policy: welcoming interns and international volunteers, taking part in school interventions and partnering with organisations  that  support  minorities.  Amundi  Technology has launched an unprecedented initiative, in partnership with the  Irish  government,  entitled  'Fast  Track  Into  IT',  which  is helping  six  people  to  undertake  professional  retraining  as part of a work-study programme.\n\n## Disability\n\nIn 2021,  Amundi  continued  its  voluntary  activities  to incorporate  people  with  disabilities  based  on  four  pillars: recruitment,  retention  in  employment,  use  of  the  sheltered employment  sector (1) and  raising  employee  awareness.  In 2019,  Amundi  signed  the  'Manifesto  for  the  inclusion  of people with disabilities in economic life', thereby committing itself  to  continue  its  actions  to  promote  the  inclusion  of people with disabilities.\n\nIn  France, a sixth disability agreement was signed for three years  at  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  Group  level.It  sets  Amundi's objective  over  this  period  to  recruit  eight  people  with disabilities across all types of employment  contract: permanent,  fixed-term,  work-study  and  temporary.  In  2021, Amundi  recruited  11  people  with  disabilities,  including 1  colleague  on  a  permanent contract and 10 on work/study contracts,  bringing  the  number  of  people  with  disabilities recruited since the sixth agreement was signed to 20 and the total  number  of  people  with  disabilities  employed  by  the company to 71. As is the case every year, Amundi has taken actions  to  raise  awareness  among  its  employees  and promote  the  inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities.  In  2021, Amundi renewed its financial support for the 'Autistes sans fronti\u00e8res' (Autism without borders) association.\n\nAt  the  international  level,  several  initiatives  have  also  been undertaken to support people with disabilities: financial assistance  in  Italy,  additional  leave  in  Germany,  an  inclusion programme in Japan that involved the publication of a guide on the  recruitment  and  integration  of  people  with  disabilities, multiple publications in the UK and participation in the Diversity Project, which works to build a more inclusive culture.\n\n## Changes in the rate of direct and indirect employment of employees with disabilities (France at 31 December)\n\n| 2012   | 2013   | 2014   | 2015   | 2016   | 2017   | 2018   |   2019 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 2.13%  | 2.50%  | 3.15%  | 3.31%  | 3.86%  | 4.50%  | 4.34%  |      4 |\n\n| Direct employment rate of employees with disabilities (2) (France at 31 December)   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                                     | 2.83%  | 2.9%   |\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  procedure  for allocating sponsorship is composed of five phases: analysis, decision, conclusion of the contract, control and traceability.\n\nIn the cultural arena, Amundi continued to support its longterm  partner,  Villa  Medicis,  of  which  it  is  the  principal sponsor,  and  Ch\u00e2teau  de  Vaux-le-Vicomte.  Amundi  has increased its support for the charity Autistes sans fronti\u00e8res (Autism  without  borders).  For  the  11th  consecutive  year, Amundi provided financial support to Action Contre la Faim (ACF,  Action  Against  Hunger)  Amundi  has  also  signed  an agreement  to  support  the  French  National  Guard.  This agreement  aims  to  strengthen  the  ability  of  the  National Guard and army reservists to serve their community, and to support  the  development  of  its  human  capital  based  on values such as courage, team spirit and solidarity.\n\nInternationally, Amundi is committed to numerous solidarity causes through its local offices. In the United States, Amundi has,  for  many  years,  operated  a  Corporate  Grants  Program that  provides  financial  assistance  to  organisations  offering support to the most vulnerable individuals. These organisations include The Home for Little Wanderers, which supports  families  and  children  in  need,  or  On  the  Rise  and Rosie's  Place,  which  provide  security  and  support  to homeless women. Another key focus is educational support for  children  in  need,  and  the  company  supports  innovative reading and writing programmes like 826 Boston and Raising a Reader MA. Amundi Ireland is also committed to long-term partnerships, particularly with the Barretstown organisation, which  supports  children  with  serious  illnesses,  Junior Achievement  Ireland,  which  encourages  disadvantaged students  to  continue  their  studies,  and  the  Dublin  Simon Community,  which  works  to  support  the  homeless.  In  Italy, Amundi  supported  a  Save  the  Childrenproject  aimed  at combatting  digital  poverty  in  educational  settings.  This initiative benefitted 100  schools,  6,000  students  and 250  teachers  over  three  years.  In  the  United  Kingdom, Amundi  is  committed  to  fighting  cancer  by  supporting various  associations  such  as  Movember  and  Macmillan Cancer Support.\n\nAmundi's contributions amounted to a total of \u20ac1.85 million in 2021.\n\n## Employee commitment\n\nAmundi's commitment to social responsibility has also led to involving employees  in  joint projects with charitable organisations. In October 2021 , Amundi organised the second annual ESG Spirit sports challenge, which involved 579 employees in 23 countries. This challenge benefitted four associations: Reforest' Action, Action  Against  Hunger, International  Committee  of  the  Red  Cross  and  Doctors Without Borders.\n\nI\n\nIn France, for the 9th consecutive year, Amundi organised its annual  'Give  A  Hand'  sponsorship  programme,  which provides financial support to solidarity projects organised by employees  that  are  involved  in  the  voluntary  sector.  This year, Amundi  financed  14  projects  aimed  at  tackling humanitarian, environmental, disability-related, health-related and  social  issues.  Amundi  employees  in  Paris  and  Valencia took  part  in  a  photo  challenge  as  part  of  a  fundraising campaign  to  fight  female  cancers  in  October  and  male cancers  in  November,  while  Amundi  made  donations  to cancer charities.\n\nAs  part  of  its  commitment  to  equal  opportunities  and professional  reintegration  and  re-education,  Amundi  has reaffirmedits support for La Cravate Solidaire. This charity works to  help  vulnerable  people  to  re-enter  the  workplace  by organising  a  collection  of  professional  clothing  at  Amundi's Paris offices. Amundi also organises toy collections through the  charity  Rejou\u00e9.  Rejou\u00e9's  community-focused,  socially conscious and environmentally friendly scheme sells secondhand toys that have been restored by individuals who are reentering  the  workplace.  Lastly,  Amundi  has  renewed  its partnership with T\u00e9l\u00e9maque, which helps young people from disadvantaged  areas  to  succeed  despite  the  obstacles associated with their socio-economic backgrounds. Through a 'school-company' mentoring program, Telemaque aims to provide  a  springboard  for  social  advancement  in  school settings.  Twenty  Amundi  employees  have  volunteered  to become a mentor to a young person.\n\nInternationally,  Amundi's  employees  continue  to  work  with numerous local charitable projects that tackle humanitarian, health and solidarity issues.\n\n- \u00b7 In the United Kingdom, employees organised a sale to raise funds for Macmillan Cancer Support. Every year, employees also donate wrapped Christmas presents to the Salvation  Army  so  that  they  can  be  distributed  to disadvantaged children.\n- \u00b7 In Austria, a collection of essential products was organised at  the  Amundi  Vienna  offices  for  donation  via  the  Red Cross to people and families in need.\n- \u00b7 Employees  in  Dublin  have  come  together  to  fight  breast cancer through the Amundi Ireland Women's Network by taking  part  in  the  100k  in  30  Days  For  Breast  Cancer Ireland online sports challenge. They also participated in a volunteer day in aid of the Barretstown organisation, which supports  children  with  serious  illnesses,  helping  the  staff to maintain and improve the grounds.\n- \u00b7 Every year, Amundi US encourages employees to invest in charitable activities. In 2021, 17 employees took part in the Thompson  Island  4K  Trail  Run  for  the  Thompson  Island Outward Bound Education Center, which provides education programmes  that  promote  personal  development,  empathy, community,  environmental  responsibility  and  academic success.",

        "page_content": "## 3.5.3 Responsible purchasing\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  has  adopted  a  Responsible Purchasing Policy (1) designed to meet the main challenges of the future and  contribute  to  the  company's  overall performance.  This  policy  is  part  of  the  Group's  Ethical Charter and is based on commitments including the United Nations  Global  Compact,  the  Diversity  Charter  and  the Charter on the Mediation of Responsible Supplier Relations. All  of  the  commitments  set  forth  in  these  texts  relate  to respect  for  human  rights  and  compliance  with  labour regulations, the fight against all forms of discrimination, the promotion  of diversity, environmental protection and business ethics.\n\nAs  part  of  the  2022  Medium-Term  Plan  (MTP),  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's Purchasing business line set out its action plan, entitled 'ACTE 2022'. This plan aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 boost the Group's performance and risk control;\n- \u00b7 create value for the regions and business lines;\n- \u00b7 translate the purchasing policy into responsible actions;\n- \u00b7 maintain responsible behaviour with its suppliers.\n\nIn 2021,  Amundi  structured  its  Responsible  Purchasing approach around the three pillars of the Group MPT:\n\n- \u00b7 the  societal  pillar ,  with  the  renewal  of  the  Responsible Supplier and Purchasing label, the launch of two new CSR rating  campaigns  for  suppliers  for  which  expenditure exceeded \u20ac100,000 in 2020, the development of action plans with  suppliers  whose  Ecovadis  ratings  fell  below  35/100, and the provision of hands-on support for suppliers whose businesses  were  impacted  by  the  pandemic  or  whose contracts  will  not  be  renewed,  in  order  to  identify  new business opportunities within the CASA  Group  or externally;\n- \u00b7 the human pillar, with the continued professionalisation of its  purchasing  in  the  area  of  CSR.  'Buy  Responsibly' training on the fundamentals of CSR purchasing has been expanded  to  include  Amundi  colleagues  for  whom purchasing accounts for less than 50% of their role;\n- \u00b7 the relationship excellence pillar, with regard to its suppliers and  internal  clients.  A  new  360\u00b0  assessment  by  our specifiers concerning the relationships and  services delivered by the purchasing teams and a quality survey of CASA  Group  suppliers  (of  which  64%  were  very  small companies  and  SMEs).  The  survey  confirmed  an  overall satisfaction rate of 90.9% (91.3% for very small companies and SMEs, 90.6% for intermediate-sized enterprises, 88.5% for  large  companies)  and  a  positive  perception  of  the quality of the relationship with purchasing.\n\nFor 2022, the CSR aspect of the Purchasing MTP has two key themes:\n\n- \u00b7 inclusion , in order to:\n- \u00b7 define its scope so that purchasing can become a driver of  employment  for  vulnerable  groups  and  increase employment in the regions;\n- \u00b7 identify the inclusion services in the purchasing tools;\n- \u00b7 raise awareness among and train buyers, according to purchasing  type,  by  getting  prescribers  involved: interbank disability information sheets on are being drawn up in  order  to  raise  awareness  among  suppliers  in  various business sectors (communication, events, marketing, administrative  services,  IT,  general  services,  waste treatment, printing and reprographics, catering);\n- \u00b7 increase by +50% the  volume of purchases made from the protected and adapted work sector in 2022.\n- \u00b7 the decarbonisation of purchases:\n\nIn order to limit the carbon footprint of the Group's purchases, four  proposals  developed  with  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A. Group  Purchasing  Department  were  adopted  by  Amundi with short- and medium-term targets (3/6 months to 1 year).\n\n- \u00b7 Perform  a  qualitative  assessment  of  the  carbon  footprint generated by an offering of services or goods during calls for  tender on the basis of the tenderers' communication of the carbon footprint, the methodology used to calculate it  and  the  action  plan  put  in  place  (targets,  trajectory, initiatives).\n- \u00b7 Increase the CSR weighting in the multi-criteria analysis grids from 15% to 35% when analysing tenders on the short list.\n- \u00b7 Perform a priority assessment of the carbon footprint of tenders in  purchasing  areas  that  have  the  greatest impact,  using  a  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  carbon  footprint assessment  methodology,  thereby  enabling  supplier tenders and their carbon footprints to be compared on a like-for-like basis.\n- \u00b7 Adopt a plan to reduce the carbon footprint generated by  Group spending  by  setting  reduction  targets  for  this carbon  footprint  and  establishing  an  emissions-reduction trajectory that is compatible with the Group's commitments.\n\nAmundi will manage the implementation and rollout of this system  to  assess  the  carbon  footprint  generated  by  an offer of services or products.\n\nFinally, in 2021, in order to optimise invoice processing times, new  communications  were  sent  to  suppliers  to  encourage them to submit their invoices via a dedicated email address. A  generic  level  2  address  was  set  up  to  enable  supplier reminders to be processed as soon as possible in the event of a delay or dispute. In Q3 2021, the percentage of invoices paid by the deadline was 80% (2) .\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

Revenue assigned to companies in the adapted  sector (EA/ESAT (1) ), which amounted  to \u20ac0.4 million in 2020, remained the same in 2021 (\u20ac0.4 million). The  decrease  in  comparison  with  2019  (\u20ac0.5  million)  was primarily  due  to  the  impact  of  the  pandemic  on  certain building services and services related to work receptions and company events.\n\n## 3.5.4 Direct environmental footprint\n\nAs a responsible asset manager since its creation in 2010 and a  member  of  the  Net  Zero  Asset  Managers  Initiative  since 2021, Amundi ensures that its corporate practices align with its  investor  requirements, particularly in terms of the target to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Amundi also works to ensure  that  this  aim  is  shared  by  all  employees,  by  making them key stakeholders in achieving this change.\n\n## Responsible management of buildings and resources\n\n## Building environmental certification\n\nAmundi's registered office in Paris complies with environmental standards. It has a BBC (2) Effinergie label and HQE Exploitation (3) and  BREEAM (4) certification.  In  2019,  as part  of  the  complete  renewal  of  its  HQE  Exploitation certification, Amundi was rated as 'Exceptional' in terms of Management  and  Sustainable  Use.  This  rating  has  been maintained thanks to Amundi's regular improvement initiatives.  For its part, Amundi ESR, the subsidiary based in Valence  (Dr\u00f4me),  is  located  in  a  building  that  meets environmental  standards.  The  Amundi  offices  in  Munich, Boston  and  Milan  are  also  all  within  LEED (5) certified premises.\n\n## Audit and energy efficiency\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  regulations,  Amundi's  premises  in Paris are subject to regular energy audits. The last audit was carried  out  in  2019.  Amundi  continues  to  implement  the actions  in  place  since  2015,  such  as  reducing  the  operating times  of  ATUs (6) ,  installing  LED  lighting  and  fitting  window switches to cut fan units when windows are open.\n\nAt  the  Valence  site,  a  project  to  optimise  the  automatic lighting, heating and air conditioning system is scheduled for 2021-2022. Reducing the switch-on time windows of devices should allow savings of between 1 hour and 1 hour 30 minutes per working day depending on the type of device or network concerned.\n\nHowever, in order to limit the impact on adapted companies:\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi began distributing packed lunches prepared by an ESAT, which allowed the company to remain open;\n- \u00b7 the contract for in-office distribution services (hydroalcoholic  gel,  internal  Amundi  magazine)  has  been awarded to an Adapted Company.\n\nA  process  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  sites  is  also underway in international entities, favouring lowconsumption  electronic  devices  and  optimising  automated lighting, heating and air conditioning systems. In the United Kingdom, a motion detection  lighting  system  is  in  place  to reduce  the  site's  power  consumption.  Several  entities  have also  put  in  place  an  automatic  switch-on  and  switch-off system  for  computers.  In  Italy,  this involves around 450 workstations.\n\n## Green IT policy\n\nAmundi  seeks  to  control  the  environmental  impact  of  its information systems in several ways:\n\n- \u00b7 all IT equipment intended for users (screens, workstations, phones,  printers)  complies  with  international  energy efficiency standards;\n- \u00b7 all computer equipment purchased is certified or complies with recognised international standards;\n- \u00b7 lastly, office IT equipment (workstations, printers, laptops, small items, etc.) is  recycled  by  the  service  provider  ATF GAIA, a WEEE certified company contracted by the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group.  Equipment  components  that  are  not  reused  for  resale  are  systematically  sent  to  a  certified partner. Amundi also recycles its used magnetic cartridges. There  are  bins  for  recycling  used  toner  drums.  In  the United States, an end-of-life device management programme is also in place. Devices are recycled or put up for sale on the second-hand market;\n- \u00b7 in 2021, as part of the building project to relocate Amundi's head  office,  Amundi  Village,  it  was  decided  to  launch  a pilot  scheme  centred  around  IT  equipment  and  office space that puts the focus on the quality of tools, ensuring equipment is appropriately sized for the space in which it sits and used in a way that prolongs its lifespan.\n\n(6) Air Treatment Unit.\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## Responsible use of paper\n\nAmundi  pursues  a  responsible  paper  policy  both  in  France and  abroad,  with  the  objective  of  reducing  consumption, promoting careful use of paper and recycling used paper.\n\n- \u00b7 With regard to office equipment: automatically configuring  printers  to  double-sided,  black  and  white, swipe  cards  for  making  copies,  lower-weight  paper,  the use  of  reams  of  certified  paper  and,  in  France,  electronic invoicing.\n- \u00b7 With regard to communication media: printing on certified paper,  selecting  printers  certified  by  Imprim'Vert  and regularly  making  more  documents  available  in  electronic form.\n- \u00b7 With  regard  to  desktop  publishing , Amundi  ESR,  the account-keeping  subsidiary  responsible  for  employee savings schemes, continued its efforts to reduce its paper consumption.  In  2021,  this  activity  recorded  a  rise  in subscriptions  to  its  e-services  from  70%  to  74%,  which contributed to the 17% reduction in the amount of printed paper used over the year. In total, the reduction in paper consumption in 2021 was nearly 15% compared with 2020, despite Amundi ESR recording an increase of nearly 3% in the number of accounts managed.\n\nSeveral initiatives were implemented or continued in 2021 to reduce  paper  consumption  or  increase  the  use  of  recycled paper. At the Paris head office, subscriptions to newspapers and  magazines  continue  to  be  digital,  contracts  are  signed electronically and receipts from the company restaurant are no  longer  automatically  printed.  Internationally,  several entities  are  also  continuing  their  efforts  to  go  paperless: creation  of  electronic  signatures  in  Italy,  digitalisation  of meeting handouts and reports. In the United Kingdom, only 10% of employees subscribe to paper publications.\n\n## Responsible waste management\n\nAmundi has implemented a responsible waste management policy for several years in France and has promoted selective sorting  through  the  voluntary  use  of  recycling  bins  since 2013.  Recyclable  waste (1) (paper,  plastic  cups  and  bottles, cans,  printer  supplies,  batteries  and  waste  electrical  and electronic  equipment  [WEEE])  is  managed  by  CEDRE,  a sheltered  workshop  employing  people  with  disabilities.  In addition to selective sorting, Amundi runs a Cleaning Week scheme each year at its Paris premises with a view to sorting and  clearing  superfluous  paper.  Every  year,  the  recycling work  entrusted  to  CEDRE  generates  9.84  Beneficiary  Units (disabled employment equivalents).\n\nEvery  year,  Amundi  strives  to  integrate  more  recyclable materials  into  its  sorting  line.  Since  2018,  a  cigarette  butt recycling  initiative  has  been  in  place  at  our  Paris  buildings, complemented in 2021 by a sorting system for used pens and surgical masks. Coffee capsules are also recycled in the UK, Austria and Ireland. In Japan, waste sorting bins can be used to sort 15 different types of waste. Biodegradable consumables were introduced into the cafeteria of the Paris site  from  2019.  Biowaste  is  collected  from  the  Company restaurant. The grease traps are biologically treated in-house in  both  buildings,  resulting  in  less  discards  and  fewer  truck movements to clean the traps and dispose of the grease at an external station.\n\n| Waste  (in tonnes)     |   2021 |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Non-recycled waste (1) |    161 |\n| Recycled waste         |    132 |\n| TOTAL                  |    293 |\n\n- (1) Paper, paper cups, plastic bottles, cans, printer supplies, batteries, WEEE, glass and plastic bottle caps.\n\n## Actions taken to reduce food waste\n\nThe  partner  of  the  Paris  Company  restaurant  carefully manages its services in order to minimise the amount of food wasted on a daily basis. 2021 was not a typical year. Firstly,\n\nthe main restaurant was either completely or partially closed. Secondly,  the  measures  taken  to  combat  the  pandemic structurally generate more waste (packaging of cutlery, meal packs  prepared  and  distributed  for  take-away  in  individual packaging).\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

In Japan, recyclable bags are made available to employees  to  reduce  the  use  of  disposable  bags  when shopping for lunch outside. In France, coffee machine cups were  removed  from  early  2020.  In  Italy,  plastic  stirrers  for coffee  were  replaced  in  2021  by  100%  recyclable  wooden stirrers. In Ireland, stirrers were completely removed in 2020. In  the  United  States,  plastic  capsules  were  also  replaced  in order to offer an entirely plastic-free coffee break.\n\nIn  handling the health crisis, Amundi has reduced its plastic consumption  and  its  waste  production.  In  Ireland,  sanitising gel dispensers are filled from 5-litre containers. In France and Ireland, all employees have been provided with fabric masks to reduce the use of disposable masks.\n\n## Educating employees about 'acting green'\n\nIn France and internationally, Amundi runs regular communication  and  awareness  actions  for  its  employees  on eco-friendly  behaviour:  awareness  campaign  for  responsible printing  in  several  entities  (Austria  already  recorded  a significant  reduction  in  the  amount  of  printing),  awareness campaign  for  sorting  in  several  entities,  promotion  of environmentally responsible travel methods in France (subsidy scheme for buying a bicycle), the United States and Italy.\n\nIn  terms  of  preserving  biodiversity,  Amundi  has  installed beehives at its premises in Paris and Valencia. Income from the  sale  of  honey  to  employees  goes  to  the  NGO  Plan\u00e8te Urgence.\n\n## Control of CO2 emissions\n\n## Amundi's carbon footprint\n\nEvery  three  years,  Amundi  prepares  a  complete  carbon footprint,  enabling  it  to  account  for  its  scope  1,  2  and  3 emissions  across  the  entire  company.  The  latest  footprint focuses on data for the 2018 reference year. It is calculated according to the GHG protocol (Greenhouse Gas Protocol). Total emissions recorded in 2018 amounted to 47,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq), i.e. 9.3 tonnes of CO2eq per employee.\n\nI\n\n## Distribution of GHG emissions by item (%)\n\n0.5\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Monitoring direct environmental footprint through the Greenway platform\n\nIn  addition  to  the  carbon  footprint,  in  2021  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group rolled out the Greenway platform, a platform that collects non-financial information. One of the features of this  tool  is  that  it  monitors  direct  environmental  footprint indicators,  which  in  turn  enables  the  Group  to  monitor  its trajectory for reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nWith its ability to calculate key indicators and then present the data in a quantified, transparent and auditable way, the platform is an essential monitoring tool.\n\n## Targets for reducing CO2 emissions\n\nIn  2021,  Amundiconducted  an  in-depth  analysis  of  its  CO2 emissions  that  led  it  to  set  reduction  targets  for  two  highimpact  items  already  subject  to  annual  monitoring:  energy and business travel.\n\nA 30% reduction in CO2 emissions per FTE compared to the reference year of 2018 by 2025 was the target set for energy consumption (scopes 1 and 2) and business travel (scope 3).\n\nCO2  emissions  related  to  business  travel  continued  to  be affected by travel constraints caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. They account for 646.2 tCO2eq. The figures for CO2 emissions related  to  energy  consumption  were  also  impacted  by  the closure of certain buildings during the year.",

        "page_content": "## CO2 emissions 2018-2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n## Energy\n\nSince 2016, the buildings in Paris (1) have been powered using electricity from  100%  renewable  sources,  mainly  hydroelectric.  In  other  countries,  such  as  Germany  and  Austria, they  are  powered  by  100%  green  energy.  Amundi's  green energy share reached 84% in 2021. The effort to transition to renewable energy will continue internationally in 2022.\n\n## Travel\n\nThe  Amundi  travel  policy  applicable  to  all  its  entities worldwide  demonstrates  its  desire  to  reduce  its  CO2 emissions: validation of forthcoming need to travel through weekly reporting to management, prior authorisation from a member  of  the  Management  Committee  for  travel  abroad, mandatory rail for journeys of under three hours, ban on taxi/ vehicle-for-hire  journeys  within  the  city  of  Paris  between 8 am and 8 pm, categorisation of rental vehicles according to the  number  of  passengers.  Since  2019,  new  functions  have been  introduced  within  the  reservation  system  to  better justify  travel  (internal  (intra-group)  travel  or  external  travel for  participation  at  a  conference  or  client  visits)  and  avoid\n\n2\n\ntrips  for  which  a  videoconference  meeting  would  be  more appropriate. The sharp reduction in business travel between 2020 and 2021 demonstrated Amundi's ability to continue its development  despite  the  health  restrictions.  Amundi  will continue its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint by 2025, by reducing  emissions  related  to  business  travel  by  30%  per employee compared to the reference year of 2018.\n\nAmundi  encourages  its  employees  to  reduce  emissions  in their  commute  to  work.  It  contributes  to  public  transport expenses  in  order  to  ensure  its  employees  prioritise  these forms of transport. In France, Amundi covers 80% of public transport expenses (e.g. Navigo card or V\u00e9lib' card in Paris).\n\nIn  France,  Ireland,  Italy  and  the  United  Kingdom,  Amundi  is putting support in place to encourage its employees to opt for  cycling  to  get  to  their  workplaces:  setting  up  bicycle mileage  allowances,  assistance  with  purchasing  a  bicycle,  a self-service bicycle offering and an increase in the number of bicycle parking places.\n\nIn France, several electric charging points have been installed in Amundi car parks. When selecting company cars, Amundi favours the use of fuel-efficient and hybrid vehicles.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3",

(1) via the Livelihoods funds in order to offset its CO2 emissions linked to energy and business travel, i.e. 15,000 metric tons of CO2 per year. These funds finance agroforestry, rural energy and ecosystem restoration projects.\n\n## Employee awareness initiatives\n\nClimate  change  presents  an  unprecedented  challenge.  In order to limit its environmental impact and turn its employees into agents of change,  Amundi  runs  awareness  and communication campaigns both in France and internationally, and  takes  measures  to  reduce  its  direct  environmental footprint.\n\n## Launch of Fresque du Climat climate workshops\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  a  pilot  scheme  was  rolled  out  with Fresque du Climat, an NGO that shares scientific knowledge in order  to  inform  the  public  about  the  causes  and consequences  of  climate  change.  Two  workshops  were piloted,  one  in  Paris  and  the  other  with  the  participation  of international entities. These pilot workshops pave the way for the  training  of  100  internal  ambassadors  by  2022  and  a rollout  of  the  scheme  aimed  at  raising  the  awareness  of 5,000 Amundi employees by 2025.\n\n## ESG Spirit Challenge\n\nThis  fun  event  designed  to  raise  employee  awareness involves  four  stages  organised  around  four  themes:  global warming, solidarity, biodiversity and ESG. Creating a sense of friendly  rivalry  between  colleagues  on  a  100%  digital platform,  it  raises  awareness  of  environmental  issues  and ESG  criteria,  one  of  Amundi's  founding  pillars.  In  2021,  a special COP26 themed ESG Spirit Challenge brought together 579  participants  from  23  countries  who  broke  off  into  98 teams.\n\n## Go Green\n\nEmployee awareness of eco-friendly behaviour is  enhanced every  year  by  new  initiatives:  removal  of  plastic  cutlery  at several entities following the example of Japan - awareness campaign for responsible printing, such as in Austria, where the amount of printing has been significantly reduced -replacement of goody bags with a financial contribution to an  education  project  in  Spain  -  waste  sorting  awareness campaign  at  several  entities,  promotion  of  environmentally responsible  travel  in  the  United  States  and  Italy  -  automatic shutdown  of  computers  at  night  and  removal  of  desktop printers in  France - having the Company's magazine printed on  recycled  paper  by  a  company  that  employs  120  people with  disabilities.  The  new  hot  drinks  machines  are  set  to automatically  go  into  sleep  mode  at  night  and  on  the weekends and bank holidays.\n\nI",

These  initiatives  also  give Amundi  employees  the  opportunity  to  broaden  their knowledge  of  existing  ESG  matters  and  to  acquire  new knowledge on emerging ESG issues.\n\n## Initiative\n\n| RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT   | RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2006                     | Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)                                                             |\n| 2015                     | OECD - Trust in Business Network (TriBuNe)                                                              |\n| 2017                     | Finance for tomorrow                                                                                    |\n| 2017                     | Pensions for purpose                                                                                    |\n| 2018                     | Embankment Project for Inclusive Capitalism                                                             |\n| 2021                     | World Benchmarking Alliance                                                                             |\n| ENVIRONMENT              | ENVIRONMENT                                                                                             |\n| 2003                     | IIGCC - Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change                                                 |\n| 2004                     | CDP - formerly Carbon Disclosure Project                                                                |\n| 2014                     | PDC - Portfolio Decarbonisation Coalition                                                               |\n| 2015                     | Montreal Carbon Pledge                                                                                  |\n| 2016                     | CBI - Climate Bonds Initiative                                                                          |\n| 2017                     | Climate Action 100+                                                                                     |\n| 2017                     | TCFD - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures                                              |\n| 2019                     | Initiative Climat International (iCi) - Private Equity Action on Climate Change                         |\n| 2019                     | La Fondation de la Mer                                                                                  |\n| 2019                     | One Planet Sovereign Wealth Fund Asset Manager Initiative                                               |\n| 2019                     | The Japan TCFD Consortium                                                                               |\n| 2020                     | AIGCC - Asia Investor Group On Climate Change                                                           |\n| 2020                     | FAIRR - Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return                                                            |\n| 2021                     | Finance for Biodiversity Pledge                                                                         |\n| 2021                     | Net Zero Asset Managers                                                                                 |\n| SOCIAL                   | SOCIAL                                                                                                  |\n| 2010                     | Access to Medicine Index                                                                                |\n| 2013                     | Access to Nutrition Index                                                                               |\n| 2018                     | PLWF - Platform for Living Wage Financials                                                              |\n| 2020                     | Investor Action on AMR initiative (lead by both the FAIRR Initiative and Access to Medicine Foundation) |\n| 2020                     | The 30% Club France Investor Group                                                                      |\n| 2020                     | Tobacco-Free Finance Pledge                                                                             |\n| 2021                     | Coalition Finance for Tomorrow's 'Investors for a Just Transition'                                      |\n| GOVERNANCE               | GOVERNANCE                                                                                              |\n| 2013                     | ICGN - International Corporate Governance Network                                                       |\n\nI",

        "page_content": "## 3.7 DUTY OF VIGILANCE AND RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n## Application of the duty of vigilance\n\nThe French law on the duty of vigilance of parent companies and  contracting  companies  applies  to  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole S.A.  Group,  which  is  obliged  to  prepare  and  implement  a vigilance  plan  to  better  identify  and  prevent  the  risks  of serious  impacts  from  its  activities  on  fundamental  human rights and freedoms, personal health and safety and on the environment.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., as the Parent company, reports on the effective  implementation  of  the  measures  laid  out  in  the vigilance plan for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group as a whole, and therefore including Amundi. Further details on the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.  Group's  vigilance  plan  are  presented  in Chapter 3 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Respect for human rights\n\nThe commitment to respect human rights is fundamental at Amundi,  both  as  an  advocate  of  responsible  management and as an employer. Respect for human rights is one of the criteria used  to  rate  issuers  and,  together  with  the environmental  criteria,  constitutes  the  basis  for  Amundi's exclusion  policy  (see  section  2.1  Promoting  responsible finance).  Specifically,  respect  for  human  rights  is  taken  into account  in  the  ESG  rating  through  the  criterion  'Local communities  and  human  rights'.  When  a  business  commits serious and repeated human rights violations without taking effective measures to remedy those violations, this constitutes  a  breach  of  the  10  principles  of  the  Global Compact. Following discussions with that business, Amundi can therefore exclude it from its investment universe.\n\nFor  several  years,  Amundi  has  maintained  a  shareholder commitment  with  many  companies  on  the  subject  of  the living  wage  in  order  to  ensure  that  direct  employees, regardless  of  their  country  of  establishment  and  the\n\ndevelopment  of  social  law  in  that  country,  receive  a  salary that  enables  them  to  live  with  dignity  and  to  meet  their needs  and  those  of  their  family.  The  results  of  this commitment are used to refine the ESG rating of companies supplied  by  Amundi  and  taken  into  account  by  managers when setting up funds.\n\nThe human rights aspect is also present in the analysis of the supply chains of businesses in some sectors where vigilance is  particularly  important  in  order  to  prevent  human  rights violations.  Particularly  migrant  workers,  who  are  at  greater risk,  require  special  attention  in  the  context  of  monitoring programmes that can be put in place by ordering companies.\n\nThis commitment is also reflected in Amundi's HR policy, in the  form  of  actions  to  promote  diversity,  the  fight  against discrimination, the  importance  of  social  dialogue  and collective  bargaining,  and  compliance  with  freedom  of association (see section 3.4.3).\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

This  analysis  is  based  on  a  sector-wide  approach comprising  quantitative  and  qualitative  criteria  as  well  as criteria specific to the company. For each company, Amundi measures the number of beneficiaries and then calculates its impact ratio: this is the number of beneficiaries created per \u20ac10,000  invested.  Based  on  Amundi's  investment  in  the company, this ratio allows reporting of the aggregated total number of beneficiaries, per impact theme, generated since the fund was created in 2012.\n\n## Climate indicators\n\n## The carbon footprint of the portfolios\n\nAmundi's ESG analysis measures companies' carbon footprints  using  a  database  of  private  issuers'  carbon emissions collected by  Trucost, the world  leader  in environmental  and  climate  data.  If  necessary,  any  missing data  is  supplemented  with  data  from  the  parent  company. Assets  in  the  portfolio  that  can  be  rated  (excluding derivatives or government-issued securities, for example) are\n\nI\n\nused  in  the  calculation  of  the  portfolio's  carbon  footprint. Amundi  has  developed  two  carbon  footprint  indicators: carbon  emissions  in  million  euros  invested  and  carbon emissions  in  million  euros  of  revenue.  These  data  and methodologies  are  used  in  fund  reporting  and  to  clarify Amundi's strategy in order to reduce the carbon footprint of investment portfolios.\n\n## Assessment of the portfolio's alignment with decarbonisation scenarios\n\nAmundi  calculates  the  alignment  of  companies  in  the portfolio using data from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)  to  assess  the  deviation  between  a  company's emissions  and  those  of  the  benchmark  index.  Amundi's method  for  assessing  this  is  based  on  the  Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach (SDA), a method approved by the SBTi.\n\n## Temperature rating indicators\n\nTo calculate the portfolio's alignment with the objectives of the  Paris  Agreement and with temperature ratings, Amundi follows  Iceberg  Data  Lab's  SB2A  methodology  and  has thereby  created  an  indicator  which  demonstrates  that  an entity  is  aligned  with  the  Paris  Agreement's  aim  of  limiting the global temperature rise to a level significantly below 2\u00b0C above  pre-industrial  levels.  To  obtain  a  temperature  rating, we  measure  a  company's  trajectory  based  on  its  past performance  in  terms  of  physical  carbon  intensity  and  its commitments to reducing carbon emissions. This trajectory is compared  to  sectoral  benchmark  scenarios  in  order  to calculate an alignment indicator in the form of a temperature rating.\n\nTemperature  ratings  have  been  adopted  as  a  key  tool enabling  investors  to  align  investment  portfolios  with  the global net zero emissions by 2050  goal. Amundi's temperature  ratings  are  taken  from  those  developed  by Iceberg Data Lab, as well as the CDP and Trucost.\n\n## Green versus brown\n\nTo  measure  the  share  of  the  investment  portfolio  that  is green,  i.e.  invested  in  activities  that  make  a  positive contribution to the objectives of the Paris Agreement, versus the  share  that  is  brown,  i.e.  deemed  to  have  a  negative contribution, Amundi relies on the methodologies developed by  three  data  providers:  MSCI,  FTSE  and  Trucost.  To calculate the green share and the brown share, the activities of  issuers  in  the  portfolio  are  classified  as  either  'green'  or 'brown'*. The breakdown of these shares is illustrated in the graph  as  a  percentage  of  revenue,  with  the  addition  of another share named 'other', which corresponds to data that cannot be classified as either green or brown.",

        "page_content": "## Energy Transition score\n\nAmundi, together with other Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group entities, has  developed  an  'Energy  Transition'  score  to  incorporate the challenges and opportunities of the energy transition into investment  decisions.  This  is  a  measure  of  the  level  of commitment  and  the  ability  of  corporates  to  adapt  their economic  model  to  the  challenges  posed  by  combating global warming and the energy transition.\n\n## Just Transition score\n\nIn  2021,  Amundi  developed  a  'Just  Transition'  score  to assess  how  issuers  maximise  the  positive  impacts  and minimise  the  negative  impacts  of  the  socially  inclusive transition to a low-carbon economy. An issuer is assessed by considering  four  social  components  of  a  just  transition: having  an  impact  on  workers,  consumers,  territories  and society in general.\n\nAll these climate-related indicators are set out in Amundi's Annual Climate Report, available on Amundi's website.\n\n| Business line indicators           |                                                                | Unit                     | 2021         | 2020    | 2019    |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|---------|---------|\n| Total assets under management      | Total assets under management                                  | \u20ac billions               | 2,061        | 1,729   | 1,653   |\n|                                    | Assets under management                                        | \u20ac billions               | 846.9        | 378.3   | 322.9   |\n| Responsible                        | ESG funds and mandates                                         | \u20ac billions               | 812.1        | 355.9   | 310.9   |\n| investment                         | Environment and social theme                                   | \u20ac billions               | 34.8         | 22.4    | 11.9    |\n|                                    | Of which strictly social and solidarity impact  funds          | \u20ac millions               | 440          | 331     | 256     |\n|                                    | Issuers rated on ESG criteria                                  | Number                   | 13,500       | >10,000 | >8,000  |\n|                                    | Number of issuers excluded                                     | Number                   | 833          | 617     | 319     |\n| ESG analysis                       | Specialists in ESG Analysis, Voting  and Quantitative Analysis | Number                   | 27           | 24      | 20      |\n|                                    | Commitment with issuers (1)                                    | Number                   | 1,301        | 871     | -

Amundi  has  chosen  to calculate  its  carbon  emissions  on  scopes  1,  2  and  3,  which correspond to the entity's direct and indirect emissions. The data was collected over 2018 for all Amundi Group entities with more than 100 employees, i.e. a coverage rate of 89.2%. The  data  was  extrapolated  for  entities  with  fewer  than 100 employees.\n\n## HR data\n\nThe HR reporting scope covers the entire Amundi Group as of 31 December 2021. The workforce of the consolidated and non-consolidated  Amundi  Group  entities  is  taken  into account  (excluding  minority  joint  ventures)  and  includes Sabadell AM, a management company acquired by Amundi in  2020,  and  BOC  Wealth  Management,  the  joint  venture launched  at  the  end  of  2019  with  Bank  of  China,  in  which Amundi holds a majority stake.\n\nCertain HR indicators are only available for France. This data is identified as such in the table of indicators. The scope for France  includes  the  following  entities:  Amundi  SA,  Amundi Asset Management, CPR Asset Management, \u00c9toile Gestion,\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Gestion, BFT Investment Managers, Amundi Finances, Amundi Immobilier, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation, Amundi  Private  Equity  Funds,  Amundi  IT  Services,  Amundi ESR and Amundi Transition \u00c9nerg\u00e9tique (1) .\n\nPresentation  of  HR  data :  unless  otherwise  indicated,  the population covered is that of 'active' employees, presented as  full-time  equivalent  (FTE).  The  concept  of  'active employees'  implies  a  legal  bond  in  the  form  of  a  standard permanent  or  fixed-term  employment  contract  (or  similar, for international activities), a presence on the payroll and in the position on the last day of the period, and working hours equal to or greater than 50%.\n\n## Environmental data\n\nThe  environmental  reporting  scope  covers  France  and subsidiaries  with  more  than  100  employees,  with  the exception  of  Sabadell  AM.

The main highlight was the acquisition of Lyxor from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale on 31 December 2021.\n\n## 4.2 MARKET CONTEXT IN 2021\n\n## 4.2.1 Macro-economic and financial environment\n\nAfter the major shock of 2020, the global economy bounced back strongly in 2021. The progress of vaccination campaigns meant  that  business  activity  could  gradually  return  to normal, albeit at speeds that varied greatly from country to country, and with temporary periods of further restrictions as successive  waves  of  Covid-19  hit.  The  combination  of renewed demand and disrupted supply resulted in  inflation reaching very high levels almost everywhere. At the end of the  year,  the  major  central  banks  in  developed  economies announced  a  gradual  reduction  of  their  support  measures, while  those  in  emerging  economies  had  already  toughened their monetary policies. Bond market yields rose sharply. On the  equity  markets,  the  indices  of  developed  countries performed  very  well,  while  emerging  countries'  indices posted much more mixed performance.\n\n## United States\n\nThe US economy recovered very strongly in 2021, although it followed  an  erratic  trajectory.  After  a  very  good  first  halfyear, activity slowed at the end of the third quarter due to a sharp  increase  in  Covid-19  cases.  However,  there  was  a  reacceleration in the fourth quarter, when monthly figures and business  surveys  demonstrated  very  buoyant  demand.  The year was also dominated by significant difficulties in the supply of semi-finished goods, due to disruptions and bottlenecks in global  industrial  chains,  resulting  in  price  pressures.  In addition to base  effects, soaring energy  prices  and considerable demand also helped to push inflation to a very\n\nI\n\nhigh level in the second half of the year. The labour market continued  to  recover,  while  the  business  climate  remained buoyant. Having maintained a very accommodative stance for most of the year, at its last two monetary policy committee meetings  the  Federal  Reserve  announced  that  it  would  be gradually reducing its asset purchases.\n\n## Euro zone\n\nDevelopments in the Covid-19 epidemic continued to play a determining role in the economic situation in 2021. Business was  severely  affected  in  the  first  quarter  by  significant restrictions  aimed  at  curbing  the  spread  of  the  virus. However, from the second quarter onwards, the progress of vaccination campaigns meant that many sectors were able to reopen,  leading  to  a  sharp  upturn  in  the  economic  climate until  the  autumn.  Furthermore,  the  first  payments  from  the European NGEU recovery fund provided additional support. Activity slowed again at the end of the year, however, due to the increase in Covid-19 infections and uncertainties related to the Omicron variant. Disruptions in global industrial chains, the sharp rise in energy prices, base effects and the strong demand generated by the reopening of the economy caused inflation to rise sharply throughout the eurozone. The labour market  improved  despite  a  reduction  in  support  measures. The ECB  maintained  a  very  accommodative  stance, providing considerable support to the economies of Member States, whose governments also continued to take action via significant budgetary measures at national level.",

        "page_content": "## Emerging countries\n\nEmerging  economies  experienced  a  very  turbulent  year  in 2021.  Growth  rebounded  strongly  as  vaccination  campaigns progressed,  while  population  mobility  normalised  after  the disruption  caused  by  the  Delta  variant  earlier  in  the  year. Governments  increased  their  support  measures,  with  the improvements seen in developed economies also generating positive  effects.  Inflation  accelerated  sharply  in  the  second half-year (often exceeding central banks' targets, particularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe) due to robust domestic demand  and  disruptions  in  global  supply  chains,  a  situation that  generates  significant  imbalances  in  supply  and  demand. The central banks had no choice but to quickly increase their interest rates, unlike their counterparts in developed countries. From a regional perspective, China's priority objectives were more structural than economic, as it tightened its regulations in  several  sectors  in  order  to  increase  workers'  share  in  the distribution of national income  and  curb  rising  social inequality.  In  Latin  America,  the  political  pendulum  swung sharply  towards  left-wing  political  forces  in  the  wake  of election  results  in  Chile  and  Peru,  and  polling  in  Brazil  and Colombia.  Finally,  the  economic  trend  was  less  volatile  in ASEAN countries, with a more limited upturn, lower inflation and less intervention by central banks than in other regions.\n\n## Rate\n\n2021 saw a sharp rise in sovereign rates. The German 10-year rate ended 2021 at -0.18%, a year-on-year increase of 40 bps. The US 10-year rate increased by 60 bps to 1.5%. Investors, then central bankers, revised their expectations of a rate hike sharply upwards in the face of inflationary pressures and the major  upturn  in  economic  activity.  There  were  significant improvements in the jobs market, particularly in  the  United States.  This  change  of  tone  among  central  bankers  was pronounced in the fourth quarter:\n\n- \u00b7 the Fed announced that its net asset purchases would end in  March  2022,  which  is  expected  to  make  an  initial increase  possible  as  early  as  the  second  quarter.  FOMC members now expect to see three increases in 2022, three increases in 2023 and two increases in 2024;\n\n## 4.2.2 The asset management market (1)\n\nA  dominant  feature  of  2021  was  the  return  of  investors  to medium-  and  long-term  products,  which  recorded  their highest-ever  inflows  (+\u20ac2.5  trillion)  on  the  back  of  welloriented  stock  markets  and  the  prospect  of  recovery  from the economic and health crises.\n\nInflows  were  mainly  concentrated  in  bond  and  equity products, which each accounted for one third of total global investments. Investments varied between  geographical areas,  however,  with  US  investors  favouring  interest  rate products  while  the  vast  majority  of  Asian  and  European clients opted for diversified and equity offerings. Furthermore, US and Asian investors also looked to money market  funds  pending  replacement  to  grow  their  assets (+\u20ac506 billion).\n\n- \u00b7 the  ECB  announced  a  massive  reduction  in  its  current monthly  purchases,  from  \u20ac90  billion  to  \u20ac20  billion  in October  2022.  At  the  same  time,  the  ECB  maintained  a safety  net:  any  securities  acquired  under  its  emergency programme  (PEPP)  which  are  reaching  maturity  may  be reinvested,  if  necessary,  in  different  asset  classes  and jurisdictions.\n\n## Equities\n\nIt  was  a  very  good  year  for  equity  indices  with  the  MSCI ACWI  up  +19.1%,  but  of  note  was  a  marked  divergence between developed markets (+22.5%) and emerging markets (-2.3%),  particularly  China  (-22.7%)  and  Brazil  (-18%).  Both these  countries  suffered  from  the  rise  of  the  dollar, statements  regarding  reduced  support  to  the  Chinese economy  in  the  first  quarter  and  an  unprecedented tightening  of  regulations  in  China.  Elsewhere,  2021  was marked  by  a  marked  upswing  in  profits  in  the  developed world  (up  +52%)  as  well  as  strong  support  for  fiscal  and monetary  policies  in  the  uncertain  context  of  the  Covid-19 pandemic.  The  continued  rise  in  inflation,  mainly  linked  to bottlenecks  in  the  production  chain,  finally  resulted  in  the central banks, and the Fed in particular, taking a harder line towards the end of the year, having indicated this as far back as June. Just when the Omicron variant was driving further reductions in movement worldwide, this tougher tone caused the markets to falter, although they still closed near to their annual  highs.  In  regional  terms,  the  United  States  (+25.2%) and  Europe  (+19.9%)  led  the  way.  Some  European  markets even  fared  better  than  the  United  States,  namely  the Netherlands (+35.4%), Sweden (+31.5%) and France (+26.7%). The United Kingdom (+15%), Japan (+11.4%) and the Pacific excluding Japan (+5.3%) were disappointing. In Europe, this year of economic recovery boosted cyclical stocks (+22.3%) more  than  defensive  stocks  (+15.9%)  and  the  fall  in  real interest  rates  benefited  growth  stocks  (+24.4%)  more  than value stocks (+15.3%). Semi-conductors (+67.7%) and luxury goods (+31.3%)  were  the  big  winners,  while  utilities  (+4.1%) and real estate (+4.1%) struggled.\n\nFunds  invested  in  Chineses  bond  issuers  (which  have broadened  their  investor  base  to  European  clients)  have been  significant  in  medium  to  long  term  flows.    Also, investment expertises in Chinese  assets (equity and bond) were  more  differentiated  with  global  emerging  markets expertise, thanks to on one hand their integration into market indexes,  and  on  the  other  hand  from  favourable  indicators for  recovery  from  the  crisis  having  maintained  their  yields. Despite  a  slowdown  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  funds invested  in  US  issuer  debt  for  domestic  investors  were  the second-biggest investment driver. The specialism attracting the third highest  volume  of  inflows  was  international  equity management (primarily in Europe and Asia).\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The  main  drivers  of  growth  were  the  SFDR Directive  coming  into  force  in  Europe  and  the  increasing market  share  of  ESG  investments  in  all  management specialisms and client types.\n\nInvestment momentum in ESG offerings, already very strong in  previous  years,  reached  a  record  high  with  more  than \u20ac700  billion  in  medium-  and  long-term  inflows  (28%  of  all inflows worldwide), particularly in thematic funds focused on environmental issues.\n\nPassive  management  attracted  more  than  \u20ac1  trillion  in  net subscriptions  with  an  all-time  high  for  passively  managed equity  investments,  spurred  on  by  exchange-traded  funds (ETFs). The ETF market reached its highest point ever, with USD 10 trillion in assets under management (+29% in 1 year) buoyed  by  inflows  of  more  than  USD  1  trillion.  Passive management  as  a  whole  (including  traditional  index-linked funds) met with strong worldwide demand, particularly in the United  States,  which  accounted  for  two-thirds  of  inflows (+\u20ac694 billion). Investments were also significant in Europe (+\u20ac232 billion) and Asia (+\u20ac159 billion).\n\n## Net inflows in 2021 by geographic area around the world\n\n(in \u20ac billions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2.2.1 European market\n\nBenefiting  from  spectacular  market  growth  and  inflows  of nearly  \u20ac750  billion,  assets  in  funds  domiciled  in  Europe reached an all-time high of \u20ac15 trillion, up 18% year on year.\n\nThe  year  was  dominated  by  the  significant  and  steady momentum  of  medium-  and  long-term  products,  which accounted  for  almost  all  net  subscriptions  (+\u20ac737  billion, more than three times the inflows in 2020), to the advantage of  all  asset  classes,  despite  a  slowdown  in  the  last  quarter due  to  the  situation  with  inflation  and  the  spread  of  the Omicron variant.\n\nEquity products were the main beneficiaries of investments made  in  Europe,  reaching  a  record  high.  Inflows  were concentrated  mainly  in  funds  with  environmental  themes (climate,  ecology  and  clean  energy)  and  international equities.\n\nI\n\nESG funds were the main driver of medium- and long-term investment  (nearly  75%  of  inflows).  Of  these,  the  main beneficiaries  were  international  equity  funds  focusing  on ecological  and  environmental  themes  or  invested  in  US stocks. Diversified funds also made a considerable contribution to responsible investment inflows, supported in particular by local offerings aimed at retail clients .\n\nBond solutions had various dynamics differentiated according to their type of management. Global flexible, variable-rate or short-term  funds  offering  protection  against  rising  interest rates  were  favoured  by  investors,  as  were  inflation-linked bonds. However, redemptions were made on emerging funds (with  the  exception  of  offerings  from  China)  and  maturing funds.",

Furthermore,  86%  of  assets  under management outperformed their benchmark over 5 years (3) .\n\nESG  remains  at  the  heart  of  management  strategies  and processes, with  constant  innovation  (ESG  Improvers  range, Social Bonds, Emerging Market bonds, etc.).\n\nThe high levels of inflows for the year reflect the positioning of  the  offerings,  which  are  tailored  to  clients'  expectations and major market trends, including:\n\n- \u00b7 diversified solutions offerings (open-ended funds, investments  managed  under  mandate)  and tailor-made offerings (asset  allocation,  portfolio  construction,  advisory, etc.) with inflows of +\u20ac25.3 billion (4) , including:\n- \u00b7 the ramp-up  of  new  OCIO  offerings in  response  to growing demand from institutional investors (16 mandates won and +\u20ac8.3 billion in inflows),\n- \u00b7 the commercial momentum of  our flagship funds Global Multi Asset Conservative (+\u20ac2.3 billion) and Multi Asset Sustainable Future (+\u20ac0.8 billion);\n- \u00b7 the  success  of  our  Equity  expertise: Value  expertise (+\u20ac1.7 billion in inflows, e.g. +\u20ac0.8 billion in the European Equity Value fund), thematic funds (+\u20ac3.9 billion, with the launch of new products such as the CPR Hydrog\u00e8ne fund) and    ESG  funds  in  general  (Global  Ecology  +\u20ac0.7  billion, European ESG Improvers +\u20ac0.3 billion);\n\nPassive  management,  ETFs  and  Smart  Beta  had  another very  good  year,  with  inflows  of  +\u20ac19.7  billion, bringing assets under management to \u20ac208 billion and exceeding the target announced in 2019 (\u20ac200 billion expected in 2023).\n\nIn ETPs (5) ,  with  net  asset  inflows  of  +\u20ac11.9  billion,  Amundi  is Europe's third largest player by inflows (6) and fifth largest in terms  of  AuM,  with  \u20ac88  billion,  and  a  market  share  that  is increasing once again.\n\nESG  accounted  for  more  than  50%  of  the  ETF  flows  in  the European  market,  and  approximately  90%  of  Amundi's  inflow, thereby  demonstrating  its  know-how  and  capacity  for  ESG innovation.\n\nAmundi's Real Assets division took full advantage of both its positioning and a strongly expanding real and private asset market. Inflows  totalled  +\u20ac4.6  billion,  evenly  distributed between all areas of expertise (+\u20ac1.8 billion in Private Equity, +\u20ac1.6  billion  in  Real  Estate,  +\u20ac1.1  billion  in  Private  Debt). Assets under management totalled \u20ac62.1 billion at the end of 2021, reflecting a significant increase over the past five years (average annual growth of +11.1%).\n\nESG  innovation  was  also  a  highlight  of  the  year ,  with  the launch  of  private-debt  ESG  impact  funds,  SRI-certified property  funds,  obtaining  the  SRI  label  for  OPCIMMO  and winning  several  mandates  for  the  Equity  Loan  Stimulus (Pr\u00eats participatifs relance, PPR)  and  Bond  Stimulus (Obligations  relance,  OR)  schemes  and  the  'Fleurons  des Territoires'  programme  (Stimulus  label)  as  part  of  the recovery plan for France.\n\n- \u00b7 in bonds, the addition of several institutional mandates.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The average margin (3) (17.9 bps) was up thanks to a favourable mix effect. The very high level of performance fees in 2021 (\u20ac427 million) is linked firstly to the sharp rise in the equity markets  since  mid-2020,  and  secondly  to  the  quality  of Amundi  management.  Performance  fees  are  expected    to continue normalising in 2022.\n\n## Ongoing excellence in operational efficiency\n\nChanges  in  operating  expenses  compared  with  2020 (+14.4%) can be explained by:\n\n- \u00b7 ongoing  development  investments  totalling \u20ac65  million: investments  in  technology  both  for  external  clients  and internal  needs,  the  ramp-up  of  Amundi  BOC  in  China, brand  promotion  and  improved  visibility  for  the  Retail division,  recruitment  in  growth  areas  of  expertise  (real assets, thematic funds, etc.);\n- \u00b7 provisions  for  variable  compensation, in  line  with  the increase in operating income;\n- \u00b7 the change in the scope of consolidation compared with 2020 (4) .\n\nThanks  to  this  positive  scissor  effect,  the  cost-to-income ratio was 47.9% (approximately 50%  excluding the exceptional level of performance fees (5) ) and gross operating income rose by +33%.\n\nThe  contribution  from  equity-accounted  entities (mostly Asian  joint ventures) rose  significantly to \u20ac84  million, compared to  \u20ac66  million in  2020,  thanks  in  particular  to  the contributions  from  the  JVs  in  China  (\u20ac28  million)  and  India (\u20ac47 million).\n\n## Accounting data\n\nAccounting  net  income  amounted  to  \u20ac1,369  million  (up +50.5%  compared  to  2020)  and  included  the  initial  costs associated with the Lyxor integration (\u20ac12 million after tax), the amortisation of distribution contracts, and an exceptional tax  gain (Affrancamento (6) ) .  Net  earnings  per  share  were \u20ac6.75, a sharp increase on 2020 (+50%).\n\nI",

These assets and liabilities are  detailed  in  Note  9.3.2  to  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nDerivatives  with  assets represented  \u20ac3,079  million  as  of 31  December  2021  (compared  to  \u20ac3,090  million  as  of 31 December 2020).\n\nThis amount mainly represents the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 the  positive  fair  value  of  performance  swaps  recorded  on the  Amundi Finance balance sheet. This subsidiary acts as\n\nI\n\nthe  counterparty  for  structured  funds  and  by  hedging  a symmetrical  transaction  with  a  market  counterparty;  as  a result,  the  performance  swap  outstanding  assets  recorded as assets appear in equal amounts as liabilities on the Group balance  sheet.  Netted  out,  these  transactions  create  no market risk;\n\n- \u00b7 the positive fair value of interest rate and performance swaps entered into as part of structured EMTN issues.\n\nDerivatives  with  liabilities represented  \u20ac2,393  million  as  of 31  December  2021  (compared  to  \u20ac2,619  million  as  of 31 December 2020).\n\nThese  amounts  mainly  reflect  the  negative  fair  value  of derivatives  contracted  as  part  of  the  structured  funds  or EMTN business and relate to the corresponding asset item, as described above.",

They mostly comprised:\n\n- \u00b7 assets  backing  EMTN  issues  (measured  symmetrically  at optional fair value through profit and loss), in the amount of  \u20ac8,997  million  as  of  31  December  2021  compared  to \u20ac9,673 million as of 31 December 2020, a fall of -7% related to  changes  in  the  business.

This  change  reflects  disposals  made  to  finance the acquisition of Lyxor;\n- \u00b7 non-consolidated equity interests, excluding those measured  at  fair  value  through  non-recyclable  equity through profit and loss, for \u20ac112 million as of 31  December  2021  compared  to  \u20ac107  million  as  of 31 December 2020, an increase of +\u20ac5 million.\n\nFinancial  liabilities  optionally  designated  at  fair  value through profit and loss in the amount of \u20ac9,694 million as of 31  December  2021  compared  to  \u20ac10,086  million  as  of 31 December 2020, a fall of -3.9%, represented the fair value of  the  structured  EMTNs  issued  by  the  Group  as  part  of broadening its range of solutions for Retail clients.\n\nFinancial  assets  designated  at  fair  value  through  equity showed  assets  of  \u20ac702  million  as  of  31  December  2021 compared  to  \u20ac607  million  as  of  31  December  2020,  an increase  of  +15.6%  over  the  year.  This  item  presents  nonconsolidated  equity  interests  optionally  recognised  at  fair value through non-recyclable equity through profit and loss in  the  amount  of  \u20ac169  million  as  of  31  December  2021, compared with \u20ac141 million as of 31 December 2020, up by +20.4%, as well as government securities (\u20ac533 million as of 31 December  2021  compared  to  \u20ac467  million  as  of 31  December  2020,  an  increase  of  +14.1%),  held  under  the EMIR regulation to underwrite derivatives.\n\nFinancial  assets  at  amortised  cost  were  made  up  of  loans and  receivables  from  credit  institutions and  amounted  to \u20ac2,000  million  as  of  31  December  2021  compared  with \u20ac2,429 million as of 31 December 2020, a decrease of -17.7%. As of 31 December 2021, they broke down into \u20ac1,733 million of short-term deposits and cash and \u20ac267 million of medium to long-term loans (excluding \u20ac125 million incorporated into voluntary investments).\n\nLiabilities at amortised cost are made up of debts owed to credit  institutions and  amounted  to  \u20ac1,814  million  as  of 31  December  2021,  compared  with  \u20ac2,968  million  as  of 31 December 2020. As of 31 December 2021, amounts due to credit institutions were made up of short-term loans totalling \u20ac295  million  and  medium  to  long-term  loans  totalling \u20ac1,519 million with the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group SA. This decrease is  the  result  of  the  amortisation  or  early  repayment  of  cash reserves built up in the context of the 2020 health crisis.\n\nSubordinated  debt, which  totalled  \u20ac304  million  as  of 31 December 2021, comprised subordinated debt subscribed with Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. as part of financing the acquisition of  the  Pioneer  Group  subsidiaries.  This  subordinated  debt matures in 2027.\n\nAccruals,  prepayments  and  sundry  assets amounted  to \u20ac2,276  million as of 31 December  2021  compared  to \u20ac1,921  million  as  of  31  December  2020,  up  by  +18.4%.  This item records the collateral paid for Amundi swap intermediation activity for \u20ac219 million (compared  to \u20ac251  million  as  of  31  December  2020)  and  other  accruals, prepayments and sundry assets for \u20ac2,057 million (compared  with  \u20ac1,670  million  as  of  31  December  2020), particularly management fees outstanding.\n\nAccruals,  deferred  income  and  sundry  liabilities amounted to  \u20ac3,316  million  as  of  31  December  2021  compared  to \u20ac2,762 million as of 31 December 2020. This item records the collateral received for the intermediation activity for \u20ac662 million (compared with \u20ac651 million as of 31  December  2020)  and  other  accruals,  deferred  income  and sundry liabilities for \u20ac2,655 million (compared with \u20ac2,111 million as of 31 December 2020), particularly the refunds to be paid to distributors.\n\nIntangible assets amounted to \u20ac519 million as of 31 December  2021,  compared  to  \u20ac530  million  as  of 31  December  2020.  This  change  is  mainly    due  to  the amortisation  of  the  value  of  distribution  contracts  in  the UniCredit,  Bawag  and  Banco  Sabadell  networks,  as  well  as the  recognition  of  \u20ac40  million  representing  the  value  of client contracts as part of the Lyxor acquisition.\n\nGoodwill totalled  \u20ac6,730.9  million  as  of  31  December  2021 compared to \u20ac5,995.6 million as of 31 December 2020. The change  over  the  financial  year  was  mainly  due  to  the acquisition  of  Lyxor,  resulting  in  goodwill  of  \u20ac652.1  million, and exchange rate fluctuations during the period.\n\nGoodwill includes the following principal items:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac377.9 million of goodwill recognised upon the transfer by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez of its asset management business in December 2003;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2004 at the time of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s acquisition of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais for \u20ac1,732.8 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill related to the transfer of Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's asset management business in December 2009 for \u20ac707.8 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2015 at the time of the acquisition of Amundi Austria for \u20ac78.4 million;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recognised in 2016 following the acquisitions of  KBI  Global  Investors  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Immobilier Investors for a total of \u20ac159.9 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill  recognised  in  2017  following  the  acquisition  of Pioneer Investments for a total of \u20ac2,537.3 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill  recognised  in  2020  following  the  acquisition  of Sabadell AM for a total of \u20ac335.0 million.\n\nProvisions amounted  to  \u20ac126  million  as  of  31  December  2021 compared to \u20ac165 million as of 31 December 2020.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "In addition, it is noted that on 23 October 2015, the Amundi Group  signed  a  syndicated  multi-currency  revolving  credit agreement of \u20ac1,750 million  with  an  international  syndicate of lenders, with an initial maturity of five years from the date of  the  agreement  (renewed  in  October  2017  and  with maturity  on  23  October  2022).  The  purpose  of  this agreement  is  to  increase  the  Group's  liquidity  profile  in  all currencies  it  covers  and  to  secure  access  to  that  liquidity particularly if needed to deal with outflows in some funds. It includes  two  covenants,  for  which  the  requirements  were met as of 31 December 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 a minimum level of tangible equity. As of 31 December 2021, this amounted to \u20ac3.5 billion;\n- \u00b7 a level of financial leverage (gearing), being the ratio of net debt  to  tangible  equity.  This  gearing  ratio  was  -26.7%  as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## Note: definitions of debt:\n\nIt is specified that the net debt used to calculate the gearing is  contractually  defined  as  the  sum  of  financial  debt  less short-term  assets  (cash,  deposits  with  central  banks  and money market assets in the voluntary investment portfolio).\n\n## 4.5 OTHER INFORMATION\n\n## 4.5.1 Transactions with related parties\n\nThe  main  transactions  entered  into  with  related  parties  are described  in  note  9.2.3  'Related  parties'  to  the  condensed consolidated financial statements as of 31 December 2021.\n\nFurthermore, in accordance with Article L. 225-37-4, 2 of the French Commercial Code, the Corporate Governance report (which  will  be  included  in  Chapter  2  of  the  2021  Universal Registration  Document)  mentions  two  agreements  covered by  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  225-38  signed  in  2021  and submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval.\n\n## 4.5.2 Main risks and internal control\n\n## 4.5.2.1 Main risks\n\nIn accordance with Article L. 225-100-1, paragraphs 3 and 4, of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  a  description  of  the  main risks  and  uncertainties  facing  the  Company  is  presented  in Chapter  5  of  this  2021  Universal  Registration  Document (URD).\n\nFurthermore,  information  on  financial  risks  arising  from climate  change  and  a  presentation  of  the  measures  the Company is taking (CSR issues, Corporate Social Responsibility)  to  mitigate  these  by  applying  a  low-carbon strategy  are  set  out  in  Chapter  3  of  this  2021  Universal Registration Document (URD).\n\nCompared  to  the  net  financial  debt  from  an  economic perspective presented in the table above, the net debt used to calculate the gearing thus excludes voluntary investments in bonds  (line  c)  and  net  margin  calls  (line  e)  and  was -\u20ac938 million as of the end of December 2021.\n\nThe NSFR  (Net  Stable  Funding  Ratio) is  a  stock  ratio (whereas the LCR is a cash flow ratio) that compares assets that have an actual or potential maturity greater than one year with  liabilities  that  have  an  actual  or  potential  maturity greater than one year. The definition of the NSFR allocates a weighting  to  each  element  of  the  balance  sheet  (and  to certain off-balance sheet items) that reflects their potential to have a maturity greater than one year.\n\nThe Amundi Group is subject to European regulations on this matter (Regulation 575/2013 as amended by Regulation 2019/876 of  20  May  2019).  As  such,  Amundi  must  maintain  an  NSFR ratio  of  at  least  100%  from  28  June  2021.  Thus,  over  the second semester of 2021, the average NSFR ratio was 103%.\n\nThe statutory Auditors' Special Report dated 28 th March  2022,  as  incorporated  in  the  2021  Universal Registration Document in Chapter 8, 'Special report by the statutory auditors on regulated agreements', informs you of the signing of these two agreements covered by Article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code, describes their  essential  features  and  terms,  and  also  recalls  the presence of two agreements previously approved in previous financial years, the execution of which continued during the financial years 2021.\n\nAs  its  primary  function  is  asset  management,  essentially managing  assets  on  behalf  of  third  parties,  Amundi  is  not directly exposed to the risks associated with climate change.\n\n## 4.5.2.2 Internal control\n\nThe main features of the internal control and risk management  procedures  put  in  place  by  the  Company relating to the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information are presented in Chapter 5 of this 2021 Universal Registration Document (URD).\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Building on these foundations and given its  growth  prospects  in  the  passive  management  market, Amundi announced that it was aiming to achieve significant growth  (+50%)  in  its  assets  under  passive  management, with a target of \u20ac420 billion by the end of 2025 (3) .\n\nThe  beginning  of  January  2022  saw  the  launch  of  the integration  phase, with  team  mergers.  Its  implementation (IT migration,  legal  mergers,  etc.)  is  expected  to  be completed quickly, during the second and third quarters of 2022.\n\nThe  synergies  generated  by  this  integration  will  be  in  line with those announced in April 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 full-year  pre-tax  cost  synergies  are  expected  to  be \u20ac60 million from 2024;\n- \u00b7 full-year revenue synergies are expected  to  reach \u20ac30 million in 2025.\n\nGiven the high potential for synergies, this transaction will create significant value:\n\n- \u00b7 an  acquisition  price  representing  a  P/E  2021e  multiple  of ~9x (4) (with cost synergies alone);\n- \u00b7 a Return on Investment of more than 10% over three years (with cost synergies alone).\n\n## Lyxor - key figures\n\nLyxor had \u20ac148 billion of assets at the end of 2021, broken down as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac101  billion  in  ETFs;  Europe's  3 rd largest  player  with  a market share of 7.1% (5) ;\n- \u00b7 \u20ac46 billion under active management, including \u20ac25 billion in liquid alternative assets;\n- \u00b7 62%  of  assets  are  in  Retail  and  38%  are  with  Institutional clients.\n\nSolid inflows of +\u20ac12.1 billion in 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 +\u20ac8.3 billion in ETFs;\n- \u00b7 +\u20ac2.4 billion under liquid alternative management;\n- \u00b7 +\u20ac1.4 billion under conventional active management.\n\nLyxor - normalised (6) key figures for 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac216 million in revenues, including \u20ac203 million in management fees;\n- \u00b7 a normalised cost-to-income ratio of 72%;\n- \u00b7 normalised net income of \u20ac42 million.\n\n## 4.6.2 Successful development of Amundi Technology\n\nThe  ramp-up  of  Amundi  Technology  continued (with 39 clients  at  the  end  of  2021,  15  of  them  new).  A  particularly clear illustration of this was the selection of Alto Investment by  Malakoff  Humanis  (\u20ac54  billion  in  assets)  and  AG2R (\u20ac120  billion  in  assets).  The  ALTO (7) range  was  expanded with the addition of two modules (ESG and Asset Servicing).\n\nThe  increasingly  diverse  nature  and  international  appeal  of the  offering  were  further  illustrated  by  the  contract  secured with Bank of New York Mellon, which chose the ALTO Asset\n\nI\n\nServicing offering (the latest innovation in the ALTO range, with  the  ALTO  Sustainability  ESG  module)  for  the  global management  of  its  'depositary  control'  activity,  becoming the third client in two years, after Caceis and SGSS.\n\nAmundi  Technology's  income  totalled  \u20ac36  million  over 12 months and is growing strongly.",

        "page_content": "## 4.6.3 ESG objectives for 2018-2021 exceeded and announcement of new ESG objectives for 2025\n\nIn  ESG, Amundi confirmed its position as European market leader,  with  \u20ac847  billion (1) in  assets  under  management  at the end of 2021 .  More than \u20ac780 billion of this amount falls within  the  remit  of  Articles  8  &  9  of  the  SFDR  regulation (2) . Inflows  amounted  to  +\u20ac36.5  billion (3) .  When  the  2018-2021 ESG strategic plan ended, all commitments had been fulfilled.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, Amundi presented its  new  ESG  Plan, 'Ambition  2025' , which  aims  to  further  strengthen  its commitments,  both  through  the  savings  and  investment solutions it offers its clients and through the way it engages with companies. To ensure it stays on track, Amundi will also use  ESG  objectives  to  calculate  the  compensation  of  its  key executives  and  present  its  entire  climate  strategy  to  its shareholders.\n\n## 4.6.4 Planned IPO of SBI Funds Management\n\nHaving  reviewed  State  Bank  of  India's  proposal  (SBI)  to explore the possibility of an IPO of SBI Funds Management Private  Limited  (SBI  FM),  in  December  2021  Amundi announced its support for this initiative and its intention to sell approximately 4% of SBI FM's share capital in connection with this  IPO.  SBI  FMPL  is  currently  owned  by  SBI  (62.6%), Amundi (36.78%) and its employees (0.6%).\n\n## 4.6.5 Covid-19\n\nThe  Covid-19  epidemic  in  2020  was  a  severe  and  unique crisis  that  demonstrated  the  robust  nature  of  Amundi's business  model.  The  main  financial  impact  came  from  the sensitivity  of  the  managed  assets  to  the  fall  in  the  financial markets (equity, rates, etc.), with the resultant effect on their valuation and on net asset management revenues; the fall in the financial markets in 2020 also had a negative impact on the financial results.\n\nThis  listing  is  expected  to  take  place  on  the  Indian  stock exchange,  subject  to  regulatory  authorisations  and  market conditions.\n\nIn 2021,  the  financial  markets  bounced  back  strongly. Nevertheless,  the  scale  and  duration  of  this  crisis  remain difficult to predict.\n\nThis  section  was  updated  taking  into  account  the  situation  in  Russia  and  Ukraine,  following  the  closure  of  the  financial statements on 9 February 2022.\n\n## 4.6.6 Russia/Ukraine crisis\n\nAt the end of February 2022, tensions between Russia and Ukraine escalated into armed conflict, a crisis that resulted in a  fall  in  the  equity  markets  and  an  increase  in  volatility. Amundi  was  swift  to  adapt  its  operating  procedures, adopting a prudent investment policy, in particular. Amundi's exposure  to  the  Russian  and  Ukrainian  markets  is  very limited.\n\nThe scale  and  duration  of  this  crisis  are  difficult  to  predict. For Amundi, the main financial impact could come from the sensitivity  of  the  managed  assets  to  the  fall  in  the  global financial markets, with the resultant effect on their valuation and  on  net  asset  management  revenues.  The  increased uncertainty  could  also  affect  clients'  risk  appetite  and  thus Amundi's inflows.\n\n## 4.6.7 Appointment of a Deputy CEO\n\nOn March 30 th 2022, Amundi announced the appointment of Nicolas  Calcoen  as  Deputy  CEO  in  charge  of  Strategy, Finance and Control Department. Other appointments have\n\nI\n\nbeen announced. Those appointments took effect on April 1 st . Please refer to Amundi Press Release of March 30 th 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This  can  be  explained  firstly  by  an  improvement  in  income from  equity  investments  in  the  order  of  \u20ac580  million (including \u20ac499 million in dividend payments) and secondly, by a reduction in the order of \u20ac27 million in losses incurred on disposals of investment securities and similar.\n\nPre-tax income on ordinary activities was \u20ac915 million.\n\nAs part of its tax consolidation agreement, Amundi recorded a net income tax charge of \u20ac5 million.\n\nIn  total,  Amundi's  net  income  for  the  period  was  a  profit  of \u20ac920 million in 2021, compared with a profit of \u20ac324 million in 2020.\n\n## Amundi (parent company) five-year results\n\n| Type of indicator

        "page_content": "## 5.1 RISK CULTURE (AUDITED) (1)\n\nAsset  management is  primarily  a  risk  management  activity. Consequently, risk culture is essential to all of the Company's business units. Amundi constantly ensures that its organisation  and  its  processes  enable  it  to  identify  risks correctly  and  contain  them  at  each  stage  of  its  products' lives.  This  approach  is  characterised  by  the  sharing  of experiences  and  best  practices  in  terms  of  understanding and managing risk, facilitated by:\n\n- \u00b7 operating across business units;\n- \u00b7 ensuring the systematic representation of control functions (Risk  Management,  Compliance  and  Security)  within  the various committees:  products,  investments,  customer service, etc.;\n- \u00b7 combining the applications and risk measurement methods onto  a  single  IT  platform,  creating  a  set  of  guidelines shared by all teams;\n- \u00b7 establishing  initiatives  to  discuss  and  provide  information on the various risks related to the Company's business;\n- \u00b7 educating  employees  about  new  risks  that  appear  and changes  in  the  regulations governing  them,  through e-learning sessions.\n\nMaintaining  a  risk  culture  also  involves  educating  clients about  the  risks  to  which  their  assets  are  exposed.  Amundi puts  out  a  variety  of  publications  for  its  clients  which describe those risks and how they are affected by economic conditions,  along  with  the  solutions  put  in  place  by  the management teams to deal with them advantageously.\n\n## 5.2 RISK FACTORS (AUDITED) (1)(2)\n\nIn accordance with regulation (EU) 2017/1129, this section sets out the main risk factors to which Amundi is exposed. The table below provides a summary of these main risk factors, classified in decreasing order of critical importance within the different risk categories, taking into account the internal control system in place within Amundi.\n\n## MAIN RISKS BY TYPE\n\n## Risk associated with the asset management activity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                |                           | Financial risk                              | Financial risk                                         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Operational risk                                               | Activity risk             | Credit risk                                 | Market risk                                            |\n| I.

        "page_content": "## 5.2.1 Risk associated with the asset management activity\n\n## 5.2.1.1 Operational risk\n\nThe operational risks Amundi faces include primarily the risk of losses incurred as a result of the inadequacy or failure of processes,  systems  or  persons  responsible  for  processing transactions,  as  well  as  from  external  events,  whether deliberate,  accidental  or  natural  (floods,  fire,  earthquakes, terrorist  attacks,  etc.).  Amundi's  operational  risks  also  include legal  risk  in  connection  with  Amundi's  exposure  to  civil,\n\n## Risk\n\n## Potential consequences\n\n## I. Promises made to clients\n\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with investment rules.\n- \u00b7 Failure to align management with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients.\n- \u00b7 Decrease in fund liquidity.\n\n## II. Process failure, human error\n\n- \u00b7 Incident resulting from the failure of an operational process.\n- \u00b7 Human error.\n- III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAmundi's primary business is asset management and, consequently, it is governed by the various regulatory frameworks associated with this activity. Amundi is also classified as a credit institution and is therefore also subject to monitoring by the banking supervisory authorities. As a consequence, Amundi is exposed to:\n\n- \u00b7 developments and increases in regulatory requirements;\n- \u00b7 regulatory reforms that could have an impact on Amundi's clients (banks, insurance companies or pension funds), encouraging them to review their investment strategies;\n- \u00b7 non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or any change in the interpretation or implementation of these.\n\n## IV. Risk of business interruption\n\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of information systems (loss of hardware, viral attack, crashing of a database, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of the working environment (inaccessibility of the site, failure of technical equipment).\n- \u00b7 Unavailability of personnel (public transport strike, epidemic, flood, etc.).\n\n## I. Promises made to clients\n\nThe  risk  associated  with  managing  assets  for  a  third  party arises  from  a  failure  to  align  management  practices  with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients.\n\nThe  vast  majority  of  risks  related  to  investments  made  on behalf of third parties are borne by the clients. As such, the main  risk  is  the  liquidity  risk  in  relation  to  the  liabilities  of open-ended funds.\n\nFailure to comply with the investment rules could result in:\n\n- \u00b7 the implementation of support measures in the event of a lack of liquidity on certain asset classes to enable clients to withdraw their investment;\n- \u00b7 having  to  compensate  clients  in  the  event  of  adverse market  developments  as  a  result  of  non-compliance  with investment constraints;\n- \u00b7 a penalty imposed by the regulator.\n- \u00b7 Client compensation.\n- \u00b7 Penalty applied by the regulator.\n- \u00b7 Ad hoc support measures.\n- \u00b7 Client compensation.\n- \u00b7 Penalty applied by the regulator.\n- \u00b7 Complying with these requirements is costly and may impact Amundi's growth.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory reforms could have an impact on Amundi's clients and encourage them to review their investment strategies to the detriment of Amundi and/or reduce client interest in Amundi products, leading to an adverse impact on assets under management and its earnings.\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance with laws and regulations may result in sanctions, bans on certain business activities, a loss of clients or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on Amundi's reputation and its earnings, as applicable.\n- \u00b7 Non-availability of IT systems (cyber-attack or other) preventing the completion of market transactions.\n- \u00b7 Potential losses from breaches\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the risks relating to non-compliance with investment rules and from failure to align management practices with (implicit or explicit) promises made to clients accounted  for  32%  of  RWA  (Risk-Weighted  Assets)  in respect of operational risk.\n\n## II. Risk of process failure, human error\n\nAmundi's communication and information systems, as well as those  of  its  clients,  service  providers  and  counterparties, may be subject to operational failure. It is also impossible to totally exclude the risk of someone making an unintentional error while they are performing a task. The consequences of operational  failure  or  human  error  vary  depending  on  the type  of  incident,  it  could  be  a  matter  of  compensating  a client,  penalties  imposed  by  the  regulator,  damage  to Amundi's reputation, etc.\n\nAs  of  31  December  2021,  the  risks  relating  to  failure  of  an operational  process  or  human  error  accounted  for  53%  of RWA in respect of operational risk.\n\nI\n\nadministrative  or  criminal  proceedings,  non-compliance  risk  in connection with failure to comply with the regulatory and legal provisions  or  with  the  ethical  standards  that  govern  its activities, and reputational risk that may arise as a result of this.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the volume of assets weighted for operational risk was \u20ac5.6 billion out of a total of \u20ac14 billion in risk-weighted assets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## III. Non-compliance, tax, regulatory and legal risk\n\nAmundi  is  an  international  group  operating  in  numerous countries. Asset management  (including  Lyxor  assets acquired  on  31  December  2021)  is  Amundi's  core  business activity.  The  Group  primarily  operates  in  Europe  with \u20ac1,562 billion in assets under management as of 31 December 2021  (\u20ac999  billion  in  France,  \u20ac215  billion  in  Italy  and \u20ac347 billion in the rest of Europe), while Asia and the rest of the world account for \u20ac372 billion and \u20ac130 billion in assets under management, respectively. As their principal business is asset management, the asset management companies that make  up  most  of  the  Amundi  Group  are  subject  to regulatory and supervisory regimes in each of the countries in  which  Amundi operates. Equally, certain Amundi entities, as  authorised  credit  institutions  or  investment  companies, are  subject  to  regulation  by  the  banking  supervisory authorities. Moreover, as a significant subsidiary of a banking group,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group,  Amundi  is  subject  to additional bank regulatory requirements.\n\nThese  regulations  subject  Amundi's  business  activities  to  a pervasive array of detailed operational requirements. Complying with these requirements is costly and may impact Amundi's growth.\n\nRegulatory  reforms  could  also  affect  some  of  Amundi's clients, such as banking, insurance and pension fund clients, which could cause them to review their investment strategies or allocations to the detriment of Amundi and/or to reduce their interest in Amundi's products. These potential regulatory  reforms  could  therefore  have  a  material  adverse effect on Amundi's assets under management, earnings and financial position.\n\nNon-compliance  by  Amundi  with  applicable  laws  or regulations, or any  changes  in  the  interpretation  or application  of  these,  could  result  in  the  imposition  of sanctions,  temporary  or  permanent  bans  on  conducting certain business activities, a loss of clients or other penalties that  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  Amundi's  reputation and, consequently, a material adverse effect on its business and earnings.\n\nAmundi has structured its commercial and financial activities to comply with the tax regulations that apply to it. Since it is not  always  possible  to  draw  clear-cut  and  definitive interpretations of the tax legislation of the various countries in  which  the  Amundi  entities  are  located  or  operate,  the Group cannot guarantee that its tax affairs will not be subject to  challenge  by  the  relevant  tax  authorities.  In  general,  any breach  of  the  tax  legislation  of  a  particular  country  could result  in  tax  adjustments  and,  if  applicable,  penalties,  fines and interest on arrears.\n\nIn  addition,  the  tax  legislation  of  the  various  countries  in which the Amundi entities are located or operate is subject to  change  (particularly  in  the  event  of  changes  in  the position  of  the  tax  authorities  and/or  the  interpretation  of the law by a court).\n\nI\n\nThese  various  risk  factors  may  result  in  an  increase  in Amundi's tax burden and have a material adverse effect on its business, its earnings and its financial position.\n\n## IV. Risk of business interruption\n\nAmundi's infrastructure is crucial to its competitiveness. This infrastructure includes its technological  capacity,  data centres  and  work  spaces.  A  significant  proportion  of Amundi's  critical  activities  are  concentrated  in  a  limited number  of  geographical  areas,  primarily  Paris,  but  also London,  Tokyo,  Hong  Kong,  Singapore  and  Boston  (United States).  External  events,  whether  deliberate,  accidental  or natural,  could  impact  Amundi's  ability  to  operate.  Such events could include:\n\n- \u00b7 unavailability  of  the  local  work  environment  due  to  site inaccessibility (one building or a group of buildings) or the failure of technical equipment (blackout, dead telecommunications devices, etc.);\n- \u00b7 unavailability of personnel due to a public transport strike, epidemic, flood, etc.;\n- \u00b7 physical  unavailability  of  the  information  systems  caused by  the  physical  destruction  of  data  centre  hardware  or devices giving network access to the Data Centre;\n- \u00b7 unavailability of data centre software caused by malicious act, error or accident (virus attack, hacking, accidental destruction of a database or a database-altering computer bug);\n- \u00b7 widespread  unavailability  of  workstations  caused,  for example, by a massive virus infecting the workstations.\n\nDespite Amundi's efforts to ensure business continuity in the event of such an incident, there could be an adverse impact on  its  ability  to  operate,  which  could  lead  to  a  drop  in  the volume  of  assets  under  management  or  a  reduction  in  its earnings. Such an incident could also impact Amundi's ability to comply with its regulatory obligations, which could affect its  reputation,  or  result  in  regulatory  sanctions  or  fines.  In addition,  a  breakdown  or  failure  of  Amundi's  information systems  could  affect  its  ability  to  determine  the  net  asset value  of  the  funds  it  manages,  making  it  vulnerable  to complaints from its clients and harming its reputation.\n\nAmundi  is  exposed  to  cybercrime  targeting  its  clients, suppliers and partners as well as its own infrastructure and IT data.  The  interconnection  between  the  various  market undertakings and the concentration of these increase the risk of an impact on Amundi in the event of an attack targeting one  of  the  links  in  this  chain,  particularly  given  the complexity of the systems that must be coordinated within tight deadlines.",

Business risk\n\nThe vast majority of Amundi's revenue came  from management fees calculated according to the assets under management. Its  earnings  are  therefore  sensitive  to  factors that impact the performance of its assets:\n\n- \u00b7 The value of financial instruments could decrease (direct impact  on  the  value  of  assets  under  management  and indirect impact on deposit-taking).\n\nThe volume of assets under management largely depends on the value of the assets held in the funds and portfolios managed by Amundi, in particular bonds, equities, money market products, currencies and real assets.\n\nFluctuations in the financial markets, particularly movements  in  interest  rates,  credit  spreads,  exchange rates  and  the  value  of  equities  may  lead  to  significant variations in the value of the assets managed by Amundi. Adverse  movements  in  the  financial  markets  may  also reduce  the  amount  of  new  investment  and  result  in investors withdrawing assets from the funds and portfolios Amundi manages, further impacting the volume of assets under management and therefore Amundi's revenue.\n\n- \u00b7 In France, Amundi is dependent on the distribution networks of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale groups.\n\nAmundi  focuses  on  two  client  segments:  individual  and institutional  investors.  The  individual  investor  segment includes the distribution of savings solutions for clients of partner  networks  in  France  and  abroad  and  third  party distributors.\n\nIn France, Amundi is supported by the networks of banks affiliated  to  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale groups, with which it has distribution agreements guaranteeing  it  quasi-exclusivity  in  the  distribution  of  a significant portion of its products. As of 31 December 2021, the products distributed in France under these distribution agreements  amounted  to  \u20ac128  billion  in  assets  under management. If one of these contracts were to terminate and not be renewed, Amundi's assets under management could be significantly (but gradually) reduced.\n\nOn  the  international front, Amundi  has  a  10-year distribution  agreement,  in  place  since  2017,  with  the UniCredit  network  in  Italy,  Germany,  Austria  and  Eastern Europe. In addition, Amundi remains the preferred supplier for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  networks  in Italy (CA Italie), the Czech Republic (Komer\u010dn\u00ed Banka) and Poland  (CA  Polska).  Amundi  is  also  in  partnership  with BAWAG  P.S.K.  in  Austria,  Resona  in  Japan  and  Banco Sabadell  in  Spain.  As  of  31  December  2021,  the  products distributed through international partner distribution networks  amounted  to  \u20ac174  billion  in  assets  under management. At the end of 2020, Amundi also created a new subsidiary in China with Bank of China.\n\nThis  distribution  capacity  is  supplemented  by  third-party distributors, private banks and asset management advisors. As of 31 December 2021, the products distributed through these third-party distributors amounted  to \u20ac324 billion of Amundi's assets under management.\n\nFurthermore,  Amundi  is  a  shareholder  in  joint  ventures operating in India, China, South Korea and Morocco. As of 31 December 2021, the products distributed through these joint ventures amounted to \u20ac286 billion of Amundi's assets under management.\n\nThese agreements may be terminated or not renewed for commercial  or  legal  reasons.  Furthermore,  these  thirdparty distributors that distribute Amundi products are not bound by any exclusivity clause. In other words, if a bank in this  distribution  network  were  to  decide  to  replace Amundi's  products  with  those  of  a  competitor,  or  to reduce  the  resources  dedicated  to  promoting  and distributing  Amundi's  products,  or  if  it  were  to  charge higher fees for the distribution of Amundi's products, this could  have  an  adverse  impact  on  Amundi's  assets  under management and its earnings. In addition, factors affecting the  competitive  environment  or  the  reputation  of  these distribution  networks,  as  well  as  any  potential  default  by these  entities,  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  Amundi's reputation and earnings.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## \u00b7 Management fee rates are subject to competitive pressure and market pressure.\n\nAmundi's management fees are usually a percentage of its assets under management and vary according to the type of  product,  the  geographic  market  and  other  factors.  In 2021,  the  revenue  generated  by  fees  and  other  income from  customer  activities  amounted  to  \u20ac2.786  billion (excluding performance fees).\n\nFees are subject to intense competitive pressure: the fees charged  on  Retail  products  must  be  disclosed  in accordance  with  the  regulations  in  force,  and  those charged  to  institutional  investors  are  usually  determined by a formal competitive process. The fees applied on the asset management market have been subject to significant competitive  pressure  in  recent  years.  A  reduction  in  the scale  of  fees  would  have  a  direct  and  adverse  effect  on Amundi's earnings.\n\nAmundi  operates  in  a  fiercely  competitive  environment: Amundi is the largest European asset manager in terms of assets  under  management and is one of the top 10 asset management companies worldwide (source: IPE 'Top 500 Asset Managers', published in June 2021, based on assets under  management  at  the  end  of  December  2020).  The asset management industry is highly competitive and entry barriers  are  moderate.  Amundi's  main  competitors  are asset  management  companies,  insurance  companies  and financial services companies, many  of  which  offer investment  products  that  are  similar  to  those  offered  by Amundi.  Competition  within  the  industry  is  driven  by several factors, including the performance of investments, the level of fees charged, the quality and diversity of the services and products provided, the image and reputation of the company, the effectiveness of distribution channels and the ability to develop new investment strategies and new  products  to  meet  the  changing  needs  of  investors. Individual  investors  are  faced  with  a  wide  range  of investments from which to choose, and even more so now with the ever-expanding  online  investment  offering. Furthermore, institutional investors generally select managers  through  a  competitive  bidding  process.  This increasingly intense competition could result in a fall in the volume  of  assets  managed  by  Amundi  and  therefore  its results, particularly if it results in reduced fees. Furthermore, where its activities in the issue of structured EMTNs are concerned, Amundi faces competition from the largest French  and  international  banking  groups.  In addition,  new  domestic  and  international  operators  may enter  the  markets  in  which  Amundi  operates  and,  in  so doing,  intensify  competition,  which  could  have  a  material adverse effect on Amundi's business, earnings and outlook. Finally, products marketed as asset management products are  in  competition  with  other  categories  of  investment offered to investors (various marketable securities, bonds, regulated  and  unregulated  savings  products,  property investments, etc.).\n\nI\n\nIn  addition,  many  competitors  offer  products  that  are similar  or  comparable  to  those  offered  by  Amundi.  If competitors'  products  fail  or  perform  badly,  this  could result in a loss of confidence in Amundi's similar products, regardless of how they perform. Any loss of confidence in a given product type could lead to withdrawals, redemptions  and  liquidity  problems  for  those  products, which could adversely affect Amundi, resulting in a fall in its assets under management and reduced earnings.\n\n- \u00b7 Demand  from  Amundi's  clients  depends  on  factors  that are beyond its control and have an overall impact on the asset management market.\n\nExternal factors such as the macroeconomic, health or tax environment  could  affect  investors'  willingness  to  save and/or  invest  in  financial  products  and,  consequently, reduce investors' interest in financial products as a whole or  in  Amundi  products.  These  changes,  the  extent  and implications  of  which  are  unpredictable,  could  have  a material adverse  impact  on  Amundi's  assets  under management and its revenue.\n\n- \u00b7 Amundi's  inability  to  recruit  and  retain  its  employees could result in the loss of clients and provoke a drop in its assets under management.\n\nAmundi's success depends on the talent and hard work of its highly-qualified employees and on its ability to plan for the  Company's  long-term  future  growth,  by  identifying employees who may ultimately play key roles at Amundi. The  market  for  portfolio  managers,  investment  analysts, product specialists, sales staff and other qualified professionals  is  competitive,  and  the  factors  that  affect Amundi's ability to attract and retain these employees are, in particular, its reputation, the compensation and benefits it  offers,  and  its  commitment  to  the  effective  planning  of management  succession,  including  by  developing  and training qualified employees. If Amundi is unable to do this, its ability  to  maintain  its  competitiveness  and  retain existing clients could be affected, and this could result in a reduction in assets under management and in its earnings.\n\n- \u00b7 Damage to Amundi's reputation could result in a decrease in its assets under management, its revenue, and its earnings.\n\nThe integrity of Amundi's brand image and reputation is of crucial importance to its ability to attract and retain clients, commercial partners and employees. Amundi's reputation could  be  damaged  by  factors  such  as  poor  investment performance,  legal  proceedings,  action  taken  by  a regulator,  misconduct  or  violation  of  applicable  laws  or regulations.  Negative  publicity  in  relation  to  any  of  these factors  could  damage  Amundi's  reputation,  expose  it  to regulatory  sanctions  and  have  an  adverse  impact  on  its relations  with  clients,  third-party  distributors  and  other commercial  partners.  Any  damage  to  Amundi's  brand image could have a negative impact on its status within the industry and would result in a loss of business in both the short and long terms.",

Over the past few years, Amundi has strengthened  and  expanded  its  approach  to  include  the identification and  assessment  of  physical  climate  and transition risks in the key indicators that are considered.\n\nIn 2018, Amundi announced the establishment of an objective to incorporate non-financial (ESG) criteria into its investment  processes  for  discretionary  active  management (actively  managed  open-ended  funds  should  have  an  ESG performance objective greater than that of their benchmark universe  where  this  is  technically  possible).  Since  then, Amundi  has  continued  to  expand  its  ESG  offering.  As  a result,  Amundi  held  more  than  \u20ac840  billion  in  Responsible Investment assets as of the end of December 2021, including some  850  funds  and  financial  products  categorised  under Article  8  or  9,  in  compliance  with  the  Sustainable  Finance Disclosure  Regulation  (see  Chapter  3  for  the  details  of Amundi's corporate social responsibility and ESG measures).\n\nand banking counterparties. Amundi is also exposed to credit risk on its investment portfolio.\n\nAs  of  31  December  2021,  RWA  for  credit  risk  (excluding threshold allowances and CVA) stood at \u20ac5.9 billion out of a total RWA of \u20ac14 billion.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## I. Default risk\n\nAmundi is exposed to default risk on its investment portfolio as well as through guarantees given on some of the products it offers to clients. This risk is monitored continuously by the Credit  Analysis  team  of  the  Risk  Management  Department which alerts the Credit Committee if the financial condition of an  issuer  or  counterparty  deteriorates.  The  Credit Committee  sets  the  individual  limits  on  issuer  risk  for securities  held  directly  or  by  the  guaranteed  funds.  It  also sets the counterparty risk limits on market transactions.\n\nStructured  funds  benefiting  from  guarantees  granted  by Amundi  mainly  consist  of  three  types:  structured  funds, constant  proportion  portfolio  insurance  (CPPI)  funds  and Italian pension funds.\n\nStructured funds are intended to deliver a predefined return, based on a formula that is usually linked to share prices or indexes.  The  structure  usually  includes  a  form  of  capital protection.\n\nCPPI  funds are  intended  to  offer  partial  exposure  to  the returns of risky assets, along with a guarantee that is defined at the outset.\n\nItalian  pension funds are  designed to protect the capital of subscribers until retirement age (except in the case of early exit).\n\nThe  following  table  shows  amounts  guaranteed  as  of 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020:\n\n| In \u20ac millions                                        | 31/12/2021   | 31/12/2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Structured funds                                     | 5,288        | 7,064        |\n| Constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds | 5,866        | 6,052        |\n| Italian pension funds                                | 2,888        | 3,050        |\n| Other guaranteed funds                               | 4,218        | 2,076        |\n| TOTAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS                  | 18,260       | 18,242       |\n\nThe  liability  relating  to  these  funds  corresponds  to  the amount of risk to which the Amundi Group as guarantor is exposed on the measurement date. Depending on the types of  funds  and  the  form  of  the  guarantee,  it  is  linked  to  the amount  initially  invested  or  the  value  of  assets  under management on the date the liability is measured, or to the specified structure in the case of structured funds.\n\nThe Risk Management Department continuously monitors the adequacy of assets held relative to returns due from the funds.\n\nFund assets may comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 direct acquisition of debt obligations;\n- \u00b7 acquisition of equities whose  performance  may  be swapped with top-tier banks;\n- \u00b7 repurchase agreements with top-tier banks;\n- \u00b7 purchase of fund units (multi-asset investments).\n\nExcept for the Italian pension funds, the main risk to which the guarantor is exposed in relation to these funds is the risk of default on securities acquired directly by the fund.\n\nAssets  that  expose  the  guarantor  to  credit  risk  are permanently  monitored  by  an  independent  credit  analysis team within the Risk Management Department. Exposures for each issuer are subject to limits set by the Credit Committee. Exposures  are  monitored  on  the  basis  of  their  nominal amount. The credit quality measurement process includes an internal system that gives a ranking based on issuer quality.\n\nAssets exposing the guarantor to credit risk are subject to:\n\n- \u00b7 prior authorisation of each investment from the independent credit analysis team. The exposure for each issuer has limits placed upon it. There is no sector or geographic restriction a  priori  but  the  assets  must  be  rated  at  least  investment grade at the time they are acquired;\n- \u00b7 monthly reports in terms of exposure, limits and ratings.\n\nI\n\n## II. Counterparty risk on market transactions\n\nTo  ensure  that  clients  receive  the  promised  returns  in structured vehicles (structured funds or structured EMTNs), derivative  agreements  are  entered  into  with  external  bank counterparties  selected  through  a  tender  process.  As  of 31 December 2021, the total nominal amount of transactions concluded between  Amundi  Finance  and  its  market counterparties was \u20ac39.6 billion.\n\nOnce  the  funds  and  the  EMTNs  have  been  sold,  the transactions  are  hedged  so  as  to  only  create  limited  market risk. However, they do result in liquidity and counterparty risk.\n\nThe notional amount of the performance swaps on funds and EMTNs  being  marketed  as  of  31  December  2021  was \u20ac709 million compared to \u20ac485 million at 31 December 2020. Performance swaps are written with market counterparties in a  notional  amount  equal  to  the  projected  level  of  sales.  The fund  is  committed  only  to  the  actual  level  of  sales.  Amundi bears  the  risk  of  a  variance  between  the  projected  level  of sales  and  the  actual  level.  These  are  short-term  liabilities (average  marketing  time  is  three  months).  A  provision appraised  by  experts  is  recognised  on  the  reporting  date should there be a variance in current transactions between the projected level of sales and the actual level. No provision had been made as of 31 December 2021.\n\nTo reduce the funds' counterparty risk associated with these transactions  -  to  which  Amundi  is  exposed  as  guarantor  Amundi  deals  with  the  counterparties  on  its  own  account. These  are  all  large  financial  institutions.  These  transactions are  centralised  by  Amundi  Finance,  an  Amundi  subsidiary that specialises in guarantee activity. Counterparties used for derivatives  brokerage  are  pre-authorised  by  the  Credit Committee which sets the limits of separate exposures. The transactions  are  executed  under  master  agreements  with exchange of collateral, which substantially reduces Amundi's counterparty risk.",

        "page_content": "Although transactions are executed under master agreements with  exchange  of  collateral  in  order  to  reduce  Amundi's counterparty  risk,  Amundi  may  nevertheless  incur  significant losses in the event of default by major counterparties. In the event  that  one  or  more  of  the  financial  institutions  defaults, Amundi  should  complete  these  transactions  and  seek  other counterparties  in  order  to  enter  into  new  transactions.  In addition, Amundi's credit risk may be amplified if the collateral held by Amundi cannot be sold or is liquidated at a price that is  not sufficient to recover the amount owed to Amundi as a result of its exposure to derivatives.\n\n## III. Equity investment risk\n\nWhen  it  makes  strategic  equity  investments  in  the  share capital  of  a  company,  Amundi's  degree  of  control  may  be limited  and  any  disagreement  with  other  shareholders  or with the management of the entity concerned could have an adverse impact on Amundi's ability to influence the policies of that entity. Amundi is exposed to the risk that the value of the capital securities it holds could fall.\n\nInterests in equity-accounted entities amounted to \u20ac385 million as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## IV.

Risk of price fluctuations in the investment portfolio\n\nThe  investment  portfolio  includes  surplus  capital  voluntary investments and seed money. Seed money is used to launch new funds. Portfolios mainly consist of investments in funds managed by Amundi and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe investment portfolio is supervised by:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Seed  Money  Committee,  which  meets  monthly  to validate and  monitor  Seed  Money  investments  and divestments;\n- \u00b7 the Financial Management Committee, which meets up to twice per quarter and establishes guidelines pertaining to the  voluntary  investments  portfolio  and  ensures  the monitoring of the risk structure of the investment portfolio; overall portfolio investment limits as well as limits for each underlying  asset  are  set  by  the  Risk  Management Department annually.\n\nFor most French entities, day-to-day cash management (relating to the Company's operations) is governed by a centralised cash management agreement. The voluntary investment and seed money portfolios are largely managed centrally at the Group level.\n\nI\n\nThe  investment  portfolio  is  principally  divided  into  fixedincome  and  money  market  exposures  as  detailed  in  table 4.1.2 of this Universal Registration Document.\n\nFluctuations in the financial markets, particularly movements in  interest  rates,  issuer  credit  spreads,  exchange  rates  and the value of equities may lead to significant variations in the value  of  Amundi's  own  investments  and  affect  its  net revenue and/or capital. Market risk is measured by Value at Risk  (VaR),  a  statistical  measure  used  to  estimate  the financial risk level of an investment portfolio. VaR represents the  potential  loss  over  a  given  holding  period  at  a  given confidence  level.  Amundi's  VaR  is  a  historical  VaR.  Amundi measures  VaR  at  a  99%  confidence  level  and  a  20-day holding  period,  based  on  a  historical  observation  period  of one year. It amounted to \u20ac13 million as of 31 December 2021.\n\nOther  indicators  are  also  used  to  monitor  the  portfolio: unrealised  capital  gains  or  losses,  sensitivity  to  changes  in interest  rates,  spreads,  and  share  prices  and  historical  and hypothetical stress indicators.",

        "page_content": "## II. Foreign exchange risk\n\nAmundi's  primary  exposure  to  foreign  exchange  risk  is structural,  related  to  its  investments  in  foreign  subsidiaries and  joint  ventures.  Amundi's  policy  is  not  to  systematically hedge  against  all  such  exposure.  Although  Amundi's currency  positions  are  not  significant, exchange  rate fluctuations  could  affect  Amundi's  earnings  and  financial position.\n\nIn  2021  it  was  decided  to  hedge  the  most  significant exposures (in USD, JPY and GBP) with a view to optimising hedging costs in relation to the impact of this risk, in order to immunise  the  CET1  ratio  against  this  risk.  These  hedges amounted to \u20ac224 million as of 31 December 2021.\n\nOperational  foreign  exchange  positions  are  subject  to  a global limit. This limit requires foreign-currency revenues to be  regularly  converted  into  euros.  It  also  requires  any foreign-currency  investment  made  in  connection  with  the investment  portfolio  to  be  hedged.  Amundi's  operational foreign exchange positions are not material.\n\n## III. Real estate risk\n\nSince the end of 2013, Amundi has developed a business in issuing index-linked bonds:\n\n- \u00b7 bonds  whose  structure  is  linked  to  the  equity  markets: these issues are hedged by derivatives and pose no market risk for Amundi;\n- \u00b7 bonds whose structure is benchmarked in part to the real estate  market:  these  issues  are  hedged  using  the  same principles as equity-linked issues, but they expose Amundi to the risk of changes in real estate prices, because of the capital guarantee attached to them. This type of risk has its own set of restrictions.\n\nAs  of  31  December  2021,  the  nominal  amount  of  structured securities issues amounted to \u20ac8,914 million, including \u20ac1,167 million in bonds that were partly indexed to real estate.\n\nAmundi  invests  a  proportion  of  the  income  from  these securities  in  units  of  real  estate  investment  funds  managed by one of its entities. These securities expose Amundi to real estate risk, given that it is usually obliged to pay the principal of the securities on maturity, irrespective of the performance of the underlying real estate investment funds.\n\nTo a lesser extent, Amundi may be exposed to liquidity risk, as it  may  be  unable  to  sell  shares/units  of  the  underlying  funds sufficiently  quickly  to  generate  the  liquidity  required  to  meet redemption requests, particularly in times of market disruption.\n\n## 5.3 RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## 5.3.1 Internal control and risk management system\n\nAmundi's internal control system notably complies with the provisions  of  the  French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code (Article L. 511-41), the Order of 3 November 2014 concerning the  internal  control  of  companies  in  the  banking,  payment services and investment services sector, which are subject to regulation  by  the  Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  et  de r\u00e9solution (ACPR),  the  AMF  General  Regulation  and guidelines on corporate governance, particularly those issued by the European Banking Authority and the Basel Committee.\n\nThe structure of the internal control system also consistently conforms to the guidelines laid down by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. and the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, which are aimed at ensuring a consolidated approach to risk as part of the controls carried out  by  the  Group,  the  majority  shareholder.  These  external guidelines  are  supplemented  by  Amundi's  own  charters, standards  and  internal  procedures  in  the  areas  of  risk monitoring, including IT and accounting, compliance checks and internal audit.\n\nThe  internal  control  system  applies  equally  to  all  Amundi Group  entities  and  covers  the  management  and  control  of activities, as well as the measurement and monitoring of risk. The system implemented by Amundi is adapted to suit the various operational units and subsidiaries depending on their specialist areas,  and  particularly  with  regard  to  their regulatory obligations.\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the risk appetite framework and the risk limits that apply to the Group. The governance of  the  internal  control  system  stipulates  that  the  Board  of Directors'  Risk  Management  Committee  is  to  systematically report back the results of controls and significant incidents in light of this framework.\n\nThe  resources,  tools  and  reports  used  in  this  regulatory environment mean that Senior Management and the Board of Directors can be given regular reports on the functioning of the internal control system and its adequacy with regard to the Group's risk profile.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is implemented by all operational units  under  their  hierarchy.  Level  1  Permanent  Control  is designed  to  ensure  compliance  with  internal  procedures relating  to  the  operational  processes,  and  their  compliance with current laws and regulations, professional standards and codes of conduct. It makes it possible to prevent or detect any risk arising as a result of Amundi's activities.\n\nThe  executives  of  the  operational  units  are  individually responsible  for  managing  the  risk  associated  with  their activities.  They  are  responsible  for  the  definition,  efficient deployment and regular updating of the Permanent Control system within their units.\n\nThe  control  system  takes  into  account  the  regulatory framework  and  internal  procedures.  It  is  understood  that these procedures must evolve and be adapted to our clients' expectations. They must take into account improvements that are expected in relation to any actual or potential incidents, as well as the recommendations made by Internal Audit.\n\nI\n\nThe  operational  units  obtain  the  resources  necessary  to perform  these  controls  and  regularly  communicate  the results  to  the  Department  to  which  they  report,  the  Risk Management Department, the Compliance Department, and the Security Department.\n\nThey prepare reports to their hierarchy at least once a year, including  a  list  of  the  key  indicators  and  controls  used  to monitor  the  risks  to  which  they  are  exposed,  as  well  as  a summary of the results of the controls carried out.\n\nIn  the  event  of  the  significant  deterioration  of  a  risk,  the operational units alert their hierarchy without delay, as well as the control functions.\n\nThe  quality  and  relevance  of  the  Level  1  controls  and  the effective relaying of their results for Level 2 control functions is an essential factor in the efficiency of Level 2 controls.\n\nThe design of the internal control system relies on two main cornerstones:\n\n- \u00b7 systems  for  the  measurement,  monitoring  and  control  of risk: financial risk, operational risk (operational processing, accounting and financial information, information systems), legal risk and non-compliance risk;\n- \u00b7 Level  1  Permanent  Control  system  is  carried  out  by  the operational units, Level 2 Permanent Control is ensured by the Risk, Compliance, and Security functions and periodic controls are performed by Internal Audit.\n\nAmundi's  internal  control  system  covers  all  of  the  Group within  France  and  internationally,  except  for  the  joint ventures in which Amundi holds a minority interest.",

        "page_content": "## Level 2 Permanent Control\n\nLevel  2  Permanent  Control  is  performed  jointly  by  three control functions, which are independent from the operational units:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management function;\n- \u00b7 the Compliance function;\n- \u00b7 the Security function.\n\nCollectively,  these  three  functions  are  responsible  for  the cooperative  and  coordinated  management  of  the  entire Permanent  Control  system  to  verify  that  it  provides comprehensive  cover  of  the  risks  Amundi  is  exposed  to. These  control  functions  report  to  the  Company's  Second Executive Director, the Head of Amundi's Business Support and Control Division.\n\n## Coordination within Amundi as a whole\n\nAmundi's  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security Departments are responsible  for  the  overall  steering  of  the Permanent Control system of the Amundi Group. Accordingly,  they  define  the  approach  and  principles  for implementation  within  the  Group's  various  entities.  They coordinate  the  control  plans  and  organise  the  reporting  of the findings.\n\nThe  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security  functions act  in  a  collective  and  complementary  manner  in  their respective fields of competence by ensuring the consistency and  effectiveness  of  the  controls  carried  out  by  the operational departments.\n\nThe  Risk  Management,  Compliance,  and  Security  functions take  into  account  the  Level  1  controls  implemented  by  the business  units  and  the  resulting  reports  relayed  when defining  their  own  Level  2  controls.  The  frequency  and comprehensiveness of these Level 2 controls depend on the annual risk assessment and mapping exercise carried out by each of the three functions.\n\nLevel 2 control functions are not a substitute for the Level 1 controls carried out by the operational departments.\n\nThe Risk Management function is responsible for monitoring the risk to which Amundi is exposed on its own account and as manager on behalf of third parties, with the exception of non-compliance risk and IT risk.\n\nIn this regard, the Risk Management function:\n\n- \u00b7 continuously checks that the company and its clients are not exposed to financial risk beyond their risk tolerance;\n- \u00b7 ensures that investment constraints are complied with;\n- \u00b7 checks that operational risk is controlled.\n\nThe Compliance function is  responsible for monitoring noncompliance  risk  and  continuously  ensures  compliance  with legislative  or  regulatory  provisions  and  professional  and ethical standards, particularly in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 market integrity;\n- \u00b7 financial security;\n- \u00b7 protection for clients and unitholders;\n- \u00b7 professional ethics;\n- \u00b7 prevention of fraud and corruption.\n\nIn this context,  the  Compliance  function  checks  that employees have a minimum level of knowledge regarding the regulatory and ethical environment and financial techniques.\n\nThe Security function is  responsible  for  monitoring  the  risk associated  with  the  information  system  (IT  infrastructure, applications and data) as well as the risk relating to personal data  protection  (under  the  European  regulations  on  the handling  of  personal  data  and  the  free  circulation  of  these data), business continuity, and the protection of persons and property.\n\n## Consolidated performance indicators for the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group\n\nThe  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  has  established  a  set  of  key indicators  (consolidated  Level  2  controls,  classified  as  2.2c controls) in various fields, which include: Credit risk, financial risk, accounting risk, non-compliance risk, business continuity plan, security safety prevention, IT risk, and operational risk.\n\nAn  individual  responsible  for  each  category  is  appointed within Amundi to establish the relevant indicators using the 2.2c  indicators  proposed  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  as  a methodological  benchmark.  This  is  done  for  all  Amundi Group  entities.  This  individual  retains  the  audit  trail  of  the controls completed and the results obtained.\n\nAmundi's  Risk  Management  Department  is  in  charge  of coordinating  the  collection  and  consolidation  of  the  results of  controls  carried  out  based  on  indicators  defined  by  the individuals  responsible  for  each  category  on  behalf  of Amundi, and providing them to Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.\n\n## Level 3 controls\n\nAmundi's Internal Audit is in charge of the Group's periodic control; it ensures the lawfulness, security and effectiveness of all operations and risk control activities across all Amundi entities. It intervenes via audit plans approved by the Board of  Directors'  Risk  Management  Committee  to  cover  the activities  at  frequencies  appropriate  to  the  risks  of  each activity. Each audit results in a report and recommendations, to which  the  audited  entities  respond.  The  effective implementation  of  recommendations  is  monitored  twice yearly by Amundi's Internal Audit. The General Internal Audit Department of Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  also  conducts  audits  of the Amundi Group.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

It ensures that  the  internal  control  system  is  subject  to  constant monitoring  to  verify  its  adequacy  and  effectiveness.  Senior Management is informed of the main malfunctions identified and the corrective measures applied.\n\n## 5.3.2.1 Internal control committees\n\n## Internal Control Committee\n\nThe  Internal  Control  Committee,  chaired  by  the  Head  of Amundi's Business Support and Control Division, ensures the consistency,  effectiveness  and  completeness  of  the  internal control system and coordinates Periodic Control, Permanent Control, Risk Management, Compliance and Security activities. Other members  of  this  committee  include Amundi's  Head  of  Risk  Management,  Head  of  Compliance, Head of Security, Head of Legal Affairs and Head of Internal Audit. It meets 11 times a year.\n\nThe duties of the Committee include:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing  the  internal  control  system  and  the  control system implemented;\n- \u00b7 examining the major risks of any kind to which Amundi is exposed  and  changes  to  the  risk  and  performance measurement systems, and ensuring the adequacy of the internal control system to correctly oversee these risks;\n- \u00b7 making  any  decision  necessary  to  remedy  weaknesses  in the internal control system;\n- \u00b7 monitoring the implementation of commitments made as a consequence of internal and external audits;\n- \u00b7 deciding on corrective measures for shortcomings revealed  by  the  audits  as  well  as  by  the  operating  and control  reports  available  to  those  responsible  for  the control or management functions of the entity.\n\n## Risk Management Committee\n\nAmundi's  Group  Risk  Management  Committee,  chaired  by the Head of the Business Support and Control Division, is the main risk governance body. It meets 11 times a year.\n\nThe Board of Directors:\n\n- \u00b7 on the recommendation of Senior Management, approves the risk appetite in view of the Group's defined strategy;\n- \u00b7 is informed at least twice a year, through presentations by Senior  Management,  about  the  Group's  consolidated  risk situation  and  earnings,  the  status  of  the  risk  monitoring and  internal  control  system  and  the  earnings  from operations and the internal control findings.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors is informed of significant incidents that exceed certain thresholds which are reviewed annually by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.  Lastly,  it  reviews  the  annual  report  on  internal control once a year.\n\nThe  objectives  of  the  Committee  are  to  set  the  risk management  policy  governing  all  Amundi  Group  entities (risks  taken  on  behalf  of  third  parties  and  on  its  own account). Accordingly, it has complete authority to:\n\n- \u00b7 define Amundi's risk policy;\n- \u00b7 approve management strategies and investment processes;\n- \u00b7 approve methodologies used to calculate risk indicators;\n- \u00b7 approve credit and counterparty limits;\n- \u00b7 set overall limits;\n- \u00b7 make  decisions  about  the  funds'  use  of  new  financial instruments;\n- \u00b7 determine  the  risk  framework  for  each  product  and activity;\n- \u00b7 review the findings of audits performed;\n- \u00b7 make  the  decisions  necessary  to  resolve  any  exceptions discovered.\n\nDecisions made by the Group Risk Management Committee apply to all Group entities.\n\nThe  Group  Risk  Committee  delegates  the  specific  duties entrusted to it to several sub-committees. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 the Valuation Committee sets the valuation policy;\n- \u00b7 the  Credit  Committee  approves  the  per  issuer  limits  on supervised funds and own account and counterparty limits on all funds;\n- \u00b7 the Operational Risk Management Committee handles the monitoring  of  incidents  related  to  operational  processes and defines the measures to enhance these processes.\n\nI",

These committees meet at least quarterly.\n\n## Compliance Committee\n\nAmundi's Compliance Committee, chaired by the Head of the Business Support and Control Division, meets 11 times a year. Amundi's Compliance Committee is an operational committee  responsible  for  overseeing  the  implementation and  application  of  the  Compliance  control  program  for Amundi and the entities falling within the scope of its internal control system. As such, the Compliance Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 defines and approves the Group's Compliance policy;\n- \u00b7 receives  reports  of  any  significant  information  regarding any  incidents  arising  from  the  application  of  French  or foreign legislation and regulations;\n- \u00b7 oversees  the  Group's  non-compliance  risk  management system and ensures it is relevant and effective;\n- \u00b7 approves  the  non-compliance  risk  mapping  and  the Compliance control plan, which are reviewed each year;\n- \u00b7 examines  the  results  of  controls,  dashboards  and  other indicators  submitted  by  the  entities;  monitors  cases submitted by the entities;\n- \u00b7 monitors significant malfunctions of which it is aware and the  related  corrective  measures,  and  takes  all  decisions and provides all additional instructions regarding measures to be taken to correct malfunctions;\n- \u00b7 oversees the results of the local Compliance Committees.\n\nAt least  twice  a  year,  Amundi's  Compliance  Committee  will submit  to  its  Board  of  Directors  a  report  containing information regarding  any  incidents  arising  from  the application of French or foreign legislation and regulations.\n\n## Security Committee\n\nThe Security Committee, chaired by the Head of the Amundi Business Support and Control Division, steers the security of property  and  persons,  information  systems,  the  business continuity  and  crisis  management  plan,  as  well  as  the protection of personal data. It meets four times per year.\n\n## Specialised committees\n\nThe following specialised committees have been set up:\n\n- \u00b7 the Products and Services Committee, which examines and approves each proposal to create or modify new products and services;\n- \u00b7 the Seed Money Committee, which examines and approves on  a  case-by-case  basis  the  seed  money  investments  or any other type of support needed;\n- \u00b7 the Financial Management Committee, which analyses the financial risk borne by the Group (such as liquidity, foreign exchange and overall interest rate) and makes any decision to  optimise  the  structure  of  the  balance  sheet  and  limit the financial risk directly borne by the Group.\n\n## 5.3.2.2 Resources\n\nSenior  Management defines the general organisation of the Company and ensures that it is effectively implemented by competent  individuals.  It  clearly  allocates  the  roles  and responsibilities with regard to internal controls and allocates the necessary resources.\n\nAs of the end of 2021, the numbers of people employed by the various business units were:\n\n| (in FTE)                   |   2020 |   2021 |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Risk Management Department |    224 |    255 |\n| Compliance Department      |    108 |    136 |\n| Security Department        |     30 |     30 |\n| Internal Audit             |     40 |     46 |\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

These measures form an integral  part  of  the  internal  control  system.  The  scope covered  includes  operational  risk,  market  risk,  credit  and counterparty risk, legal risk, etc.\n\nAmundi has put in place an organisation to manage risk which is based on a high level of integration of the Risk Management business unit across the whole of the Amundi Group, with the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 uniformity of the risk monitoring processes;\n- \u00b7 the  pooling  of  resources  adapted  to  suit  the  various entities;\n- \u00b7 a  high  level  of  team  expertise,  by  means  of  dedicated centres of competence.\n\n## 5.3.3.1.1 Organisation of the Risk Management business unit\n\nThe  Risk  management  business  unit  employs  a  matrix organisation consisting of:\n\n- \u00b7 cross-business Risk Management  Departments  which determine the broad methods of controlling and monitoring risk related to the way funds are managed and provide  supervision  of  this  risk.  The  goal  of  these departments  is  to  integrate  all  risk  and  performance factors  and  indicators  for  each  fund  analysed  and  to ensure  the  internal  consistency  of  these  indicators  and their  suitability  to  a  fund's  objectives.  Within  these departments,  Senior  Risk  Managers  (SRM)  consult  with Senior  Investment  Managers  to  oversee  the  risks  of  each asset class managed;\n- \u00b7 in  each  subsidiary  that  manages  assets,  a  Risk  team oversees the risks and reports functionally to a department head;\n- \u00b7 teams  specialised  by  field  of  expertise  and  brought together  in  a  dedicated  department  whose  mission  is  to ensure  consistency  across  business  lines  of  the  approach taken  for  each  type  of  risk.  The  main  missions  of  this department are to define the standards and methods for measuring  risk,  produce  the  risk  indicators  and  provide expertise in applying these measurements to the portfolios;\n- \u00b7 the  department  is  organised  around  the  following  seven areas of expertise:\n- \u00b7 implementation  and  administration  of  the  monitoring software for regulatory and contractual constraints,\n- \u00b7 measurement and attribution of performance,\n- \u00b7 calculation of credit and market risk indicators, definition and control of the valuation policy,\n- \u00b7 supervision of the monitoring system for operational risk and  accounting  risk,  as  well  as  co-ordination  of  the work done on permanent control at consolidated level,\n- \u00b7 establishment of a list of authorised counterparties and, for  certain  managed  portfolios,  the  setting  of  issuer limits,\n- \u00b7 the steering and implementation of solutions for the Risk Management department and cross-business projects,\n- \u00b7 establishment of  a  list  of  authorised  counterparties  for all  managed  portfolios  and  the  setting  of  per  issuer limits for certain managed portfolios;\n- \u00b7 a dedicated team in charge of steering the operational risk monitoring system. This team's main role is to:\n- \u00b7 map operational risk at the Amundi level,\n- \u00b7 collect information about operational incidents,\n- \u00b7 monitor all action plans designed to mitigate this risk,\n- \u00b7 contribute to calculating the capital requirement,\n- \u00b7 contribute to the Permanent Control system.\n\nAmundi  takes  a  comprehensive  approach  to  managing operational  risk.  All  teams  and  managers  are  involved  in managing operational risk.\n\nTo make  risk monitoring more  consistent, the risk management  information  system  is  shared  by  all  entities within  the  internal  control  scope,  including  the  following applications:\n\n- \u00b7 applications for managing constraints and risk limitations;\n- \u00b7 applications for measuring market risk;\n- \u00b7 systems for performance measurement and attribution.\n\nPeriodic reports are provided to Senior Management and to the Board of Directors on the controls carried out by the Risk Management  function.  In  2018,  Senior  Management  was regularly updated by:\n\n- \u00b7 the Risk Management function's Monthly Scorecard, which provides  a  detailed  review  of  the  Group's  exposure  to various risks, and sensitive matters;\n- \u00b7 the update given by the Head of Risk Management to the Executive Committee; and\n- \u00b7 the  Risk  Management  business  unit's  various  governance committees  which  Senior  Management  takes  part  in, including  Amundi's  Group  Risk  Management  Committee which  is  the  head  committee  of  the  Risk  Management system.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  also  receives  regular  information through  presentations  given  by  the  Risk  Management Committee, which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the  risk  management  system,  its  current  state  and  any changes to it;\n- \u00b7 a summary of risks, changes in risk, the level of the main risk limits and usage of those limits.\n\nI",

The main highlights of this were:\n\n- \u00b7 work  (still  ongoing)  to  finalise  the  strengthening  plan, which is required following internal fraud that occurred in 2014 and 2015;\n- \u00b7 a review of the liquidity stress tests for the funds to ensure compliance with the ESMA guidelines; and\n- \u00b7 the  acquisition  of  Lyxor  on  31  December  2021,  which  will result  in  work  to  integrate  it  into  the  Group's  management system in 2022.\n\nIn terms of changes to the control system:\n\n- \u00b7 activities performed on behalf of third parties:\n- \u00b7 strengthening liquidity risk management  tools  in accordance with ESMA regulatory requirements:\n\n## 5.3.3.2 Compliance function\n\n## 5.3.3.2.1 Organisation of the Compliance business unit\n\nAmundi's  Compliance  business  unit  is  organised  as  a centralised  function  that  is  independent  of  operational services.  The  duties  of  Amundi's  Head  of  Compliance  are carried out totally independently. A  feature of this independence is a dual reporting system; reporting hierarchically, on the one hand, to the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole and operationally, on the other, to the Head of the Business Support and Control Division.\n\nThe  Compliance  Business  Unit  ensures  that  the  prevention and control  systems  for  non-compliance  risk  are  consistent and effective throughout the entities that are monitored on a consolidated basis by  Amundi.  Along  with  the  Risk Management  and  Security  business  units,  it  constitutes  the second line of defence of the Group's internal control system. The  Compliance  business  unit  relies  on  the  controls formalised by the managers of the operational units, who are primarily responsible for and the guarantors of the effective deployment  of  the  internal  control  system  and  ensure  that the transactions carried out comply  with  laws  and regulations and internal standards.\n\nIts main tasks are:\n\n- \u00b7 to disseminate a culture of compliance within the Group;\n- \u00b7 to define the framework of compliance standards;\n- \u00b7 to  assist  the  Group's  managers  and  employees  with carrying out their business activities;\n- \u00b7 to help the business units assess non-compliance risk and implement and monitor the corresponding controls;\n- \u00b7 to  represent  the  Group  in  its  dealings  with  regulators, national authorities and  professional associations in conjunction with the Group's other control functions;\n- \u00b7 to inform and, if applicable, warn Senior Management of a non-compliance risk.\n\n- -updating the framework for procedures,\n- -implementing  the  first  backtests  to  evaluate  the liquidation costs for funds,\n- -monitoring the funds' liquidity profiles, supplemented by  monitoring  fund  liquidation  costs  (in  normal  and stress situations),\n- -continuing work on backtesting liquidity buffers,\n- \u00b7 providing Risk Management support during the roll-out of the ESG approach:\n- -formalising the ESG risk policy,\n- -deploying ESG monitoring on an operational level;\n- \u00b7 activities performed on our own account:\n- \u00b7 ensuring  compliance  of  the  risk  tools  with  the  new banking regulation (CRR2), which entered into force on 30 June 2021.\n\nAmundi's Compliance business unit which is structured as a globally  integrated  function,  brings  together  all  of  the Compliance teams of Amundi and its subsidiaries. It is itself incorporated into Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's Compliance business unit. Its  structure  is  designed  to  preserve  the  independence  of the  entities'  Compliance  Managers,  to  ensure  that  the resources allocated to the effective management and control of non-compliance risk are adequate and proportionate and to ensure information is transparent.\n\nIn  each  country,  the  Compliance  business  unit  must  ensure that  the  activities  and  operations  of  the  entities  within  the Amundi Group comply both with local regulations and with any  other  regulations  and  any  of  the  Group's  internal  rules that apply to them. Every year, the Compliance Department of each entity and subsidiary:\n\n- \u00b7 maps  the  risk  of  non-compliance  with  legislative  and regulatory  provisions  with  the  aim  of  identifying  major areas of risk and determining the regulatory procedures to be put in place and setting out any remedial action. In the event  of  a  significant  risk  being  identified,  the  escalation procedure  will  be  implemented  and  Senior  Management and the Board of Directors notified, if necessary;\n- \u00b7 prepares  the  annual  Compliance  report  for  the  entity's Board  of  Directors  and  forwards  it  to  Amundi's  Head  of Compliance.  This  annual  Compliance  report  sets  out  the conditions  for  ensuring  Compliance,  essential  information and  the  lessons  learned  from  measuring  and  monitoring non-compliance risk.\n\nBased on the annual reports of its subsidiaries, as well as on the  results  of  its  own  controls,  Amundi's  Compliance Department  produces  the  annual  Compliance  report  for Amundi's CEO and Board of Directors, and informs the Head of Compliance of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 5.3.3.2.2 Risk monitoring scheme\n\nThe main non-compliance risks are grouped together by level of risk in the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Market integrity;\n- \u00b7 Professional ethics;\n- \u00b7 Financial security;\n- \u00b7 Protection for clients and unitholders;\n- \u00b7 Prevention of fraud and corruption.\n\nNon-compliance risks are identified and assessed each year for  each  compliance  topic  within  the  'non-compliance  risk mapping'.  These  maps  are  drawn  up  by  each  Group  entity and consolidated at the Amundi level.\n\nThe  Compliance  Department's  control  plan  is  aligned  with the non-compliance risks identified in the risk mapping. It is reviewed  periodically  and  validated  by  the  Compliance Committee at the start of the year.\n\nThe Compliance procedures are based on Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  S.A.'s  compliance  procedures  and  include  the specific  characteristics  of  the  business  units  offered  by Amundi and its subsidiaries, particularly asset management. These procedures apply to all entities in the Amundi Group. The  Compliance  procedures  are  accompanied  by  a  set  of compliance checks that are common to all entities, ensuring consistent  implementation  of  controls  across  the  entire scope.\n\n## Market integrity\n\nRegulations require Amundi investment service providers to act in an honest, fair and professional manner that promotes market integrity. The Group ensures compliance with market integrity  through  checks  on  transactions  and  the  way  they are executed in the markets (time-stamping, pre-allocation of orders,  partial  execution,  management  of  market  abuse alerts, monitoring of threshold crossings, application of best execution criteria, etc.).\n\nThe Compliance Department's work also covers NAV figures (examining  requests  to  suspend/recalculate  a  net  asset value),  and  validating  and  checking  the  exercise  of  voting rights.\n\n## Monitoring of order allocation\n\nThe  system  in  place  is  based  on  a  strict  separation  of  the Portfolio  Management  and  Trading  business  units.  Portfolio managers' orders are placed and processed by the Trading business unit. The procedure is aimed at establishing an audit trail for each  stage  of  the  process,  which  involves investment  management,  the  trading  desk  and  the  middle office. It is based on the use of a single in-house tool which systematically time stamps and pre-allocates orders from the moment they are entered into the IT systems.\n\nThe order placement system uses a default model whereby, in  the  event  of  partial  execution,  the  allocation  of  partial quantities  is  determined  in  proportion  to  the  quantities initially requested. This method ensures the fair allocation of traded quantities.\n\nI\n\n## 'Best selection' procedure\n\nAmundi has committed to take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result when executing orders. Amundi has implemented a selection and execution policy that applies to all financial instruments covered by Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) that are traded on financial  markets  by  intermediaries.  Due  to  their  status, Group asset management companies do not have access to financial  markets.  In  order  to  obtain  the  best  execution possible,  Amundi has chosen to use Amundi Interm\u00e9diation for  its  transmission  and  order  execution  activities.  Amundi Interm\u00e9diation  has  been  approved  by  the  Autorit\u00e9  de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) as an investment company  able  to  provide  Reception  and  Transmission  of Orders (RTO) services and order execution on behalf of third parties  relating  to  all  financial  instruments  specified  in Article L. 211-1 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.\n\nAll steps are taken to ensure that orders are executed in the client's  best  interest  and  contribute  to  market  integrity  by taking into account specified criteria such as price, liquidity, rapidity and cost, depending upon their relative importance according to the various types of orders transmitted. Amundi Interm\u00e9diation  regularly  re-examines  the  conditions  and mechanisms  it  uses  for  order  execution.  In  the  absence  of internal  or  external  events  requiring  a  review  during  the course of the year, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation's execution policy is reviewed  on  an  annual  basis  during  the  selection committees.  This  review  is  formalised  in  the  reports  drawn up by these committees.\n\n## Professional ethics\n\nAmundi  employees  undertake  to  comply  strictly  with  the applicable ethical standards in accordance with the law, and with  the  regulations  and  codes  of  conduct  in  force. Compliance with ethical standards is an essential element of the quality of service that Amundi is committed to delivering to its clients.\n\nIn  order  to  protect  and  prioritise  the  interests  of  its  clients, Amundi has implemented a policy for identifying, preventing and managing any conflicts of interest that may arise during the  course  of  its  business.  The  system  for  preventing conflicts of interest is based partly on a map that identifies situations  posing  a  risk  of  a  conflict  of  interest,  the preparation and rating of conflict of interest scenarios, and a set of controls covering risky situations. Up to and including Senior Management, Amundi is also organised into business units  to  separate  the  various  functions  likely  to  give  rise  to conflicts of interest.\n\nThe holding of inside or confidential information is governed by  special  procedures  that  reiterate  the  obligations  of  the employees concerned and require the compilation of insider lists  and  confidentiality  lists.  Employees  on  those  lists  are informed  of  the  fact,  and  they  are  reminded  of  the  relevant conduct rules at that time.\n\nAmundi  aims  to  develop  and  promote  a  strong  culture  of compliance  in  accordance  with  the  laws  and  regulations  in force. The Compliance Department provides Amundi employees with mandatory training sessions, available in elearning or face-to-face format.",

This  system  is  built around three pillars: prevention, detection and management of fraud. Due to its international dimension and the diversity\n\nof its activities, Amundi has included the detection of the risk of  money  laundering,  tax  fraud  and  tax  evasion  within  the scope of its normal due diligence measures.\n\nThe  anti-corruption  measures  implemented  by  Amundi notably include:\n\n- \u00b7 monitoring  the  gifts  and  benefits  employees  give  or receive in the course of their professional activities;\n- \u00b7 incorporating  clauses  in  the  contracts  it  has  with  its partners that enable Amundi to terminate the relationship if the partner is involved in acts of corruption;\n- \u00b7 implementing  an  annual  non-compliance  risk  mapping system that includes the risk of corruption;\n- \u00b7 enabling any Amundi employee who suspects or is aware of the existence of a corruption risk to report it.\n\n## 5.3.3.2.3 Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2021\n\nIn  2021,  Senior  Management  was  updated  on  Compliance matters as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 monthly, at Compliance Committee meetings, during which the  results  of  controls  performed  by  Compliance  were presented;\n- \u00b7 annually, via the annual report on the management of noncompliance risk.\n\nThe Board of Directors receives regular information through presentations  given  by  the  Board's  Risk  Management Committee, which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 the  system  for  managing  non-compliance  risk  (including non-compliance risk mapping);\n- \u00b7 the control plan and the results of controls.\n\nThe  major  actions  taken  by  the  Compliance  Department  in 2021 focussed on:\n\n- \u00b7 Market  Integrity  and  Transparency  through  the  activities undertaken  by  Amundi  and  Amundi  Interm\u00e9diation  in  a context  of  increased  attention  on  the  part  of  regulators. Updates  are  required  on  a  continuous  basis  to  ensure adequate  control  of  risk  exposure.  A  strengthening  plan was implemented for the control system;\n- \u00b7 Financial Security and client knowledge files (KYC) as part of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole's OFAC Remedial Plan.\n\nSignificant  deterioration  of  the  fraud  indicator  on  the grounds of internal fraud of an exceptional amount (occurred in 2014/15 and recognised in 2021).\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 5.3.3.3 Security function\n\n## 5.3.3.3.1 Organisation of the Security business unit\n\nThe Security Department is organised in a centralised fashion while  still  relying  on  local  correspondents.  It  combines divisions with different expert departments in charge of the security  of  persons  and  property,  business  continuity, information  systems  security  or  personal  data  protection. The  Security  Department  helps  combat  fraud  notably  by coordinating  relations  with  the  judicial  authority  and,  more specifically, investigation services.\n\nThe activity and controls carried out by the Security function are  regularly  reported  to  Senior  Management  through  the monthly Internal Control Committee meetings or the Security Committee meetings held four times a year and chaired by the  Company's  Second  Executive  Director,  the  Head  of Amundi's  Business  Support  and  Control  Division.  Likewise, the Board of Directors receives regular reports from its Risk Management Committee on the risk control system managed by  the  Security  function,  as  well  as  the  results  of  any controls  carried  out.  In  the  context  of  new  cybersecurity threats and notably ransomware attacks, specific attention is paid  to  the  security  strategy  with  its  cyber  resilience  plan that aims to limit the risk of interruptions to the information system, which is also presented to this body.\n\nThe  resources  dedicated  to  the  security  of  information systems (IS), under the responsibility of the Chief Information Security  Officer  (CISO),  are  separate  from  the  Information Systems Department (ISD), which reports hierarchically and functionally  to  the  department  responsible  for  Operations (OST). Applying Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's policy, the CISO is tasked  with  defining  IS  security  procedures  tailored  to Amundi's own activities, managing their proper execution as well  as  implementing  a  strategy  to  anticipate  and  prevent any  breaches  to  the  integrity,  confidentiality,  availability  or traceability of the  overall  system.  This  team  is  also responsible for protecting the information systems, detecting any malicious acts or acts that breach internal policy and for responding  to  such  acts.  Amundi  employees  have  an essential  role  to  play  within  the  framework  of  this  strategy, actively  contributing  to  the  detection  of  hacking  attempts and  fraud  as  well  as  to  the  protection  of  data  and  the information  system.  In  order  to  continually  strengthen  this active first line of defence, mandatory  training  and awareness  campaigns  are  regularly  carried  out  as  well  as phishing  tests  to  check  the  employees'  ability  to  identify suspicious emails.\n\nIn  view of cybersecurity threats, the CISO team is part of a wider system, organised primarily within the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group and specifically the CERT-AG (Computer Emergency Response  Team  -  Cr\u00e9dit  AGricole),  which  is  in  charge  of predicting, monitoring and responding to incidents (available 24/7).  In  addition  to  the  capacities  provided  by  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group,  Amundi's  CISO  team  relies  on  its  own Security Operation Centre, a team responsible for detecting and handling security incidents. The CISO is also responsible for developing external partnerships to improve and optimise the processes for predicting and responding to incidents.\n\nI\n\nThe  IT  risk  control  function  relies  on  Level  1  and  Level  2 permanent controls, including vulnerability scans and regular penetration tests to check for any weaknesses in infrastructures,  applications  or  data.  These  test  campaigns are  mainly  conducted  by  third-party  companies  and  take various forms: The Red Teams, made up of external experts (outside Amundi), take on the role of 'hacker' and simulate cyberattacks  with  the  aim  of  penetrating  the  information systems to damage their integrity, gain access to and extract data,  and  corrupt  valuable  data.  They  rely  on  social engineering  and  a  vulnerability  analysis  of  the  target companies,  among  other  things,  in  order  to  carry  out physical and logical attacks. These regular tests are used to identify vulnerabilities that may be exploited by a malicious actor. The Purple Teams work alongside the teams in charge of IS Protection (known as the Blue Teams in the context of these  tests,  made  up  of  Amundi  employees  and  structured around  the  Company's  own  Security  Operation  Centre)  to deal  with  attacks  from  the  Red  Teams.  The  purpose  is  to capitalise  and  organise  experience  sharing  in  order  to strengthen  detection,  protection  and  response  capabilities by  learning  from  the  various  simulated  attacks  and  the operating methods used.\n\nThe  results  of  these  controls  are  shared  with  a  monthly operational committee (the IT Security Steering Committee) and the Security Committee, which meets four times a year.\n\nAmundi's overall business continuity system derives from the regulations and also from Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group procedures that include disaster scenarios. It is adapted to Amundi's own business  and  each  subsidiary  has  its  own  version  that incorporates the local regulatory framework  and  the activities of each entity. Based on an analysis of the criticality of the various business lines, and regularly reviewed so as to take  into  account  any  changes  in  risks  and  the  associated disaster  scenarios,  the  business  continuity  plan  includes  a 'crisis management' component and is designed to meet the Company's need to resume business rapidly.\n\nThe results  of  the  associated  control  plan  are  presented  to the Security Committee.\n\n## 5.3.3.3.2 Improvement and adaptation of the risk monitoring system in 2021\n\nGiven the significant change in the cybersecurity threat and, more  specifically,  the  risk  of  disruption  to  information systems  following  a  ransomware  attack  targeting  Amundi, one  of  its  clients,  partners  or  suppliers,  business  continuity plans  are  regularly  reviewed.  To  take  into  account  the increase in the number of cyberattacks during the Covid-19 pandemic, a cyber resilience plan was specifically implemented  to  continuously  improve  the  prediction, detection  and  protection  capabilities  of  the  information systems. It also aims to reduce data recovery times and the time taken to rebuild all or part of the information system in the  case  of  attacks.  Lastly,  it  defines  the  organizations, procedures and workarounds to be established to reduce the impact  of  such  an  attack  and  to  maintain  business operations in the face of this specific type of risk.",

        "page_content": "In  this  context,  over  the  course  of  2021,  Amundi  initiated discussions and active cooperation with the French government's  agencies  in  charge  of  cybersecurity,  namely the Cyber Directorate of the French Gendarmerie (ComCyberGend). Created in August 2021, ComCyberGend is an  agency  of  the  French  Ministry  of  the  Interior,  operating under  the  supervision  of  the  Director  of  the  French Gendarmerie.  Comprising  top-level  experts,  particularly  in\n\nthe field of digital investigations, it works to prevent threats and  protect  major  national  interests.  A  key  component  of these exchanges between Amundi and the French Gendarmerie  is  the  sharing  of  experiences  and  expertise. They  aim  to  establish  a  cyber  crisis  management  plan  for potential cyberattacks, including those involving ransomware.\n\n## 5.3.3.4 Periodic control\n\nThe Amundi Internal Audit Department reports hierarchically to the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. General Internal Audit Department and  operationally  to  Amundi's  Senior  Management.  The Periodic  Control  system  includes  a  central  Internal  Audit team, which covers the entire Amundi  scope, and decentralised Internal Audit teams  in several of its subsidiaries,  which  report  to  local  management  and  to Amundi's Head of Internal Audit.\n\nIntegrated  within  the  Internal  Audit  business  unit  of  the majority shareholder, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., Amundi's periodic control system is based on the tools and methods adopted by  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group,  in  particular  with  regard  to audit  mapping,  planning  and  conducting  audits,  monitoring implementation of recommendations issued and reporting on follow-up to its work.\n\nThe audit plan is drawn up on the basis of a multi-year audit program based on the mapping of the Amundi Group's risks. It also factors in requests from Amundi's Senior Management, the  Internal  Audit  business  unit  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The objective of the multi-year program is to cover the audit scope  (which  is  based  on  the  scope  of  the  monitored entities)  over  a  maximum  of  five  years,  with  an  average frequency of three years used.\n\nIn  addition,  Internal  Audit  conducts  half-yearly  audits  to follow up the implementation of all of its recommendations, as  well  as  ensuring  quarterly  follow-up  of  some  important recommendations.  All  work  carried  out  by  Amundi  Internal Audit,  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  General  Internal  Audit Department and by supervisory authorities are subject to this formal  monitoring  system  which  ensures  that  remedial actions  are  implemented  within  the  deadlines  agreed  with the entity's management at the end of the audit. The system also enables the Head of Internal Audit to issue alerts to the Board when necessary, as set out in Article 26 of the Order of 3 November 2014.\n\nThe audit conclusions are presented to Senior Management, the Board of Directors' Risk Management Committee and the Board of Directors, who are also kept updated regarding the progress made to implement the recommendations.\n\nFinally,  the  approach  taken  by  Amundi's  Internal  Audit function  is  subject  to  an  ongoing  quality  improvement process.\n\n## 5.3.3.5 Specific internal control system for accounting and financial information; role and responsibilities in the preparation and processing of accounting and financial information\n\nUnder  the  authority  of  the  Senior  Management,  Amundi's Finance  Department  is  responsible  for  preparing  the accounting  and  financial  information.  In  particular,  the Finance Department:\n\n- \u00b7 draws  up  the  consolidated  financial statements in accordance  with  IFRS  and  the  accounting  rules  and principles set and distributed by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- \u00b7 prepares  the  financial  statements  of  each  entity  in accordance with current local accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 prepares the various regulatory, prudential and fiscal reports;\n- \u00b7 produces  the  various  pieces  of  management  information necessary to steer the activities;\n- \u00b7 ensures that Amundi's financial communications are issued to investors.\n\n## Permanent controls on accounting and financial information\n\nThe accounting and financial information control system within the Finance Department is based on checks carried out on the one hand by the Accounting, Management Control and Cash Management  teams,  and  on  the  other,  by  an  accounts\n\nauditing  unit  reporting  directly  to  the  Chief  Financial  Officer. This  system  is  supported  by  permanent  accounting  controls provided  by  an  independent  team  reporting  to  the  Risk Management function.\n\nThe  permanent  accounting  control  objectives  are  designed to  ensure  adequate  coverage  of  the  major  accounting  risk which could alter the quality of the accounting and financial information in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of data with regard to the legal and regulatory provisions, and the standards of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- \u00b7 reliability  and  accuracy  of  the  data,  so  that  it  provides  a true  picture  of  the  earnings  and  financial  position  of Amundi  and  of  the  entities within its scope of consolidation;\n- \u00b7 security of the data preparation and processing procedures,  limiting  the  operational  risk  with  regard  to Amundi's commitment to the information published;\n- \u00b7 prevention of the risk of fraud and accounting irregularities.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  particular,  the  risks  monitored  by  the Risk  Management  Department,  especially  those  related  to the  off-balance-sheet  commitments,  are  reconciled  with Accounting  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  information  is complete  and  is  properly  evaluated  in  the  financial statements.\n\nThe  Head  of  Amundi's  Permanent  Accounting  Control ensures that any corrective actions are implemented in order to reinforce the system of permanent accounting controls.\n\n## 5.3.4 Brief statement concerning risk\n\n(Statement prepared in accordance with Article 435 (1) (f) of EU  Regulation  No. 575/2013  and  approved  by  the  Amundi Board of Directors on 7 February 2022)\n\nRisk appetite at Amundi means the type and aggregate level of  risk,  by  nature  of  risk  and  by  activity,  that  Amundi  is prepared  to  assume  in  light  of  its  strategic  objectives. Amundi  defines  its  risk  appetite  by  including  the  essential dimensions of its business: the attractiveness of the products it offers, the strength of its financial position and the pursuit of its short and long-term profitability objectives.\n\nThe formalisation of Amundi's risk appetite is instructive for Senior Management and the Board of Directors as they plan the Group's development trajectory and how that translates into each business unit's strategy.\n\nThis  formalisation  is  the  result  of  a  coordinated  and  shared effort among the Finance, Risk Management, Compliance and Security Departments and has as its goal:\n\n- \u00b7 to  engage  the  Directors  of  the  Board  and  Senior Management  in  discussions  and  conversations  about risk-taking;\n\n## Process for formalising the risk appetite framework\n\nIn  line  with  the  Group's  policy,  Amundi  expresses  its  risk appetite in terms of key indicators, broken down into three levels of risk:\n\n- \u00b7 appetite refers  to  the  normal,  recurring  management  of risk.  This is expressed in the form of budget objectives in terms  of  solvency,  liquidity  and  profitability,  as  well  as operational limits pertaining to market, ALM and credit risk which, if breached, are immediately flagged and corrected by Senior Management;\n- \u00b7 tolerance refers to managing a deteriorated risk level on an exceptional basis. When tolerance thresholds are breached, this  immediately  triggers  a  report  to  the  Chair  of  the  Risk Management Committee of the Amundi Board of Directors and, when appropriate, the Board of Directors itself;\n\nI\n\n## Relationships with statutory auditors\n\nIn  accordance  with  current  professional  standards,  the statutory auditors carry out work as they deem necessary on the accounting and financial information published:\n\n- \u00b7 audit of the separate and consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 a  limited  audit  of  the  half-yearly  consolidated  financial statements;\n- \u00b7 a reading of all the supporting materials for the published financial information.\n\nAs part of their legal mandate, the statutory auditors present their  findings  to  the  Audit  Committee  and  to  Amundi's Board of Directors.\n\n- \u00b7 to formalise, standardise and specify the acceptable level of risk (framework of standards) relating to a given strategy;\n- \u00b7 to  fully  integrate  the  risk/return  relationship  into  the strategic steering and decision-making process;\n- \u00b7 to  have  at  hand  sophisticated  indicators  and  alert thresholds  enabling  Senior  Management  to  anticipate  an excessive  deterioration  in  strategic  indicators  and  to improve resilience by employing certain mechanisms in the event that an alert level is reached compared to standard risk appetite;\n- \u00b7 to  improve  external  communications  with  third  parties, regulators and investors concerning earnings stability and the management of risk.\n\nAmundi's  risk  appetite  framework  for  the  2021  financial  year was set out at the Board of Directors meeting of 8 December 2020.\n\n- \u00b7 capacity refers  to  the  maximum level of risk that Amundi could theoretically assume without violating its operational or regulatory constraints.\n\nWhen these thresholds are breached, the supervisory bodies of  the  Company  are  informed  in  proportion  to  the  level  of risk incurred.\n\nFurthermore,  although  Amundi  chooses  most  of  its  risks  as part of its strategic plan, certain risks such as operational risks and  some  non-compliance  risks  are  inevitably  going  to  be incurred, even though the protective measures and the control systems  in  place  may  limit  their  occurrence  and  their potential  consequences. Amundi's appetite for any voluntary act  that  might  create  an  operating  loss  or  a  violation  of regulations and professional standards is quite obviously zero.",

This  indicator shows the implementation of controls  and  supervision, the  purpose  of  which  is  to  reduce  the  impact  of operational risk to the incompressible minimum,\n- \u00b7 the  CET1  solvency  ratio,  which  stood  at  16.1%  as  of 31 December 2021;\n- \u00b7 two indicators of balance-sheet liquidity:\n- \u00b7 the Gearing or Debt ratio (net debt/tangible shareholders' equity):  as  of  31  December  2021,  the  Gearing  ratio  was -26.7%,\n- \u00b7 the liquidity  coverage ratio  (LCR):  Amundi's LCR as of 31 December 2021 was 271%;\n\n## 5.4 SOLVENCY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY\n\n## 5.4.1 Solvency ratio\n\n## 5.4.1.1 Applicable regulatory framework\n\nAs a credit institution, Amundi is subject to French prudential regulations, which implement into French law the provisions of  the  EU  Directive  'Access  to  the  activity  of  credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms'.\n\nAmundi has managed its capital so as to satisfy the levels of regulatory  capital  defined  in  the  EU  Directive  2013/36 (CRD  IV)  and  European  Regulation  575/2013  (CRR)  since 1  January  2014  and  required  by  the  relevant  authorities,  the European Central Bank and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) to cover risk-weighted assets in terms of credit risks, operational risks and market risks.\n\nRegulatory  capital,  calculated  based  on  Amundi's  scope  of consolidation, breaks down into three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1);\n- \u00b7 four profitability indicators:\n- \u00b7 cost  of  risk,  which  takes  into  account  credit  risk (particularly  default  by  an  issuer  or  counterparty  that may affect Amundi) in addition to operational risk and, where  applicable,  any  market  risk  arising  from  the management  of  guaranteed  funds  and  mandates;  for 2021, Amundi's cost of risk was \u20ac12.1 million,\n- \u00b7 cost-to-income ratio, which reached 47.9% for the 2021 financial year, from an adjusted point of view,\n- \u00b7 net  income  Group  share,  which  for  the  2021  financial year amounted to \u20ac1,369 million,\n- \u00b7 equity-accounted income from joint ventures, which for the 2021 financial year amounted to \u20ac84.3 million.\n\nFor the 2021 financial year and as of 31 December 2021, the various key indicators of the risk profile were situated within the  acceptable  risk  range  defined  by  Amundi  and  did  not reach their tolerance thresholds.\n\n- \u00b7 Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1);\n- \u00b7 Tier 2 capital consisting of equity and debt instruments, to which various adjustments are made.\n\nRegulatory capital is obtained from accounting shareholders' equity.  The  adjustments  made  (prudential  filters)  mostly involve  deducting  goodwill  and  intangible  assets  (net  of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi  principally  holds  CET1  capital,  consisting  of  share capital and undistributed reserves. As part of the financing of the  acquisition  of  Pioneer  Investments,  Amundi  issued  Tier  2 capital in the amount of \u20ac300 million in 2017, maturing in 2027.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

This decrease is due to the  acquisition  of  Lyxor  and  the  regulatory  impact  of  the entry into force of CRR2 in June 2021 on the calculation of credit  RWA,  which  was  partially  absorbed  by  organically generated CET1 capital over the year.\n\nThe CET1 ratio stood at 16.1% (1) ,  significantly higher than the regulatory minimum for 2020, and up from 20.0% at the end of 2020.\n\nThe reconciliation between accounting equity and regulatory capital is presented  in  section  4.3  of  this  Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe key figures are set out in Section 5.5 below.\n\nAmundi  applies  IFRS  9  to  financial  instruments  since 1  January  2018.  This  standard  is  being  applied  retrospectively. Accordingly, the impact associated with the new classification and the measurement principles for financial instruments and the  writing  down  of  credit  risk  was  all  taken  into  account with regard to Amundi's capital. This impact was not material for Amundi.\n\n## Minimum requirements of Pillar 2\n\nSince  2017,  the  ECB  has  changed  the  methodology  used, splitting the regulatory requirements into two parts:\n\n- \u00b7 a 'Pillar 2 Requirement' (P2R). This requirement applies to all  levels  of  capital  and  must  be  entirely  made  up  of Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1). Non-compliance with this requirement will automatically result in restrictions on distributions (additional Tier 1 capital instrument coupons, dividends,  variable  compensation).  Consequently,  this requirement is published;\n- \u00b7 a  'Pillar  2  Guidance'  (P2G). This  requirement  is  not currently published.\n\nSince 1 January 2020, the Amundi Group has no longer had any  additional  capital  requirements  under  the  Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process - SREP (P2G and P2R). As a result,  as  of  31  December  2020,  the  minimum  regulatory level for compliance was 7.0% for the CET1 ratio and 10.5% for  the  Total  Capital  ratio.  These  levels  included  the requirements of Pillar 1, the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer.\n\nFor credit risk purposes, risk-weighted assets are calculated using  the  standardised  prudential  method  set  out  in  the regulations. In practice, for the three main types of exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  investment  portfolio,  risk-weighted  assets  are calculated  on  a  transparent  basis,  taking  into  account assets actually held by the funds in which Amundi invests; risk-weighted assets related to these underlying assets are valued  for  regulatory  purposes  using  the  standardised prudential method;\n- \u00b7 for  guarantees  given  to  funds,  risk-weighted  assets  are also  calculated  using  the  standardised  approach  with respect  to  recognition  of  the  guarantee  mechanism.  The assets  held  by  the  funds  benefiting  from  the  guarantees are  then  estimated  on  a  transparent  basis  using  the standardised approach;\n- \u00b7 for Amundi Finance's derivatives transactions, risk-weighted assets are valued according to the standardised prudential standards ('valued at their market value' method).\n\nI",

At  the  end  of  2018,  Amundi  received the ECB's permission to take into account deductions linked to goodwill and financial stakes for exposures denominated in US dollars and Chinese yuans.\n\nCapital requirements  for  operational  risk  are  partially calculated  using  the  advanced  measurement  approach (AMA)  developed  by  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  and  used  by Amundi.  Use  of  the  AMA  method  was  approved  by  the French  Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  in  2007  and  then confirmed in 2010.\n\nThe  AMA  model  for  capital  calculation  is  based  on  an actuarial  Loss  Distribution  Approach  model,  taking  into account both internal and external factors.\n\n## 5.4.2 Leverage ratio\n\nArticle  429  of  the  CRR,  setting  out  the  terms  and  conditions relating  to  the  leverage  ratio,  was  modified  by  Delegated Regulation No. 62/2015 of 10 October 2014 published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 18 January 2015.\n\nSince  the  European  regulation  CRR  2  was  published  in  the Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union  on  7  June  2019,  the leverage ratio has become a Pillar 1 minimum requirement with effect from 28 June 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 the minimum leverage ratio requirement is 3%;\n- \u00b7 from  1  January  2022,  for  global  systemically  important banks  (G-SIBs),  and  therefore  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group, there will be an additional leverage ratio buffer set at half of the entity's systemic buffer;\n\nInternal factors (change in the entity's risk profile) include:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in the entity's organisational structure, change in risk  profile  of  the  business  and  risk  mapping,  change  in internal losses;\n- \u00b7 quality  of  the  risk  management  system  and,  in  particular, the permanent control system.\n\nAs  regards  external  factors,  incidents  occurring  in  other credit  institutions  are  monitored  based  on  external  data, leading  when  necessary  to  adjustments  to  the  stress scenarios used in the model.\n\nIn  terms  of  type  of  operational  risk,  Amundi  is  mainly exposed to execution, delivery and process management risk and risk related to clients, products and business practices.\n\nFinally,  concerning  the  large  risk  ratio,  Amundi's  biggest exposure was \u20ac448 million at the end of 2021, in compliance with the 25%  threshold  of  Tier  1  regulatory  capital (CET1+AT1).\n\n- \u00b7 finally,  non-compliance  with  the  leverage  ratio  buffer requirement  will  result  in  limitations  on  distributions  and calculation of a maximum distributable amount (L-MMD).\n\nThe  leverage  ratio  is  the  ratio  of  a  bank's  CET1  to  its  total exposures, i.e. total assets plus off-balance sheet items after certain restatements for derivatives, intra-group transactions, financial  securities  transactions,  items  deducted  from  the numerator and off-balance sheet items.\n\nSince 1  January  2015,  it  has  been  mandatory  to  publish  the leverage ratio at least once a year.\n\nAmundi's leverage ratio was 13.6% as of 31 December 2021, compared to 9.4% at the end of 2020.\n\n| In \u20ac millions     | 31/12/2021   | 31/12/2020   |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Tier 1 capital    | 2,261        | 2,465        |\n| Leverage exposure | 16,617       | 26,284       |\n| LEVERAGE RATIO    | 13.6%        | 9.4%         |\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

Group employees therefore hold 0.8% of the share capital compared to 0.6% previously.\n\n## Planned IPO of SBI Funds Management\n\nIn a press release dated 15 December 2021, the Amundi Group announced  its  support  for  the  State  Bank  of  India's  (SBI) initiative  to  explore  the  possibility  of  an  IPO  of  SBI  Funds Management  Limited  (SBI  FML)  and  its  intention  to  sell approximately 4% of SBI FML's share capital in connection with this IPO.\n\nThis  listing  is  expected  to  take  place  on  the  Indian  stock exchange  in  2022,  subject  to  regulatory  authorisations  and market conditions.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, State Bank of India owns 62.6% of SBI  FML,  with  36.78%  owned  by  Amundi  and  0.6%  by  the company's employees.",

The impact on the Group's equity is +\u20ac11.7 million after tax effects are taken into account (see 6.2.5 - Statement of changes in equity). Furthermore, the impact on income for 2020 is not significant.\n\n## Benchmark index reforms\n\nIn 2021, reforms to benchmark  indices entered an acceleration phase, set by market milestones determined by the alternative rates working groups and the authorities. On 5 March  2021,  an  announcement  by  the  IBA  -  the administrator  of  the  LIBOR  -  confirmed  the  significant milestone  that  the  LIBOR  indices  would  not  be  published, and  would  lose  representativeness  at  the  end  of  2021. Accordingly, for new contract flows, depending on currencies  and  asset  classes,  all  players  are  expected  to gradually stop using LIBOR indices during the course of 2021 and discontinue their use altogether after the end of 2021.\n\nThe Amundi Group started the transition from the EONIA to the  \u20acSTR  as  early  as  2020  (transition  no  later  than 3  January  2022)  through  the  Benchmarks  project  and  this transition  is  now  complete.  Furthermore,  the  EURIBOR,  like any benchmark index, is likely to see its methodology change or  be  replaced  in  the  long  term.  However,  the  scenario  for replacing the EURIBOR in the short-term is not envisaged at this stage.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Amundi Group does not use any of  the  indices  that  are  defined  as  critical  by  ESMA  and therefore affected by these phases of transition. Furthermore,  no  benchmark  indices  that  mature  after  their final publication date have been identified.\n\nIt  should  also  be  noted  that,  as  of  the  date  of  the  financial statements,  none  of  the  hedging  instruments  used  by  the Amundi Group was affected by this reform.\n\nThe  Amundi  Group  does  not,  therefore,  anticipate  any significant impact on its financial accounts in connection with these reforms and the transition phase currently in progress.\n\nI\n\n## 1.1.1 Standards applied as of 31 December 2021\n\nThe  accounting  principles  and  methods  chosen  by  Amundi Group to prepare its consolidated financial statements as of 31  December  2021  are  identical  to  those  used  for  the preparation of the consolidated statements for the financial year  ended  31  December  2020,  with  the  exception  of  the following standards, amendments and interpretations newly applicable to the 2021 fiscal period:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

They  will  not  become compulsory  until  the  date  set  by  the  European  Union  and, therefore, the Group  has  not  adopted  these  as  of 31 December 2021.\n\n## 1.2 Presentation format of the financial statements\n\nAmundi presents its balance sheet in decreasing liquidity order. The  assets  and  liabilities  balance  sheet  is  presented  in notes 6.2.3. and 6.2.4.\n\nThe income statement is presented, by type, in note 6.2.1.\n\nThe main income statement aggregates are:\n\n- \u00b7 net  income,  including  net  revenues  from  commissions  and other customer activities (note 1.3.6) and net financial income;\n- \u00b7 general operating expenses;\n- \u00b7 cost of risk (note 1.3.13);\n- \u00b7 the share of net income from equity-accounted entities;\n- \u00b7 net gains or losses on other assets.\n\n## 1.3 Accounting methods and principles\n\n## 1.3.1 Use of assumptions and estimates for the preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  in  accordance with  the  IFRS  accounting  standards  implies  that  the  Group carries  out  a  number  of  estimates  and  retains  certain assumptions it deems realistic and reasonable. The estimates relate to the identification of income and expenses and the valuation of assets and liabilities as well as the information in the notes to the financial statements.\n\nThe exercise assumes that Management  applies its judgement based on the information available at the time the statements  are  prepared.  Due  to  the  uncertainties  inherent in  any  valuation  process,  the  Group  revises  its  estimates based  on  information  updated  on  a  regular  basis.  It  is therefore possible that the future results of the operations in question differ from the estimates.\n\nFuture  results  can  be  impacted  by  a  number  of  different factors, notably (but not exclusively):\n\n- \u00b7 the economic and political environment in certain business sectors and countries;\n- \u00b7 the  risks  associated  with  financial  markets,  including changes in the domestic and international markets as well as  fluctuations  in  interest  rates,  exchange  rates,  equities and credit spreads. In line with the sensitivity of managed assets  to  any  variation  in  financial  markets  (equity,  rates, etc.), this may have an impact on the Amundi Group's net asset management revenues;\n- \u00b7 changes in regulations and legislation;\n- \u00b7 the risk of non-compliance with regulations and legislation.\n\nI\n\nThe  significant  estimates  made  by  the  Group  to  prepare  the financial statements relate primarily to:\n\n- \u00b7 assessment  of  the  recoverable  amount  of  goodwill  and other intangible assets (see notes 1.4.6. and 5.13.);\n- \u00b7 the  fair  value  measurement  of  financial  instruments  (see notes 1.3.2. and 7);\n- \u00b7 the  valuation  of  provisions  for  guarantees  granted  to funds;\n- \u00b7 the valuation of provisions for retirement commitments;\n- \u00b7 the valuation of provisions for legal, tax, regulatory and noncompliance risks (please refer to notes 1.3.2.10. and 5.14.).\n\nAll  these  assessments  are  carried  out  on  the  basis  of  the information available on the date of establishing the financial statements.\n\n## 1.3.2 Financial instruments\n\n## 1.3.2.1 Definitions\n\nIAS  32  defines  a  financial  instrument  as  any  contract  that gives  rise  to  a  financial  asset  in  one  entity  and  a  financial liability  or  equity  instrument  in  another  entity, i.e. any contract representing contractual rights or obligations to pay or receive cash or other financial assets.\n\nDerivatives are financial assets and liabilities that derive their value  from  an  underlying,  which  require  little  or  no  initial investment and which are settled at a future date.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are recognised in the financial statements  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  IFRS  9  as adopted by the European Union.\n\nIFRS  9  sets  new  principles  governing  the  classification  and measurement  of  financial  instruments,  impairment  of  credit risk and hedge  accounting, excluding macro-hedging transactions.\n\nPlease  note,  however,  that  Amundi  has  opted  not  to  apply the general IFRS 9 hedging accounting model. Consequently, IAS  39  continues  to  be  applied  to  all  hedging  relationships whilst awaiting future provisions for macro-hedging.\n\n## 1.3.2.2 Bases for measuring financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Initial measurement\n\nUpon  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are valued at fair value as defined by IFRS 13.\n\nFair  value  as  defined  by  IFRS  13  is  the  price  that  would  be received to sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an orderly  transaction  between  market  participants  at  the measurement  date,  on  the  primary  or  most  advantageous market.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\nAfter  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  and  liabilities  are valued based on their classification, either at their amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for debt instruments,  or  at  their  fair  value  as  specified  by  IFRS  13. Derivatives are always measured at fair value.",

        "page_content": "Amortised cost is the amount at which the financial asset or liability  is  measured  upon  initial  recognition,  including  the transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue,  less  principal  repayments,  plus  or  minus  accumulated amortisation, calculated using the effective interest rate (EIR) method  for  any  difference  (discount  or  premium)  between the initial amount and the amount at maturity. In the case of a  financial  asset  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  through recyclable equity, the amount  may  be  adjusted  for impairment losses, if necessary.\n\n## 1.3.2.3 Financial assets\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nNon-derivative financial  assets  (debt  or  equity  instruments) are  classified  in  accounting  categories  in  the  financial statements  that  determine  their  accounting  treatment  and their  subsequent  measurement  method.  These  financial assets are classified in one of the following three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 financial assets at amortised cost (debt instruments only);\n- \u00b7 financial assets at fair value through equity (recyclable for debt instruments, non-recyclable for equity instruments).\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nThe  classification  and  measurement  of  debt  instruments depends  on  two  criteria,  the  management  model  and  the analysis  of  contractual  characteristics  (unless  the  fair  value option is used).\n\n## The three management models\n\nThe  management  model  is  representative  of  the  financial asset management strategy followed by Amundi's management  in order to meet its objectives. The management  model  is  specified  for  an  asset  portfolio  and does not constitute an intention, on a case-by-case basis, for an isolated financial asset.\n\nThere are three separate management models:\n\n- \u00b7 the  'hold  to  collect'  model  which  aims  to  collect contractual  cash  flows  over  the  life  of  the  assets;  this model does not necessarily mean that all assets are held to contractual maturity, but asset sales are strictly controlled;\n- \u00b7 the 'hold to collect and sell' model which aims to collect cash  flows  over  the  life  of  the  asset  and  to  dispose  of assets;  under  this  model,  the  sale  of  financial  assets  and the receipt of cash are both essential; and\n- \u00b7 the  other/sale  model  whose  primary  objective  is  asset disposal.\n\nThis model mainly relates to portfolios that aim to collect cash flows via disposals,  portfolios  whose  performance  is measured  on  the  basis  of  fair  value  and  portfolios  of financial assets held for trading.\n\nWhen  the  strategy  pursued  by  the  Management  for managing financial assets does not match either the 'holdto-collect'  model  or  the  'hold-to-collect-and-sell'  model, these  financial  assets  are  classified  in  an  other/sale portfolio model.\n\n## Contractual  characteristics  ('solely  payments  of  principal  & interests' or 'SPPI' test)\n\nThe 'SPPI' test combines a series of criteria, examined on a cumulative basis, that make it possible to establish whether the  contractual  cash  flows  have  the  characteristics  of  a simple  financing  arrangement  (payments  of  principal  and interest on the principal outstanding).\n\nThe  test  is  satisfied  when  the  financing  arrangement  gives rise solely to payments of principal and where the payment of  interest  received  reflects  the  time  value  of  money,  the credit  risk  associated  with  the  instrument,  the  other  costs and risks of a traditional loan agreement as well as a reasonable margin, whether the interest rate is fixed or variable.\n\nUnder a simple financing arrangement, the interest represents the cost of time elapsing, the price of credit and liquidity  risk  over  the  period  and  other  components related to the asset's carrying cost (e.g. administrative costs, etc.).\n\nIn some cases, this qualitative analysis is not conclusive and quantitative analysis (or Benchmark Test) is carried out. This additional  analysis  consists  of  comparing  contractual  cash flows for the asset under consideration and cash flows for a benchmark asset.\n\nIf the difference between the financial asset's cash flows and those  of  the  benchmark  asset  is  deemed  to  be  immaterial, the asset is deemed to be a simple financing arrangement.\n\nIn  addition,  a  specific  analysis  will  be  conducted  if  the financial  asset  was  issued  by  special  purpose  entities establishing  an  order  of  payment  priority  between  financial asset  holders  by  bundling  multiple  instruments  together under  contract  and  creating  credit  risk  concentrations ('tranches').\n\nEach tranche is given a level of subordination which specifies the order of distribution of the cash flows generated by the structured entity.\n\nIn  this  event,  the  SPPI  test  requires  an  analysis  of  the contractual cash flow characteristics of the asset in question and  of  underlying  assets  according  to  the  'look-through' approach  and  of  the  credit  risk  carried  by  the  subscribed tranches  compared  with  the  credit  risk  for  the  underlying assets.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Although  contractual cash flows are received during the time that Amundi holds the  assets,  receipt  of  these  contractual  cash  flows  is ancillary rather than essential;\n\n- \u00b7 debt  instruments  that  do  not  meet  the  SPPI  test  criteria. This is particularly true of UCIs;\n- \u00b7 financial  instruments  classified  in  portfolios  for  which  the entity  chooses  measurement  at  fair  value  to  lessen  a difference in accounting treatment in the income statement. In this case, classification of fair value through profit or loss is designated as an option.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  excluding  transaction costs (taken directly to profit or loss) and including accrued interest.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value and changes in fair  value  are  recognised  through  profit  or  loss,  in  net revenues as an offset to outstanding assets.\n\nNo impairments are recognised for this category of financial assets.\n\nDebt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss as an option are recorded on the trading date.\n\nDebt  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  through  profit  or loss  that  do  not  satisfy  the  SPPI  test  are  recorded  on  the settlement/delivery date.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity  instruments  are,  by  default,  recognised  at  fair  value through  profit  or  loss,  apart  from  an  irrevocable  option  of classification at fair value in non-recyclable equity, provided that such instruments are not held for trading purposes.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value,  excluding  transaction costs (taken directly to profit or loss). They are recorded on the settlement/delivery date (except equity instruments held for trading purposes, which are recorded on the trading date).",

These  securities  are recorded on the trading date.\n\nThe initial fair value includes transaction costs.\n\nOn  subsequent  measurements,  changes  in  fair  value  are recognised in non-recyclable equity. In the event of disposal, these  changes  are  not  recycled  through  profit  or  loss,  the gain or loss on the disposal is recognised in equity.\n\nOnly dividends are recognised through profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets\n\nA  financial  asset  (or  group  of  financial  assets)  is  fully  or partially derecognised if:\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual rights to the related cash flows expire;\n- \u00b7 or  are  transferred  or  deemed  to  have  expired  or  been transferred because they belong de facto to one or more beneficiaries  and  if  almost  all  of  the  risks  and  benefits  of ownership of the financial asset are transferred.\n\nIn this case, any rights or obligations created or retained at the time of transfer are recognised separately as assets and liabilities.\n\nIf the contractual rights to the cash flows are transferred, but only some of the risks and rewards of ownership as well as control are retained, the entity will continue to recognise the financial asset to the extent of its involvement in the asset.\n\nFinancial  assets  renegotiated for commercial reasons in the absence of financial difficulties by the counterparty and with the  aim  of  building  or  retaining  a  business  relationship  are derecognised on the renegotiation date. New loans to clients are  recorded  on  that  date  at  their  fair  value  on  the renegotiation date. Subsequent recognition is dependent on the management model and the SPPI test.\n\n## 1.3.2.4 Financial liabilities\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\nBalance  sheet  financial  liabilities  are  classified  in  these  two accounting categories:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, either by type or designated as an option;\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss by type\n\nFinancial  instruments  issued  primarily  with  a  view  to  shortterm  buyback,  instruments  forming  part  of  a  portfolio  of identified financial instruments which are managed as a unit\n\nand which show signs of having a recent short-term profittaking  profile,  and  derivatives  (apart  from  some  hedging derivatives) are measured at fair value by type.\n\nChanges  in  the  fair  value  of  this  portfolio  are  recognised through the income statement.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss as an option\n\nFinancial liabilities meeting one of the three cases provided by  the  standard  may  optionally  be  valued  at  fair  value through  profit  or  loss:  hybrid  issues  including  one  or  more separable embedded derivatives, lessening or elimination of the  distortion  of  the  accounting  treatment,  or  groups  of managed financial liabilities whose performance is measured at fair value.\n\nThis  option  is  irrevocable  and  is  applied,  on  a  mandatory basis, on the date of the instrument's initial recognition.\n\nOn  the  occasion  of  subsequent  measurements,  these financial liabilities are measured at fair value through profit or loss for changes in fair value unrelated to own credit risk and in  non-recyclable equity for changes in value linked to own credit risk unless this makes the accounting mismatch worse.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nAny  other  liabilities  meeting  the  definition  of  a  financial liability  (apart  from  derivatives)  are  measured  at  amortised cost.\n\nThese liabilities are initially recorded at fair value (including transaction income and costs) and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Reclassification of financial liabilities\n\nThe  initial  classification  of  financial  liabilities  is  irrevocable. No subsequent reclassification is authorised.\n\n## Distinction between liabilities and equity\n\nThe  distinction  between  debt  instruments  and  equity instruments  is  based  on  an  analysis  of  the  economic substance of contractual arrangements.\n\nA  financial  liability  is  a  debt  instrument  if  it  includes  a contractual obligation:\n\n- \u00b7 to return cash, other financial assets or a variable number of equity instruments to another entity; or\n- \u00b7 to  exchange  financial  assets  and  liabilities  with  another entity under potentially unfavourable conditions.\n\nAn equity instrument is a non-repayable financial instrument that  provides  a  discretionary  return  which  highlights  a residual interest in a company after deduction of all financial liabilities  (net  assets)  and  which  is  not  qualified  as  a  debt instrument.\n\n## Buyback of treasury shares\n\nThe treasury shares purchased by Amundi, including shares held for hedging the performance share allocation plans, do not  fall  within  the  definition  of  a  financial  asset  and  are recognised as a deduction from the equity. They do not have any impact on the income statement.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Any difference between the carrying amount of the liability that  has  been  extinguished  and  the  new  liability  will  be recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\nIf the  financial  liability  has  not  been  derecognised,  the original effective interest rate continues.  A  discount/ premium is immediately recognised through profit or loss on the date of the modification and is then apportioned at the original effective interest rate over the remaining life of the instrument.\n\n## 1.3.2.5 Provisions for credit risk\n\n## Scope of application\n\nIn  accordance with IFRS 9, Amundi recognises impairments under Expected Credit Losses (ECL) for outstanding assets on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments  recognised  at amortised cost or at fair value in recyclable equity (loans and receivables, debt securities);\n- \u00b7 guarantee commitments covered by IFRS 9 and which are not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nEquity instruments (at fair value through profit or loss or at fair value  in  non-recyclable  OCI)  are  not  affected  by impairment provisions.\n\nCounterparty  risk  is  calculated  for  derivatives  and  other instruments at fair value through profit or loss which is not pursuant to the ECL model.\n\n## Credit risk and provisioning stages\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of losses associated with the default of a counterparty leading to its inability to meet its commitments to the Group.\n\nThe  credit  risk  provisioning  process  distinguishes  between three different stages (Buckets):\n\n- \u00b7 stage  1  (Bucket  1):  from  the  initial  recognition  of  the  financial instrument  (credit,  debt  security,  guarantee,  etc.),  the  entity recognises 12-month expected credit losses;\n- \u00b7 stage  2  (Bucket  2):  if  the  credit  quality  deteriorates significantly for a given transaction or portfolio, the entity recognises  the  expected  losses  to  maturity  (ECL  to maturity);\n- \u00b7 stage 3 (Bucket 3): when one or more default events occur in respect of the transaction or the counterparty and have a  damaging  effect  on  estimated  future  cash  flows,  the entity recognises  objective  evidence  of  impairment. Subsequently,  if  the  conditions  for  classifying  financial instruments  in  Bucket  3  are  not  met,  the  financial instruments are reclassified  in  Bucket  2,  then  in  Bucket  1, depending on the  subsequent  improvement  in  credit  risk quality.\n\nI\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe definition of default for the requirements of provisioning for  ECLs  is  identical  to  that  used  in  management  and  for calculating regulatory ratios. A debtor is thus considered to be  in  default  when  at  least  one  of  the  following  two conditions has been met:\n\n- \u00b7 significant payment arrears generally in excess of 90 days unless special circumstances show that the arrears are due to reasons unrelated to the debtor's situation;\n- \u00b7 the  entity  deems  it  unlikely  that  the  debtor  will  settle  its credit obligations in full without recourse to measures such as the provision of surety.\n\nAn outstanding asset in default (Bucket 3) is said to be impaired when  one  or  more  events  have  occurred  that  have  a  harmful effect  on  this  financial  asset's  estimated  future  cash  flows. Signs  of  a  financial  asset's  impairment  include  observable  data on the following events:\n\n- \u00b7 major financial difficulties experienced by the issuer or the borrower;\n- \u00b7 a breach of contract, such as failed or late payment;\n- \u00b7 the  granting  of  one  or  more  favours  by  one  or  more lenders  to  the  borrower  for  economic  or  contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financial difficulties that the  lender  or  lenders  would  not  have  envisaged  under other circumstances;\n- \u00b7 the  increasing  probability  of  the  failure  or  financial restructuring of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 the  disappearance  of  an  active  market  for  the  financial asset due to financial difficulties;\n- \u00b7 the  purchase  or  creation  of  a  financial  asset  with  a  big discount, which reflects the credit losses suffered.\n\nIt  is  not  necessarily possible to single out a particular event since the impairment of the financial asset may be the result of the combined effect of several events.\n\n## The concept of expected credit loss (ECL)\n\nECL  is  defined  as  the  probability-weighted  estimate  of discounted credit loss (principal and interest). It is the actual value of the difference between contractual cash flows and expected cash flows (principal and interest).\n\nThe ECL approach aims to allow expected credit losses to be recognised as early as possible.\n\n## Governance and measurement of ECLs\n\nGovernance  of  the  system  used  to  measure  IFRS  9 parameters is based on the organisation put in place under the Basel framework.  The  Group's  Risk  Management Department  is  responsible  for  defining  the  methodological framework and oversight of the system of asset provisioning.\n\nThe  Group  prioritises  the  internal  rating  system  and  current Basel  processes  when  generating  the  IFRS  9  parameters needed to calculate ECLs. Assessment of the change in credit risk  is  based  on  an  expected  loss  model  and  extrapolation based  on  reasonable  scenarios.  All  available, relevant, reasonable  and  supportable  information  must  be  used, including forward-looking information.",

        "page_content": "The  calculation  formula  incorporates  the  parameters  of probability  of  default,  loss  in  the  event  of  default  and exposure at the time of default.\n\nThese  calculations  are  based  on  internal  models  applied within  a  regulatory  framework  where  this  exists,  but  with restatements  to  determine  an  economic  ECL.  IFRS  9 recommends a Point in Time analysis while taking account of historic loss data and Forward-looking macroeconomic data, whilst  the  prudential  viewpoint  is  analysed  Through  The Cycle for the probability of default and at the lowest point of the cycle (downturn) for losses in the event of default.\n\nThis accounting approach also results in the recalculation of certain Basel parameters to neutralise internal recovery costs or  the  floors  imposed  by  the  regulator  in  the  regulatory calculation of Loss Given Default or LGD.\n\nECL  calculation  methods  must  be  assessed  according  to product  type:  financial  instruments  and  off-balance  sheet instruments.\n\n12-month expected credit losses are a portion of the lifetime expected credit losses and represent the cash flow shortfalls caused by default within 12 months of the reporting date (or a  shorter  period  if  the  financial  instrument's  lifetime  is expected  to  be  less  than  12  months),  weighted  by  the probability of default within the 12 months.\n\nExpected  credit  losses  are  discounted  using  the  EIR determined at the financial instrument's initial recognition.\n\nECL  measurement  methods  take  into  account  the  assets assigned  as  collateral  and  other  credit  enhancements  that are part of the contractual terms and that the entity does not recognise  separately.  The  estimated  cash  flow  shortfalls expected  from  a  secured  financial  instrument  reflects  the amount  and  the  timing  for  recovering  the  collateral.  In accordance with IFRS 9, the recognition of guarantees and collateral  does  not  affect  the  assessment  of  the  significant deterioration in credit risk: this is based on changes in credit risk on the debtor without taking into account guarantees.\n\nThe  models  and  parameters  used  are  back-tested  at  least once a year.\n\n## Significant deterioration in credit risk\n\nOn  each  reporting  date,  all  Group  entities  must  assess  the deterioration of the credit risk for each financial instrument since its initial recognition. This assessment of the change in credit  risk  leads  entities  to  categorise  their  transactions  by risk rating (Buckets).\n\nTo  assess  significant  deterioration,  the  Group  operates  a process based on two levels of analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 an initial level depending on Group rules and relative and absolute criteria imposed on Group entities;\n- \u00b7 a second level relating to the assessment, certified by an expert for local Forward Looking data, of the risk carried by each entity on its portfolios that may lead the Group to adjust its criteria for downgrading to Bucket 2 (portfolio or sub-portfolio switching to ECL at maturity).\n\nAll  financial  instruments,  save  for  some  exceptions,  are monitored  for  significant  deterioration.  No  contagion  is required  to  switch  financial  instruments  from  the  same outstanding from Bucket 1 to Bucket 2. Monitoring significant deterioration  must  take  account  of  changes  to  the  main debtor's credit risk, without taking account of the warranty.\n\nFor outstanding assets comprising small loans and receivables with similar characteristics, the counterparty-bycounterparty  review  may  be  replaced  by  a  statistical estimate of expected losses.\n\nTo measure significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition,  it  is  necessary  to  recover  the  initial  internal rating and PD (probability of default).\n\nThe date of origination is understood to be the trading date, when the entity becomes party to the contractual provisions of  the  financial  instrument.  For  financing  and  guarantee commitments, the date of origination is understood to be the irrevocable commitment date.\n\nFor  outstanding  assets  (other  than  securities)  for  which internal rating systems have been constructed (in particular, exposures monitored using authorised methods), the Amundi Group  considers  that  all  the  information  incorporated  in such  rating  systems  allows  for  a  more  relevant  assessment than the sole criterion of payments more than 30 days past due.\n\nIf the deterioration since the date of origination ceases to be recorded, the impairment may return to 12-month expected credit losses (Bucket 1).\n\nTo  compensate  for  the  fact  that  some  factors  or  signs  of significant  deterioration  cannot  be  identified  at  the  level  of an individual financial instrument, the standard authorises the assessment of significant deterioration for portfolios, groups of portfolios or portions of portfolios of financial instruments.\n\nThe  construction  of  portfolios  to  assess  deterioration  on  a collective basis may result in common characteristics such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the type of instrument;\n- \u00b7 the credit risk rating (including the internal Basel II rating for entities with an internal rating system);\n- \u00b7 the type of collateral;\n- \u00b7 the initial recognition date;\n- \u00b7 the remaining term to maturity;\n- \u00b7 the value of collateral relative to the financial asset, if it has an  impact  on  the  probability  of  a  default  occurring  (for example, non-recourse loans in some jurisdictions or loanto-value ratios).\n\nGroupings  of  financial  instruments  for  the  purpose  of assessing  changes  in  credit  risk  on  a  collective  basis  may change over time as new information becomes available.\n\nFor  securities,  Amundi  uses  an  approach  that  consists  of applying an absolute level of credit risk in accordance with IFRS  9,  beyond  which  exposures  are  classified  in  Bucket  2 and provisioned on the basis of ECL at maturity.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Each entity must set the writeoff  time  with  the  Risk  Management Department, depending on how much information it has on its business. Prior to any write-offs, Bucket 3 provisioning must be made (apart from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss).\n\nFor  loans  at  amortised  cost  or  at  fair  value  in  recyclable equity, the amount written off is recorded under cost of risk for  the  principal  and  under  net  financial  income  for  the interest.\n\n## 1.3.2.6 Financial derivatives\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nDerivatives  are  financial  assets  or  liabilities  classified,  by default,  as  derivative  instruments  held  for  trading,  unless they can be classified as derivative hedging instruments.\n\nThey  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  initial  fair value on the trading date.\n\nThey are subsequently measured at fair value.\n\nOn  every  reporting  date,  any  change  in  the  fair  value  of derivatives on the balance sheet is recorded:\n\n- \u00b7 in  profit  or  loss  for  derivatives  held-for-trading  or  as  fair value hedges;\n- \u00b7 in equity if these are derivatives used to hedge cash flows or a net investment in a foreign operation, for the effective portion of the hedge.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\n## General framework\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  Group's  decision,  Amundi  does  not apply the 'Hedge accounting' section of IFRS 9 in line with the  option  given  by  the  standard.  All  hedging  relationships\n\nI\n\nwill  continue  to  be  documented  in  accordance  with  IAS  39 rules  until,  at  the  latest,  the  macro-hedging  text  is  adopted by the European Union.

In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Group  documents  these  hedging  relationships  on  the basis of the gross position of derivatives and hedged items;\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness of these hedging  relationships is evidenced by means of timelines.",

        "page_content": "## M easurement\n\nThe  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  at  its  fair  value  is recognised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 fair  value  hedge:  the  change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is recognised in profit or loss symmetrically with the change in value of the hedged item in the amount of the hedged risk. Only the net amount of any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 cash flow hedge: the change in value of the derivative is recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  as  a  counterparty  to  a specific account in gains and losses recognised directly in recyclable  equity  for  the  effective  portion,  and  any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss.  Any  profits  or  losses  on  the  derivative  accrued through equity are then recycled in profit or loss when the hedged cash flows occur;\n- \u00b7 hedges  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the change  in  value  of  the  derivative  is  recognised  in  the balance  sheet  as  a  counterparty  to  the  translation difference in recyclable equity and any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nWhen the conditions  for  benefiting  from  hedge  accounting are no longer met, the following accounting treatment must be applied prospectively:\n\n- \u00b7 fair value hedge: only the hedging instrument continues to be revalued as a counterparty to profit or loss. The hedged item  is  wholly  recognised  according  to  its  classification. For  debt  instruments  at  fair  value  in  equity  recyclable through profit or loss, changes in fair value subsequent to the end of the hedging relationship are recorded, in full, in equity.  For  hedged items valued at amortised cost which were  interest  rate  hedges,  the  revaluation  surplus  is amortised over the remaining life of those hedged items;\n- \u00b7 cash flow hedge: the hedging instrument is valued at fair value through profit or loss. The amounts accumulated in equity under the effective portion of the hedge remain in equity until the hedged element affects profit or loss. For interest  rate  hedged  items,  net  income  is  allocated according  to  the  payment  of  interest.  The  revaluation surplus  is  therefore  amortised  over  the  remaining  life  of those hedged items;\n- \u00b7 hedging  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign  operation:  the amounts accumulated in equity in respect of the effective portion  of  the  hedging  remain  in  equity  while  the  net investment  is  held.  The  income  is  recorded  once  the  net investment  in  the  foreign  operation  exits  the  scope  of consolidation.\n\n## 1.3.2.7 Determining the fair value of financial instruments\n\nThe  fair  value  of  financial  instruments  is  determined  by maximising the use of observable input data. It is presented using the hierarchy defined by IFRS 13.\n\nIFRS 13 defines fair value as the price that would be received to  sell  an  asset  or  paid  to  transfer  a  liability  in  an  orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date,  on  the  primary  market  or  on  the  most  advantageous market.\n\nFair  value  applies  individually  to  each  financial  asset  and financial  liability.  It  can,  exceptionally,  be  estimated  by portfolio  if  the  management  and  risk  monitoring  strategy allow and if appropriately documented. Accordingly, certain fair  value  parameters  are  calculated  on  a  net  basis  when  a group of financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  is  managed on the basis of its net exposure to market or credit risks. This is the  case  for  the  CVA  calculation  (Credit  Valuation Adjustment)  and  the  DVA  calculation  (Debit  Valuation Adjustment).\n\nAmundi  believes  that  quoted  prices  published  in  an  active market are the best evidence of fair value.\n\nWhen  such  quoted  prices  are  not  available,  fair  value  is established by using valuation techniques that maximise the use  of  relevant  observable  data  and  minimise  the  use  of unobservable data.\n\n## Fair value of structured issues\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, Amundi values its structured issues by integrating the issue spread of the guarantor.\n\n## Counterparty risk on derivative instruments\n\nIn application of IFRS 13, Amundi incorporates into fair value the  assessment  of  counterparty  risk  for  derivative  assets (Credit Valuation Adjustment -CVA)  and,  using a symmetrical treatment, the non-performance risk for derivative  liabilities  (Debit  Valuation  Adjustment  -  DVA  or own credit risk).\n\nCVA makes it possible to determine expected counterparty losses from Amundi's perspective. DVA makes it possible to determine expected losses on Amundi from the counterparty's perspective.\n\nFor  derivatives  carried  out  with  market  counterparties,  the CVA/DVA calculation  is  based  on  an  estimate  of  expected losses given the probability of default and loss in the event of default.  The  methodology  used  maximises  the  use  of observable  market  data.  It  is  primarily  based  on  market parameters such as registered and listed CDS (Credit Default Swaps) or Single Name CDS, or Index CDS in the absence of named  counterparty  CDS.  Under  certain  circumstances, historical default parameters may also be used.\n\nNo CVA/DVA is calculated either for derivatives contracted by Amundi or for funds, taking into account that there is no historical  default  data  and  the  guarantee  provided  by Amundi to the funds.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

These are stocks and bonds quoted in active markets (such as the Paris Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the New York  Stock  Exchange,  etc.)  and  shares  in  investment  funds listed  on  an  active  market  and  derivatives  traded  on  an organised market, in particular futures.\n\nA market is deemed to be active if quoted prices are readily and  regularly  available  from  an  exchange,  broker,  dealer, pricing service or regulatory  agency,  and  the  prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions under normal competitive conditions.\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities with offsetting market risks, Amundi uses mid-prices as the basis for establishing the fair value  of  the  positions.  The  current  bid  price  is  applied  to assets held or liabilities to be issued (open long position) and the current asking price to assets to be acquired or liabilities held (open short position).\n\n## Level 2: fair value measured using directly or indirectly observable inputs other than those in Level 1\n\nThis  data  is  directly  observable  (i.e.  prices)  or  indirectly observable  (data  derived  from  prices)  and  generally  meets the  following  criteria:  this  is  data  not  specific  to  the  entity, which is publicly available/accessible and based on a market consensus.\n\nLevel 2 consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 stocks and bonds listed on an inactive market or unlisted on an active market, but for which fair value is established using a valuation methodology habitually used by market participants  (such  as  the  method  of  discounting  future cash flows or the Black & Scholes method) and based on observable market data;\n- \u00b7 instruments  traded  over  the  counter,  the  fair  value  of which  is  measured  with  models  using  observable  market data,  i.e.  which  can  be  obtained  from  several  sources independent  of  internal  sources  on  a  regular  basis.  For example, the fair value of interest rate swaps is generally derived  from  the  yield  curves  of  interest  rates  based  on market interest rates observed on the reporting date.\n\nWhen the models used are consistent with standard models and on observable market parameters (such as yield curves or implied volatility ranges), the initial margin generated on the instruments valued in this way is recognised in profit or loss from inception.\n\nI\n\n## Level 3: fair value for which a significant number of the parameters used for determination are not based on observable criteria\n\nIn  the  case  of  some  complex  instruments  which  are  not traded in an active market, fair value measurement is based on valuation techniques that use assumptions not supported by data observable on the market for an identical instrument. These instruments are presented in Level 3.\n\nThese are mainly complex rate products, equity derivatives and structured credit products whose valuation requires, for example, correlation or volatility parameters that cannot be directly compared to market data.\n\nThe initial transaction price is deemed to reflect the market value and recognition of the initial margin is deferred.\n\nThe margin generated on these structured financial instruments  is  generally  recognised  in  profit  or  loss  spread over the period during which the parameters are deemed to be unobservable. When  the market data becomes observable, the margin remaining to be spread is immediately recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe valuation methodologies and models used to value the financial instruments presented in Levels 2 and 3 incorporate all of the factors that market players use to calculate prices. They  must  first  be  validated  by  an  independent  audit. Determination  of  the  fair  value  of  these  instruments  takes into account both the liquidity risk and the counterparty risk.\n\n## 1.3.2.8 Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nIn  accordance with IAS 32, Amundi offsets a financial asset and  a  financial  liability  and  reports  the  net  balance  if,  and only if it has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts reported  and  intends  either  to  settle  on  a  net  basis,  or  to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\nThe  effect  of  this  offsetting  is  presented  in  table  5.4. concerning  the  amendment  to  IFRS  7  on  disclosures regarding  the  offsetting  of  financial  assets  and  financial liabilities.\n\n## 1.3.2.9 Net gains or losses on financial instruments\n\n## Net gains or losses on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFor financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, this heading includes the following income statement items:\n\n- \u00b7 dividends  and  other  revenue  from  shares  and  other variable-income securities classified under financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 changes in fair value of financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 gains and losses on disposal of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 changes  in  fair  value  and  gains  and  losses  on  disposal  or termination of derivatives not included in a fair value hedging relationship or cash flow hedge.",

If  required,  the estimates are discounted when the effect is significant.\n\nThis obligation can be legal, regulatory or contractual. It can also result from the Group's practices or from commitments that  created  a  legitimate  expectation  on  the  part  of  third parties involved that the Group will assume certain liabilities.\n\nIf  no  reliable  evaluation  of  the  amount  can  be  made,  no provisions are recognised, but information is provided in the appendix, where appropriate.\n\nThe  Group  creates  provisions  for  these  obligations  which cover:\n\n- \u00b7 risks related to guarantees granted to funds;\n- \u00b7 operational risks;\n- \u00b7 employee benefits, including retirement commitments;\n- \u00b7 disputes;\n- \u00b7 legal, tax (excluding income tax), regulatory and non-compliance risks.\n\n## 1.3.4 Employee benefits\n\nThese  are  grouped  into  four  categories  in  accordance  with IAS 19 'Employee benefits':\n\n- \u00b7 short-term  benefits  such  as  salaries,  social  security contributions,  annual  holidays,  incentives,  profit  sharing and  bonuses  are  those  which  are  expected  to  be  paid within 12 months following the financial year during which the services were rendered;\n- \u00b7 long-term  benefits  (long-service  awards,  bonuses  and compensation payable 12 months or more after the close of the financial year);\n- \u00b7 severance pay;\n- \u00b7 post-employment  benefits, falling into one of two categories  described  below:  defined-benefit  plans  and defined-contribution plans.\n\n## 1.3.4.1 Retirement plans - defined contribution plans\n\nThere  are  several  compulsory  retirement  plans  to  which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies  have  no  legal  or  implied  obligation  to  pay additional  contributions  if  the  funds  do  not  have  sufficient assets  to  cover  all  benefits  corresponding  to  services rendered  by  the  employees  during  the  financial  year  and during  prior  years.  Consequently,  Amundi  Group  entities have no liabilities in this respect other than their contributions to be paid for the year ended.\n\n## 1.3.4.2 Defined-benefits plans\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  19,  the  commitments  are  assessed based  on  a  set  of  actuarial,  financial  and  demographic assumptions  and  using  the  Projected  Unit  Credit  method. This method consists of allocating an expense corresponding to the rights vested over the period for each financial year of employment. The expense is calculated based on the future, discounted benefit.\n\nThe  calculations  for  expenses  for  future  social  benefits  are made  on  the  basis  of  assumptions  for  discount  rates, employee turnover and changes in wages and social security contributions developed by Management.\n\nThe  discount  rates  are  determined  based  on  the  average period of commitment, that is, the weighted average of the payment dates of future benefits. The underlying index used is the iBoxx AA Index.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IAS  19,  Amundi  allocates  all  actuarial differences recorded in gains and losses recognised directly in  non-recyclable  equity.  Actuarial  differences  consist  of adjustments  related  to  experience  (difference  between estimated and actual experience) and the effect of changes made to the actuarial assumptions.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The  difference  between  the  expected return  and  the  actual  return  of  plan  assets  is  recorded  in gains and losses recognised directly in non-recyclable equity.\n\nThe provision amount is equal to:\n\n- \u00b7 the  current  value  of  the  commitment  for  the  defined benefits on the closing date, calculated using the actuarial method recommended by IAS 19;\n- \u00b7 less,  if  appropriate,  the  fair  value  of  assets  allocated  to hedging the commitments. They can be represented by an eligible insurance policy. In the event that the obligation is fully  hedged  by  a  policy  which  exactly  covers,  in  both amount  and  time,  all  or  part  of  the  benefits  payable  by virtue of the plan, the fair value of the latter is considered to be that of the corresponding obligation (i.e. the amount of the corresponding actuarial debt).\n\nAmundi  has  taken  out  an  'IFC'  insurance  policy  (end-ofcareer  allowance)  with  an  insurance  company  in  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group.\n\nA  provision  to  cover  the  retirement  benefits  is  included  in balance sheet liabilities in the 'Provisions' item for commitments which are not covered.\n\n## 1.3.4.3 Long-term benefits\n\nLong-term benefits are benefits which are paid to employees other  than  post-employment  benefits,  severance  payments and equity-based compensation, but which are not due in full during the 12 months following the end of the financial year in  which  the  corresponding  services  were  rendered.  They include,  among  other  things,  bonuses  and  other  deferred compensation paid 12 months or more after the end of the financial year in which they were earned, but which are not indexed to shares.\n\nThe valuation method is similar to that used by the Group for post-employment benefits in the defined-benefits category.\n\nThe  long-term  benefits  which  can  be  granted  by  Amundi consist primarily of the allocation of bonuses whose payment will  be deferred to future financial years subject to meeting certain performance conditions set in advance and continued employment  at  the  time  of  payment  to  the  employees  to whom they were granted.\n\n## 1.3.5 Non-compliance risk\n\nAmundi conducts a regulated activity. As such, its business is subject  to  regular  monitoring  and  investigation  by  various regulators. These inspections may reveal certain irregularities and may, in some instances, result in fines or other penalties.\n\nFollowing an investigation conducted from 2017 to 2019, the French  Financial  Markets  Authority  (Autorit\u00e9  des  March\u00e9s Financiers  -  AMF)  notified  grievances  to  Amundi  on 12  June  2020.  The  grievances  relate  to  the  management  of\n\nI\n\ncertain  transactions  carried  out  by  two  Amundi  employees between 2014 and 2015. These transactions impacted assets managed  on  behalf  of  an  institutional  client,  who  was compensated.\n\nOn 4 August 2021, the AMF fined the Amundi Group a total of \u20ac32 million, which was paid during the year, thus bringing these proceedings to an end.\n\nVarious measures have been taken since then to ensure that such dysfunctions do not recur.\n\nThe  impact  of  this  risk  is  recorded  in  the  'Cost  of  Risk' section of the income statement.\n\n## 1.3.6 Revenue from contracts with customers (IFRS 15)\n\nMost  of  the  Group's  revenue  comes  from  third-party  asset management in collective or individual portfolios (dedicated funds  or  mandates).  It  is  essentially  based  on  the  assets under management in managed funds.\n\nThe net fees comprise net management fees which are equal to  the  gross  management  fees  received  after  deduction  of fees paid:\n\n- \u00b7 the  gross  management  fees  compensate  the  portfolio management  services.  They  are  primarily  calculated  by reference  to  a  percentage  of  the  outstanding  amounts managed;\n- \u00b7 the fees paid are composed of:\n- i) contractual  retrocessions  paid  to  distributors.  These generally correspond to a percentage of the management fees,\n- ii) custodian  and  valuation  agent  fees,  where  these  are paid by the asset management company, as well as a limited  number  of  associated  administrative  costs such as the ETF listing fees.\n\nNet fees are also composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 fees paid to Amundi for the guarantee given to guaranteed funds  or  structured  EMTNs.  Various  costs  connected  to the formation and the life of structured products are added to these fees;\n- \u00b7 transfer fees paid by the fund in respect of the execution of sales and purchases of securities on behalf of funds by the Amundi trading desk;\n- \u00b7 other  fees  for  lower  amounts,  such  as:  entry  fees, compensation  for  consulting  services,  borrowing  and lending  securities  fees,  account  maintenance  fees  for Employee Savings Plans.\n\nPerformance  fees  are  paid  to  the  asset  management company as provided by contract. They are calculated on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the actual  performance  and  the  benchmark  index  as  provided by the contract.",

Their recognition on the income statement must reflect the rate at which control of the goods or services sold is transferred to the customer:\n\nNet  income  from  a  transaction  associated  with  a  service provision is recognised under Fees upon transfer of control of the service provided to the customer, if this can be reliably estimated.  Said  transfer  may  be  made  as  the  service  is rendered (ongoing service) or on a given date (one-off service).\n\n- i) Fees  remunerating  ongoing  services  (management  fees, for  example)  are  recorded  in  profit  or  loss  according  to the stage of completion of the service provided.\n- ii) Fees received or paid for one-off services are recorded, in full, in profit or loss when the service is provided.\n\nThe  fees  payable  or  receivable  contingent  upon  meeting  a performance target are recognised only if all of the following conditions are met:\n\n- i) the amount of fees and commissions can be estimated reliably;\n- ii) it is probable  that  the  future  economic  benefits resulting  from  the  services  rendered  will  flow  to  the Company;\n- iii) the stage of completion of the service can be reliably estimated, and the costs incurred for the service and the costs to complete it can be reliably estimated.\n\nThese  performance  fees  are,  therefore,  recognised  in  the majority of cases in profit or loss at the end of the calculation period.\n\n## 1.3.7 Share-based payments (IFRS 2)\n\nIFRS  2  'Share-based  payments'  requires  valuation  of  the transactions  remunerated  by  payment  in  stock  and  similar instruments  in  the  profit  or  loss  and  balance  sheet  of  the Company. The standard is applicable to transactions carried out for employees, and specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in equity instruments;\n- \u00b7 transactions whose payment is based on shares and paid in cash.\n\nTwo plans in the Amundi Group are covered by IFRS 2:\n\n- \u00b7 share-based payment plans initiated by the Amundi Group of the type where settlement is made by awarding equity instruments (allocating performance shares). Share awards are measured at fair value at the time of the award. They are  recognised  in  expenses  under  'Employee  expenses' offsetting an equity account over the acquisition period of the rights;\n- \u00b7 when the award takes place after the services have been delivered,  Amundi  carries  out  a  valuation  of  the  services provided  by  the  beneficiaries.  The  expense  is  recognised over the period during which these services were provided;\n- \u00b7 Amundi  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  share  subscriptions  are made  available  to  employees  as  part  of  the  Company Savings Scheme. They are also covered by the provisions of IFRS 2. The shares are offered with a maximum discount of  30%.  The  plans  have  no  vesting  period,  but  include  a five-year lock-up period. The benefit granted to employees is measured as the difference between the fair value of the vested  shares  taking  into  account  the  lock-up  condition and  the  acquisition  price  paid  by  the  employee  on  the subscription  date  multiplied  by  the  number  of  shares subscribed;\n- \u00b7 the  expense  for  the  share  allocation  plan  settled  by Amundi  and  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  equity  instruments  is recognised as personnel expenses offsetting an increase in 'Consolidated reserves - Group share'.\n\n## 1.3.8 Current and deferred tax assets\n\nIn accordance with IAS 12, the income tax expense includes all income-related taxes, whether current or deferred.\n\n## Tax liability\n\nThe standard defines current tax liability as 'the amount of income tax payable (recoverable) with respect to the taxable profit  (tax  loss)  for  a  financial  year'.  The  taxable  income  is the  profit  (or  loss)  for  a  given  financial  year  measured according  to  the  rules  set  by  the  taxation  authorities.  The applicable rates and rules used to determine the current tax liability  are  those  in  effect  in  each  country  in  which  the Group's companies are established.\n\nA tax consolidation group was set up for the French entities (from 1 January 2010) with Amundi as the head of the group.\n\nThe current tax liability includes all taxes on income, payable or recoverable, for which payment is not subordinated to the completion of future transactions, even if payment is spread over several financial years. The current tax liability must be recognised as a liability until it is paid. If the amount that has already been paid for the current year and previous financial years  exceeds  the  amount  due  for  these  years,  the  surplus must be recognised under assets.\n\nMoreover, certain transactions carried out by the entity may have  tax  consequences  that  are  not  taken  into  account  in measuring the current tax liability. IAS 12 defines differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability and its tax base as temporary differences.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nThe standard requires that deferred taxes be recognised in the following cases:\n\nA  deferred  tax  liability  must  be  recognised  for  all  taxable temporary  differences  between  the  carrying  amount  of  an asset or liability on the balance sheet and its tax base, unless the deferred tax liability arises from:\n\n- \u00b7 initial recognition of goodwill;\n- \u00b7 initial  recognition  of  an  asset  or  a  liability  in  a  transaction that is not a business combination and that does not affect either the accounting or the taxable profit (taxable loss) on the transaction date.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

As a result, deferred tax is not recognised on these gains.\n\nIn France, capital gains on the sale of equity investments, as defined by the French General Tax Code and coming under long-term  taxation  treatment,  are  exempt  from  corporation tax  (except  for  a  12%  share  of  capital  gains  taxed  at  the normally  applicable  rate).  Accordingly,  unrealised  gains recognised  at  the  end  of  the  financial  year  generate  a temporary  difference  requiring  the  recognition  of  deferred tax on this share, in so far as Amundi considers the disposal of the securities likely.\n\nAs  part  of  IFRS  16  'Leases',  a  deferred  tax  liability  is recognised on the right of use and a deferred tax asset on the lease liability for leases for which the Group is lessee.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax is recognised in net income for the year, unless the tax arises from:\n\n- \u00b7 either a transaction or event recognised directly in equity, during  the  same  year  or  during  another  financial  year,  in which case it is directly debited or credited to equity;\n- \u00b7 or by a business combination.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  offset  each  other  if,  and only if:\n\n- \u00b7 the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7 and the deferred tax assets and liabilities concern income tax assessed by the same tax authority:\n- i) either for the same taxable entity,\n- ii) or  for  different  taxable  entities  that  intend  either  to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, or to settle their tax assets and liabilities at the same time  during  each  future  financial  year  in  which  it  is expected  that  substantial  deferred  tax  assets  or liabilities will be paid or recovered.\n\nTax risks relating to income tax resulting in the recognition of a receivable or a current tax liability when it is deemed to be more likely than unlikely that the assets will be received or the  liabilities  paid.  These  risks  are  also  taken  into  account when assessing current and deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n\nIFRIC 23 - Uncertainty over income tax treatments applies as soon  as  an  entity  has  identified  one  or  more  uncertainties over  income  tax  treatments  undertaken  with  regard  to  its taxes. It also provides details of their estimates:\n\n- \u00b7 the analysis must be based on the risk of an identification made solely by the tax administration;\n\nI\n\n- \u00b7 the tax risk  must  be  recognised  as  a  liability  if  it  is  more likely  than  not  that  the  tax  authorities  will  challenge  the treatment used, at an amount reflecting the Management's best estimate;\n- \u00b7 in the event that the probability of redemption by the tax authorities  is  greater  than  50%,  a  receivable  must  be recorded.\n\nWhen tax  credits  on  income  from  securities  portfolios  and receivables  are  effectively  used  to  pay  corporation  tax  due for  the  financial  year,  they  are  recognised  under  the  same heading as the income with which they are associated. The corresponding tax charge continues to be recognised under the 'Income tax' heading in the income statement.\n\n## 1.3.9 Property, plant and equipment\n\nAmundi  applies  component  accounting  to  all  its  property, plant  and  equipment.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of IAS 16,  the  depreciable  base  takes  account  of  the  potential residual value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nOperating  and  investment  buildings,  as  well  as  equipment, are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since they were commissioned.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nFixed assets are depreciated based on their estimated useful lives. The main periods used are:\n\n| \u00b7 Fixtures and fittings   | 5 to 10-year straight-line   |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 IT equipment            | 3-year declining balance     |\n| \u00b7 Office equipment        | 5-year straight-line         |\n| \u00b7 Office furniture        | 10-year straight-line        |\n| \u00b7 Technical plant         | 10-year straight-line        |\n| \u00b7 Buildings               | 20-year straight-line        |\n\nRepair  and  maintenance  costs  are  recorded  as  expenses when  incurred  except  in  cases  in  which  they  contribute  to increasing productivity or the useful life of the fixed asset.\n\nThe  information  which  Amundi  has  about  the  value  of  its amortisable  fixed  assets  has  led  it  to  conclude  that impairment tests would not result in any change in the values recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n## 1.3.10 Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  include  software,  as  well  as  the  intangible assets  resulting  from  the  identification  of  contractual  rights at  the  time  of  allocating  the  acquisition  price  of  a  business combination.\n\nPurchased  software  is  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment since the acquisition date.\n\nProprietary  software  is  recognised  at  production  cost  less accumulated  depreciation,  amortisation  and  write-downs since completion.\n\nAssets  acquired  from  business  combinations  resulting  from contractual  rights  (e.g.  distribution  agreements)  are  valued on  the  basis  of  corresponding  future  economic  benefits  or the potential of the expected services.",

There are two exceptions to this rule:\n\n- \u00b7 for  debt  instruments  at  fair  value  through  recyclable equity,  the  translation  adjustments  calculated  on  an amortised  cost  are  taken  to  profit  or  loss;  the  balance  is recorded in equity;\n- \u00b7 exchange  adjustments  on  items  designated  as  cash  flow hedges  or  forming  part  of  a  net  investment  in  a  foreign entity are recognised in equity.\n\nNon-monetary items are treated differently depending on the nature of the items:\n\n- \u00b7 items at historical cost are valued at the exchange rate on the transaction date;\n- \u00b7 items at fair value are valued at the exchange rate on the reporting date.\n\nExchange adjustments on non-monetary items are recognised:\n\n- \u00b7 in  profit-and-loss  if  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  non-monetary item is recorded in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 in  equity,  if  the  gain  or  loss  on  the  non-monetary  item  is recorded in equity.\n\n## 1.3.12 Earnings per share\n\nIn accordance with IAS 33:\n\n- \u00b7 basic  earnings  per  share  are  equal  to  net  consolidated income divided by the weighted average number of shares in circulation during the financial year;\n- \u00b7 diluted  earnings  per  share  are  equal  to  net  consolidated income divided by the weighted average number of shares in circulation during  the  financial  year.  These  two components  must  be  adjusted  for  the  effect  any potentially dilutive ordinary shares may have.\n\n## 1.3.13 Cost of risk\n\nThe  cost  of  risk  mainly  consists  of  the  cost  of  credit  risk including  any  changes  in  provisions  for  guaranteed  funds (financial  guarantees),  provisions  for  litigation  and  other expenses related to operational risk.\n\n## 1.3.14 Leases\n\nThe  Amundi  Group  holds  lease  agreements  primarily  as  a lessee.\n\nLease  transactions  are  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  on the  date  of  availability  of  the  leased  assets.  The  lessee\n\naccounts  for  an  asset  that  is  representative  of  the  right  to use  the  leased  asset  in  the  property,  plant  and  equipment during the estimated term of the contract and a debt owed under an obligation to pay the rents in the various liabilities over the same term.\n\nThe term of lease corresponds to the non-cancellable term of the  lease  adjusted  by  the  contract  extension  options  that the lessee is reasonably likely to exercise and the termination option that the lessee is reasonably likely not to exercise.\n\nIn France, the term  used  for  the  so-called  '3/6/9' commercial  leases  is  generally  9  years  with  an  initial  noncancellable  period  of  3  years.  Amundi  used  a  term corresponding to the earliest opportunity to terminate after 5 years has passed, as being the reasonably certain term of a lease.  This  term  is  applied  in  the  majority  of  cases  when French commercial leases are initiated.  The  main  exception to  this  will  be  a  lease  in  which  the  interim  three-year  exit options  have  been  waived  (for  example,  in  return  for  a reduction  in  rent);  in  this  case,  the  term  used  will  remain 9 years. This 5-year term also applies to leases that can be extended automatically.\n\nThe  lease  liability  is  recognised  at  an  amount  equal  to  the present  value  of  the  rent  payments  over  the  term  of  the contract.  Rent  payments  include  fixed  rents,  variable  rents based  on  a  rate  or  index,  and  payments  that  the  lessee expects  to  make  as  residual  value  guarantees,  a  purchase option or as an early termination penalty.\n\nVariable rents that do not depend on an index or a rate and the non-deductible VAT on rents are excluded from the debt calculation and are recognised as general operating expenses.\n\nThe discount rate applicable for calculating the right of use and  the  rental  liability  is,  by  default,  the  lessee's  marginal debt  ratio  over  the  term  of  the  contract  on  the  date  of signature of the contract when the implicit rate cannot easily be calculated. The marginal debt ratio takes account of the rental payment structure.\n\nThe  expense  of  the  lease  contracts  is  partly  comprised  of interest and partly of capital amortisation.\n\nThe right to use the asset is valued at the initial value of the lease liability, plus the initial direct costs, advance payments and refurbishment costs. It is amortised over the estimated term of the contract.\n\nThe lease liability and the right of use may be adjusted in the event  of  an  amendment  to  the  lease  agreement,  a reassessment of the lease term or a rent review linked to the application of indices or rates.\n\nDeferred  taxes  are  recognised  on  the  basis  of  timing differences between the rights to use and the lessee's rental liabilities.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  exception  set  out  in  the  standard, short-term leases (an initial term of less than twelve months) and leases where the value when new of the leased property is low  are  not  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet;  the corresponding leasing expenses are recorded on a straightline  basis  in  the  income  statement  in  general  operating expenses.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions set out in the standard, the Group does not apply IFRS 16 to leases for intangible assets.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

In  the  case  of  an unrealised loss, a write-down is recognised in profit or loss. They are no longer amortised when they are reclassified.\n\nIf the fair value of a group of assets held for sale less selling costs  is  less  than  its  carrying  amount  after  write-down  of non-current  assets,  the  difference  is  allocated  to  the  other assets  of  the  disposal  group,  including  the  financial  assets, and  is  recognised  under  net  income  from  discontinued operations.\n\nA discontinued operation is any component that the Group has  either  disposed  of,  or  is  classified  as  held-for-sale,  and which is in any of the following situations:\n\n- \u00b7 it is a major separate business line or a geographical area of operations;\n- \u00b7 it  is  part  of  a  single  coordinated  plan  to  dispose  of  a separate  major  business  line  or  geographical  area  of operations; or,\n- \u00b7 it is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.\n\nThe following are disclosed on a separate line of the income statement:\n\n- \u00b7 the net income from discontinued operations until the date of disposal, net of tax;\n- \u00b7 the  gain  or  loss  recognised  on  the  disposal  or  on measurement at fair value less the cost of sale of the assets and liabilities constituting the discontinued operations, net of tax.\n\nAmundi did not record any transactions covered within the scope of IFRS 5 during the 2021 financial period.\n\n## 1.4 Consolidation principles and methods\n\n## 1.4.1 Consolidation scope and methods\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  include  Amundi's financial statements and those of all companies over which, in  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  IFRS  10,  IFRS  11  and IAS 28, Amundi exercises control, joint control or significant influence.\n\n## 1.4.1.1 Definitions of control\n\nExclusive control over an entity is deemed to exist if Amundi is  exposed  to  or  entitled  to  receive  variable  returns  as  a result  of  its  involvement  in  the  entity  and  if  the  power  it\n\nI\n\nholds over this entity enables it to influence the returns. Only substantive  (voting  or  contractual)  rights  are  examined  to assess  the  concept  of  power.  Rights  are  considered substantive if the holder of the rights can exercise them, in practice, when decisions about the entity's relevant activities are made.\n\nAmundi  is  deemed  to  control  a  subsidiary  through  voting rights when its voting rights give it the ability to direct the subsidiary's relevant activities. Amundi is generally considered to control a subsidiary when it holds more than half  of  the  existing  or  potential  voting  rights  in  an  entity, whether  directly  or  indirectly  through  subsidiaries,  except when  it  can  be  clearly  demonstrated  that  such  ownership does  not  give  it  the  power  to  direct  its  relevant  activities. Control is  also  deemed to exist when Amundi holds half or less than half of the voting rights, including potential rights, in  an  entity  but  is  able  in  practice  to  direct  its  relevant activities  at  its  sole  discretion,  notably  because  of  the existence of contractual arrangements, the relative size of its stake  in  the  voting  rights  compared  to  those  of  other investors, or other facts or circumstances.\n\nControl of a structured entity is not assessed on the basis of the  percentage  of  voting  rights,  because  by  their  nature these have no effect on the entity's returns. When assessing control,  consideration  is  given  not  only  to  contractual arrangements, but also to whether Amundi was involved in creating the entity and what decisions it made at the time, what agreements were made at its inception and what risks are borne by Amundi, any rights under agreements that only give  the  investor  the  power  to  direct  relevant  activities  in specific circumstances and any other facts or circumstances that indicate that the investor can direct the entity's relevant activities. Where there is a management agreement, it should be established whether the manager is in practice acting as an agent (with delegated powers) or as a principal (on their own  account).  Accordingly,  when  decisions  about  the entity's relevant activities must be taken, the indicators used to assess whether an entity is acting as agent or principal are as  follows:  the  extent  of  the  decision-making  powers compared  to  the  powers  over  the  entity  delegated  to  the manager, the compensation provided for under the contractual agreements, but also any substantive rights held by  third  parties  involved  in  the  entity  that  may  affect  the decision-making  capacity  of  the  decision  maker  and  the exposure  to  the  variable  nature  of  the  returns  of  other interests held in the entity.\n\nJoint control is deemed to exist when there is a contractual division  of  control  over  an  economic  activity.  Decisions affecting  the  entity's  relevant  activities  require  unanimous agreement of the parties sharing control.\n\nIn  traditional  entities,  significant  influence  is  defined  as  the power  to  influence,  but  not  control,  a  company's  financial and operational  policies.  Significant  influence  is  assumed  in cases of 20% or more ownership, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, of the voting rights in an entity.\n\n## 1.4.1.2 Control and consolidation of structured entities (special purpose entities)\n\nThe control criteria for structured entities or special purpose entities  (structures  created  to  manage  an  operation  or  a group of similar operations) are defined by IFRS 10.",

        "page_content": "Control is primarily assessed based on the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the power to manage the entity's operations;\n- \u00b7 the receipt of variable revenue or exposure to the entity's risks;\n- \u00b7 the  ability  to  influence  the  revenue  earned  by  the  entity and the risks.\n\nThese  provisions  are  applicable  to  the  funds  held  or guaranteed by Amundi, in particular.\n\n## Funds held by Group companies\n\nWith  respect  to  the  fund  units  held  by  Group  companies, Amundi's  Management  assesses  the  existence  of  control based on two criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 the  threshold  at  which  the  holding  company  can  be considered to be primary:\n- \u00b7 either in the event of a direct holding in the fund above 35%, or,\n- \u00b7 in the event of a direct holding in the fund above 20% together with the sharing of performance fees between the management company and investors such that total Amundi revenue from the fund is greater than 35%;\n- \u00b7 the  durable  nature  of  the  investment,  established  in  the event of a holding greater than the above thresholds for a period longer than one year.\n\nUnder this analysis, cases of control of a fund by a company within the scope are limited and only involve dedicated funds and certain fund holdings for seed money.\n\n## Funds guaranteed by Amundi\n\nAmundi provides guarantees to funds managed by the Group (see note 9.5):\n\n- \u00b7 structured funds;\n- \u00b7 'portfolio insurance' funds.\n\nThe analysis conducted leads to the conclusion that there is no  control  as  defined  by  IFRS  10  criteria  so  the  funds  are therefore not consolidated.\n\nOnce  the  structure  of  structured  funds  is  established,  they are  managed  passively  and  subject  to  the  regulatory constraints of regulators (AMF, ESMA). This passive, directed management  and  the  internal  management  rules  (careful selection  of  exposures  to  credit  risk,  strict  management  of the  turnover  of  assets  held  by  the  fund)  limit  Amundi's exposure to variable returns.\n\nLikewise,  portfolio  insurance  fund  structuring  is  closely monitored  and  this  significantly  limits  the  guarantor's exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 investors  who  generally  have  immediate  rights  to  the returns on the funds' assets: Amundi's exposure to market risk  is  low;  it  is  essentially  tied  to  dynamic  assets  and  is further  reduced  by  internal  management  rules  (very prudent  assessment  of  risk  exposure,  strict  liquidity  and diversification controls);\n- \u00b7 exposure  to  credit  risk  which  is  essentially  tied  to monetising assets and is governed by the same restrictions as  those  applied  to  structured  funds  and  reflects  a  high level of caution at issuer selection time.\n\n## 1.4.2 Consolidation methods\n\nConsolidation methods are defined in IFRS 10 and the revised IAS  28.  They  result  from  the  type  of  control  exercised  by Amundi over the entities that can be consolidated, regardless of activity or whether or not they have legal entity status:\n\n- \u00b7 full consolidation, for controlled entities;\n- \u00b7 equity  method,  for  entities  over  which  Amundi  exercises significant influence or joint control.\n\n## Full consolidation\n\nFull consolidation substitutes each of the assets and liabilities carried by each subsidiary for the value of the shares.\n\n## Equity method\n\nThe  equity  method  substitutes  for  the  value  of  shares  the Group's proportional share of the equity and net income of the  companies  in  question.  The  change  in  the  carrying amount of the shares includes changes in goodwill.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe  equity  and  income  attributable  to  non-controlling interests is presented separately in the consolidated balance sheet and income statement.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  are  as  defined  by  IFRS  10.  They incorporate instruments representing present ownership interests  that  give  the  right  to  a  proportional  share  of  the  net assets  in  the  event  of  liquidation  and  the  other  equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the Group.\n\n## 1.4.3 Restatements and eliminations within the Amundi Group\n\nThe  impact  of  the  Group's  internal  transactions  on  the consolidated  balance  sheet  and  income  statement  is eliminated for fully consolidated entities.\n\nCapital  gains  or  losses  arising  from  intra-Group  asset transfers  are  eliminated.  Any  potential  lasting  depreciation measured at the time of disposal of an internal transaction is recognised.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The translation is made as if the information had been initially recognised in the functional currency  (same  translation  principles  as  for  foreign currency translations);\n- \u00b7 the  functional  currency  is  translated  into  euros,  the currency  in  which  the  Group's  consolidated  financial statements  are  presented.  Assets  and  liabilities,  including goodwill,  are  translated  at  the  closing  rate.  Equity  items, such  as  share  capital  or  reserves,  are  translated  at  their historical exchange  rate.  The  income  and  expenses included  in  the  income  statement  are  translated  at  the average  exchange  rate  for  the  period.  The  resulting exchange  differences  are  recognised  as  a  separate component  of  equity.  These  translation  differences  are recognised as net income in the event of disposal of the foreign  operation  (sale,  repayment  of  capital,  liquidation, discontinuation  of  operations)  or  in  the  event  of  a deconsolidation  due  to  a  loss  of  control  (even  without sale) while accounting for the income from the disposal or loss of control.\n\n## 1.4.5 Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3. On the date of acquisition,  the  identifiable  assets,  liabilities  and  contingent liabilities of the acquired entity which meet IFRS 3 conditions for  recognition  are  recognised  at  their  fair  value.  Notably, restructuring liabilities are only recognised as a liability of the acquired entity if, on the acquisition date, the entity is under an obligation to carry out the restructuring.\n\nEarn-out  clauses  are  recognised  at  fair  value  even  if  their application  is  not  probable.  Subsequent  changes  in  the  fair value of financial liability clauses are recognised in profit or loss.  Only  earn-out  clauses  for  transactions  where  control was obtained at the latest by 31 December 2009 can still be recorded against goodwill, because these transactions were accounted for under IFRS 3 before the revision.\n\nNon-controlling  interests  representing  shares  of  current interests  giving  rights  to  a  share  of  the  net  assets  in  the event of liquidation may be measured in one of two ways at the purchaser's choice:\n\n- \u00b7 at fair value on the acquisition date;\n\nI\n\n- \u00b7 at the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired company revalued at fair value.\n\nThe option may be exercised acquisition by acquisition.\n\nThe balance of non-controlling interests (equity instruments issued by the subsidiary and not held by the Group) must be recognised at fair value on the acquisition date.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 3, the initial valuation of the assets, liabilities  and  contingent  liabilities  can  be  revised  within  a maximum of 12 months from the acquisition date.\n\nThe  transferred  counterparty  at  the  time  of  a  business combination (acquisition cost) is measured as the total of fair values transferred by the purchaser on the acquisition date in exchange for control of the acquired entity (for example: cash, equity instruments).\n\nThe costs directly attributable to the business combination in question  must  be  recognised  as  expenses  separately  from the business combination. If there is a very strong possibility that the transaction will occur, they are recognised under the heading  'Net  gains  or  losses  on  other  assets';  otherwise, they are recognised under 'General operating expenses'.\n\nThe difference between the sum of the acquisition cost and non-controlling interests and the net balance on the date of acquisition of acquired identifiable assets and liabilities taken over, valued at their fair value, is recognised and, when it is positive, on the assets side of the consolidated balance sheet under  the  heading  'Goodwill'  when  the  acquired  entity  is fully  consolidated,  and  under  the  heading  'Investments  in equity-accounted  entities'  when  the  acquired  company  is consolidated  using  the  equity  method  of  accounting.  Any negative  change  in  the  value  of  goodwill  is  recorded immediately in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is carried on the balance sheet at its initial amount in  the  currency of the acquired entity and translated at the closing rate on the reporting date.\n\nWhen  control  is  taken  by  stages,  the  interest  held  before taking control is revalued at fair value through profit or loss on the acquisition date and the goodwill is calculated once, using  the  fair  value  at  the  date  of  acquisition  of  acquired assets and liabilities taken over.\n\nIn  the  event  of  an  increase  in  Amundi's  percentage  of interest in an entity which it already exclusively controls, the difference between the acquisition cost and the share of net assets acquired is recognised under 'Consolidated reserves, Group  share'.  In  the  event  that  the  Amundi  percentage  of ownership  interest  in  an  entity  that  remains  under  its exclusive control declines, the difference between the selling price and the carrying amount of the share of net assets sold is  also  recognised  under  'Consolidated  reserves,  Group share'.  The  expenses  arising  from  these  transactions  are recognised in equity.",

IAS  36  requires  that  impairment  on  goodwill  be determined  by  reference  to  the  recoverable  value  of  the Cash-generating  Unit  (CGU)  or  CGU  group  to  which  it belongs.\n\nCash-generating Units are defined as the smallest identifiable group  of  assets  and  liabilities  generating  incoming  cash independently  of  cash  generated  by  other  asset  groups. Amundi's organisation is defined by a very high centralisation and  interdisciplinary  nature  of  the  functions  inherent  to asset management.  This  centralisation  and  integration translate  into  the  following  organisational  principles:  an\n\nintegrated management platform, cross-functional investment products and solutions, interlinked sales and key interdisciplinary  functions.  This  organisation  has  resulted  in the  identification  of  a  single  CGU.  Therefore,  goodwill  is tested at the Group level in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36.\n\nThe recoverable value of the CGU is defined as the higher of the market value and the value in use. The value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the CGU, as  set  out  in  medium-term  business  plans  prepared  by  the Group for its management purposes.\n\nWhen  the  recoverable  amount  is  lower  than  the  carrying amount,  a  corresponding  impairment  is  recognised  for  the goodwill allocated to the CGU or CGU group. The impairment is irreversible.\n\n## Note 2 FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, RISK EXPOSURE AND HEDGING POLICY\n\nThe  description  of  these  systems  as  well  as  analytical information are now provided in the Risk Analysis chapter of the  management  report,  as  permitted  by  IFRS  7.  The accounting breakdown tables are nonetheless still included in the financial statements.\n\nAs a credit institution, Amundi is subject to French prudential regulations, which implement into French law the provisions of  the  EU  Directive  'Access  to  the  activity  of  credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions  and  investment firms'. Amundi has managed its capital so as to satisfy the levels of regulatory capital defined in the  EU  Directive  2013/36  (CRD  IV)  and  European  Regulation 575/2013  (CRR)  since  1 January  2014  and  required  by  the relevant  authorities,  the  European  Central  Bank  and  the Autorit\u00e9  de  contr\u00f4le  prudentiel  et  de  r\u00e9solution  (ACPR)  to cover risk-weighted assets in terms of credit risks, operational risks and market risks.\n\nRegulatory capital, calculated on Amundi's scope of consolidation,  breaks  down  into  three  categories:  Common Equity Tier 1 capital (CET1), Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) and Tier 2 capital (Tier 2) consisting of equity and debt instruments, to  which  various  adjustments  are  made.  Regulatory  capital  is obtained from accounting shareholders' equity. The adjustments made (prudential filters) mostly involve deducting goodwill and intangible assets (net of deferred taxes).\n\nAmundi  principally  holds  CET1  capital,  consisting  of  share capital and undistributed reserves. As part of the financing of the  Pioneer  acquisition,  Amundi  issued  Tier  2  capital  in  the amount of \u20ac300 million in 2017, maturing in 2027.\n\nAmundi  met  all  regulatory  requirements  in  effect  as  of 31 December 2021, as it did in 2020.\n\n## Note 3 CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF AMUNDI FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nThe contractual  maturity  of  Amundi's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  is  as  follows  for  the  three  financial  years  presented.  The financial asset and liability balances are shown by contractual maturity date. Equities, funds and other variable-income securities do not have a contractual maturity and are shown in the 'Indefinite' column.\n\nThe Group has a portfolio of money market investments and current accounts to meet its liquidity requirements.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

The change over the financial year was mainly due to the acquisition of Lyxor, resulting in goodwill of \u20ac652.1 million, and exchange rate fluctuations during the period.\n\nThe goodwill consists of the following other main items:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac377.9 million of goodwill recognised upon the transfer by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Indosuez of its asset management business in December 2003;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2004 at the time of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.'s acquisition of Cr\u00e9dit Lyonnais for \u20ac1,732.8 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill  related  to  the  transfer  of  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale's  asset management business in December 2009 for \u20ac707.8 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill recognised in 2015 at the time of the acquisition of Amundi Austria for \u20ac78.4 million;\n- \u00b7 the goodwill recognised in 2016 following the acquisitions of KBI Global Investors and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Immobilier Investors for a total of \u20ac159.9 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill  recognised  in  2017  following  the  acquisition  of Pioneer Investments for a total of \u20ac2,537.3 million;\n- \u00b7 goodwill  recognised  in  2020  following  the  acquisition  of Sabadell AM for a total of \u20ac335.0 million.\n\nGoodwill is tested for impairment based on the Group's value in  use.  Determination  of  the  value  in  use  is  based  on  the present value of estimated future cash flows of the Group as\n\nset out in the medium-term business plans prepared by the Group for management purposes.\n\nThe  impairment  test  conducted  on  31  December  2021  was carried out using results forecasts for the 2021-2023 period. The results forecasts  were  primarily  based  on  the  following assumptions about the economic environment:\n\n- \u00b7 on  the  equity  markets,  stability  compared  with  the  level seen at the end of November 2021;\n- \u00b7 on the interest-rate markets, rising long-term rates (which are going back into positive territory from 2022), despite remaining low for the duration of the plan, and short-term rates remaining negative.\n\nAmundi used a perpetual growth rate of 2% for the tests as of 31 December 2021 and 2020 and a discount rate of 8.1% for the  test  as  of  31  December  2021  (compared  to  8.0%  for  the tests as of 31 December 2020).\n\nA  change  in  these  assumptions  (+/-50  basis  points  in  the discount rate and +/-50 basis points in the perpetual growth rate)  would  not  change  the  conclusions  of  the  impairment test as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## 5.14 Provisions\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                         | 01/01/2021   | Change in scope   | Increases   | Decr. and reversals not used   | Reversals used   | Translation differences   | Other movements   | 31/12/2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Provisions for risk on  commitments made | 31,522       |                   |             | (3,943)                        | (15,411)         |                           | (130)             | 12,038       |\n| Provisions for  operational risks        | 568          |                   | 181         | (158)                          | (171)            |                           |                   | 421          |\n| Provisions for employee  expenses (1)    | 91,258       | 10,265            | 12,937      | (8,361)                        | (1,758)          | (25)                      | (26,872)          | 77,441       |\n| Provisions for litigation                | 10,128       |                   | 1,809       | (846)                          | (2,950)          |                           |                   | 8,141        |\n| Provisions for other risks               | 31,885       |                   | 25,236      | (23,193)                       | (6,120)          | 1                         |                   | 27,809       |\n| PROVISIONS                               | 165,361      | 10,265            | 40,163      | (36,501)                       | (26,410)         | (24)                      | (27,002)          | 125,851      |\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                         | 01/01/2020   | Change in scope   | Increases   | Decr. and reversals not used   | Reversals used   | Translation differences   | Other movements   | 31/12/2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------|-------------------|--------------|\n| Provisions for risk on  commitments made | 25,061       |                   | 7,892       | -                              | (1,431)          |                           |                   | 31,522       |\n| Provisions for  operational risks        | 1,302        |                   | 530         | (957)                          | (307)            |                           |                   | 568          |\n| Provisions for employee  expenses        | 101,998      |                   | 15,924      | (6,277)                        | (32,005)         | (67)                      | 11,685            | 91,258       |\n| Provisions for litigation                | 7,083        |                   | 4,020       | (940)                          | (35)             |                           |                   | 10,128       |\n| Provisions for other risks               | 23,278       |                   | 15,364      | (2,239)                        | (4,518)          |                           |                   | 31,885       |\n| PROVISIONS                               | 158,722      | -                 | 43,730      | (10,413)                       | (38,296)         | (67)                      | 11,685            | 165,361      |\n\nI",

This consists primarily of:\n\n- \u00b7 variable-rate  assets  and  liabilities  for  which  interest  rate changes  do  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  fair  value, since  the  rates  of  return  of  these  instruments  frequently adjust themselves to market rates (loans and borrowings);\n- \u00b7 short-term  assets  and  liabilities  where  the  redemption value is close to the market value.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

These  funds,  excluding management  mandates,  are  considered  to  be  structured entities to the extent that they are created for a very specific purpose, are managed  via  contracts  signed  by  the stakeholders, and the rights associated with the voting rights of the shares have limited impact, where applicable.\n\nAmundi has defined criteria to identify companies which are involved as the sponsor of a structured entity:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company is involved in the creation of the structured entity  and  the  intervention,  which  is  remunerated,  is deemed  significant  for  the  successful  completion  of operations;\n- \u00b7 the  structuring  occurred  at  the  request  of  the  Company and it is the primary user;\n- \u00b7 the Company sold its own shares to the structured entity;\n- \u00b7 the Company is the manager of the structured entity;\n- \u00b7 the  name  of  a  subsidiary  or  the  Parent  company  is associated with the name of the structured entity or with the financial instruments it issues.\n\nGiven  this  definition,  all  funds  managed  by  Amundi  Group companies,  whether  held  or  not,  are  considered  to  be 'sponsored' structured entities.\n\nThe Group receives management and performance fees and commissions  from  the  funds.  It can invest, provide guarantees and contract performance swaps with the funds.\n\n## 8.1 Nature and extent of Amundi's involvement with the non-consolidated structured entities\n\nThe table below shows the assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments of the Group in sponsored structured entities, with the exception of those that are consolidated.\n\n## 31/12/2021\n\n|                                                                                                        | Asset management    | Asset management              | Asset management                                  | Asset management   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                                                        |                     | Maximum loss                  | Maximum loss                                      | Maximum loss       |\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                                                                                       | Balance sheet value | Maximum exposure to loss risk | Guarantees received and other credit enhancements | Net exposure       |\n| Financial assets held for trading                                                                      | 802,446             | 802,446                       | -

It  therefore  has  only  one  operating  segment within the meaning of IFRS 8.\n\nThe  Group's  operational  performance  is  not  tracked  more closely than the Group overall. Items that are reviewed at a closer level are limited to monthly reports on Group business volume (inflows, outstanding assets) and periodic reports on\n\nincome  net  of  commissions  by  client  segment  (retail, institutional). The Group believes that this information better corresponds  to  monitoring  commercial  activity  than  to measurement of operational performance for the purposes of decision-making for resource allocation. Operating expenses are not allocated to client segments (retail and institutional).\n\nHowever, the Group believes that it is helpful to publish the information about commercial activity which is shown below as information complementary to that required by IFRS 8:\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Retail                                          | 2,029  | 1,744  |\n| Institutional                                   | 756    | 690    |\n| Institutional, Corporate and  e mployee savings | 594    | 537    |\n| Insurers (1)                                    | 162    | 153    |\n| NET FEES                                        | 2,785  | 2,434  |\n| Performance fees                                | 427    | 200    |\n| TOTAL NET MANAGEMENT REVENUES                   | 3,211  | 2,634  |\n| Net financial income                            | 1      | (36)   |\n| Other net income                                | (76)   | (76)   |\n| TOTAL NET REVENUES                              | 3,136  | 2,521  |\n\nIn addition, the allocation of net income is broken down by geographical area as follows:\n\n| (in \u20ac thousands)   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| France             | 1,578  | 1,314  |\n| Abroad             | 1,558  | 1,208  |\n| TOTAL NET REVENUES | 3,136  | 2,521  |\n\nThe net revenue break-down is based on the location where the accounting information is recorded.\n\n## 9.2 Related parties\n\n## 9.2.1 Scope of related parties\n\nRelated  parties  are  businesses  which  directly  or  indirectly control or are controlled by, or which are under joint control with the Company presenting the financial statements.\n\nAmundi's  related  parties  are  (i)  the  consolidated  companies, including equity-accounted companies, (ii) the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group companies, that is, the Regional Banks, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A., its subsidiaries, associates and  joint ventures. No provisions for write-downs were made for these relationships.\n\nIn addition, the funds in which the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group has invested are not considered to be related parties.\n\nA  list  of  the  Amundi  Group's  consolidated  companies  is presented  in  note  9.3.1.  'Scope  of  consolidation'.  The transactions carried out and the assets under management at the  end  of  the  period  between  the  fully  consolidated companies  of  the  Group  are  entirely  eliminated  on consolidation.\n\nI\n\n## 9.2.2 Nature of transactions with related parties\n\nAmundi  has  commercial  relationships  with  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group companies.\n\nCr\u00e9dit Agricole Group is a distributor, a lender and borrower, a derivative counterparty and also a depositary and calculation agent  of  Amundi's  financial  products.  In  addition,  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group makes certain resources available to Amundi and manages Amundi's end-of-career allowance insurance.\n\nAmundi handles asset management of certain mandates for the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group  and  also  provides  book-keeping services  for  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  Group's  employee  savings plans.",

The company is a major player in the ETF sector (with \u20ac95 billion in assets under management), Europe's 3 rd largest player with a market share of  7.7%.  Lyxor  has  also  developed  widespread  recognition for its expertise in active management (\u20ac45 billion in assets under management), notably due to its top-level alternative asset platform.\n\nThe  acquisition  of  Lyxor,  the  European  pioneer  of  ETFs, propels Amundi's passive management platform (ETF, indexbased & Smart Beta solutions) into the top tier of European ETF suppliers:  the  two  platforms  combined  represent  more than \u20ac170 billion in assets under management, resulting in a share in the ETF UCITS market of 14% for Amundi.\n\nIn accordance with the revised IFRS 3 (business combinations), the Amundi Group has provisionally allocated the  acquisition  cost  at  closing  and,  consequently,  the amounts  allocated  to  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities acquired and goodwill may be adjusted within one year (the measurement period) from the date of consolidation if new information  is  obtained  about  facts  and  circumstances  that were in existence at the acquisition date.\n\n## 9.3.2.1 Components of the Lyxor acquisition\n\nAs part of this transaction, the Amundi Group acquired from Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale:\n\n- \u00b7 the legal entities within the Lyxor scope (listed below);\n- \u00b7 Lyxor's distribution activities (including the staff responsible for  promoting  and  distributing  Lyxor  products)  in  Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, Hong Kong and Japan;\n- \u00b7 rights for the use of Lyxor's proprietary software, which is used to conduct its business;\n- \u00b7 intellectual property rights relating to the Lyxor brand.\n\n31/12/2021\n\n| Entities                                                    | Method   | % of control   | % of stake held   | Principal place of business   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|\n| SUBSIDIARIES                                                |          |                |                   |                               |\n| Lyxor Asset Management Holding Corp.                        | Full     | 100%           | 100%              | United States                 |\n| Lyxor Asset Management Inc.                                 | Full     | 100%           | 100%              | United States                 |\n| Lyxor Asset Management S.A.S.                               | Full     | 100%           | 100%              | France                        |\n| Lyxor Asset Management UK LLP                               | Full     | 100%           | 100%              | United Kingdom                |\n| Lyxor Funds Solutions S.A.                                  | Full     | 100%           | 100%              | Luxembourg                    |\n| Lyxor Interm\u00e9diation S.A.                                   | Full     | 100%           | 100%              | France                        |\n| Lyxor International Asset Management S.A.S.                 | Full     | 100%           | 100%              | France                        |\n| Lyxor International Asset Management S.A.S. -

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe  conducted  our  audit  engagement  in  compliance  with independence requirements of the Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors, for the period from January 1, 2020 to\n\nthe date of our report and specifically we did not provide any prohibited  non-audit  services  referred  to  in  Article  5(1)  of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 or in the French Code of ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors.\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been  prepared  and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional  measures  taken  in  the  context  of  the  state  of sanitary  emergency  have  had  numerous  consequences  for companies,  particularly on  their operations and  their financing,  and  have  led  to  greater  uncertainties  on  their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and  remote  working,  have  also  had  an  impact  on  the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the\n\nI\n\nFrench  Commercial  Code  (code  de  commerce)  relating  to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a  whole  and  in forming  our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not  provide  a separate  opinion  on  specific  items  of  the  consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Price Purchase Allocation of Lyxor entities\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nOn  December  31,  2021,  Amundi  acquired  the  companies  of  the Lyxor Group from Group Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (as mentioned in Note 9.3.2 to the consolidated financial statement)\n\nTaking  into  account  the  recognition  of  a  price  adjustment estimation  of  \u20ac35.1  million,  the  price  of  this  acquisition  is estimated  at  \u20ac860.1  million  for  net  assets  after  purchase  price allocation of around \u20ac208 M\u20ac.\n\nIn  accordance  with  IFRS  3  revised,  Amundi  Group  allocated  the purchase  price  to  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities assumed relating to the Lyxor entities, as well as to the goodwill.\n\nThe purchase price allocation led to the identification of intangible assets related to customer contracts. Those contracts are valued according to the excess earnings method.\n\nWe  considered  that  the  purchase  price  allocation  and  the measurement of the fair value of the intangible assets identified to be  a  key  audit  matter.  Indeed,  given  its  nature,  this  allocation requires  the  exercise  of  judgment  to  identify  the  identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, and to determine the various assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these assets and liabilities.\n\n## Goodwill measurement\n\n## Risk identified\n\n## Our response\n\nThe  goodwill  mainly  arises  from  external  growth  operations  and amounts to \u20ac 6.7 billion.\n\nAs  mentioned  in  Note  1.4.6  to  the  consolidated  financial statements,  goodwill  is  subject  to  impairment  tests  as  soon  as there is objective evidence of a loss of value, and at least once a year.\n\nThese  tests  are  based  on  the  comparison  between  the  carrying amount  of  the  cash  generating  unit  (CGU)  and  its  recoverable amount.  The  recoverable  amount  of  the  CGU  is  defined  as  the highest value between its market value and its value in use. The value in use is calculated on the basis of the present value of the future cash flows generated by the CGU.\n\nAs indicated in note 5.13 to the consolidated financial statements, these estimated future cash flows are determined on the basis of the  medium-term  business  plans  prepared  by  the  Group  for  its management  purposes. They are based on assumptions concerning  the  growth  of  the  Group's  business  and  include macroeconomic parameters evolution.\n\nThe present value of the future cash flows also takes into account assumptions concerning discount rates and perpetual growth rate which necessitate the exercise of Management's judgment.\n\nIn  view  of  the  materiality  of  the  goodwill  and  the  degree  of management's  judgment  to  determine  the  assumptions  used  to calculate an impairment loss, we considered goodwill measurement to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe have reviewed the methodology used by the Amundi Group to identify any indications of impairment.\n\nWe  examined  the  calculations  performed  and  we  involved  our valuation specialists to assess the assumptions used by Management  to  determine  the  discount  rates  and  the  perpetual growth rates used in the discounted cash flow calculations, where necessary by comparing them with external sources.\n\nWe  also  examined  the  financial  trajectories  prepared  by  the Group's Management and used in the impairment tests in order to compare  them  with  the  information  presented  to  the  Group's Board of Directors and to assess the main underlying assumptions. The reliability of these assumptions was assessed in particular by comparing  the  financial  trajectories  developed  in  previous  years with the actual performance.\n\nWe  also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  on  certain  assumptions (perpetual growth rate, discount rate).\n\nFinally,  we  assessed  the  appropriateness  of  the  information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements on the results of these impairment tests and the level of sensitivity to the various assumptions.\n\nI\n\nOur audit work notably consisted in the following:\n\nanalyzing the procedures conducted by Amundi Group to identify the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed;\n\nassessing  the  process  for  the  measurement  of  the  fair  value  of these  assets  and  liabilities,  the  assumptions  used  and  the  useful lives of the intangible assets applied;\n\nperforming sensitivity analyses on certain assumptions.\n\nWe  involved  valuation specialists to assess the actuarial assumptions  used  and  to  assess  the  valuation  of  the  customer contracts.\n\nWe analyzed the financial trajectories used for the valuation of the customer  contracts  and  considered  their  consistency  with  the business  plan  prepared  by  management  within  the  acquisition  of Lyxor context.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

For  some  funds,  it  is  planned  to  remunerate  the performance of the fund by the payment of a commission named 'performance fee'.\n\nAs  mentioned  in  Note  1.3.6  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, the performance fees pay the investment management company when specified in  the  contract.  They  are computed on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the fund's actual performance and the reference index as set out in the contract.\n\nAs  at  December  31,  2021,  the  performance  fees  recorded  in  the income  statement  amounted  to  M\u20ac  426.5  (Note  4.1  of  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nThe  diverse  maturity  dates,  reference  index  and  performance target  entail  complexity  in  determining  the  amount  of  the performance  fees  and  the  different  recognition  dates  of  the corresponding income as well.\n\nWe  considered the measurement  and  recording of the performance fees to be a key audit matter.\n\nWe  analyzed  the  calculation  process  of  the  performance  fees implemented by the Group.\n\nWe  tested,  for  a  sample,  the  periodic  reconciliations  performed with  the  performance  fees  calculated  by  Management  and  the amounts recorded in P&L, and with the fees provided by the funds' administrators.\n\nIn addition, on the basis of a sample of funds, we:\n\n- \u00b7 reconciled  the  reference  index  used  in  calculation  of commissions, with the one specified in the contract;\n- \u00b7 reconciled  the  fee  amounts  determined  by  Management with the amounts recorded;\n- \u00b7 reconciled  the  performance  fees  recorded  in  commissions with the fees calculated by the funds' administrators;\n- \u00b7 assessed  that  the  fees  were  recorded  by  the  investment management company at the end of the calculation period specified in the contract.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verification required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to their fair presentation and their consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have  also  verified,  in  accordance  with  the  professional standard  applicable  in  France  relating  to  the  procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single  electronic  format,  that  the  presentation  of  the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared  under  the  responsibility  of  Deputy General Manager, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation No 2019/815 of  17  December 2018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements,  our  work  includes  verifying  that  the  tagging  of\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as statutory auditors of Amundi by the Annual  General  Meeting  held  on  November  16,  1989  for PricewaterhouseCoopers  Audit  and  on  May  10,  2021  for Mazars.\n\nI\n\nthese  consolidated  financial  statements  complies  with  the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended  to  be  included  in  the  annual  financial  report complies,  in  all  material  respects,  with  the  European  single electronic format.\n\nWe  have  no  responsibility  to  verify  that  the  financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in  the  annual  financial  report  filed  with  the  AMF  are  in agreement  with  those  on  which  we  have  performed  our work.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Mazars  were  in  the  thirty third year of total and uninterrupted  engagement  and  Mazars  in  its  first  year,  of which  respectively  twenty  five  years  and  one  year  since securities  of  the  Company  became  a  public  interest  entity, due to its status as a credit institution.",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a whole  are  free  from  material  misstatement.  Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in  Article  L.823-10-1  of  the  French  Commercial Code  ( code  de  commerce ),  our  statutory  audit  does  not include  assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nAs  part  of  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with professional  standards  applicable  in  France,  the  statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifies  and  assesses  the  risks  of  material  misstatement of  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  whether  due  to fraud  or  error,  designs  and  performs  audit  procedures responsive  to  those  risks,  and  obtains  audit  evidence considered  to  be  sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a basis  for  his  opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement  resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one resulting  from  error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion, forgery,  intentional  omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report.  However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to the  related  disclosures  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates  the  overall  presentation  of  the  consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements  represent  the  underlying  transactions  and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the consolidated financial statements. The statutory auditor is responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of  the  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and for  the  opinion  expressed  on  these  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

This law amends Article 18 of banking  law  84-46  of  24  January  1984  and  abrogates Article 99.\n\nPursuant  to  French  Financial  Activity  Modernisation  Act no. 96-597 of 2 July 1997, Amundi opted to be categorised as a financial company, i.e. a credit institution.\n\nThe  Comit\u00e9  des  \u00e9tablissements  de  cr\u00e9dit  et  des  entreprises d'investissement (Credit Institutions and Investment Firms Committee) redefined Amundi's accreditation on 19 February 2002. Amundi, as a financial  company,  is  authorised  to  issue  capital and/or performance guarantees in the field of asset management, particularly for customers of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group or of UCITS it manages.\n\nOwnership percentages in the Company are:\n\n- \u00b7 69.46% by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group;\n- \u00b7 30.41% by the public (including employees);\n- \u00b7 0.13% held in treasury.\n\n## 1.3 Events after the 2021 financial year\n\nNo significant events took place after the financial year end, whether recognised or not.\n\n## Note 2 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND METHODS\n\nThe Amundi financial statements comply with the provisions of  regulation  no.  2020-10  of  22  December  2020  amending ANC  (French  accounting  standards  authority)  regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014 which, for financial years starting from 1 January 2015, brings together all accounting\n\nstandards applicable to credit institutions under a single set of regulations on the basis of established law.\n\nThere  are  no  changes  in  accounting  methods  and  in  the presentation of the financial  statements compared with the previous financial year.\n\n## 2.1 Loans and receivables due from credit institutions and customers financing commitments\n\nLoans  and  receivables  due  from  credit  institutions,  Amundi Group entities and customers are governed by Articles 2211-1 to  2251-13  (Title  2 Accounting  treatment  of  credit  risk of Book  II Special  transactions )  of  regulation  no.  2020-10  of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014.\n\nThey are broken down according to their remaining maturity or type:\n\n- \u00b7 cash and term deposits for credit institutions;\n- \u00b7 current accounts, accounts and straight loans for Amundi Group internal transactions;\n- \u00b7 trade  receivables,  other  loans  and  current  accounts  for customers.\n\nIn  accordance  with  regulatory  provisions,  the  customer  section also includes transactions completed with financial customers.\n\nSubordinated  loans,  as  well  as  repurchase  agreements  (taking the  form  of  securities  or  assets),  are  incorporated  under  the various loans and receivables sections, depending on the type of counterparty (interbank, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole, customer).\n\nLoans and receivables are recorded on the balance sheet at their nominal value.\n\nIn accordance with regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020, amending  ANC  regulation  no.  2014-07  of  26  November  2014, commissions  and  fees  received  and  the  marginal  cost  of transactions completed are spread out over the actual life of the loan and are therefore incorporated into the outstanding balance of the relevant loan.\n\nAccrued  interest  not  yet  due  on  loans  and  receivables  is recognised under accrued interest on the income statement.\n\nI\n\n## 1.2 Significant events in 2021\n\n## Covid-19 health crisis\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic dominated 2020, a year in which a health crisis led to an economic crisis, resulting in a fall in the financial markets and increased volatility.\n\nThis pandemic continued throughout 2021 without impacting the Company's business to any significant extent.\n\nNevertheless,  the  scale  and  duration  of  this  crisis  remains difficult to predict.\n\n## Capital increase\n\nThe  capital  increase  reserved  for  employees  was  finalised during the second half of 2021. It was completed under the existing  legal  authorisations  approved  by  the  General Meeting of May 2017.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  subscription  period,  this  capital  increase resulted  in  the  issuance  of  488,698  shares  at  a  price  of \u20ac51.04 per share (nominal value of \u20ac2.50 and share premium of  \u20ac48.54). The final amount of the transaction amounts to 24.9 million.",

        "page_content": "Financing commitments recognised off-balance sheet represent  irrevocable  backstop  liquidity  commitments  and guarantee  commitments  that  have  not  generated  any  fund movements.\n\nThe enforcement of regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014 has led the entity to recognise loans and receivables presenting a risk  of  non-payment in accordance with the rules outlined in the following paragraphs.\n\nThe use of external and/or internal  rating  systems  helps  to assess the level of credit risk.\n\nLoans  and  receivables  and  financing  commitments  are divided between those deemed to be unimpaired and those deemed doubtful.\n\n## Unimpaired loans and receivables\n\nAs  long  as  receivables  are  not  deemed  doubtful,  they  are considered  unimpaired  and  remain  under  their  original heading.\n\n## Provisions for credit risk on unimpaired, deteriorated outstanding loans\n\nIn addition, without waiting for the loans to become doubtful, when  the  financial  instruments  are  initially  recognised, Amundi  notes  that  credit  losses  are  expected  over  the coming twelve months (loans and receivables deemed to be unimpaired) and/or over the life of the financial instrument as  soon  as  there  is  significant  deterioration  in  the  credit quality of the outstanding (loans and receivables deemed to have deteriorated) under liabilities on its balance sheet.\n\nAllowances  and  reversals  of  provisions  for  credit  risk  on unimpaired loans are recognised under cost of risk.\n\nThese  provisions  are  determined  as  part  of  a  special monitoring process and are based on estimates showing the change in the credit risk level on the initial recognition date and the reporting date.\n\n## Doubtful loans and receivables\n\nThese  are  loans  and  receivables  of  all  types,  even  those incorporating  guarantees,  that  present  a  demonstrated  credit risk corresponding to one of the following situations:\n\n- \u00b7 there is one or more unpaid receivables that are older than one year;\n- \u00b7 a  counterparty  situation  presents  characteristics  such  that, regardless  of  any  unpaid  receivables,  it  can  be  concluded that a demonstrated risk exists;\n- \u00b7 there is litigation between  the  institution and its counterparty.\n\nAmong doubtful loans, Amundi makes a distinction between non-performing doubtful loans and performing doubtful loans.\n\n## 2.2 Securities portfolio\n\nThe  rules  regarding  accounting  for  credit  risk  and  writedown of fixed-income securities are defined in Articles 2311-1 to 2391-1 and Articles 2211-1 to 2251-13 of regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014.\n\nThe  securities  are  presented  by  type  in  the  financial statements:  treasury  bills  (Treasury  Notes  and  similar securities), bonds and other fixed-income securities (negotiable debt securities and interbank securities), equities and other variable-income securities.\n\nI\n\n## Performing doubtful loans and receivables\n\nPerforming doubtful loans and receivables are those that do not meet the definition of non-performing doubtful receivables.\n\n## Non-performing doubtful loans and receivables\n\nDoubtful  loans  and  receivables  with  a  very  poor  collection outlook and for which a future write-off is being considered.\n\nInterest continues to accrue on doubtful loans and receivables  as  long  as  they  are  considered  doubtful  but performing. Interest stops accruing as soon as the receivable becomes non-performing.\n\nClassification as a doubtful loan can be disregarded as soon as  the  demonstrated  credit  risk  is  permanently  eliminated and when regular payments have resumed for the amounts stipulated for the original contractual due dates. In this case, the loan is once again considered unimpaired.\n\n## Write-downs for credit risk on doubtful loans\n\nAs  soon  as  a  loan  becomes  doubtful,  Amundi  accounts  for the probable write-off through a write-down deducted from the asset on the balance sheet. These write-downs represent the  difference  between  the  book  value  of  the  loan  or receivable and the future estimated flows discounted at the contract  rate,  while  taking  into  consideration  the  financial position  and  economic outlook of the counterparty, as well as any potential guarantees minus their cost of enforcement.\n\nPotential write-offs relating to off-balance sheet commitments  are  taken  into  account  through  provisions included in balance sheet liabilities.\n\n## Accounting treatment of write-downs\n\nAllowances  and  reversals  for  the  write-down  of  the  risk  of non-collection on  doubtful  loans  and  receivables  are recognised under cost of risk.\n\nIn accordance with regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014 the Group  has  opted  to  record  the  increase  in  the  book  value associated  with  the  reversal  of  the  write-down  due  to  the passage of time under cost of risk.\n\n## Writing off of losses\n\nThe assessment of the time period for a write-off is based on the  judgement  of  experts.  Amundi  determines  this  with  its Risk Management Department, based on its knowledge of its business.\n\nLoans  and  receivables  that  have  become  irrecoverable  are recognised  as  losses  and  the  corresponding  write-downs  are reversed.",

Revenue  from dividends  associated  with  the  equities  are  recorded  in  the income  statement  under  'Income  from  variable-income securities'.\n\nRevenue from SICAVs (variable-capital investment companies) and mutual funds are recorded at the time the funds are received in the same section.\n\nShort-term investment securities are valued at the lower of the purchase price or the market value at the reporting date. Accordingly, when the book value on one line is lower than the carrying amount, a charge for write-down of unrealised losses is recognised without any offset for any capital gains recorded under other types of securities. Gains generated by hedges, as defined in regulation no. 2020-10 of 22  December  2020  amending  ANC  regulation  no.  2014-07  of 26 November 2014, taking the form of purchases or sales of forward  financial  instruments,  are  taken  into  account  in calculating  write-downs.  Potential  capital  gains  are  not recognised.\n\nDisposals of securities are deemed to involve the securities of the same type that were subscribed at the earliest date.\n\nWrite-down allowances and reversals, as well as any capital gains  or  losses  from  the  disposal  of  short-term  investment\n\nsecurities,  are  recognised  under  the  heading  'Balance  of transactions  on  marketable  security  investment  portfolios and similar' in the income statement.\n\n## Long-term investment securities\n\nFixed-income securities with a fixed maturity that have been acquired  or  reclassified  in  this  category  with  the  clear intention  to  hold  them  until  maturity  are  recorded  as  longterm investment securities.\n\nThis  category  includes  only  those  securities  for  which Amundi has the financing capacity required to hold them to maturity  and  is  not  subject  to  any  existing  legal  or  other constraints  that  may  cast  doubt  upon  its  intention  to  hold these securities until maturity.\n\nLong-term  investment  securities  are  recognised  at  their acquisition price, including acquisition costs and coupons.\n\nThe difference between the purchase price and the redemption price is spread over the residual life of the security.\n\nNo  write-downs  are  recorded  for  investment  securities  if their market value is lower than their cost price. However, if the impairment is associated with a risk specific to the issuer of the security, a write-down is recorded under 'Cost of risk'.\n\nIf  long-term investment securities are sold or transferred to another  category  of  securities  for  a  significant  amount,  the institution  is  no  longer  authorised,  during  the  current financial year and during the following two financial years, to classify  securities  previously  acquired  and  securities  to  be acquired  as  long-term  investment  securities,  in  accordance with regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates, equity investments and other long-term investments\n\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsidiaries and affiliates are investments in companies that are under exclusive control and which are, or are likely to be, fully consolidated into a single group.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments are investments (other than investments in subsidiaries and affiliates), whose long-term ownership  is  deemed  beneficial  to  the  reporting  entity, particularly  because  it  allows  it  to  exercise  influence  or control over the issuer.\n- \u00b7 Other  long-term  equity  investments  consist  of  securities held  with  the  intention  of  promoting  long-term  business relations by creating a special relationship with the issuer, but involve no influence on the issuer's management due to the small percentage of voting rights held.\n\nThe  securities  are  recognised  at  their  acquisition  price, including costs.\n\nAt the reporting date, these securities are measured individually  based  on  their  value  in  use  and  are  recorded  on the balance sheet at the lower end of their historical cost or value in use.\n\nThis  represents  what  the  institution  would  agree  to  pay  to acquire them, given its holding objectives.\n\nThe  value  in  use  may  be  estimated  on  the  basis  of  various factors such as the issuer's profitability and profitability outlook, its equity, the economic environment or even its average share price  in  the  preceding  months  or  the  economic  value  of  the security.\n\nI",

Primarily,  these techniques make reference to recent transactions completed  under  normal  competitive  conditions.  When appropriate, Amundi uses valuation techniques commonly used by market participants to value these securities when it  has  been  demonstrated  that  these  techniques  produce reliable  estimates  of  the  prices  obtained  in  actual  market trades.\n\n## Recording dates\n\nAmundi  records  securities  that  are  classified  as  long-term investment securities on the settlement/delivery date. Other securities,  regardless  of  their  nature  or  category  in  which they are classified, are recorded on the trading date.\n\n## 2.3 Non-current assets\n\nAmundi applies regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014 for the depreciation, amortisation and write-down of assets.\n\nAmundi  applies  component  accounting  to  all  its  property, plant  and  equipment.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of this  regulation,  the  depreciable  base  takes  account  of  the potential residual value of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe  acquisition  costs  of  non-current  assets  include,  in addition to the purchase price, incidental expenses, meaning the  expenses  directly  or  indirectly  linked  to  the  acquisition for putting the property in proper operating condition or for its entry into inventory.\n\nBuildings and equipment are recognised at acquisition cost less accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since they were commissioned.\n\nAcquired  software  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated depreciation, amortisation and write-downs since the acquisition date.\n\nI\n\n## Reclassification of securities\n\nIn accordance with regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending  ANC  regulation  no.  2014-07  of  26  November  2014, securities may be reclassified as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 from  trading  book  to  long-term  investment  or  marketable security investment portfolio, in the event of an exceptional market situation,  or  for  fixed-income  securities,  when  they can  no  longer  be  traded  on  an  active  market  or  if  the institution  has  the  intent  and  ability  to  hold  them  for  the foreseeable future or until maturity;\n- \u00b7 from the marketable security investment portfolio to longterm  investment  portfolio,  in  the  event  of  an  exceptional market situation or for fixed-income securities, when they can no longer be traded on an active market.\n\nIn 2021, Amundi did not carry out any reclassifications under regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014.\n\n## Buyback of treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares  bought  back  by  Amundi  under  a  liquidity contract are recorded under the assets of the balance sheet in a transaction portfolio for their inventory value.\n\nThe  treasury  shares  repurchased  by  Amundi  as  part  of  the hedging  of  free  share  award  plans  are  recognised  in  a marketable investment portfolio. They are subjected, where applicable,  to  a  write-down  if  the  book  value  is  lower  than the purchase price, with the exception of transactions related to  the  stock  option  plans  or  subscription  of  shares  and  the free share award plans for employees pursuant to regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of 26 November 2014.\n\nProprietary  software  is  measured  at  production  cost  less accumulated  depreciation,  amortisation  and  write-downs since completion.\n\nIntangible  assets  other  than  software,  patents  and  licences are  not  amortised.  If  applicable,  they  may  be  subject  to  a write-down.\n\nNon-current  assets  are  depreciated  over  their  estimated useful lives.\n\nThe  following  components  and  depreciation  periods  have been  adopted  by  Amundi  following  the  application  of component  accounting  for non-current assets. These depreciation periods are adjusted according to the nature of the asset and its location:\n\n| Component           | Depreciation Period   |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|\n| Technical equipment |                       |\n| and installations   | 5 years               |\n| IT equipment        | 3 years               |",

The gains or losses  resulting  from  these  conversions,  as  well  as  the translation  adjustments  on  the  financial  year's  transactions, are recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe  monetary  receivables  and  liabilities,  as  well  as  the forward  currency  contracts  appearing  as  off-balance  sheet commitments  in  foreign  currencies  are  translated  at  the\n\n## 2.10 Off-balance sheet commitments\n\nOff-balance  sheet  commitments  mainly  reflect  the  unused portion of financing commitments and guarantee commitments given and received.\n\nWhere  applicable,  provision  has  been  made  for  the commitments  given  where  there  is  a  likelihood  of  a  claim from them involving a loss for Amundi.\n\nI\n\nThe  methodology  used  maximises  the  use  of  observable market data.\n\nIt is based:\n\n- \u00b7 primarily  on  market  data  such  as  registered  and  listed credit default swaps (or single-name CDS) or CDS proxies;\n- \u00b7 in  the  absence  of  a  registered  counterparty  CDS,  on  an approximation based on a basket of single-name counterparty  CDS  of  the  same  rating,  operating  in  the same sector and located in the same region.\n\n## Complex transactions\n\nA complex transaction is defined as a synthetic combination of instruments (types, natures and methods of valuation that are identical or different) recognised as a single lot or as a transaction whose recognition does not pertain to an explicit regulation  and  that  involves  a  choice  of  principle  by  the institution.\n\nIncome and expenses relating to the instruments traded as part  of  complex  transactions,  particularly  the  issuance  of structured  notes,  are  recognised  in  the  income  statement symmetrically  to  the  method  for  recognising  income  and expenses  on  the  hedged  item.  Accordingly,  changes  in  the values  of  hedging  instruments  are  not  recognised  in  the balance sheet.\n\nforeign exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date or the market price on the nearest preceding date.\n\nWithin the context of the application of regulation no. 2020-10 of 22 December 2020 amending ANC regulation no. 2014-07 of  26  November  2014,  Amundi  implemented  multi-currency accounting  enabling  it  to  monitor  its  foreign  exchange position and to assess its exposure to this risk.\n\nReportable off-balance sheet items do not include commitments  on  forward  financial  instruments  or  foreign exchange transactions.",

Agreements  regarding  employee  profit-sharing and incentive plans have been signed in this context.\n\n## 2.12 Post-employment benefits\n\n## Retirement plans - defined contribution plans\n\nThere  are  several  compulsory  retirement  plans  to  which 'employer' companies contribute. Plan assets are managed by independent organisations and the contributing companies  have  no  legal  or  implied  obligation  to  pay additional  contributions  if  the  funds  do  not  have  sufficient assets  to  cover  all  benefits  corresponding  to  services rendered  by  the  employees  during  the  financial  year  and during prior years.\n\nConsequently, Amundi has no liabilities in this respect other than its contributions for the year ended.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  contributions  made  to  these  retirement plans is recognised under 'employee expenses'.\n\n## Commitments in terms of retirement plans, preretirement and end-of-career payments defined benefit plans\n\nAmundi  has  applied  ANC  recommendation  no.  2013-02 regarding accounting and valuation rules for retirement plans and similar benefits, which was abrogated and incorporated into ANC regulation 2014-03.\n\nProfit-sharing  and  incentives  are  shown  under  employee expenses.\n\nThe employees provided by Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. are covered by  agreements  signed  for  that  entity's  SEU.  The  estimated expense to be paid for the profit-sharing and incentive plans allocated  in  this  context  is  recognised  in  the  financial statements.\n\nThis recommendation  was  amended  by  the  ANC  on 5 November 2021. For defined-benefit plans for which benefits are  conditional  on  length  of  service,  are  capped  at  a maximum amount and are conditional on a member of staff still being employed by the entity when they reach retirement age, this recommendation  permits  entitlements  to  be allocated on a straight-line basis from:\n\n- \u00b7 either the date upon which the staff member's employment began;\n- \u00b7 or the start date of each year of service used to calculate the acquisition of entitlements.\n\nIn accordance  with  this  regulation,  Amundi  funds  its retirement  plans  and  similar  benefits  falling  under  the category of defined benefit plans.\n\nThe sensitivity index shows that:\n\n- \u00b7 a  change  of  more  than  50  bps  in  discount  rates  would result in a 4.33% decrease in the commitment;\n- \u00b7 a change of less than 50 bps in discount rates would result in a 4.66% increase in the commitment.\n\nWithin  the  Amundi  Group,  Amundi  AM  has  signed  an insurance  contract  for  an  'end-of-career  allowance'  (IFC) with  PREDICA,  and  management  agreements  were  signed between Amundi and its SEU subsidiaries. This outsourcing of the 'end-of-career allowance' resulted in the transfer of a portion of the liability provision from the financial statements to the PREDICA contract.\n\nThe  non-outsourced  balance  is  still  recorded  under  the provision for liabilities.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and the French Code of Ethics (Code de d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1 st , 2021 to the  date  of  our  report  and  specifically  we  did  not  provide  any  prohibited  non-audit  services  referred  to  in  Article  5(1)  of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014.\n\n## Emphasis of matter\n\nWithout  qualifying  the  opinion  expressed  above,  we  draw  attention  to  the  following  matter  described  in  Note  2.12  'Postemployment benefits' to the financial statements that describes the consequences of the application of the recommendation ANC n\u00b02013-02 from November 7, 2013, modified on November 5, 2021, about the evaluation and accounting methods of postemployment benefits and other similar benefits\n\n## Justification of Assessments - Key Audit Matters\n\nDue to the global crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic, the financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been  prepared  and audited  under  specific  conditions.  Indeed,  this  crisis  and  the exceptional  measures  taken  in  the  context  of  the  state  of sanitary  emergency  have  had  numerous  consequences  for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and  have  led  to  greater  uncertainties  on  their  future prospects.  Those  measures,  such  as  travel  restrictions  and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organization and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt is in this complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L. 823-9 and R. 823-7 of the\n\nFrench  Commercial  Code (Code  de  commerce) relating  to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to risks of material misstatement that, in  our  professional  judgment,  were  of  most  significance  in our audit of the financial statements of the current period, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  and  in  forming  our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.\n\nI",

Our objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether the  financial  statements  as  a  whole  are  free  from  material misstatement.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,\n\nindividually  or  in  the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code (Code  de  commerce) ,  our  statutory  audit  does  not include  assurance  on  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  the quality of management of the affairs of the Company.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting  from  fraud  is  higher  than  for  one  resulting  from error,  as  fraud  may  involve  collusion,  forgery,  intentional omissions,  misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of  internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtains  an  understanding  of  internal  control  relevant  to the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  and related  disclosures  made  by  Management  in  the  financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Assesses the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence  obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant doubt  on  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern.  This  assessment  is  based  on  the  audit  evidence obtained  up  to  the  date  of  his  audit  report.  However, future  events  or  conditions  may  cause  the  Company  to cease  to  continue  as  a  going  concern.  If  the  statutory\n\nauditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is  a  requirement  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to the  related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether  these  statements represent  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular  a  description  of  the  scope  of  the  audit  and  the audit  program  implemented,  as  well  as  the  results  of  our audit.  We  also  report,  if  any,  significant  deficiencies  in internal  control  regarding  the  accounting  and  financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur  report  to  the  Audit  Committee  includes  the  risks  of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the  current  period  and  which  are  therefore  the  key  audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also  provide  the  Audit  Committee  with  the  declaration provided  for  in  Article  6  of  Regulation  (EU)  No  537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable  in  France  such  as  they  are  set  in  particular  by Articles  L.  822-10  to  L.  822-14  of  the  French  Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code  de  d\u00e9ontologie) for statutory auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may  reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March 28, 2022\n\nThe Statutory Auditors French original signed by\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nMazars\n\nLaurent Tavernier\n\nAgn\u00e8s Hussherr\n\nJean Latorzeff\n\nI",

The minimum and maximum number of members is set down by the applicable laws.\n\nDirectors  must  each  own  at  least  200  shares  during  their terms of office.\n\nThe Board of Directors is renewed each year by rotation; this rotation will concern a certain number of Board members.\n\nThe Ordinary General Meeting sets the length of a director's term  of  office  at  three  years,  subject  to  legal  provisions allowing for any extension, to end at the close of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders deliberating on the accounts for the previous financial year and held in the year in which the said director's term of office comes to an end.\n\nExceptionally,  in  order  to  begin  or  maintain  the  abovementioned rotation, the General Meeting may appoint one or more directors for a different term of no more than four years, in  order  to  allow  a  staggered  renewal  of  directors'  terms  of office.

Each share gives the right to one vote in these General Meetings; the double voting right set down by Article L. 225-123 and L. 22-10-46 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) is expressly excluded.\n\nWhere a certain number of shares must be held in order to exercise  any  right,  more  particularly  in  the  case  of  the exchange,  conversion,  consolidation  or  allocation  of  free shares,  share  capital  decrease,  merger,  demerger  or  any other  operation,  a  shareholding  of  less  than  the  requisite number  of  shares  grants  its  owner  no  right  against  the Company, and shareholders shall personally ensure that they obtain the requisite number of shares required or a multiple thereof;  the  provisions  of  Article  L.  228-6  of  the  French Commercial Code shall apply to fractional shares.\n\n## Article 11 - Director representing employees\n\nThe Board of Directors includes one director that represents employees, who is elected by the employees of the Company or  by  the  employees  of  its  direct  or  indirect  subsidiaries whose registered offices are located in France, except in the event of absence of candidacy. The status of and procedures for the election of the director elected by the employees are set  forth  in  Articles  L.  225-27  et  seq.  and  Articles  22-10-6 and L. 22-10-7 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe term of office of the director representing employees is three years.

If  there  is  no  successor  able  to  carry  out  the director's  duties,  a  new  election  shall  be  held  within three months.\n\nThe election of the director representing employees involves a  majority  vote  in  two  rounds,  in  accordance  with  the following  procedures  pursuant  to  Article  L.  225-28  of  the French Commercial Code and to this Article.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

With regard to its main activity  -  asset  management  -  Amundi  is  subject  to numerous regulations, prudential supervision and authorisation  requirements  (for  companies  performing  a regulated  activity  and  for  savings  products).  In  addition, several Group entities, including the Company, are authorised  as  credit  institutions  and  therefore  subject  to monitoring by banking supervisors.\n\nAmundi is subject to laws and regulations that apply to asset management  activities,  including  requirements  in  terms  of internal organisation and good conduct, prudential requirements,  investment  and  asset  allocation  rules,  rules relating to the prevention of money laundering, rules relating to the  identification  and  knowledge  of  clients  (Know  Your Customer,  or  'KYC')  and  the  rules  relating  to  international sanctions,  including  those  issued  by  the  Office  of  Foreign Assets  Control  of  the  United  States  Department  of  the Treasury, which are applicable to Amundi at international level.\n\nThe  regulations  applicable  to  Amundi  are  constantly evolving,  particularly  within  the  European  Union  ('EU'). These regulations could also change as a result of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union ('Brexit'). It should  be  noted  that  in  the  context  of  the  publication  on 5  November  2020  by  the  European  Securities  and  Markets Authority (ESMA) of its guidelines on performance fees for collective  investment  undertakings  in  transferable  securities and certain types of alternative investment funds, which have been  incorporated  into  the  AMF's  doctrine  (DOC-2021-01 position  of  5  January  2021),  it  is  possible  that  the  current method for calculating performance fees may be subject to adjustments in order to comply with ESMA recommendations.\n\nAny  new  regulations  or  changes  in  the  implementation  or application of the laws and regulations in force could, where applicable,  have  a  significant  impact  on  Amundi's  activities and operating income.\n\n## 8.3.1 Regulations relating to asset management activities\n\n## 8.3.1.1 European Union\n\n## 8.3.1.1.1 General presentation\n\nAmundi's  asset  management  activities  can  be  divided  into two main categories:\n\n- \u00b7 portfolio management and investment advice, governed by the MiFID II regulations;\n- \u00b7 the  management  of  funds  and  other  undertakings  for collective  investment,  including  UCITS-type  funds  and AIFs,  governed  by  the  UCITS  V  Directive  and  the  AIFM Directive, respectively.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  main  legislative  texts,  asset  management activities are impacted by other regulations and reform projects at  European  level,  such  as  the  regulations  applicable  to derivative  financial  products  (European  Market  Infrastructure Regulation, 'EMIR'), regulations aimed at providing a framework for the 'parallel banking system' or the regulations applicable to sustainable finance (SFDR/TAXONOMY).\n\nAlthough  laws  and  regulations  vary  from  one  country  to another,  the  texts  transposing  the  EU  legislation  in  each Member State are substantially similar in all the countries in which  Amundi  operates,  in  particular  in  France,  Italy, Germany,  Austria,  Spain  and  Luxembourg.  However,  the legislative  transposition  of  the  Directives  in  each  European country or their interpretation by local supervisory authorities may give rise to different approaches and in some cases delays.\n\n## European passport system\n\nOne of the objectives of the European regulatory framework is  to  facilitate  the  cross-border  marketing  of  investment products  in  Europe.  The  European  passport  allows  a management  company  that  has  been  authorised  by  the\n\nregulator of its country of origin to conduct its activities in the EU or signatory states of the agreement on the European Economic  Area  ('EEA')  within  the  scope  of  the  free provision  of  services  and  freedom  of  establishment.  A management company that wishes to conduct activities, for which it has been approved, in another State must inform the competent authorities of its origin Member State. In the host Member State, the management company may only conduct the  activities  covered  by  the  approval  granted  in  its  origin Member State.\n\nIn  terms  of  asset  management,  a  passport  may  be  granted for  three  types  of  activity:  (i)  UCITS  management,  (ii)  AIF management and (iii) portfolio management for a third party. The passport may also cover other investment services such as  receiving/transmitting  orders  and  executing  orders  on behalf  of  third  parties.  The  passport  system  allows  Amundi entities to benefit from conducting cross-border activities in the EU.\n\n## Capital requirements\n\nIn accordance with the various regulatory regimes applicable to  asset  management  activities,  several  Group  entities  are subject to minimum capital requirements, generally equal to the highest of the following amounts: 25% of the overheads of the previous year, or \u20ac125,000 plus a sum equal to 0.02% of  the  assets  under  management  in  excess  of  \u20ac250  million (plus an additional 0.01%, as a minimum, of the value of the AIF portfolios managed for the regulated entities subject to the AIFM  Directive). These capital requirements are significantly more  restrictive  than  those  applicable  to Amundi  under  the  current banking regulations. See paragraph 8.3.2 'Banking regulations applicable to Amundi'.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

In  addition,  Directive 2019/2034 ('IFD')  described  below  (see  section  2.3.2.2)  has created  a  specific  remuneration  regime  for  investment companies,  which  will  be  applicable  to  certain  Group subsidiaries from the 2022 financial year (for more information on the aspects relating to remuneration, see section 2.4).\n\n## 8.3.1.1.2 Regulations applicable to the provision of investment services\n\n## Applicable legal framework\n\nThe  Group's  investment  service  providers  are  obliged  to comply with the MiFID II regulatory framework governing the provision of these services, including portfolio management activities,  also  known  as  discretionary  management,  as  well as investment advice and the order receipt and transmission service.\n\nThis  regulation  sets  out,  in  particular,  (i)  requirements  in terms  of  internal  organisation,  (ii)  obligations  of  good conduct  to  ensure  the  protection  of  investors  through enhanced information requirements, assessments of adequacy and suitability for clients, the execution of orders under the most favourable conditions for clients and rules for handling  client  orders,  (iii)  enhanced  management  of  the commissions  paid  in  connection  with  the  provision  of investment advice, (iv) an increase in pre- and post-trading transparency requirements and their extension to additional financial  instruments,  and  (v)  an  increase  in  the  powers  of the competent authorities. The applicable rules then depend on  the  type  of  client,  with  a  high  degree  of  protection  for non-professional clients and, conversely, flexibility allowed in relations with professional investors.\n\n## Enhanced information requirements\n\nMiFID II imposes increased obligations on investment service providers  in  terms  of  client  information  when  providing investment services, particularly investment advice. Regulated  entities  must  provide  clear  and  appropriate guidelines and warnings regarding the risks associated with financial  instruments  and,  in  particular,  indicate  to  clients whether  the  range  of  instruments  offered  to  them  is established  or  provided  by  entities  with  links  and  relations with  the  entity  offering  the  advice  services.  Furthermore, MiFID II introduces additional information obligations regarding the breakdown of the price of financial instruments and services. The client must be informed of the cumulative amount of costs and charges relating to investment services and ancillary services.\n\nNew  requirements  arising  from  Delegated  Regulation  (EU) 2021/1253  will  be  introduced  relating  to  the  integration  of ESG  preferences  into  investor  product  suitability  tests  and sustainability factors into the internal organisation  of investment  companies.  Similarly,  Delegated  Directive  (EU) 2021/1269 will lead to the integration of sustainability factors when defining a target market, requiring firms to specify the types or groups of clients with whose ESG preferences the proposed product is compatible.\n\nI\n\n## Regulation of commissions\n\nMiFID II reinforces the protection of investors with regard to payments that a company may receive or pay to third parties during  the  provision  of  investment  services.  Companies providing  investment  advice  in  an  independent  manner  or conducting  portfolio  management  activities  are  prohibited from  collecting  fees,  commissions  or  monetary  or  nonmonetary benefits from third parties. Certain minor benefits of a non-monetary nature are allowed, but the client must be clearly informed of these.\n\nIn  the  case  of  entities  providing  investment  services  other than  portfolio  management  or  independent  investment advice,  commissions  may  be  received  provided  that  these payments  are  intended  to  improve  the  quality  of  service provided  to  the  client,  are  provided  over  time  and  do  not impair  the  service  provider's  compliance  with  its  obligation to act in an honest, equitable and professional manner in the interests of its clients. The client must be clearly informed of the existence, nature and amount of such commissions, in a comprehensive, precise and understandable manner, before the provision of any service.\n\nThe  prohibition  of  commissions  in  respect  of  independent investment advice does not apply to the commissions paid to entities  in  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,  UniCredit, BAWAG and Banco Sabadell  networks,  in  accordance  with the distribution agreements with these networks.\n\n## 8.3.1.1.3 Regulations applicable to funds\n\n## Regulations applicable to UCITS-type funds\n\nAmundi entities that manage and market UCITS-type funds in the EU must comply with the organisational requirements and the rules of good conduct of the UCITS V Directive.\n\nIn  terms  of  internal  organisation,  strict  rules  must  be respected, including requirements relating to the management of risk and conflicts of interest, as well as the rules of good conduct, particularly in relation to information to  be  provided  to  clients  and  the  amount  of  commissions. UCITS or AIF assets must be held by a depositary that is a separate  entity.  The  activities  of  depositaries  are  governed by rules relating to entities eligible for this function, covering their tasks, responsibilities and delegation agreements.\n\nIn addition, UCITS-type funds are subject to rules relating to the allocation and diversification of assets and should not, in particular, invest more than (i) 5% of the assets in securities or  money  market  instruments  issued  by  the  same  entity  or (ii) 20% of its assets in deposits with the same entity.\n\nFor each UCITS-type fund that it oversees, the management company  must  draw  up  a  short  document  containing  key information for investors (Key Investor Information Document or 'KIID'). This document must contain information on the essential elements of the UCITS-type fund concerned, in particular the identification of the UCITS-type fund, a brief description of its investment objectives and its investment  policy,  a  presentation  of  past  performance, associated  costs  and  charges  and  the  investment's  risk/ benefit profile. The management company must also publish a  prospectus  containing  the  information  necessary  for investors to be able to make an informed judgement about the  investment  offered  to  them  and,  in  particular,  the associated risks.",

        "page_content": "## Regulations applicable to AIF managers\n\nAmundi's activities are impacted by the AIFM Directive which imposes  strict  regulatory  requirements  on  AIF  managers. AIFs  are  defined  as  entities  (other  than  UCITS-type  funds) that raise capital from a number of investors, with a view to investing  this  capital  for  the  benefit  of  the  investors  in accordance  with  a  defined  investment  policy.  The  AIFM Directive  imposes  additional  requirements  in  terms  of organisation,  governance,  information  and  asset  allocation, and requires AIF assets to be held by depositaries that are independent of the manager and the AIF.\n\nAIF managers must draft regular reports for the competent authorities of their origin Member State on behalf of the AIFs that they manage.  In  particular, they must  provide information  on  (i)  the  main  instruments  in  which  each  AIF invests,  (ii)  the  markets  where  each  AIF  is  established  or active, and the most important exposures and concentrations for  each  AIF.  In  addition,  AIF  managers  are  subject  to enhanced obligations to provide investors with information. They must, for each EU AIF that they manage and for each AIF that they market in the EU, prepare an annual report no later than 6 months after the end of the financial year. Before any  investment,  managers  must  also  make  a  list  of information available to investors, including a description of the AIF investment strategy and objectives, a description of the procedures by which the AIF may change its investment strategy  or  policy,  a  description  of  the  AIF  valuation procedure and the method for fixing the price of the assets, a description  of  the  management  of  the  liquidity  risk  of  the AIF  and  a  description  of  all  commissions,  charges  and expenses (including the maximum amounts of these) that are directly or indirectly borne by the investors.\n\nEuropean  managers  may,  under  certain  conditions,  market European or non-European AIF units or shares within the EU through the passport scheme.\n\n## Information to be provided to investors by funds incorporating a non-financial approach (France)\n\nThe  Amundi  Group  management  companies  are  subject  to the provisions of the AMF Position - Recommendation (Doc2020-03)  on  'Information  to  be  provided  by  collective investments incorporating non-financial approaches', updated  in  January  2022  to  take  account  of  the  joint publication by the FBF and AMAFI of the joint charter on the synthetic  hedging  of  ESG  funds.  By  this  position,  the  AMF has clarified its expectations vis-\u00e0-vis management companies in terms of information provided to investors by funds  incorporating  non-financial  approaches.  This  position applies  to  UCIs  with  a  non-financial  aspect  authorised  for marketing  in  France  to  a  client  base  of  non-professional investors.  The  information  sent  to  investors  must  be proportionate to the actual and measurable consideration of non-financial  features.  The  implementation  of  this  doctrine involves updating, if necessary, the regulatory documentation, commercial documentation and the name of the existing funds.\n\n## SFDR regulation\n\nPortfolio  management  companies  of  the  Amundi  Group providing a portfolio management service (undertakings for collective investment or 'UCIs', or investment mandates) or investment consultancy services are subject to the provisions of  the  Disclosure  Regulation  and,  as  such,  must  describe sustainability  impacts,  which  more  specifically  consist  in communicating  and  identifying  the  SFDR  (Sustainable Finance  Disclosure  Regulation)  classification  applicable  to financial  products  and  complying  with  SFDR  obligations  in terms of transparency of information.\n\nThey  are  also  required  to  amend,  where  applicable,  the documentation of UCIs and mandates covered by the SFDR regulation.\n\nAlong  with  the  SFDR  Regulation,  the  portfolio  management companies of the Amundi Group must also comply with the provisions of the European Taxonomy Regulation published in the Official  Journal  of  the  European  Union on  22  June  2020. This text comes into effect on 1 January 2022 with the aim of establishing a classification system  for  environmentally sustainable economic  activities and  supplementing  the transparency requirements introduced by SFDR.\n\n## Regulations applicable to money market funds\n\nMoney market funds are AIFs or UCITS-type funds investing in  short-term  liquid  assets  with  the  aim  of  offering  yields comparable to those of the money market and/or preserving the value of the investment. The MMF Regulation establishes uniform operating rules at European level in order to make these  funds  more  resilient,  limit  the  risks  of  financial instability and guarantee the equitable treatment of investors. This regulation applies to UCITS-type funds or AIFs for  which  the  management  and  marketing  are  subject  to approval.  These  new  rules  apply  cumulatively  with  existing rules  laid  down  by  the  UCITS  and  AIFM  regulations,  unless otherwise stipulated in the regulations.\n\nMoney  market  funds  must  obtain  specific  approval  before being managed or marketed. The investment policy is framed by  the  requirements  for  eligible  assets,  concentration  and diversification  of  asset  portfolios.  The  fund  manager  must also  establish  a  crisis  simulation  system  as  well  as  internal appraisal  procedures  to  determine  the  credit  quality  of  the money  market  instruments.  Furthermore,  procedures  must be documented, validated, permanently applied and periodically reviewed.\n\nThe MMF regulations submit money market funds to increased transparency  requirements.  The  assets  of  a  money  market fund must be valued at least every day, with publication of the daily valuation on the monetary fund website.\n\nMoney  market  funds  are  also  subject  to  weekly  reporting obligations  relating  to  the  composition  of  the  portfolio, including breakdowns by maturity, credit profile, total asset value and net return.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

This regulatory framework requires (i) the centralised  clearing  of  certain  categories  of  standardised OTC derivatives,  (ii)  obligatory  reporting  of  any  derivatives transactions  and  (iii)  the  implementation  of  risk  mitigation techniques  (such  as  the  provision  of  guarantees)  for  OTC derivatives that are not subject to centralised clearing.\n\n## 8.3.1.1.5 Supervision of the so-called parallel banking sector\n\n## Securities financing transactions\n\nThe European regulations on the transparency of securities financing  transactions  and  reuse  aim  to  encourage  the transparency of these transactions and limit associated risks. Three  types  of  obligation  have  been  introduced  for  fund managers:  (i)  an  obligation  to  report  securities  financing transactions to trade repositories of data, (ii) an obligation to publish  information  on  the  use  of  securities  financing transactions and total return swaps and (iii) a framework for the reuse of collateralised financial instruments.\n\n## Packaged investment products\n\nThe European regulations on investment products, known as PRIIPS  ('Packaged  Retail  and  Insurance-Based  Investment Products') aim to standardise the pre-contractual information  provided  to  non-professional  investors  (within the  meaning  of  the  MiFID  II  Directive)  for  investment products, the performance of which is based on underlying assets  (such  as  UCITS-type  funds  and  AIFs,  structured deposits, structured bonds, unit-linked life insurance policies, etc.). The PRIIPS regulations also apply to securities or units of securitisation vehicles.\n\nThe  initiator  of  these  products  must  prepare  a  Key Information  Document ('KID'), with accurate, fair  and  clear\n\n## 8.3.1.2 France\n\nThe  French  regulatory  framework  applicable  to  Amundi's asset  management  activities  mainly  reflects  the  European framework described above.\n\n## 8.3.1.2.1 French regulatory and supervisory bodies\n\n## Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) French Prudential Supervision and Resolution Authority\n\nThe ACPR has a dual mission: to oversee credit institutions, investment  companies  and  insurance  companies,  and  to ensure the protection of consumers and the stability of the financial system. In its role as a supervisory body, the ACPR grants  approvals  to  investment  companies  and  ensures compliance of credit institutions and investment companies with the applicable laws and regulations and the conditions of  their  approval  as  well  as  monitoring  their  financial positions  (subject  to  the  powers  devolved  to  the  ECB  (see below)). The ACPR has the powers of administrative policing and sanction over the supervised entities. Certain powers of supervision  and  sanction  with  regard  to  credit  institutions, previously  entrusted  to  the  ACPR,  were  transferred  to  the European Central Bank in November 2014. See section 8.3.2.1 'The regulatory and supervisory bodies for banking'.\n\nI\n\ncontent, presenting the terms and conditions of the product to  offer  the  retail  investor  basic  information  and  allow understanding and comparisons of the product.\n\n## 8.3.1.1.6 Sustainable finance\n\nFollowing  its  action  plan  of  8  March  2018,  the  European Commission made sustainable finance one of its priorities in the implementation of the Capital Markets Union with several level  1  and  2  regulatory  initiatives  under  discussion.  The Disclosure regulation defines harmonised rules applicable to all  financial  market  professionals,  including  management companies,  on  the  subject  of  publishing  information  on sustainable investment and sustainability risks. Stakeholders are  required  to  take  ESG  risks  into  account  in  their investments,  and  must  provide  information  on  the  main negative  impacts  of  their  investment  policy  on  these  ESG factors. The regulations also provide for enhanced transparency  requirements  for  products,  highlighting  ESG characteristics  and  so-called  sustainable  investments.  The regulations came into effect on 10 March 2021, however the technical regulatory standards that must define the content and  presentation  of  the  information  to  be  published  by financial market professionals will only apply at a later date. The  European  Commission  indicated  in  a  letter  sent  to  the European  Parliament  and  to  the  European  Council  dated 25  November  2021  that  the  date  of  entry  into  force  of  these technical standards would be postponed to 1 January 2023.\n\nOn 1 January 2022, the Taxonomy Regulation supplemented the  transparency  requirements  introduced  by  SFDR  (the Disclosure regulation).\n\nIn  terms  of  indices,  the  Benchmark  regulation  creates  two new European low-carbon indices, the EU Climate Transition Benchmark  and  the  EU  Paris-aligned  Benchmark,  with enhanced  transparency  requirements,  to  provide  investors with  improved  information  on  the  carbon  footprint  of companies and investment portfolios.\n\n## French Financial Markets Authority ('AMF')\n\nThe  AMF  is  responsible  for  regulating  and  supervising  the financial  markets and for supervising portfolio management companies. The latter must obtain AMF approval in order to conduct their activities. The nature of this approval depends on the management activities envisaged and on the financial and organisational capacity of the applicant companies. The portfolio management companies may thus request approval for  two  different  activities,  namely:  (i)  UCITS  management and  (ii)  AIF  management.  Depending  on  the  approval granted,  the  portfolio  management  companies  may  also propose  investment  services,  defined  by  MiFID  II,  such  as portfolio management for a third party, providing investment advice or receiving and transmitting orders.\n\nWhen  authorised  to  manage  both  UCITS-type  funds  and AIFs,  portfolio  management  companies  must  comply  with the regulations applicable to these two activities cumulatively, unless otherwise stipulated. The AMF monitors the compliance of portfolio management companies with the laws and regulations applicable to them and the conditions of  their  approval  and  has  the  power  to  sanction  any  party breaching these regulations.",

They  must  also  establish  systems  for  assessing and managing the risks of money laundering and the financing of  terrorism  that  are  customised  to  the  transactions,  clients and suppliers concerned. They are also required to implement a corruption prevention program.\n\n## 8.3.2 Banking regulations applicable to Amundi\n\n## 8.3.2.1 Regulatory and supervisory bodies for banking\n\n## The banking supervisory authorities\n\nOn 15 October 2013, the EU adopted a regulation establishing a single supervisory mechanism for credit institutions in the euro  zone  and  countries  where  there  is  an  explicit  prior consent  system  (opt-in)  (the  'ECB  Single  Supervisory Mechanism'),  that  entrusted  specific  tasks  to  the  European Central Bank (ECB) concerning the prudential supervision of credit  institutions.  This  regulation  granted  the  ECB,  in coordination with the competent national regulators, a direct supervisory  power  over  certain  European  credit  institutions and banking groups, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. As Amundi is part of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, several Group entities  are  supervised  directly  by  the  ECB,  including  the Company and Amundi Finance, and by the ACPR, including Amundi Interm\u00e9diation and Amundi ESR.\n\nThe ECB fully assumed its supervisory role within the context of  the  European  regulation  as  implemented  under  French law  and  the  guidelines  and  recommendations  of  the European Banking Authority ('EBA') on 4 November 2014 as well as its responsibilities within the ECB Single Supervisory Mechanism, in close coordination, in France, with the ACPR (the  ACPR  and  the  ECB  thereafter,  each  being  a  'banking supervisory authority').\n\n## Supervisory framework\n\nThe  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  shall  take individual  decisions,  instruct  and  issue  approvals  to  credit institutions and investment firms and grant specific exemptions  in  accordance  with  the  prevailing  banking regulations.  The  Authority  ensures  observance  by  credit institutions and investment firms of the applicable laws and regulations  and  the  conditions  for  their  approval,  and monitors their financial situations.\n\nThe  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  may  require credit institutions and investment companies to comply with the  applicable  regulations  and  cease  activities  that  may adversely  affect  clients'  interests.  The  competent  banking supervisory authority may also require a financial institution to  take  necessary  measures  to  reinforce  or  restore  its financial position, improve its management methods and/or adjust its organisational structure and activities to achieve its objectives.  If the  solvency  or  liquidity  of  a  financial institution or the  clients' interests are, or could  be,\n\nthreatened,  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority may  take  certain  provisional  measures  such  as:  submitting the  establishment  to  specific  monitoring,  restricting  or prohibiting  the  conduct  of  certain  activities  (including  the collection  of  deposits),  the  settlement  of  certain  payments, the  sale  of  certain  assets,  the  distribution  of  dividends  to shareholders, and/or the payment of variable compensation. The  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  may  also require credit institutions to maintain their regulatory capital level  and/or  their  liquidity  ratios  at  a  higher  level  than  that required  by  the  applicable  regulations  and  submit  them  to specific liquidity requirements, including in terms of maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities.\n\nIn the event  of  non-compliance  with  the  applicable regulations,  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority may impose administrative sanctions, such as warnings, fines, suspension  or  dismissal  of  directors  and  withdrawal  of approval,  which  would,  where  necessary,  lead  to  the winding-up  procedure  of  the  institution  concerned.  The competent banking supervisory authority also has the power to appoint a provisional administrator to temporarily manage an  establishment  that  it  considers  to  be  poorly  managed. Insolvency  proceedings  may  only  be  opened  against  credit institutions or investment companies after the prior approval of  the  competent  banking  supervisory  authority  has  been obtained.\n\n## Resolution authority\n\nIn France,  the  ACPR  is  responsible  for  implementing measures for the prevention and resolution of banking crises.\n\nSince  1  January  2016,  a  Single  Resolution  Board  (SRB)  has been in charge of planning the preparation and resolution of decisions in such matters for cross-border credit institutions and  banking  groups,  as  well  as  for  credit  institutions  and banking  groups  that  are  directly  supervised  by  the  ECB within  the  European  banking  union,  such  as  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group. The ACPR  remains responsible for implementing  the  resolution  plans  in  accordance  with  the SRB's instructions.\n\nThe 'resolution authority' refers to the ACPR, SRB and/or any other national authority authorised to exercise or participate in the exercise of internal bailout powers (including the Council of the  European  Union  and  the  European  Commission  acting  in accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the SRM).\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Revision of the CRD IV Directive was  transposed  into  French  law  by  Order  No.  2020-1635  of 21  December 2020 relating to various provisions  for  adapting legislation  to  European  Union  financial  law,  which  has  been applicable since 29 December 2020.\n\nAccording  to  these  regulations,  credit  institutions  must comply with minimum capital requirements. The requirements  arising  from  these  regulations  that  apply  to Amundi  in  terms  of  solvency  and  capital  adequacy  are described in section 5.4 'Solvency and capital adequacy' of this  Universal  Registration  Document.  In  addition  to  these requirements,  the  main  regulations  applicable  to  credit institutions relate to the need to diversify the risks and liquid assets  held,  monetary  policy,  restrictions  on  investments  in shares  and  the  possibility  of  conducting  other  non-banking activities,  reporting  requirements,  the  implementation  of  an appropriate  internal  control  system  and  a  compensation policy compatible with sound and effective risk management and the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism.\n\nFinally,  banking  regulations  impose  information  obligations on credit institutions. They must provide information on their objectives  and  policies  in  terms  of  risk  management, governance  procedures,  compliance  with  capital  adequacy\n\n## 8.3.2.3 Bank resolution\n\nOn 15 May 2014, the European Parliament and the Council of the  European  Union  adopted  Directive  2014/59/EU  of  the Parliament and of the Council, providing for the establishment of a European framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms (known as 'BRRD'), transposed into French law by Order No.  2015-1024  of  20  August  2015,  introducing  various provisions for adapting legislation to European Union law in financial matters.\n\nThe BRRD was amended by Directive (EU) 2019/879 of the European  Parliament  and  of  the  Council  of  20  May  2019 amending the BRRD with regard to the loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity of credit institutions and investment firms  as  well  as  Directive  98/26/EC,  (known  as  'BRRD  II'),\n\nI\n\nrequirements  and  compensation  that  have  a  significant impact  on  the  leverage  and  risk  profile.  In  addition,  the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  imposes  additional information requirements on credit institutions, which must, in particular, provide  information  on  certain  financial indicators,  their  activities  in  non-cooperative  States  or territories,  and  more  generally,  information  about  their locations and activities in each State or territory.\n\nThe  changes  to  the  CRD/CRR  Regulation  are  accompanied by  a  new  European  regulatory  framework  specific  to investment  companies:  the  Directive  and  regulation  of 27 November 2019, applicable since 26 June 2021. Known as IFD/IFR  ('Investment  Firms  Directive/Regulation'),  this regulation  aims  to  establish  a  regulatory  framework  that  is more in line with the size and risks of investment companies, which are often different from traditional banking risks. The capital  requirements  for  investment  companies  therefore now  include  business  volumes  and  the  balance  sheet  risk approach has been simplified.  Owing  to  the  presence  of  at least  one  credit  institution,  the  Amundi  Group  remains subject to the consolidated CRD/CRR framework. However, Amundi Interm\u00e9diation and Amundi ESR have the status of investment company and are subject to this new scheme on an individual basis.\n\nFurthermore, on 27 October 2021 the European Commission presented  a  legislative  package  to  finalise  the  adoption  of the  Basel  III  standards  within  the  European  Union  and announced  that  these  new  texts  were  scheduled  to  come into  effect  from  1  January  2025.  This  legislative  package  is composed of (i) a proposal for a directive to amend the CRD V Directive, (ii) a proposal for a regulation to amend the CRR 2  Regulation  and  (iii)  a  proposal  for  a  regulation  to  amend the aspects of the CRR 2 Regulation relating specifically to the  banking  resolution.  These  texts  include  a  number  of changes to the existing rules, including (i) the implementation of the latest measures included in the Basel III standards,  (ii)  the  inclusion  of  explicit  rules  on  the supervision and  management  of  ESG  risks  and  the introduction of additional powers for regulators in regard to the  assessment  of  ESG  risks,  and  (iii)  greater  alignment  of the supervisory powers of regulators.\n\nwhich  was  transposed  into  French  law  by  Order  No. 2020-1636  of  21  December  2020  relating  to  the  resolution regime in the banking sector.\n\nThis regime, which includes measures for the prevention and resolution of banking crises, is designed to preserve financial stability,  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  the  activities,  services and  transactions  of  institutions  whose  failure  would  have serious consequences for the economy, to protect depositors,  and  to  avoid  or  minimise  the  dependency  on public financial support. Accordingly, the European resolution authorities, including the Single Resolution Board, have  been  given  extensive  powers  to  take  all  necessary measures relating to the resolution of the entirety or part of a credit institution or the group to which it belongs.",

        "page_content": "The resolution authorities may open a resolution procedure against a credit institution if they consider that: the failure of the  institution  is  confirmed  or  likely,  there  is  no  reasonable prospect  that  another  non-public  measure  would  avert  the institution's failure within a reasonable timeframe, a resolution  measure  is  needed  and  a  winding-up  procedure would  not  accomplish  the  aims  of  the  resolution  described above.\n\nFollowing  the  opening  of  a  resolution  procedure,  the resolution  authorities  have  several  tools  that  they  may deploy with the aim of recapitalising the relevant institution or  restoring  its  viability,  under  the  conditions  described below.  They  may  implement  the  'internal  bailout'  tool  to reduce  the  nominal  value  of  capital  instruments  or  convert other  capital  instruments  and  some  of  the  institution's commitments into securities. The internal bailout tool is first implemented  by  reducing  category  1  capital  securities  and then  by  reducing  or  converting  other  capital  instruments followed by some of the institution's commitments.\n\nIt is our understanding that, for cooperative banking groups, including the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group, the resolution authorities  should  favour  the  'extended  SPE'  resolution strategy.  Therefore,  and  in  the  event  that  a  resolution procedure  were  to  be  opened  against  the  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole Group,  the  entirety  of  Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  (in  its  role  as central body) and its affiliated entities would be considered together as the extended SPE (Amundi is not affiliated with the central body of Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A.).\n\nIn  the  event  of  financial  difficulties  that  may  justify  the initiation of a resolution procedure against Amundi Group, or if  the  viability  of  the  Company  or  group  depends  on  it,  the Company  shares  in  circulation  may  be  diluted  by  the conversion  of  other  capital  or  debt  instruments,  whether cancelled or transferred, thus depriving shareholders of their rights.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  internal  bailout  tool,  broader  powers  are conferred on the resolution authority in order to implement other resolution measures concerning defaulting institutions (or the group to which they belong), comprising in particular: the total or partial transfer of the activities of the institution to a third-party or relay institution, the separation of assets, the  replacement  or  substitution  of  the  establishment  as  a debtor in respect of debt instruments, changes to the terms and conditions of debt instruments (the maturity date and/or the  amount  of  interest  and/or  temporary  suspension  of payments),  the  removal  of  officers  from  their  duties,  the appointment of a special administrator and the issue of new\n\ncapital  securities  or  other  capital  instruments.  When  it  uses its  powers,  the  resolution  authority  must  take  into  account the  situation  of  the  Group  or  institution  concerned  and  the potential consequences of its decisions in the Member State in question.\n\nThus, although it is not possible to predict this, in the event that  a  resolution  procedure  is  initiated  against  the  Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  Group,  the  resolution  authorities  could  require Cr\u00e9dit  Agricole  S.A.  to  sell  all  the  Company  shares  that  it holds.\n\n## MREL Ratio\n\nThe  MREL  (Minimum  Requirement  for  Own  Funds  and Eligible Liabilities) ratio is defined  in  the  BRRD  and corresponds  to  a  minimum  requirement  of  own  funds  and eligible  liabilities  that  must  be  available  to  absorb  losses  in the event of resolution.\n\nAmundi does not have any specific requirements for MREL; however, as a subsidiary of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole S.A. Group, it contributes to the ratio calculated at Group level and is part of  the  monitoring  and  steering  mechanism implemented by the Group.\n\n## The Single Resolution Fund\n\nThe Single Resolution Mechanism provides for the establishment of a single resolution fund from 1 January 2016, which  may  be  used  by  the  Single  Resolution  Board  in support  of  resolution  plans  (the  'Single  Resolution  Fund'). This  Single  Resolution  Fund,  financed  by  all  banking institutions, will replace the national resolution funds implemented in accordance with the BRRD. On 19  December  2014,  the  Council  adopted  Implementing Regulation  (EU)  2015/81  specifying  uniform  conditions  of application  of  the  regulation  on  the  Single  Resolution Mechanism with regard to ex ante contributions to the Single Resolution  Fund.  This  regulation  defines  the  method  for calculating the contributions of banks  to  the  Single Resolution Fund, and sets out the annual contributions to be paid by banks to the latter, in proportion to the amount of their  liabilities,  excluding  capital  and  deposits  covered  and adjusted according to risks. The Single Resolution Fund will be established gradually over an eight-year period (2016 -2023) and must reach at least 1% of the value of the deposits covered by all the credit institutions by 31  December  2023.  As  of  July  2021,  the  Single  Resolution Fund stood at approximately \u20ac52 billion.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

The main characteristics of a high-quality liquid asset are: 1) low risk and volatility; 2) ease and certainty of valuation; 3) low correlation with risky assets; and 4) listing on a developed, recognised market of a substantial size. Total high-quality liquid assets that are not already being used as collateral represent the numerator of the short-term liquidity ratio (LCR or liquidity coverage ratio, which measures 1-month liquidity in a stress situation) under the same regulations.\n\nincluded in the consolidated group, and that the management report  (included  in  chapter  4  of  the  present  Universal Registration  Document)  provides  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the business trends, results and financial position of the Company and  of  all  entities  included  in  the  consolidated  group,  and describes the main risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\n12\u00a0April 2022\n\nVal\u00e9rie Baudson\n\nChief Executive Officer of the Company\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nRepresented by Laurent Tavernier and Agn\u00e8s Hussherr\n\n63, rue Villiers, 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine\n\nPRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS  Audit  is  a  member  of  the Compagnie  R\u00e9gionale  des  Commissaires  aux  Comptes  de Versailles et du Centre (the Regional Association of Auditors of Versailles and the Centre Region).\n\nPRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS  Audit  was  renewed  as Statutory  Auditor  by  decision  of  the  General  Meeting  of Shareholders of the Company of 16 May 2019 for a term of six years  to  end  at  the  close  of  the  General  Meeting  to  be convened  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  year ending 31 December 2024.\n\n## Account administration\n\nAccount  administration  or  account  keeping  consists  of entering financial instruments into an account in the name of their  holder,  i.e.  recognising  the  holder's  rights  over  those financial instruments, and keeping the corresponding assets, according  to  the  particular  arrangements  for  each  financial instrument.\n\n## CA and SG insurers\n\nEntities belonging to the insurance companies of the Cr\u00e9dit Agricole  and  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G\u00e9n\u00e9rale  groups  that  have  formed  an agreement  with  Amundi  for  the  management  of  their general assets.\n\nI",

Amundi  has  identified  the  following  asset classes  for  the  monitoring  of  its  activities:  Treasury,  fixed income, multi-asset, equity, real and structured.\n\n## Net inflows/(outflows)\n\nOperating activities indicator not reflected in the consolidated  financial  statements  and  that  corresponds  to the  difference  between  the  subscription  and  buyback amounts  of  the  period.  Positive  net  inflows  mean  that  the total  amount  of  inflows  (from  client  investments)  is  higher than  the  amount  of  outflows  (from  client  withdrawals). Conversely, negative net inflows mean that the total amount of outflows is higher than the amount of inflows.\n\n## Net management fees\n\nNet management fees equal management fees received net of fees paid. Management  fees received correspond to management  fees  paid  by  the  portfolio  to  remunerate  the management company, recognised as and when the service is rendered and generally calculated as a percentage of assets under  management,  along  with  fees  paid  by  the  funds  to Amundi  Finance  in  relation  to  the  guarantees  provided  by Amundi Finance for guaranteed funds or EMTNs, turnover fees paid by the fund, and other fees of smaller amounts, such as front-end charges and securities lending and borrowing fees. Fees  paid  comprise  commissions  paid  to  distributors  in accordance  with  contractual  provisions,  depositary  and valuation fees where paid by the management company, and to a lesser extent, certain related administrative costs.\n\n## Performance fees\n\nPerformance  fees  are  paid  to  the  asset  management company as provided by contract. They are calculated on the basis of a percentage on the positive difference between the actual  performance  and  the  benchmark  index  as  provided by the contract.\n\n## Upfront fees\n\nFees paid by the client that correspond to commissions paid to  distributors,  in  accordance  with  contractual  provisions. They are generally defined as a percentage of management fees.  Upfront  fees  paid  to  distributors  are  capitalised  and amortised over the life of the contracts.\n\n## Depositary\n\nService  provider  ensuring  the  safekeeping  of  securities  and checking the lawfulness of management decisions taken on behalf  of  the  UCITS-type  funds.  The  depositary  may contractually  outsource  part  of  its  functions  to  another establishment  authorised  to  provide  account-keeping  and custody services; in particular, it may outsource the custody of  assets  to  a  'custodian'.  However,  it  may  not  outsource checks  on  the  lawfulness  of  decisions  taken  by  the management company of the UCITS-type funds.\n\nI\n\n## Third-party distributors\n\nA  distributor  is  a  service  provider  in  charge  of  marketing investment  services  and  financial  instruments  to  its  client base (retail customers or institutional investors). Amundi has contracts  with  more  than  1,000  distributors  worldwide  for the  marketing  of  its  products  and  services.  The  scope  of Amundi's  third-party  distributors  includes  all  of  these distributors  with  the  exception  of  partner  distribution networks in France, international partner distribution networks and joint ventures.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nOperational  business  indicator  not  reflected  in  the  Group's unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements,  corresponding to  assets  in  portfolios  marketed  by  the  Group,  whether  the Group  manages  them,  advises  on  them  or  delegates  their management to an external manager. For each fund, assets under  management  are  measured  by  multiplying  the  net asset  value  per  unit  (calculated  by  an  external  valuation agent in accordance with regulations in force) by the number of units/shares in issue.\n\n## ETF (Exchange Traded Fund)\n\nETFs  (exchange  traded  funds)  or  'trackers'  are  stock market-listed index funds that aim to replicate as closely as possible the performance in their benchmark index, on both the  upside  and  downside.  An  ETF  security  trades  like  a normal share and can therefore be purchased or sold during market trading hours.\n\n## Formula funds\n\nType of mutual funds whose aim is to achieve, after a defined period,  a  value  determined  by  the  strict  application  of  a predefined  calculation  formula,  based  on  financial  market indicators or financial instruments, and as the case may be to distribute income, which is determined in the same manner.\n\n## FCP mutual fund\n\nType of UCITS that issues units and has no legal personality. The  investor,  by  buying  units,  becomes  a  joint  owner  of securities,  but  has  no  voting  rights.  The  investor  is  not  a shareholder in the fund. An FCP mutual fund is represented and  managed  in  administrative,  financial  and  accounting terms  by  a  single  management  company,  which  may outsource those tasks.\n\n## Alternative investment fund (AIF)\n\nAlternative investment funds or AIFs are investment funds that are  distinct  from  UCITS-type  funds.  They  raise  capital  from  a certain  number  of  investors  to  invest,  in  the  interests  of  those investors,  in  accordance  with  an  investment  policy  defined  by the AIFs or their management companies.\n\n## Fund of funds\n\nA fund of funds is an undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS-type funds) that mainly invests in equities or units of other mutual funds.\n\nBy convention, assets held by Amundi funds invested in other funds are counted in the AuM of 'Institutional excluding CA and SG Insurers'.",

        "page_content": "## Collective investment fund\n\nInvestment  funds  are  undertakings  that  collectively  own financial  assets.  In  France,  these  funds  take  various  legal forms that are often very specific. Most collective investments  are  regulated  by  the  AMF  (UCITS-type  funds, AIFs, 'other AIFs' and 'other collective investments').\n\n## Multi-asset fund\n\nMulti-asset funds invest in a wide variety of securities and in various  asset  classes  (equities,  bonds,  money  market,  etc.). Risks  and  returns  associated  with  a  multi-asset  fund  may vary  greatly  depending  on  its  management  objectives  and the composition of its assets.\n\n## Constant proportion portfolio insurance ('CPPI') fund\n\nType  of  investment  fund  managed  using  the  constant proportion portfolio insurance method, which gives the fund exposure  to  upside  in  the  financial  markets  while  also providing  capital  protection  or  a  capital  guarantee.  It  is based  on  differentiation  between  two  types  of  assets  in  a single  portfolio:  dynamic  assets  intended  to  produce  the returns  sought,  and  assets  providing  the  guarantee  or protection.  The  breakdown  of  assets  between  these  two types  is  reviewed  regularly  in  order  to  achieve  the management objective.\n\n## Open-ended fund\n\nCollective investment undertakings that may take the form of a UCITS-type fund, AIF or other, that are open to both nonprofessional and professional investors.\n\n## Sovereign fund\n\nInternational investment fund owned by a State or a State's central bank.\n\n## Structured fund\n\nType of investment fund that generally features guarantees or protection on some or all of the amounts invested, mainly comprising  two  large  families:  formula  funds  and  constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI) funds.\n\n## Alternative asset management\n\nInvestment  strategies  intended  to  achieve  returns  showing low correlation with market indices. Strategies cover various investment processes, risks and returns targets, and can be used  to  meet  a  wide  range  of  objectives.  Investors  access these strategies either indirectly (via 'funds of hedge funds') or directly (via 'hedge funds').\n\n## Asset management for third parties\n\nProcess  by  which  an  investor  (individual  or  institutional) delegates the financial management of its capital/savings to a financial  intermediary,  of  which  the  management  company  is the  most  common  institutional  form.  Asset  management  for third parties comprises (i) portfolio management  or customised  mandate-based  management  for  individuals, companies  or  institutional  investors,  and  (ii)  collective management  through  collective  investment  undertakings (mutual funds).\n\n## Discretionary management\n\nInvestment service consisting of managing, on a discretionary  and  customised  basis,  portfolios  that  include one or more financial instruments as part of a mandate given by a third party.\n\n## Passive or index-based management\n\nInvestment  strategy  intended  to  replicate  as  accurately  as possible the performance of a benchmark index.\n\n## Unconventional hydrocarbons\n\nOil sands, shale oil and shale gas.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nInstitutional  investors  are  organisations  that  collect  savings on a large scale and invest on their own behalf or on behalf of third parties. Institutional clients include sovereign funds, pension funds, insurers, other financial institutions and nonprofit  organisations.  Amundi's  'Institutional'  business  also covers  Corporates,  Employee  Savings  and  Retirement schemes, and CA and SG Insurers.\n\n## Seed money investments\n\nAmundi capital invested in order to launch funds before they are marketed. The intention is for this capital to be gradually replaced by capital invested by clients.\n\n## Reponsible Investment Universe\n\nThe  Responsible  Investment  universe,  described  in  the Amundi  reference  framework (1) ,  is  made  up  of  investment products, funds and mandates, which integrate extrafinancial criteria into their investment process, known as \"responsible\" criteria (ESG: Environmental, Social and Governance; sustainability objectives; ethical considerations).\n\nAmundi's statutory auditors have carried out procedures on the  amount  of  assets  under  management  classified  as Responsible  Investments  by  Amundi  of  \u20ac847  billion  as  at 31 December 2021. Their report (1) indicates that based on the work  they  have  performed  and  the  evidence  they  have obtained,  nothing  has  come  to  their  attention  that  causes them to believe that the information, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Amundi reference framework.\n\n## Managed account\n\nManaged accounts are covered by the  AIFM  Directive,  and are investment funds that give investors access to alternative management in a regulated  environment,  while  limiting  the main operational risks.  These  alternative  funds  are  under  the control and oversight of the operator of the managed account platform,  who  delegates  the  financial  management  of  a portfolio to a third-party manager. That manager has the task of replicating some or all of the investment strategy used in its reference  fund.  This  operational  arrangement  is  intended  to limit  exposure  to  the  third-party  manager  to  its  performance drivers only. The aim of a managed account is to give investors greater  operational  security,  independent  risk  management through  greater  transparency,  and  in  general  improved liquidity.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are two  types  of  UCITS-type  funds:  SICAVs  (variable-capital investment companies) and FCPs (mutual funds).\n\n## Voluntary investment\n\nProprietary investments carried out by Amundi, as opposed to investments for third parties.\n\n## Basis point (BP)\n\nA basis point is equal to 0.01% or 1/10,000.\n\n## Privileged\n\nNotion  qualifying  Amundi's  commercial  relationship  with certain  distributors  that  provide  specific  services  and implement  particular  efforts  to  promote  its  products.  The agreements formalising these relationships do not, however, provide for any exclusivity.\n\n## Derivative\n\nFinancial instrument whose value varies as a function of the price  of  an  underlying,  which  may  be  of  a  different  nature\n\nI\n\n(equity,  index,  currency,  interest  rate,  etc.).  The  derivative gives  its  holder  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  the  underlying without  the  holder  having  to  buy  or  sell  it  itself.  Derivative contracts may take various forms (swaps, forwards, futures, options, CFDs, warrants, etc.).\n\n## Guaranteed product/fund\n\nDebt security or mutual fund where the achievement of the target  capital  repayment/return  is  guaranteed  by  a  credit institution.\n\n## Raison d'\u00eatre\n\n'Raison  d'\u00eatre'  is  defined  as  that  which  is  'essential  to fulfilling the corporate purpose, in other words, the scope of the company's activities' (source: Notat-Senard report). The Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Group's raison d'\u00eatre ('Acting in the interests of our clients and society every day') is inconsistent with a statutory concept and was formulated in the context of the Group Project and the 2022 MTP.\n\n## Retail\n\nClient segment including the following distribution channels: French Networks, International Networks, Third-party Distributors and Joint-Ventures.\n\n## Smart beta\n\nInvestment  strategy  involving  management  processes  based on  indices  other  than  those  that  weight  stocks  by  market capitalisation, e.g. 'anti-benchmark\u00ae' management by TOBAM.\n\n## Portfolio management company\n\nInvestment service provider whose main activity is managing assets  for  third  parties  (individually  through  a  management mandate  or  collectively  through  a  UCITS-type  fund)  and which is subject to AMF authorisation.\n\n## Spread\n\nIn general, a spread is a differential between two rates. The term's  precise  definition  varies  according  to  the  type  of market in relation to which it is used.\n\n## Tracking error\n\nTracking  error  is  an  asset  management  risk  measurement used in portfolios that track indices or are compared with a benchmark index. It is the annualised standard deviation of the  differences  between  portfolio  returns  and  benchmark index returns.\n\n## Value at risk (VaR)\n\nValue  at  Risk  represents  an  investor's  maximum  potential loss on a financial asset or portfolio of financial assets, which should only be reached with a given probability over a given timeframe. In other words, it is the worst loss expected over a given timeframe for a certain confidence level. VaR can be regarded  as  a  quantile  of  the  distribution  of  profits  and losses associated with holding an asset or portfolio of assets over a given period.",
