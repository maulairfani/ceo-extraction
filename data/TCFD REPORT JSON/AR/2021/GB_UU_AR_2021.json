Customer satisfaction and employee engagement remain high, and we have achieved our best ever performance against customer outcome delivery incentives (ODIs). We are on track to deliver our environmental improvement programme for the 2020-25 regulatory period (AMP7), which will improve river and bathing water quality in the North West, and have made good progress against our carbon pledges. We are upper quartile across a suite of environmental, social and governance (ESG) indices, and our robust balance sheet provides long-term financial resilience.\n\n## Helping customers struggling with bills\n\nMany people across the country are facing real challenges as we emerge from a global pandemic and are faced with significant rises in the cost of living. We serve many of the most deprived areas in England and Wales, so it is more important than ever that we are doing what we can to help customers.\n\nOur average household bill for 2022/23 is not increasing, and we are offering more support than ever before through our extensive range of affordability and vulnerability schemes, helping over 200,000 households this year and providing around \u00a3280 million (1) of affordability support over AMP7.\n\nThere is still more we would like to be able to do, and we are a passionate supporter of the Consumer Council for Water's drive to introduce a national social tariff, which would help deliver a more equitable sharing of support for customers struggling to pay their bill regardless of where they live in the country.\n\n## Sustained high levels of operational and environmental performance\n\nWe were a sector-leading company on outcome delivery in Ofwat's Service Delivery Report for 2020/21, with nine of 11 outcomes (2) being at or better than target, and were recognised as a top performer on supply interruptions and pollution incidents - two areas where we are now seeing the benefits of targeted investment we made in AMP6. On the two outcomes (2) where our performance was poorer than target we have plans in place to improve this.\n\nOur customer ODI performance has been strong across the board this year, meeting or beating over 80 per cent of our performance commitments. Based on our anticipated reward this year, we will have earned rewards in both the first two years of AMP7 against Ofwat's customer satisfaction measure, C-MeX, and we have achieved our lowest ever level of written complaints this year.\n\nWe were pleased to achieve a 4 star rating in the 2020 Environmental Performance Assessment from the Environment Agency (EA), meaning we were categorised as an industry-leading company in the most recent annual assessment by the EA, taking into account performance across a broad range of environmental metrics. It reflected our best ever performance, and we were the first water company to achieve green status across all measures since 2015.\n\nWe continue to be at the sector frontier on pollution performance, having reduced overall pollution by a third since the start of the AMP. Our treatment works compliance remains strong and we expect to remain green on this measure in the EA's assessment for 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Performance improvements earning outperformance\n\nWe earned a reported return on regulated equity (RoRE) of 7.9 per cent for 2021/22 (3) , driven by our continued improvements in operational performance together with high levels of inflation, which increases financing outperformance, and tax outperformance.\n\nUnderlying RoRE is slightly lower at 7.7 per cent, and excludes the tax that will be recovered through the regulatory sharing mechanism.\n\nCumulative RoRE for the first two years of AMP7 is 6.2 per cent on both a reported and underlying basis.\n\nOur strong performance this year earned a \u00a325 million reward against customer ODIs (2) , the highest annual reward we have achieved to date. We anticipate earning total customer ODI rewards over AMP7 of \u00a3200 million, a third higher than we estimated in last year's report.\n\nWe consistently issue debt at efficient rates, and we earned financing outperformance of 1.6 per cent of regulated equity this year. We also performed strongly on tax as a result of optimising government tax incentives. The economic environment as we emerge from a global pandemic, as well as the war in Ukraine, has driven higher costs in our supply chain and we are starting to see significant cost increases in power and chemicals. We continue to seek efficiencies and exploit technology and innovation to help us deliver our total expenditure (totex) efficiently.\n\n## Sharing our success with customers\n\nAs a responsible company it is right that we should share our success with customers, and we feel the best way for us to create more value for customers and other stakeholders is through investing to accelerate improvements in performance. This is in line with the approach we have taken historically, sharing over \u00a3600 million over the 2010-20 period.\n\nWe have increased the investment we are making by a further \u00a3400 million meaning that, over the 2020-25 period, we are investing \u00a3765 million beyond the scope of our final determination allowance to help us accelerate environmental and customer outcomes.\n\n## Investing to improve service for customers\n\n\u00a3250 million of the additional investment is helping us deliver further improvements to service for customers and better performance against our customer ODIs.\n\nAs mentioned above, our performance has been strong across the majority of our customer outcomes, but this investment is targeted at delivering sustainable improvements for customers in two specific areas\n\n## \u00a3280m\n\naffordability support being provided over 2020-25, helping 200,000 households in the North West\n\nwhere we want to do better - sewer flooding and water quality (specifically discolouration).\n\nIt includes investment in Dynamic Network Management (DNM), an advancement of Systems Thinking in our wastewater network that will help us reduce sewer flooding and pollution incidents using real-time performance data from a network of sensors to enable predictive and preventative optimisation.\n\n## Investing outperformance for environmental improvements\n\nA further \u00a3250 million of the additional investment is being used to deliver environmental outcomes. This includes delivering elements of the new Environment Act requirements earlier, and improving the health of rivers across the North West.\n\nIn July 2021, we launched a collaborative partnership with The Rivers Trust, a first for any water company in the United Kingdom. To help kickstart a river revival in the North West we published 'Better Rivers: Better North West', our plan to improve the health of rivers across our region in the next three years. We are delivering improvements that support at least a one-third sustainable reduction in the number of spills recorded from our storm overflows between 2020 and 2025, with all storm overflows monitored by 2023 and real-time data on their operation made publicly available. Our plans will lead to 184 kilometres of improved waterways across the region. We also continue to engage with the ongoing industry-wide investigations by Ofwat and the EA into possible unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\nThe remaining \u00a3265 million of the \u00a3765 million of additional investment is for projects where regulatory allowances and mechanisms have been secured, much of which will deliver further environmental benefits. For example, around \u00a390 million will fund a project in Bolton that is part of our Water Industry National Environment Programme (WINEP), and \u00a365 million will go towards supporting the country's green economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic.\n\n## Long-term investment needs for the environment\n\nProtecting and enhancing the natural environment has always been a key priority for us and many of our stakeholders. In the last 12 months this has received increased public interest, particularly the health of rivers and the part the water industry can play in helping to improve this.\n\nNew and emerging requirements reflect the increased importance being given by the Government to the environmental agenda and we share the Government's ambitious improvement plans.\n\n## \u00a3765m\n\nadditional investment being made over 2020-25 to deliver customer and environmental improvements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our \u00a3765 million investment on page 71\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about Dynamic Network Management on\n\npage 43\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our Better Rivers: Better North West plan on\n\npage 67\n\n## \u00a325m\n\nnet reward earned this year against customer ODIs (1) , the highest we have achieved in any year to date",

We have published our plan to help improve the health of our rivers over the next three years.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our TCFD and TNFD disclosures on pages 86 to 99\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our /financial risk management policies on pages 242 to 249\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to diversity and inclusion on pages 44 to 45\n\n- * The dividend increase is based on the CPIH element included within allowed regulated revenue for the 2021/22 financial year (i.e. the movement in CPIH between November 2019 and November 2020).\n\nThe Environment Act 2021 introduces several new challenges for the sector, including a requirement for water companies to secure a progressive but very substantial reduction in the average number of spills from storm overflows, and controlling nutrient pollution by reducing phosphate release from wastewater treatment works. The Industrial Emissions Directive broadens the scope of activities covered by compliance requirements, and the EA's recent interpretation of Farming Rules for Water restricts the application of biosolids to land in certain areas at certain times, requiring more storage capacity or alternative means of disposal.\n\nWe have delivered significant improvements in environmental performance in recent years, and through our original plans for AMP7 we will deliver further improvements, with good progress already having been made. The additional investment we are making will help accelerate improvements, but there is more that the industry will need to do.\n\nSpecific targets for the next regulatory period have not yet been agreed, but it is already clear that there is an ambition to deliver a fundamental change in the way drainage network systems were originally configured. The investment needed to deliver these changes will be significant for the industry as a whole, but particularly for the North West, where we have a much higher proportion of combined sewers. We are working with the Government and regulators to determine how these bold ambitions can be met and by when, recognising that the pace of change must consider customer affordability.\n\nResilience to climate change and population growth remains a material issue for many stakeholders, even more so since COP26, and this is something that will need to be addressed by water companies both regionally and nationally. Our Systems Thinking approach and investment are helping to deliver increased resilience across the North West, and longer term we are involved in strategic planning for a national water transfer scheme.\n\nWe have committed to achieve net zero by 2030 with six pledges to reduce our carbon footprint, underpinned by ambitious science-based targets for reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, and we are making good progress against these. We are linking executive remuneration more tightly to our carbon\n\ncommitments with four targets added to the Long Term Plan, and in this year's report we also include nature-related financial disclosures.\n\n## Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP)\n\nWe have continued to develop HARP, an industry-first Direct Procurement for Customers (DPC) programme to design and build six replacement tunnel sections of the Haweswater Aqueduct, which transports water from Cumbria to Manchester.\n\nWe have undertaken extensive market engagement throughout the process - challenging for a project of this scale during the pandemic - and used innovative ways to manage stakeholder engagement, including the use of digital channels and a virtual exhibition giving people access to information and the ability to ask questions remotely.\n\nWe developed the initial design following extensive ground investigation work to plot the best route, and planning applications have all been submitted with decisions expected later this year. During early 2022, we have been finalising tender documents, and we expect to start procurement in the summer of 2022.\n\n## Strong financial performance in a turbulent economic climate\n\nWe have delivered another good financial performance this year, underpinned by a strong balance sheet.\n\nUnderlying earnings per share is 53.8 pence, a decrease of 4 per cent primarily due to the inflationary impact on our underlying net finance expense. With inflation increasing, this impacts interest charges and therefore earnings, but our regulatory capital value will benefit from higher indexation. This higher finance expense is partially offset by a tax credit following a review of our innovation-related capital expenditure.\n\nReported earnings per share is (8.3) pence, with the difference mainly due to a one-off deferred taxation charge which occurs from a restatement of the liability following a change in the headline rate of corporation tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent, effective from 1 April 2023. Adjusting items are outlined in the reconciliation table on pages 82 and 83.\n\nThe board has proposed a final dividend of 29.0 pence per ordinary share, taking the total dividend for 2021/22 to 43.5 pence. This is an increase of 0.6 per cent*, in line with our AMP7 policy of targeting an annual growth rate of CPIH inflation through to 2025.\n\nOur balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the sector as a result of the responsible and prudent approach we take to financial risk management. Gearing, measured as net debt to regulatory capital value, is 61 per cent, remaining comfortably within our target range of 55 to 65 per cent. This supports United Utilities Water Limited's A3 credit rating with Moody's, and at year end we have liquidity to February 2025, giving us a high level of flexibility and resilience.\n\nWhile we are not immune to the effects of the current high inflation environment, our risk management policies have been effective at helping to shield us in certain areas. Our fully funded, low dependency pension schemes protect employees and shareholders from the risk and deficit repair contributions that come with having a large pension deficit.",

We have over 90 per cent of our AMP7 base capital programme on contract under target price arrangements, with sharing of cost overruns incentivising our partners to deliver within budget.\n\n## Supported by a diverse and highly motivated workforce\n\nWe pride ourselves on being a quality employer, and are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive team of people, recruiting from every part of our community. We scored equal to the UK high performance norm with 87 per cent employee engagement this year, are rated 4.6 out of five by Glassdoor, and were the leading utility company in The Inclusive Top 50 UK Employers List 2021/22.\n\nWe believe in the importance of developing younger generations to keep the talent pool flowing.

We have included information that we believe is material to these decisions, which is presented in a way that we believe is fair, balanced and understandable. We engage with - and recognise that this report will be read by - a wide variety of other stakeholders including customers, suppliers, employees, analysts, regulators, community bodies, politicians, non-governmental organisations, and devolved authorities. Where we believe that a topic is material to a large number of them, which is assessed in part through a matrix approach to stakeholder materiality as set out on pages 34 and 35, we either include it in this report or refer the reader to other reports and information (such as our regulatory reports, customer communications, or corporate responsibility web pages). We believe this approach meets the requirements of company law, the UK Corporate Governance Code, IFRS and the International <IR> Framework, and that we go beyond those requirements where we feel it is particularly helpful to do so and where that can be done without making the report unnecessarily lengthy or difficult to read.",

We have a long-standing commitment to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters.\n\nOver the past 20 years we have measured ourselves against national and international benchmarks of responsible business practice, often breaking new ground in the way the water sector approaches challenges such as catchment management and helping customers struggling to pay their bills through affordability schemes. Our consistent performance across a range of external ESG indices and rankings over that time has demonstrated our commitment to operating in a responsible manner.\n\nThis strong track record has provided a solid foundation upon which to evolve existing programmes, develop new initiatives, and respond to the changing world in which we operate.\n\n## Our approach\n\nWe focus on operating in a responsible manner throughout the organisation. This enables us to provide the best possible service to customers and ensures we are well placed to continue to create long-term, sustainable value for all stakeholders. This value comes from understanding what matters most to them and balancing these different perspectives in our decision-making. We are currently integrating six-capital thinking (manufactured, financial, natural, social, human and intellectual capital) into business processes as we believe this will better inform our\n\ndecision-making processes and enable us to create and protect value for all stakeholders. This includes how we might report publicly against these capitals.\n\nOur approach isn't just about what we do, but how we do it. Open, honest and transparent reporting has been at the core of our approach, underpinned by a clear purpose and strategic objectives.\n\nIncreasingly, stakeholders assess how companies approach responsible business through the lens of ESG. We believe there is a close relationship between ESG performance and investor value.\n\n## Demonstrating how we act responsibly and create value\n\nOur stakeholders are ultimately the ones who will judge whether we are delivering on our purpose so it is up to us to provide the evidence that we are providing great water and more for the North West. Having tangible, externally recognised measures of our behaviour and performance helps retain the trust of those who take an interest in the way we do business. It enables us to demonstrate that we are operating in our stakeholders' interests.\n\nWe collate, monitor and report on a wide range of performance measures, linked to what stakeholders tell us matter most, and align ourselves to recognised management standards and accreditations to give confidence in the way we are operating. We report these publicly so stakeholders can assess our progress. Read more about how we deliver value for our stakeholders on pages 52 to 75.\n\nAlongside this, we actively participate in a range of global ESG ratings, indices and frameworks to benchmark our approach against best practice and emerging sustainability challenges.

This is in response to increasing interest in how companies respond to sustainability challenges and growing expectations on how they disclose relevant information and data on their responsible business activities. For example, there is more interest in the disclosure of the ESG performance of companies and, last year, we published a summary of our ESG performance in More than Water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more on our website at\n\nunitedutilities.com/globalassets/z\\_corporate-site/cr-images/ cr-pdfs/stakeholder-esg-booklet-2021-final.pdf\n\nWe have evolved the way we report by presenting more ESG data alongside our financial reporting. We have looked to do this without making this report unnecessarily lengthy or difficult to read. We use our purpose-led approach as the framework to disclose performance and data for each of the stakeholders we create value for. Read more on pages 52 to 75. Many of the ESG indices in which we participate (see right-hand column) draw their data from this report.\n\nAs the reporting landscape develops further we will continue to adapt our reporting to take account of international best practice in the presentation of ESG performance and data.\n\nWe do recognise that some stakeholders prefer to have specific data provided in one place. The following indicates where further information on certain frameworks can be found:\n\n## World Economic Forum (WEF) International Business Council (IBC)\n\nThe WEF IBC has proposed a set of common metrics for the consistent reporting of sustainable value creation in mainstream annual reports.

As well as delivering a reliable service of great tasting water and removing wastewater, we proactively keep customers informed about any work we are doing in their area and communicate with them in ways that meet their individual needs. For example, we now use 'push texts' to send updates and alerts to customers within a specified location.\n\nThe best service to customers means being available when they need to contact us, always interacting in a friendly and helpful manner, and offering tailored support and assistance for customers when they need it. As well as these day-to-day interactions, it means consulting on what matters to them. This shapes what we do; for example, we redesigned our bills based on customer research and feedback.\n\n## In a responsible\n\n## manner\n\nWe will only deliver our purpose and create and maintain value for our stakeholders if we act in a responsible manner.\n\nThis means protecting and enhancing the natural environment, using natural solutions where possible, and reducing our carbon footprint and waste. It means promoting a safe, healthy and engaging workplace for our employees, supporting their physical and mental health. It drives us to support local communities on issues that matter to them, and to work with local schools and training facilities to promote skills for the future.\n\nAbove all, it means we are open, honest and transparent in our dealings and in reporting our performance.\n\n## OUR VISION\n\nWhat we want to achieve\n\n## To be the best UK water and wastewater company\n\nThis is what motivates us to improve our services and deliver more. To achieve this vision, our strategy has three themes - the best service to customers, at the lowest sustainable cost, in a responsible manner.\n\n## OUR STRATEGIC THEMES How we deliver our purpose and vision\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## At the lowest sustainable cost\n\nTo run a resilient business, it is important to ensure cost reductions are sustainable so that we can keep them down without compromising on resilience or the quality of service we deliver.\n\nWhen we develop our plans and assess different options, we look to minimise the whole-life cost. This fits with the total expenditure (totex) model, because the most cost-effective option can vary between traditional operating expenditure (opex) or capital expenditure (capex) solutions.\n\nOur Systems Thinking approach helps us look holistically at all options, and operating our entire network as a system rather than discrete assets opens up new avenues that otherwise would not have been available.\n\n## Our strategic themes run through everything we do\n\nHow we manage the water cycle, our risk assessment, and our remuneration policy are aligned to these strategic themes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our water cycle on pages 18 to 19\n\nRead more about on pages 100 to 109\n\n## Customer focused\n\nCustomers are at the heart of everything we do, and we aim to provide a great and resilient service at the most efficient cost.\n\nour risk management\n\nRead our remuneration report on pages 160 to 191\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OUR CORE VALUES AND CULTURE\n\n## Fundamental values that drive decision-making\n\n## Innovative\n\nWe continually look for new ways to make our services better, safer, faster and cheaper.\n\n## Trustworthy\n\nWe make promises knowingly and keep them, behaving with integrity towards all of our stakeholders.\n\n## Culture at United Utilities\n\nAs well as our purpose, strategy and core values, we monitor our culture against key categories relating to our people, such as engagement, health and wellbeing, diversity, and development.

        "page_content": "## Our business model - our key resources\n\nThe six capitals\n\n## Natural capital\n\n## Human capital\n\n## Manufactured capital\n\nWe rely on water sources, such as reservoirs, rivers and boreholes, from which abstraction licences permit us to take water in a safe and sustainable way to be treated and supplied to customers. We rely on natural watercourses to take wastewater back into the environment. We use bioresources from wastewater and break it down into biogas (which we use to generate renewable energy) and biosolids (which we treat to provide a high-quality fertiliser for farmers). We face risks from both severe dry weather, when we must manage resilience of water supply, and from severe rainfall, when we must cope with the risk of flooding.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nMuch of the water we abstract originates on land before running off into water. We are stewards of large areas of this land, much of which is managed by tenant farmers or in partnership. We ensure it is well managed to improve water quality and help protect habitats.\n\nWe plan and invest for the long term to ensure we have resilient water resources. In the short term, we can bring more supplies online to meet demand, and our integrated supply zone allows us to move water efficiently around the region. We also encourage customers to use water more efficiently with tips, free watersaving devices, and metering initiatives.\n\nWhen rainfall exceeds the capacity of sewers, storm overflows allow heavily diluted wastewater to be released directly to the environment to minimise the risk of sewer flooding in streets or people's homes. We now need to reduce the use of storm overflows, so we must find alternative ways to cope with excess surface water whilst avoiding flooding. Traditional interventions, such as storage tanks and enlarging sewers, are costly, carbon intensive and subject to space constraints. We are innovating with sustainable drainage and other naturebased solutions that use the urban and rural environment as part of the solution.\n\nWe manage the waste from our activities, including sludge, in a sustainable way, with the vast majority going to beneficial use such as recycling or fertiliser for land.\n\n## Link to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our principal risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWater service\n\nWastewater service\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRetail and commercial\n\nSupply chain and programme delivery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nResource\n\nOur people are essential in delivering services for customers. We believe the most effective decision-making comes from a diverse range of people who feel encouraged to share their views. Having a skilled, engaged and motivated team of employees, suppliers and contractors is fundamental to the performance we deliver and to employee retention, which helps ensure efficient training and better performance.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nWe support thousands of jobs in the North West, including graduate and apprenticeship programmes, helping to secure a legacy for the future in our region. We are an accredited Living Wage Foundation employer, providing our employees with competitive salaries and benefits, an attractive pension offering, and the opportunity to join the employee healthcare scheme and share incentive plan. We provide comprehensive training and development opportunities, including digital skills to help with our Systems Thinking approach, and enable remote working where practical.\n\nWe promote diversity, equality and inclusion, recruiting from all areas of the communities we serve and supporting our employees with equal opportunities. Employee networks, representing groups of employees that may face specific challenges, are overseen by an executive sponsor and support employees through their career progression.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about diversity and inclusion on pages 44 to 45\n\nWe are committed to protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of our people, and have been awarded the workplace wellbeing charter.\n\nWe measure employee engagement through an annual survey, and regularly achieve results higher than UK norms.\n\nWe monitor and measure employee performance through annual reviews. Employees at all levels of the company participate in the bonus scheme, with the same bonus performance measures as the executive directors, so everyone benefits from the success of the company.\n\n## Link to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur network assets and treatment works are essential to delivering our services for customers and protecting public health. Our energy assets enable us to generate renewable energy, which helps reduce costs and minimise our environmental impact. It is important we have the right systems and procedures in place to monitor and control our assets efficiently and effectively.\n\nMany of our assets are very long term in nature, such as our impounding reservoirs that can last hundreds of years. We must invest to maintain these assets in good condition so they can continue to provide for customers in the long term. We need to make improvements to ensure we can meet the needs of a growing population, and increasingly high quality standards and tighter environmental consents driven by our quality and environmental regulators.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nSince privatisation, the significant investment we have made in our assets has provided substantial benefits to customers, including reduced supply interruptions, reduced sewer flooding incidents, and improved water quality, and we expect to continue with a substantial investment programme for the foreseeable future as current environmental legislation is expected to drive significant investment needs.\n\nLong-term planning helps us understand where and when we need to invest in our assets, and we monitor the condition, performance and health of our assets.\n\nWe manage our assets in a holistic way that seeks to minimise whole-life costs, and we embrace new technology and innovation, which is at the heart of our Systems Thinking approach. This helps us deliver efficient total expenditure (totex) without compromising on quality of service or longterm resilience, saving future operating costs and reducing future customer bills.\n\nOur assets and infrastructure projects can affect people who live nearby. We consult with these communities in the planning stage and work hard to minimise any negative impact, including odours from our wastewater treatment works.\n\n## Link to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinance\n\nHealth, safety and environmental\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSecurity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConduct and compliance\n\nPolitical and regulatory\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is important that we are able to raise finance when needed to preserve adequate liquidity, and that we manage financial risks such as our exposure to movements in interest rates and inflation, to ensure we maintain long-term financial resilience.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nWe maintain a robust capital structure, with a responsible mix of equity and debt financing. We monitor our performance against key credit ratios to help us maintain strong and stable investment grade credit ratings, which gives us efficient access to debt capital markets across the economic cycle.\n\nWe maintain relationships with a range of banks and retain access to a broad and diverse range of sources of financing in a number of markets, across which we seek the best relative value when issuing new debt. We periodically refresh our medium-term note programme to enable efficient debt issuance under preagreed contractual terms, and the board delegates authority to the CFO, allowing us to respond quickly to attractive financing opportunities. This helps us to consistently raise efficient financing. Our sustainable finance framework allows us to raise debt based on our strong ESG credentials.\n\nWe aim to avoid a concentration of refinancing in any one year, and fund long term where possible. Our debt portfolio has a very long average life, and we monitor liquidity forecasts with a policy of having resources available to cover the next 15-24 months of projected cash flows to ensure forward funding needs are met. We have clear and transparent hedging policies covering credit, liquidity, interest rate, inflation and currency risk, and these are aligned with the regulatory model.\n\nLink to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe work with several capital delivery partners, often on large infrastructure projects that can span multiple years, and these partner organisations form part of the public face of our business. It is important that we build constructive working relationships with our supply chain partners to ensure the smooth delivery of projects and a good all-round service for customers.\n\nMaintaining positive relationships with other stakeholders is really important, such as regulators and community bodies across our region.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nWe have contracted for around 80 per cent of our base capital programme for the 2020-25 regulatory period, with arrangements in place for sharing of cost overruns to incentivise efficient delivery against the target price.\n\nOur supplier relationship management process ensures regular discussions between our commercial team and existing suppliers to help identify issues and opportunities for a smooth and productive relationship, and we engage suppliers on sustainable and ethical issues through our United Supply Chain (USC) approach.\n\nWe actively engage with all our stakeholders, including our regulators with whom we discuss short-term and longer-term priorities and objectives and respond to consultations so we are influencing where we are able to.\n\nOur stakeholder engagement extends to various environmental interest groups and community bodies, whom we keep informed, collaborate and in some instances form partnerships with.\n\nThis engagement helps us develop a matrix of the issues that are most material to stakeholders and to our ability to create value, and our assessment of these issues is a key part of our planning approach.\n\n- Read more about engaging with  our stakeholders on pages 30 to 33 and working in partnerships on page 55\n\nLink to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk exposure\n\nAn indication of the current exposure of each principal risk relative to the prior year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDecreased\n\nStable\n\nIncreased\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe knowledge and systems we have across our business are critical to effectively running our treatment works and maintaining our assets to ensure a long-term resilient service.\n\nIt is important that we keep up to date with new advances in technology. With a growing population, changing climate, finite resources and space constraints, we need to find innovative solutions to help us deliver the best service to customers, protect and enhance the environment, and keep bills affordable.\n\n## How we manage this key resource\n\nInnovation is one of our core values, and we use a variety of methods to find novel ideas and solutions - idea scouting, using ideas from other water companies across the world and from other industries. We invite companies to bring innovative solutions to us through our Innovation Lab programme, and we encourage innovation at all levels inside the business, including our CEO Challenge programme where our graduates work in groups to find novel ways to tackle challenges that we face as a business.\n\nThese initiatives are a source of fantastic new ideas and often lead to the development of products and software that give us a competitive advantage against our peers in the water industry. Occasionally, new ideas are worth protecting with copyrights, trademarks and patents, and we manage this intellectual property portfolio for short and long-term benefit.\n\nOur Systems Thinking approach involves remote monitoring and control, taking a 'whole system' view of our network and assets, and proactive and preventative optimisation to spot and resolve issues before they impact customers. This requires a network of systems and processes, and at the higher maturity levels we use artificial intelligence to optimise the way we operate. With sensors in our network sending real-time data to our Integrated Control Centre, we develop an understanding of the signature and can predict patterns that enable us to spot anomalies that could signal issues we can then proactively fix.\n\nLink to risks\n\n<!-- image -->",

RCV represents the net value of accumulated investment in the company's asset base. We serve over seven million people, with over three million household customers making up around two-thirds of our revenue, and over 200,000 businesses. In the non-household marketplace, we provide wholesale services to retailers.\n\nAs a monopoly provider of essential services, we are regulated by various bodies (as set out below), and we are subject to sector-specific legislation alongside this regulation.\n\nOur regulators assess our comparative operating performance against the other water and wastewater companies in England and Wales, with the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) assessing performance in water, the Environment Agency (EA) assessing performance in wastewater, and Ofwat assessing customer satisfaction. Both Ofwat's customer satisfaction assessment and the EA's annual performance assessment are included in our operational key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\nOfwat sets total revenues, service levels that must be provided, and the incentive package for companies for five-year periods, known as Asset Management Plan periods (AMPs).\n\n## Our regulators\n\nWe are subject to regulation of our price and performance by economic, quality and environmental regulators, as shown in the diagram.\n\nThese bodies exist to help protect the interests of customers and the environment, but they can have competing interests. For example, in agreeing environmental improvements and over what time frame these will be delivered, we must consider how much it will cost and the need to protect customers from bill shocks. Balancing these interests requires open and continuous dialogue.\n\nThese packages are based on Ofwat's methodology, which reflects stakeholder and customer priorities, and are confirmed following detailed scrutiny of business plans proposed by the companies. We must, therefore, engage constructively with Ofwat on future priorities and its methodology development and submit high-quality plans to help ensure we receive a determination that targets the best outcomes for us to continue creating value for customers and all our stakeholders, and effectively incentivises us to continue improving performance.\n\nTo ensure our plan is robust and balanced, we consult with customers and other stakeholders (including quality and environmental regulators) and factor in long-term planning and resilience needs.\n\nThis was the second year of AMP7, covering the 2020-25 period, and our focus has been on delivering and trying to outperform our final determination through:\n\n- \u00b7 achieving higher customer satisfaction than our peers;\n- \u00b7 beating the outcome delivery incentive (ODI) targets for operational performance;\n- \u00b7 delivering efficient total expenditure (totex); and\n- \u00b7 raising debt finance at a cost below the industry allowed cost of debt.\n\nOur vision is to be the best UK water and wastewater company, so we regularly benchmark our performance against our peers, and we benchmark our customer service performance against other leading service providers in our region.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSince privatisation, the water industry has invested a significant amount, contributing to improvements in public health and environmental standards, better quality of services, and superior quality drinking water. In its final determinations for AMP7, Ofwat allowed a further \u00a351 billion across the industry to deliver further improvements, and since this, Ofwat has allowed a further \u00a32.7 billion for green economic recovery.\n\n11\n\nlarge licensed water and wastewater companies\n\n## 2nd\n\nlargest waste and wastewater company in England and Wales\n\n## >\u00a350bn\n\nallowance across the industry to deliver further improvements over the 2020-25 period",

To achieve this, we're linking West Cumbria to our regional water network by building a major new pipeline from Thirlmere.\n\nCommunity involvement and stakeholder engagement have been at the heart of the strategy for West Cumbria. This is the single biggest project to go through the Lake District National Park in recent times and required a sector-leading approach to stakeholder management to ensure a success.\n\nEngagement with stakeholders began in 2013, allowing parties to come together and collaboratively formulate the plan. Core to our stakeholder approach was a planning performance agreement funded by us and created in conjunction with Natural England, the Environment Agency, the three local planning authorities, and Cumbria County Council. We submitted a planning application in January 2016 and in November 2016, four months ahead of schedule, all three local planning authorities voted unanimously to grant full planning permission.\n\nWe were clear from the outset that local communities and stakeholders would be encouraged to have their say on any plans, creating opportunities for communities to give their views. It was key that during planning and construction our stakeholders\n\nwere on the journey with us and could raise concerns easily. Engagement took many forms, from individual meetings to workshop events, as well as formal consultation and attendance at community events such as agricultural shows.\n\nCOVID-19 led to an urgent review of our engagement, as traditional face-to-face exhibitions could not take place. We developed a hybrid engagement plan unique to Cumbria, accounting for the geography and technology challenges across the county. A virtual consultation was developed alongside webinars with real-time, live chat functionality that proved a huge success. As lockdown eased, the virtual sessions were supplemented with a return to face-to-face meetings. The hybrid approach resulted in better overall engagement and will be considered on all future large projects.\n\nAs the project approaches completion, and we return the land back to how we found it, engagement continues. By the time the project is complete we will have attended over 150 parish council meetings and held 50 public exhibitions. Continuous engagement has helped minimise the impact that construction inevitably brings to local communities. We believe that this engagement, alongside community and woodland funds totalling over \u00a31 million, will leave a lasting legacy long after the pipeline is finished, benefiting people and communities across Cumbria for years to come.\n\nDelivering value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Define\n\nWe reviewed current best practice in materiality reporting. The assessment criteria for stakeholder interest and our ability to create value was confirmed. Building on our existing matrix we brought in more stakeholder views and evolved the matrix design. We committed to provide more detailed commentary on the most material issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Engage\n\nViews were obtained from across all our stakeholder groups. Insight from consultations and data was made available through the engagement processes described on pages 30 to 33. Key internal subject matter experts and stakeholder relationship managers provided further insight on issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 3. Assess\n\nComments and data were drawn together to form an initial view of the issues. The rationale for issue selection and its significance was presented to senior management for discussion. This included potential new issues, removal of issues and movement of existing issues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4. Align\n\nWe cross-referenced and aligned identified issues with our principal risks and uncertainties, as set out on pages 104 to 105. Matrix visuals were then created to easily communicate the prioritisation of issues. For the first time an indication of how issues have moved since the previous review has been included.\n\n## Our approach to materiality\n\nUnderstanding what matters most to our stakeholders is fundamental to being a purpose-driven organisation. We consider these stakeholder priorities alongside our own assessment of what has the biggest impact on the company and its ability to create value, and the output is presented in the material issues matrix.\n\nThis stakeholder materiality assessment informs decisions about what we report in documents such as this annual report. Setting out issues in this way helps ensure we understand key stakeholder priorities and consider their interests in strategic decision-making, helping us create long-term value.\n\nIn defining the strategic relevance of an issue to the company, we have adopted the integrated reporting framework definition of materiality, which states: 'a matter is material if it could substantively affect the organisation's ability to create value in the short, medium or long term'. Value, in this context, may be created internally (for the company and employees) and there can be external value (for customers, communities, investors, suppliers and the environment). Value may be financial or nonfinancial.\n\n## Our 2021/22 assessment\n\nThis year we carried out a thorough review of our material issues and matrix design.\n\nStriking the right balance between different interests and views is not easy but our assessment process consolidated feedback based on a balance of views obtained from all our stakeholders.\n\n## Material matters in 2021/22\n\nThe assessment process identified 28 material issues. More information about the most material issues can be found on the following pages. We describe the issue, provide our response to managing the issue, explain how the issue links to our strategic themes and how it is included in our plans for the future.\n\n## Materiality matrix\n\nIssues are plotted on the matrix from lower to higher in terms of level of interest to stakeholders and how much it can affect our ability to create value.\n\n## Independent review\n\nOur approach has been reviewed by responsible business consultancy Corporate Citizenship, which commented that 'United Utilities has set out the orderly, balanced and comprehensive process by which it has arrived at its refreshed materiality assessment. The detailed coverage of the six most material issues fosters public understanding. It sets out the links to strategic themes, risks and future actions. It shows how United Utilities recognises the most important issues and acts upon them'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUnited Utilities recognises the most important issues and acts upon them.'",

        "page_content": "## Our business model - our external drivers\n\nWhat matters most to our stakeholders\n\nUnderstanding and responding to the most material issues affecting our business is key to delivering our purpose. Addressing these issues over the short, medium and long term is an integral part of our strategic themes and risk management.\n\n## 1. Trust, transparency and legitimacy\n\n## Description\n\nStrong stakeholder relationships are based on trust. Being open, honest and transparent is key to building and maintaining trust and legitimacy. As well as reporting openly, this means setting out commitments and delivering on them. Our stakeholders want to know that we are treating employees fairly, protecting customer data, and paying our fair amount of tax.\n\nThe societal trend of mistrust in governments, and media, is crossing over into the corporate world. This has led to growing calls for companies to demonstrate how they are contributing to society as a whole and operating in the public interest.\n\nIn recent years, the UK water sector has faced challenges to its legitimacy, amplified by some specific issues at a small number of companies. Consequently, trust has been eroded and questions raised about the ownership structure of the sector, and Ofwat has called for further transparency and disclosure around board leadership and decision-making processes, as well as starting discussions on companies' contribution to public value.\n\n## Our response\n\nBeing open about our purpose and transparent about how we are delivering for all of our stakeholders is key to operating in a responsible manner.\n\nWe aim to maintain high ethical standards of business conduct and corporate governance. We apply the principles and report against the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Additional governance and assurance is applied to our regulatory reporting.\n\nWe have open and transparent reporting around all of our equity and debt financing arrangements, do not use offshore financing vehicles, and we have secured the Fair Tax Mark independent certification since 2019.\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive set of policies, linked to and including, human rights, modern slavery and whistleblowing.\n\nCybercrime has been on the increase and, as the holder of customer information, it is a threat we take very seriously through our policies and dedicated data protection team.\n\nWe work with suppliers and contractors whose principles, conduct and standards align with our own. Our key suppliers have committed to our United Supply Chain approach (read more on page 73). We are a signatory to the Prompt Payment Code, and fully comply with rules on reporting payments to suppliers.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe engage on a continual basis with customers to understand their expectations in relation to service and behaviour, through activities like our quarterly brand tracker.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe maintain stable credit ratings with key agencies, which helps us to retain efficient access to the debt capital markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe set qualitative and quantitative performance targets across all of our stakeholders to evidence how we are delivering on our purpose.\n\n## Future plans\n\nOperating in a responsible manner is a key driver of trust with our stakeholders. Our continued compliance with the corporate governance requirements of a listed company helps ensure the transparency of our reporting and behaviour. We will continue to use ESG indices as benchmarks of best practice to drive further improvements in transparency and disclosure.\n\nLink to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Resilience\n\n## Description\n\nResilience is a broad and interconnected topic that is of interest to many of our stakeholders. A resilient company will embed resilience throughout its operations, financing and corporate systems of governance and control. Providing essential services to customers requires long-term planning to manage future challenges, such as population growth and climate change, to ensure they are provided effectively to meet increasing expectations.\n\nLong-term financial resilience starts with a robust balance sheet and management of financial risks. Companies have to be aware of their own financial situation and make sure that they understand the financial resilience of others, such as suppliers and former employees.\n\nAs the world becomes increasingly digital, companies need to have the right people and skills to manage in the modern world. Increasingly, stakeholders are interested in the ability of an organisation's governance, accountability and assurance processes to help avoid, cope with and recover from disruption and to anticipate trends and variability in all aspects of their business.\n\n## Our response\n\nIt can take many years and require substantial investment to increase the resilience of existing assets or build new ones, which is why our long-term planning is so important. We have detailed plans in place to anticipate future challenges and understand what we need to do to address these. We build these needs into our business plans for each five-year regulatory period to anticipate the future funding we need to allocate in order to act at the right time. Our Systems Thinking approach provides opportunities for us to increase our operational resilience further.\n\nWe have a strong balance sheet, a secure pension position, and take a prudent approach to financial risk management, which delivers long-term predictability and resilience to financial shocks. As a public listed company, we consistently adhere to the highest",

Customer service and operational performance\n\n## Description\n\nIn an increasingly digitised and instant economy, customers expect more from services than ever before. This includes the water sector, with high expectations for the reliability and responsiveness of services.\n\nSince the pandemic, more people have come to appreciate the environment and there is increasing stakeholder focus on the operational performance of companies that rely and impact on the environment.\n\nEnsuring a reliable service in the face of a growing population, changing climate and increasing expectations of service requires integrated long-term thinking and targeted investment to ensure both short and longer-term reliability.\n\nMany of our assets are ageing compared to other utilities. To meet the expectations of customers and regulators, it is critical that we combine modern technology into our networks and management of customer service.\n\n## Our response\n\nTo provide great water and more is reliant on delivering good operational and customer performance. Our pollution incident reduction plan and reinvestment of regulatory outperformance has improved our environmental performance.\n\nWe have improved customer service provision through both traditional and digital channels, measuring ourselves against key external benchmarks such as securing the Institute of Customer Service accreditation with distinction. This is alongside making new services available to customers, such as 'Get Water Fit' which is helping over 95,000 customers learn more about their water usage.\n\nOur culture of innovation and Systems Thinking drives us to adapt our assets and the way we operate to use modern technology and the best new ways of working. Examples include sensors across our network that allow remote monitoring and control from our Integrated Control Centre, and our fleet of alternative supply vehicles (ASVs) that can inject treated water directly into supply while we undertake repairs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe monitor the performance and health of our assets, with the help of sensors across the network, and this allows us to be proactive. For example, by monitoring pressure in the water network we can spot issues and fix them before we get a burst, saving costs and sparing customers the impact.\n\nWe have a substantially enhanced social media presence to respond quickly to stakeholders. Over one million customers now engage with us digitally, whether this is through our website, our mobile app or on social media.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Systems Thinking approach is delivering operational excellence - benefiting customers and the environment.\n\nWe balance our capital and maintenance expenditure to ensure affordability and reliability over the short, medium and long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Better Rivers: Better North West commitments and additional \u00a365 million investment in our Green Recovery proposals will deliver improvements for customers and the environment by 2025.\n\n## Future plans\n\nWider deployment of Systems Thinking, for instance through Dynamic Network Management (read more on page 43), will deliver further improvements in the reliability of services. We have a number of challenging targets for the 2020-25 period that will help improve the reliability of our services, including helping and encouraging customers to use less water.\n\nLink to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConduct and compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPolitical and regulatory\n\n<!-- image -->",

Climate change\n\n## Description\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions and how they are affecting the earth's climate is important to many stakeholders. There is a growing expectation on companies, across all sectors, to take action to reduce their carbon emissions and to adapt to the impacts of climate change.\n\nWeather is fundamental to the delivery of water and wastewater services, and so climate change will always be of strategic and operational importance to the water sector and its stakeholders.\n\nAlready, we are seeing the effects of climate change on the North West's weather, with increasing summer temperatures, wetter winters and more extreme rainfall events. With these trends set to continue, unless we take action there will be increasing impact on the services we provide to the communities we serve.\n\nCompanies must plan well into the future to understand what changes are likely to occur, and continually adapt to meet the risks and opportunities this presents.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur response to climate change risk involves mitigation (minimising our greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (ensuring our services are resilient to a changing climate). Where practical, we generate renewable energy on our sites through solar panels, wind turbines, and the use of bioresources at wastewater treatment works, helping to reduce our emissions. We have reduced our carbon footprint considerably since 2005/06 and have set ambitious science-based targets as part of our continued efforts to reduce emissions. We have committed to six pledges to help us achieve significant further reductions in emissions and from this year the long-term incentive outcomes for our executives will be linked to these.\n\nWe have detailed plans that set out how we will adapt our services to meet the challenges of climate change such as the 25-year Water Resources Management Plan, and we are targeting a 15 per cent reduction in leakage over AMP7, one of our actions to address the risk of water sufficiency events.\n\nWe work with third parties to encourage sustainable drainage solutions to help cope with surface water in periods of heavy rain and are finalising a Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan with key authorities across the region.\n\nWe have reported against the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures for the past three years to provide transparency of our approach.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe help customers use less water, with advice and free water saving gadgets, saving them money and water.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGenerating our own renewable energy helps to reduce our reliance on purchasing energy and, therefore, saves costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur six carbon pledges, including science-based targets covering all of our emissions, demonstrate our commitment to reducing our footprint.\n\n## Future plans\n\nWe have a detailed 25-year Water Resources Management Plan, a Drought Plan, and we published our third adaptation report in 2021 setting out how we aim to adapt to meet the challenges of climate change.

Political and regulatory environment\n\n## Description\n\nThe UK Government's current goal is to be the first generation to leave the environment in a better state than we found it. The Environment Act, which became law in 2021, includes commitments to improve water management, and the water sector has a leading role to play to implement its requirements. This could drive significant increases in investment in the future which will need to be balanced with customer affordability.\n\nEnvironmental and quality regulators set stringent consents for water company activities to ensure the environment and water quality is protected. In meeting these obligations, companies need to work hard to maintain compliance. This requires striking a balance with other environmental impacts, such as the use of natural resources and emissions of greenhouse gases. Read more about our regulators on page 27.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe welcome the Environment Act and the inclusion of aspects relating to storm overflows. Many of our Better Rivers: Better North West pledges will be delivered over the next three years, including investment in wastewater systems, enhanced data monitoring and sharing, greater innovation and more use of nature-based solutions. Read more about Better Rivers: Better North West on page 67.\n\nThe Environment Agency assesses water companies' performance across a basket of measures, and we are one of the best-performing companies over the last five years. Our regulatory framework shapes the way we manage natural resources and our interaction with the environment, and we work with our environmental regulators to agree long-term plans.\n\nAlongside this, we need to deliver other core regulatory obligations - such as those set out by Ofwat - and compliance with ever increasing drinking water quality standards. This year we launched our Water Quality First programme with",

Affordability and vulnerability\n\n## Description\n\nThe socioeconomic situation in the UK remains challenging. Many people across the region are facing real challenges as we emerge from a global pandemic and are faced with significant rises in the cost of living, so water poverty continues to be an important issue.\n\nMaintaining trust and confidence in the sector in the years ahead will be crucial. The North West already suffers high levels of acute deprivation with twelve per cent of households affected by water poverty, higher than the national average. Research indicates that many customers who struggle with water charges are behind on other bills and many have a pay-day loan.\n\nOur stakeholders are interested in how we provide support for customers in vulnerable circumstances beyond just financial distress, such as disability, first language not being English, or temporary vulnerability brought on by illness or a life event.\n\n## Our response\n\nOur industry-leading approach to collections and innovative affordability offerings have enabled us to respond to the pandemic and the emerging cost of living crisis. The temporary extension to the social tariff we secured at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to support those customers most affected has now been made permanent, so we have an additional \u00a315 million of support available per annum for each of the remaining years of AMP7.\n\nWe have the sector's widest range of affordability and vulnerability schemes. Through these schemes over 77,000 customers were lifted out of water poverty over the past two years. Our extensive affordability schemes are providing \u00a3280 million of support over AMP7.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe led the sector in establishing our Priority Services scheme, with dedicated teams providing additional support to customers with physical, mental health, or financial difficulties during an incident. This scheme is accredited by the British Standards Institute and over 150,000 customers are now registered for this support, with more joining every day.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will continue to invest in our assets and people to meet the stretching customer support targets in our regulatory contract.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are the first UK utility company to harness real-time open banking as part of our processes to verify customer eligibility for reducedrate social tariffs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBacking the Consumer Council for Water's drive to launch a national social tariff.\n\n## Future plans\n\nWe will continue to provide substantial affordability assistance through support tariffs and other forms of support, while extending our Priority Services offering to over 210,000 customers by 2025, improving the quality and scale of the support we provide.\n\n## Link to risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConduct and compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 10 Political and regulatory\n\n<!-- image -->",

Under DPC the CAP* will be responsible for the detailed design and build of the project and, crucially, for securing the project finance. The CAP will also be responsible for maintaining and inspecting the new tunnels for a period of 25 years post construction. In November 2020, the replacement of the Hallbank section of the aqueduct was successfully completed by UUW, which was delivered via a traditional approach working with a design and build contractor.\n\n## How we engaged with stakeholders\n\nOur regulator, Ofwat, has introduced the new DPC approach for companies to consider when delivering large infrastructure projects. (More information on the DPC approach can be found on Ofwat's website.) Ofwat 'believe that by outsourcing the delivery of infrastructure projects using DPC, water companies can achieve significant benefits for customers. This includes both through innovation and lower whole life costs of the project'.

United Utilities is an organisation where, pre-pandemic, the majority of our employees routinely travelled to work on a daily basis to attend one of the group's offices or sites. As the pandemic progressed, the need to evolve our ways of working to face the future became evident. The board was fully involved in the development of the group's next ways of working, including the pilot project prior to rolling out the hybrid way of working for roles which fulfilled specific criteria within the organisation.\n\n## How we engaged with stakeholders\n\nWeekly online webinars were established during the early stages of the pandemic in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhas been working with Ofwat on developing the detail of the DPC approach for this complex project since proposing the delivery of HARP via DPC in its AMP7 business plan.\n\nIn developing this project, we have sought customers' views and worked with their representatives through YourVoice to develop a solution to balance risk reduction and the cost of delivery. We have completed initial design work and submitted all planning applications taking into account impacts on local communities and the environment, and have sought to minimise this as much as possible.  We have actively engaged stakeholders through the planning process, undertaking extensive public engagement including an innovative 'virtual public exhibition' when face-to-face interactions were restricted due to the pandemic. We have also completed environmental impact assessments and are seeking a ten per cent biodiversity net gain from the project.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at ofwat.gov.uk/ regulated-companies/markets/directprocurement/direct-procurement-forcustomers/\n\n## The board's view\n\nThe aqueduct is a critical asset in being able to deliver our purpose to provide great water and more for the North West. It is a major part of our water supply network serving our customers in parts of Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester. The board does not underestimate the complexities of the project to replace six sections of tunnel in some remote stretches of countryside and with sections of the tunnel at a depth of up to 370 metres. As well as the technical challenges, the complexities of the new and untested DPC approach have added to the challenge of a\n\norder to communicate with line managers prior to the cascade of information to their teams, and with these resources being made available to all employees via the intranet. Our Employee Voice panel has been a valuable mechanism for employees to provide feedback, particularly on how they felt they have been supported during the pandemic. Over 1,000 employees, including those based out in the field or at one of our many operational sites, provided their views, which were taken into account when formulating the plans for our next ways of working. Feedback from the teams involved in the pilot project have helped shape our current approach to hybrid working.\n\n## The board's view\n\nOur employees are fundamental to fulfilling our purpose of providing great water and more for the North West. We have seen a number of positive benefits relating to work during the pandemic including: reductions in employee sickness absences; improvements in engagement and wellbeing; improvements in\n\n## Statement by the directors in performance of their statutory duties in accordance with S172(1) Companies Act 2006\n\nThe board of directors of United Utilities Group PLC consider, both individually and together, that they have acted in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole and having regard (amongst other matters) to factors (a) to (f) s172 Companies Act 2006, in the decisions taken during the year ended 31 March 2022 including:\n\nproject estimated to require investment of over \u00a31 billion and take circa 9-10 years to complete.\n\nThe board has been kept fully apprised of progress at key stages of the project through regular presentations at board meetings, 'deep-dive' sessions and as part of strategy discussions.\n\nThe board approved the submission of the Outline Business Case to Ofwat under DPC having evaluated and considered the DPC approach and identified, and sought to mitigate as far as possible, the known and likely risks associated with the DPC approach. The board is cognisant of the many challenges ahead including amongst other things: the appointment of the CAP through a new DPC tender process, the implications for the group of the different commercial construct and financing of the project, and the critical nature of the aqueduct to the business.\n\nUnder the current circumstances, the board considers that the DPC delivery approach has the potential to be most likely to promote the long-term success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. This is based on the information currently available, which suggests that the DPC route has the potential to offer the best value for customers and, therefore, supports the position that this should be tested through the market through progressing HARP through a DPC procurement process.\n\nIn April 2022, Ofwat gave its consent for UUW to procure HARP through a DPC procurement process under Condition U of its licence.\n\n- *  CAP means a limited company which has been competitively appointed to be the provider in accordance with a DPC Procurement Process in respect of a DPC Delivered Project.\n\noperational performance; and reduced travel costs and carbon emissions. Increased hybrid working provides opportunities including: the ability to attract employees from a wider and potentially more diverse talent pool; being the catalyst to improve our digital capabilities and in time shape the workplace of the future; and potentially make savings on accommodation.\n\nOur plans have seen 2,000 employees adopting hybrid ways of working. In terms of the non-hybrid roles which are typically directly supporting our customers and critical operations, we are continuing to look at providing additional flexible opportunities and changing workplace practices to retain, attract and stay aligned to the employment market. The board concluded that the incorporation of a hybrid way of working alongside the traditional approach would be most likely to promote the long-term success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. This way of working will be monitored closely to ensure it remains efficient and effective.",

We have written to all our stakeholders including the EA, Ofwat, The Consumer Council for Water and MPs in our region. We announced that we would be launching a community fund to support local rivers initiatives, work alongside The Rivers Trust, RSPB and local authorities to deliver projects, and launch a new partnership to protect watercourses with farmers to incentivise farming practices that reduce impact to river health.\n\n## The board's view\n\nThe group has co-operated fully with the EA/ Ofwat investigation. The board is cognisant that United Utilities needs to do more to play its part in improving river health in the North West, and amongst other things, we will:\n\n- \u00b7 aim to publish investigations and plans for all overflows that operate frequently;\n- \u00b7 ensure all storm overflows are monitored by 2023;\n- \u00b7 aim to provide near real-time data when an overflow operates and ensure this data is easily accessible by 2023;\n- \u00b7 aim to deliver a significant reduction in impact caused by storm overflows and sewage treatment works by 2030; and\n- \u00b7 aim for there to be no serious pollution incidents from our assets.\n\nThe board, in committing to playing its part in improving river health, believes this would be most likely to promote the long-term success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole.\n\n## Non-financial information statement\n\nThe table below constitutes the company's non-financial information statement, produced to comply with sections 414CA(1) and 414CB(1) of the Companies Act 2006.

This creates long-term value, improving our asset reliability and resilience, reducing unplanned service interruptions, and delivering cost savings.\n\n## Systems Thinking capability maturity\n\nWe assess new opportunities against five capability maturity levels.\n\nAt the lower levels there is a high degree of human intervention and reactive behaviour.\n\nAt the higher levels there is a high degree of predictive analytics, use of artificial intelligence to process vast amounts of data, joined up decision-making across the system, and higher levels of automation.\n\nIt requires time and investment to reach the higher levels, and we are at different levels in different areas of our business as we continue to embed and progress our approach.\n\nHuman-driv en, r eactiv e behavio ur\n\nP r edictiv e analy tics, pr oactiv e management of net w ork\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Maturity level 1\n\nEvent-led human-driven analytics\n\n## Maturity level 2\n\nCentralised view of system performance\n\n## Maturity level 3\n\nTechnology-enabled, standardised analytics and insight\n\n## Maturity level 4\n\nMachine-led system analytics and system management\n\n## Maturity level 5\n\nMachine intelligence provides full system control\n\n## Central system management from our Integrated Control Centre\n\nSystems Thinking involves looking at the entire system and all of its linkages, rather than individual assets or sites in isolation, to find the best all-round solutions. Our digital backbone sends vast amounts of real-time data to our Integrated Control Centre (ICC), from which we plan, monitor and control our operations. We also factor in other source data such as weather forecasts and customer demand, and at the higher capability maturity levels we use artificial intelligence and machinelearning to identify trends and anomalies that could signal potential issues.\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are certain places along the network where incidents such as blockages, flooding and pollution are more prone to occur, and many incidents are not traditionally detected until they are experienced first-hand by customers. Our goal was to create a smarter network - one that allows us to truly understand how our drainage systems perform.\n\nTo help reduce the risks of flooding and pollution, over 20,000 digital sensors are being installed in manholes across the expansive sewer network, and also at a large number of pumping stations. The sensors identify when the sewer network flow is not operating as usual for that particular part of the network, or if a pumping station is not working as it should. The sensors send an alert back to a central system, meaning we can respond in real time to any deviation in performance, identifying and resolving issues before they impact customers or the environment.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) we use has a neural network that learns trends in the system, predicting future behaviour of the assets, as well as current activity. It identifies patterns in customer behaviour, for example, or in river levels as a response to rainfall, and allows us to predict where and when bigger problems might develop.\n\nNetwork business manager, Sam Sloan, said: 'The programme's combination of artificial intelligence and machine-learning puts us in a leading position when it comes to Systems Thinking. We're harnessing data on a huge scale across a large region, and combining that with the advancements in AI to really understand that complete system.'\n\nWe have already installed over 10,000 of the digital sensors, and the data produced by this system means we are finding and fixing issues within the sewer system before they cause an incident. As a result, our customers have seen a year-on-year reduction in internal flooding of a third in this last year with our performance significantly ahead of the original target we set ourselves.\n\n## Delivering value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnvironment\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have completed a further maturity audit with our specialist inclusion partner, the Clear Company, who has independently measured progress against our plans and recognised our strong focus on education.\n\nWe again ranked in the top 1 per cent of over 850 companies across Europe in the Financial Times' Statista Survey for Diversity and Inclusion Leadership, and were the leading utility company in the Top 50 Inclusive UK Employers Index. We have been included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 2022, showing our commitment to more equal and inclusive workplaces.\n\n## Ethnicity\n\nWe continue to build on our diversity data, collecting information as part of our ongoing processes. We launched our first diversity survey, with over 2,000 employees sharing data about themselves beyond their role. The percentage of employees who choose not to disclose their ethnic origin has decreased from 15 per cent to 9 per cent. We have moved from 2.5 per cent of our workforce identifying as from an ethnic background to 2.7 per cent.\n\nWe have become a patron member of the BAME Apprenticeship Alliance and have an active multicultural network that supports colleagues and educates the wider workforce on cultural differences. Our drive to build an inclusive culture has seen us focus on educating, raising awareness, and celebrating cultural events. We recruited 25 university students onto the 10,000 Black Interns programme, and have committed to offering 120 placements over the next five years.\n\nWe have put efforts into developing a diverse leadership pipeline by introducing a new talent programme for employees from ethnic minority backgrounds, giving them the opportunity to develop personal and leadership skills that will help them fast-track their careers with us.\n\nWe've made good progress in recruiting apprentices from more diverse backgrounds, with 16 per cent of new apprentices this year from an ethnic minority background. This is a positive result against a backdrop of low attrition levels, regional variations in ethnic diversity, and difficulties attracting females for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) roles.\n\n## Gender\n\nOur workforce profile remains static at 66 per cent male and 34 per cent female. We recognise the need to attract diverse and talented individuals with an interest in STEM\n\nand have a focused approach to improving the gender diversity of our workforce. To help us inspire young people into STEM careers, we continue to run our 'Engineering your future' competition with secondary schools from the local area, working closely with our apprentice ambassador, Warrington Wolves women's rugby captain Michelle Davis. Sixty per cent of participants are female.\n\nWe have strong female role models succeeding at all levels of the organisation, including the board, executive leadership team, and key operational roles. Sixty-two per cent of all senior leader vacancies this year were filled by females. We offer targeted support for future female talent through our Female Leadership Pipeline and Aspiring Manager Programme. Sixty-four per cent of employees currently on our Aspiring Manager Programme are female.\n\nIn the last 12 months, we have welcomed 26 graduates onto our schemes, and 51 apprentices have joined us on operational, service and future-facing digital and environmental schemes. Thirty-seven per cent of new apprentices and 36 per cent of new graduates are female, higher than the UK average of 24 per cent females in STEM roles.\n\nWe are proud that 96 per cent of our current female workforce would recommend us as an employer and 92 per cent of female employees say that we support diversity and inclusion in the workplace.\n\n## Gender pay reporting (from the 2021 gender pay report)\n\n(2)\n\n## Our median gender pay gap over the last five years\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2021 | 14.7%   |\n|--------|---------|\n|   2020 | 15.3%   |\n|   2019 | 13.8%   |\n|   2018 | 15.3%   |\n|   2017 | 15.9%   |\n\n## Our mean gender bonus gap over time\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPercentage of women and men overall and in each quartile of the pay range (figures for 2021 and 2020)\n\n|   2021 | 8.1%   |\n|--------|--------|\n|   2020 | 10.7%  |\n|   2019 | 11.3%  |\n|   2018 | 13.2%  |\n|   2017 | 13.1%  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Upper        | Upper        |\n|--------------|--------------|\n| 30% 2021     | 70%          |\n| 30% 2020     | 70%          |\n| Upper middle | Upper middle |\n| 23% 2021     | 77%          |\n| 21% 2020     | 79%          |\n| Lower middle | Lower middle |\n| 32% 2021     | 68%          |\n| 33% 2020     | 67%          |\n| Lower        | Lower        |\n| 48% 2021     | 52%          |\n| 49% 2020     | 51%          |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(2)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Group board as at 31 March 2022.\n- (2) Executive team excludes CEO and CFO, who are included in group board figures.\n- (3) As at 31 March 2022, there were eight male and three female employees appointed as statutory directors of subsidiary group companies but who do not fulfil the Companies Act 2006 definition of 'senior managers'.\n- (4) Wider employees as at 31 March 2022.\n\nWe're making good progress in reducing our gender pay gap and gender bonus gap, continuing a positive downward trend over the last five years.

Executive team (2) Executive team\n\nOur mean gender pay gap has reduced significantly since 2017, mainly due to an increase in the number of women progressing into more senior roles within the company and the success of our talent management programmes.

This is mainly due to more women than men being promoted into higher-paid roles as a result of our talent management programme, which has helped to reduce the pay gap. However, there is still more work for us to do, for example in our main operational roles, where it is more difficult to achieve a gender split that is representative. 4 4 7 3 4 4 4 7 3 4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n19\n\n19",

One hundred per cent of attendees now think United Utilities is a diverse and inclusive employer and 76 per cent said they were extremely interested in applying for an apprenticeship after completing the programme.\n\nWe successfully implemented an awardwinning engineering masterclass, with around 300 students having been taken through the curriculum, inspiring the next generation of diverse students from disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue a STEM-related career.\n\n## Armed Forces\n\nWe were proud to again achieve the Ministry of Defence's Employer Recognition Scheme Gold Award, the highest level of recognition for commitment to supporting the Armed Forces community, and have become one of the first companies to be reaccredited. The accolade is awarded to companies that can demonstrate considerable commitments and 'forces-friendly' action, including signing the Armed Forces Covenant, making necessary adjustments to HR policies, and fostering a more inclusive work culture for Armed Forces personnel, past and present.\n\n## Our inclusion plan\n\n## Inclusive leadership\n\nWith workshops, masterclasses, and talks on inspirational topics from external speakers, we're leading a fresh approach to diversity and inclusion.\n\n## Encouraging openness\n\nWe launched our 'About Me' campaign to find out more about our employees' needs and improve our employee records.\n\n## Improving our policies\n\nWe have a number of policies in place to support our employees in achieving the balance between home and work life, with enhanced family-friendly leave options and maternity benefits that are better than those required by UK law.\n\n## Increasing awareness\n\nOur 'We are better together' video shows our employees that we want to create and maintain a working environment where we value and respect one another's unique contribution.\n\n## Supporting inclusion\n\nThrough our gender equality network we've been focusing on normalising some tricky conversations.\n\n34% of our employees are female and 25% of these are in STEM roles\n\n41% of our graduates and 27% of our apprentices are female\n\n15% of our graduates and 13% of our apprentices have told us they have a disability or learning difficulty",

We review this information as part of our long-term planning and risk management processes.\n\nOver the next 25+ years we have identified many challenges and opportunities that we are likely to be faced with, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change;\n- \u00b7 Population growth;\n- \u00b7 A more open, competitive market;\n- \u00b7 Water trading;\n- \u00b7 More stringent environmental regulations;\n- \u00b7 Developments in technology; and\n- \u00b7 Combining affordable bills with a modern, responsive service.\n\nThere is a section of our website dealing with our future plans, where we examine these challenges and how we will focus our resources and talents to meet them.\n\nOur 25-year Water Resources Management Plan (WRMP) covering the 2020-45 period, was developed and published in 2019 following consultation with stakeholders. We will publish our new WRMP in 2024 covering the next period.\n\nOur approach to long-term planning ensures we are responding to challenges and opportunities that may arise far into the future.\n\nOur last Drought Plan was published in 2018. We have a new draft on which we have consulted with stakeholders, and the final plan will be made available on our website once approved by Defra and the Environment Agency.\n\nWe will publish a Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan (DWMP) for the first time in 2024, and more information will be made available on our website as we launch this.\n\nThese long-term plans set out the investment needed to ensure we have sufficient water to continue supplying our customers, taking into account the potential impact of climate change, the actions we will take to manage the risk of a drought, and the risks around flooding, pollution, storm overflows, and wastewater treatment.\n\nWe create long-term value for stakeholders by:\n\n- \u00b7 Systems Thinking and innovation;\n- \u00b7 long-term planning and responding to challenges and opportunities;\n- \u00b7 sustainable catchment management;\n- \u00b7 disciplined investment, based on a sustainable whole-life cost modelling approach, to ensure the resilience of our assets and network;\n- \u00b7 investing in our employees to maintain a skilled, healthy and motivated workforce;\n- \u00b7 close collaboration with suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 maintaining a robust and appropriate mix of debt and equity financing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at unitedutilities.com/ corporate/about-us/our-future-plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe majority of the group's activities sit within our regulated water and wastewater business, therefore, our medium-term planning predominantly sets out how we will deliver against the final determination (FD) we receive from Ofwat for each five-year period. Historically, we have submitted business plans which were focused mainly on the subsequent five-year asset management plan (AMP) period, while providing a high level view of the following AMP. This provided medium-term planning visibility of between five and ten years at any one point in time, although Ofwat is proposing a longer-term planning approach for the next business plan submission in 2023.\n\nIt is important that our plans deliver for all stakeholders including customer preferences and environmental requirements. We, therefore, align our plans to these priorities in line with key published methodologies in order to deliver the best overall approach to stakeholder value.\n\nOur business plans are designed to help us work towards our long-term plans, build and maintain resilience, and ultimately fulfil our purpose. We engage in extensive research to ensure the plans we put forward are robust and balanced, targeting the best overall outcomes for all our stakeholders.\n\nFollowing scrutiny and challenge from Ofwat, we receive the final determination (FD), which sets the price (in terms of total expenditure and customer bills), level of service, and incentive package that we must deliver over the five-year period, and an allowed return we can earn.",

Since 2015, we have published an annual performance report (APR), which reports our regulatory performance in a format that helps customers and other stakeholders understand it and compare it with other companies in the sector. This includes reporting of Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE), which comprises the base allowed return and any out/ underperformance, on an annual and cumulative basis for each AMP.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur APR is published in July each year at unitedutilities.com/corporate/about-us/ performance/annual-performancereport\n\nInformation on companies' regulatory performance can be found at discoverwater.co.uk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Short-term planning\n\nShort-term planning helps us work towards our medium and long-term goals and provides us with measurable targets so that we can continually monitor and assess our progress, which helps us ensure the long-term resilience and sustainability of our business.\n\nBefore the start of each financial year, which runs from 1 April to 31 March, we develop a business plan for that year, and this is reviewed and approved by the board. This business plan sets our annual targets, which are designed to help deliver further improvements in service delivery and efficiency, and to help move us towards achievement of our five-year and longer-term goals.\n\nPerformance against these annual targets determines the annual bonus percentage that is awarded. Executive directors and employees right through the organisation are remunerated against these same bonus targets.\n\nAs well as these annual bonus targets, in order to avoid encouragement of short-term decision-making and ensure management is focused on the long-term performance of the company, executive directors are remunerated through long-term incentive plans (LTP). The LTP assesses three-year performance, and is measured during the 2020-25 period through RoRE and a basket of customer measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee details of the annual bonus and Long Term Plan arrangements on pages 178 to 182\n\nIn the short term we set annual, measurable targets, but we retain flexibility to enable us to respond to challenges that may arise.\n\nThe executive directors hold quarterly business review meetings with senior managers across the business to monitor and assess performance against our annual targets, helping to ensure that we are on track to deliver our targets for the year, and longer term.\n\nIt is vital that we retain flexibility within this short-term planning so we can adapt to meet challenges that may arise during each year, and deliver high-quality and resilient services to customers in the most effective and cost-efficient way possible. This may involve bringing enhancements forward to deliver improvements for customers early, investing further into the business to maintain service, or delaying projects to occur later in the regulatory period in order to prioritise expenditure and allow our people to spend their time dealing with any unexpected challenges that arise.\n\nThe challenges presented by COVID-19 were a clear example of why this flexibility is crucial. We enacted our robust contingency plans, enabling us to quickly and efficiently move thousands of our people to home working and introduce additional safeguarding measures for those that remained on sites or in the field, while maintaining reliable water and wastewater services that were especially critical for public health at this time.",

These are unchanged from last year.\n\nBonuses (for executive directors and employees right through the business) and long-term incentives for executive directors, are closely aligned to many of our operational and financial KPIs.\n\n## Operational KPIs\n\nOur purpose drives us to create longterm value for all our stakeholders, and we report against one operational KPI for each of the six stakeholders for whom we create value. More detail on these operational KPIs, including our targets and performance this year, can be seen on pages 8 to 9.\n\n## Financial KPIs\n\nWe have selected financial KPIs that assess both profitability and sustainability of our business from a financial perspective.\n\nMore detail on these financial KPIs, including our targets and performance this year, can be seen on pages 10 to 11.\n\nOur six operational KPIs are by no means the only metrics by which we monitor and assess our performance. We report against many other metrics both internally and externally. As discussed on pages 29 to 33, our stakeholder engagement gives us a view of what matters most to them. We report on a selection of other metrics on pages 52 to 75 of this report, based on the measures shown to be of highest interest to our stakeholders.\n\nFor example, on performance for customers, our KPI is Ofwat's measure of customer experience, C-MeX, but on page 58 we report on Ofwat's measure of developer satisfaction, D-MeX, the level of customer complaints, vulnerability support, customers lifted out of water poverty, and the impact of water efficiency measures.\n\nWe regularly report on numerous corporate responsibility performance measures on our external website as detailed on page 50.\n\nAll these performance indicators have received an appropriate level of assurance, such as independent third-party verification, regulatory reporting assurance processes, or through our own internal audit team.\n\n## Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE)\n\nReturn on regulatory equity (RoRE) measures the regulatory returns (after tax and interest) that companies have earned by reference to the notional regulated equity (which is calculated as 40 per cent of the regulatory capital value (RCV), while the other 60 per cent of the RCV is notional net debt).\n\nRoRE comprises a base allowed return, which is set by Ofwat, plus or minus any out or under performance earned. It is reported on an annual and cumulative basis throughout the AMP.\n\nAs well as being a key regulatory measure, RoRE is one of our operational KPIs and is linked to executive remuneration through its inclusion in the Long Term Plan.\n\nThe three key areas through which we can earn a higher RoRE are:\n\n- \u00b7 delivering efficiency savings versus our cost allowance (total expenditure (totex) outperformance);\n- \u00b7 earning outperformance payments for service delivery against our performance commitments (customer outcome delivery incentive (ODI) rewards); and\n- \u00b7 raising finance at a lower cost than the industry allowed cost of debt (financing outperformance).\n\nRoRE can also be higher or lower as a result of the outturn tax position versus the allowance.\n\nPerformance against our regulatory contract is monitored and assessed each year, and reported within the annual performance report (APR), as required by our economic regulator Ofwat.\n\nWe cover several regulatory performance measures within this report. Our APR provides more details, as well as further narrative, about our regulatory performance during the year.\n\nThere is financial information contained within the APR. This relates only to the regulated company, United Utilities Water Limited, and its appointed activities, and is calculated in accordance with the regulatory accounting framework. This differs from IFRS reporting, and a reconciliation to IFRS reporting is provided in the APR. For the purposes of clarification, our financial KPIs relate to our performance at the group level, and are calculated within the definitions given in this report.\n\nOur APRs for previous years are available on our external website, and the APR for 2021/22 will be published in July 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur annual\n\nperformance reports can be viewed on our website at unitedutilities.com/ corporate/about-us/ performance/annualperformance-report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe main areas that could detract from RoRE, therefore, are:\n\n- \u00b7 overspending versus our total cost allowance (totex underperformance);\n- \u00b7 incurring underperformance payments for failure to meet our performance commitments (customer ODI penalties); and\n- \u00b7 incurring higher finance costs than the industry allowed cost of debt (financing underperformance).\n\nOur efficient financing has given us a history of financing outperformance. We strive to deliver efficient costs, but our strategy for AMP7 has been to prioritise operating performance and ODI rewards over totex savings, as this drives better long-term value for all our stakeholders.",

We understand the impact our work can have on everyday lives across our region, and we seek to play an active role in tackling the issues that matter most to these communities. Our approach is to develop strong relationships and build partnerships where we work to generate solutions together. Our employees also get involved in local communities through volunteering, fundraising, and giving.\n\nOur region has a broad mix of rural and urban landscapes, and we look after some beautiful areas of land, from the rolling hills of Cumbria to nature reserves and other green spaces in towns and cities. We open much of our land to the public, which supports the regional tourism industry and offers physical and mental health and wellbeing benefits for communities through access to relaxation and recreation. We also promote sustainable drainage solutions to help avoid flooding in built-up urban areas.\n\n## Community investment beyond the B4SI method of calculation\n\nIn addition to the \u00a32.82 million of community investment calculated using the B4SI method, we contribute to our Trust Fund to help those struggling to pay their bills, with further support available to help customers reduce their water bill to an affordable amount through our social tariff. We have extended the additional \u00a315 million per annum of support provided through our social tariff during COVID-19 to 2025.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nWe invest in community partnerships to tackle issues more effectively, to find new solutions to the challenges we face, and to access new funding streams, driving efficiency and a better overall outcome. Last summer we signed two memoranda of understanding with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and The Rivers Trust - partners held in high esteem by local communities with a broad membership base, enhancing the credibility of what we do.\n\nAs part of our \u00a3300,000 CaST fund, we provided funding to community groups across the North West to deliver elements of our catchment management approach, focused in particular on community engagement with nature or helping shape and promote natural capital markets.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPromoting our support services and campaign messages places us at the heart of communities and builds trust with hard-to-reach groups.\n\nBy working with community partners we can share resources, access new funding opportunities and achieve more together.\n\nProviding access to our land enables communities to enjoy the physical and mental wellbeing benefits that green spaces can bring, which in turn helps reduce the burden on health services.\n\nOne of the first projects to receive funding is led by the Mersey Rivers Trust and focuses on establishing community participation on the lower catchment area of the River Bollin. It aims to increase the number of people connecting with nature and accessing local blue-green space for health and wellbeing. The project will engage volunteers and landowners in restoring the reed bed habitat at Tatton Mere, a popular recreational site in Cheshire.\n\n## Helping young people\n\nIn addition to our ongoing graduate and apprentice schemes, we have supported the Government's Kickstart programme by providing placements in various roles across the North West. This scheme helps support those traditionally overlooked groups in our communities. Each Kickstarter has had a dedicated skills coach and received job-related and employability skills training. Since April 2021, 55 Kickstarters have joined our business and 24 have found full-time employment with us or our suppliers. A further six have applied, or are being supported with applications, for our apprentice programme.\n\nAs part of our work to promote skills for the future, we once again joined forces with five high schools from Warrington to help attract potential engineers. Our partnership with The Challenge Academy Trust (TCAT), now in its fifth year, was set up to inspire young people to pursue a career in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields. Sixty students from the five schools, who are part of TCAT, worked with our engineering mentors over a period of 16 weeks, gaining a real insight into what working life as an engineer is like.\n\nThe programme builds up to a 'Dragons' Den' style business competition to showcase the work the students have done, in front of judges from the business. The project provides more than just STEM experience, as the challenges allow pupils to develop valuable skills including teamwork, problem solving, influencing others, and public speaking.\n\nAs the water industry deals with the challenge of climate change, and we drive towards carbon neutrality, attracting the next generation of creative, skilled people is key to the success of our business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our partnerships on page 55",

Students rated the overall experience ten out of ten.\n\nAs COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted, our free  'All about water' sessions have returned to classrooms across the region. Consequently, we have seen a reduction in the number of children benefiting from our online education resources, which increased significantly during lockdown. We are reviewing our approach to education and, as part of this, we will consider the most practical way to deliver educational resources.\n\n## Community engagement\n\nDirect engagement with communities provides the opportunity to hear what customers think and to explore ways we can work together to address issues.\n\nFor example, to highlight inappropriate use of sewers and the problems created by that, we held a familyfriendly interactive exhibition at the Arndale Shopping Centre in Manchester during February half term. Engaging 'Sewer Monster' posters, competitions, fun activities and free giveaways, including fat traps, were all part of our Stop the Block campaign.\n\nAt the RHS Tatton Flower Show, we talked to customers about water saving tips and sponsored a garden of resilience. The garden addressed the challenges of extremes of weather and the stresses and strains of the pandemic. It gave visitors ideas for making outdoor spaces better able to cope with too much or too little rain, such as a rainwater planter and a slimline water butt disguised as a bench, and incorporated ideas to encourage people to take time out and contemplate their own personal resilience. Plants were chosen for their resilience to extremes and prolonged spells of dry and wet weather, while their colours complemented the hard landscaping materials. The garden was well received by visitors and won three awards at the show, receiving prime time television exposure on BBC One and social media coverage, helping to raise awareness to a much wider audience. It will continue to inspire gardeners at its new permanent home at RHS Bridgewater in Salford.\n\n## Access to our land for recreational use\n\nWe encourage the public to access our land and regional bathing waters, and to enjoy them safely. Since the first COVID-19 lockdown in spring 2020, there has been an increase in anti-social behaviour on our catchment land, with issues such as wild camping, illegal fires and littering. We have been working with local groups at several sites to address this.\n\n\u00a3300k Catchment Systems\n\nThinking (CaST) funding for community groups\n\nAt Macclesfield Forest, we have joined forces with the rural crime team from Cheshire Police and rangers from the Peak District National Park to tackle antisocial behaviour by undertaking joint patrols at busy times to remind visitors to enjoy the area responsibly.\n\nIn spring 2021, we launched a new podcast series entitled 'Acres of Nature' to connect people with the North West's outdoor spaces. Each themed episode takes an in-depth look at the land we manage - such as the Davyhulme Millennium Nature Reserve in the heart of Urmston, Manchester - through the eyes of people who live, work and visit there. Available to all on Spotify, Acres of Nature is all about bringing people closer to nature, and podcast themes have included history, nature and wellbeing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                      |                                             | Status              | Status               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Measure                                                                                                                                                                                | 2025 target                          | Performance                                 | Annual  performance | Against 2025  target |\n| KPI:                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                      |                                             |                     |                      |\n| Community  investment                                                                                                                                                                  | 10% increase  (\u00a32.82m)               | \u00a32.82m \u00a32.15m                               |                     |                      |\n| Partnership leverage  1:4                                                                                                                                                              | Partnership leverage  1:4            | 1:4 1:7                                     |                     |                      |\n| Percentage of  participants who  remain employed six months after  completing an early                                                                                                 | 50-60%                               |                                             |                     |                      |\n| careers or outreach scheme with United  Utilities Number of children  benefiting from  education materials Percentage of  visitors to our  recreation sites who  view United Utilities | 20,000 Maintain  position  above 50% | 75% 83% 12,998 19,120 57. 3 % Baseline year |                     |                      |\n| Status key:                                                                                                                                                                            |                                      |                                             |                     |                      |\n| Annual performance                                                                                                                                                                     |                                      | Against 2025 target                         |                     |                      |\n| Met expectation/target                                                                                                                                                                 |                                      | Confident of meeting target                 |                     |                      |\n| Behind expectation/target                                                                                                                                                              | Close to meeting expectation/target  | Some work to do Target unobtainable         |                     |                      |\n\n## Performance key:\n\n2021/22 2020/21\n\n55\n\nKickstarters have joined the business through the government programme\n\nOf students on TCAT STEM programme say they are more likely to pursue a STEM-related career\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 90%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus",

Only by working in partnership with others can we deliver for water, wildlife and local communities. This year, we have committed to two major partnerships aimed at improving the environment of the North West.\n\nOur ground-breaking strategic partnership with The Rivers Trust aims to tackle the big challenges facing rivers in the region. It is the first time a partnership has set about designing a framework to bring together everyone with an interest in the health of rivers from source to sea. It will build better competence for more urgent action to tackle challenges that are increasingly important to society, such as pollution, flooding and water abstraction and help deliver adaptations and resilience to combat the extremes of climate change.\n\nThe partnership formalises the existing strong relationship between the water company and the non-governmental organisation, which is the umbrella body for one of the fastest growing environmental movements in the UK.\n\nBoth parties expect the new partnership to facilitate longer-term planning of investment priorities, beyond the current water sector five-year regulatory cycle, allowing faster adoption of nature-based solutions and other collaborative ventures.\n\nA new shared vision with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) builds on joint work at our Haweswater estate over the past ten years. This has demonstrated that nature-based solutions make a very real contribution to meeting the challenge of a changing climate and the economic pressures facing upland farmers.\n\nWe already work together at Bowland in Lancashire, Dove Stone Reservoir near Oldham, and Lake Vyrnwy in North Wales. The memorandum of understanding signed in 2021 commits us to explore areas of opportunity by working together, such as helping farming tenancies, creating and managing new wetland, peatland and woodland, and working to improve the visitor experience. Together we intend to tap into natural capital markets including green finance initiatives and the Environmental Land Management scheme to fund beneficial land management projects.\n\nDelivering value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## How we deliver value to customers Short term\n\n- \u00b7 We focus on providing continuous, resilient and reliable water and wastewater services for customers, ensuring clean water is available at their taps when they need it, and wastewater is taken away when it goes down their drains.\n- \u00b7 When customers need to contact us, we are helpful, friendly and supportive, talking and listening to them so that we can understand and meet their expectations.\n- \u00b7 We maintain bills that are good value for money, providing help and support for those who are struggling to pay.\n\n## Long term\n\n- \u00b7 Our water and wastewater services make a major contribution to the long-term health and wellbeing of customers in the North West.\n- \u00b7 Through long-term financing and the regulatory framework, we are delivering multi-million pound infrastructure projects to improve services and resilience for the long term. We ensure the cost of this is shared fairly and affordably between those that benefit now and in the future.\n- \u00b7 Providing additional help to vulnerable customers builds long-term trust relationships.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe put customers at the heart of everything we do, with one of our core values being to be customerfocused. The continuous improvements we have driven in recent years saw us enter the 2020-25 period as a leading water and wastewater company, and our level of operational performance and customer satisfaction remain high.\n\nServing many of the most economically deprived areas in England and Wales, we are always mindful of the need to help customers who struggle to pay their bills, and this has never been more important than it is right now as we emerge from a global pandemic with high levels of inflation increasing the cost of living.\n\nWe are providing sector-leading support for vulnerable customers, supporting over 200,000 households this year, with around \u00a3280 million (1) of affordability support being given over the 2020-25 period (AMP7).\n\n## Operational performance for customers\n\nWe have continued to improve performance for customers this year, earning our highest ever one-year net reward against customer outcome delivery incentives (ODIs) at \u00a325 million (2) for 2021/22.\n\nWe delivered a strong performance against our ODI in relation to voids, having reduced voids to 4.78 per cent of billable properties, against a target of 5.24 per cent, as a result of which we earned a \u00a36 million reward this year. Reducing voids not only helps economically, but it enables us to keep bills lower for other customers because revenue is spread between more billable properties, making things fairer and more affordable for all customers.\n\nSome of the other commitments for which we achieved rewards were our strong performance in reducing pollution incidents, removing over 3,500 homes completely off lead supply pipes, and lifting more than 77,000 customers out of water poverty.\n\nIn areas where we incurred penalties, such as internal sewer flooding incidents and customer contacts in relation to taste and smell, the additional investment we are making over the remainder of AMP7 will help improve our performance for customers in future years.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will continue to invest in our assets and people to meet the stretching customer support targets in our regulatory contract.\n\nBy achieving sustainable cost reductions we can provide an efficient service, keeping bills low and maintaining good value for money.\n\nWe provide assistance schemes to those who need it most and provide practical advice on how to manage water in the home.\n\nOur strong performance on customer service metrics this year has helped drive a 14 per cent reduction in written complaints, achieving our lowest ever volume.\n\nWe have achieved recertification to the new and enhanced BSI standard 18477:2010 for our Priority Services scheme, which supports over 180,000 customers, and we are proud to have been reaccredited this year with the Institute of Customer Service - Service Mark with Distinction award, one of only 18 brands to achieve the distinction status.\n\n## Affordability\n\nWe have an extensive range of schemes available to help customers, providing a sector-leading level of customer support. We supported more than 200,000 households with affordability in 2021/22, with over 180,000 on discounted tariffs and grants, and a further 20,000 having received support through our payment matching scheme.\n\nThe financial support we committed to in our AMP7 business plan was the largest of any water company, and over the five-year period we are providing around \u00a3280 million (1) of customer support.\n\nWe are exploring innovative ways to help customers more efficiently. We are the first utility company to harness open banking, which helps us identify and support customers to get access to the right affordability tariffs more quickly and easily. A process that traditionally would have taken weeks can now be done in minutes with the use of open banking, and we have received positive feedback from customers that used the service.\n\nWe carried out 39,000 affordability visits, taking our financial support to the customer's doorstep, and we promote our Back on Track scheme via partner organisations and the Hardship Hub, as well as directly to customers.\n\nThere is always more we would like to be able to do, and we are a leading supporter of the Consumer Council for Water's drive to introduce a national social tariff, which would help to provide a more equitable sharing of support for customers across the country that are struggling to pay their bill, regardless of where people live.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our use of open banking on\n\npage 59\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information about our ODI performance will be published in July 2022 in our APR, available on our website at: unitedutilities.com/ corporate/about-us/ performance/annualperformance-report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) 50 per cent company funded.\n- (2)  Excluding per capita consumption, which Ofwat will be revisiting at the next price review once there is a better understanding of the impact of/uni00A0COVID-19 and any enduring effects.",

This helps to provide a high degree of collection certainty and to spot any potential affordability issues early, at the point of the first missed payment, so that we can make contact swiftly.\n\nFor customers that need affordability support, we can quickly get them onto the right scheme to help them get back on track. For those customers that can afford to pay but choose not to do so, we have a comprehensive data-led approach to collections that helps us to accurately pursue payment in an efficient and timely manner. This includes a range of techniques, such as 'nudging' customers through email or text if a payment is late, enhanced credit reference sharing, and credit reporting.\n\nOnly \u00a34 million of our net household debtors are aged by more than one year, indicating that we are not storing up a problem for future bad debts.\n\nOur best-in-class approach to collections continues to receive external recognition. This year we have won five awards across the Credit Awards, Utilities and Telecoms Awards, and Utility Week Awards, including 'Utility Team of the Year' and 'Best Use of Technology' at the Credit Awards. We have been recognised for our use of data and technology to provide financial support to those who needed it most during the pandemic and for the introduction of open banking.\n\n## Digital transformation\n\nThrough a significant increase in the availability and performance of our digital channels, over 1.2 million customers engaged with us digitally, driving both service improvements and cost efficiencies, and we achieved strong customer sentiment scores.\n\nWe have been proactive using targeted communications with customers to offer support to those impacted financially by the pandemic and struggling to pay.\n\nTo underpin our contact centre operations, we have implemented new technology in the form of a new workflow system linking billing and operational customer service activities.\n\n## \u00a3280m\n\nAffordability support being given in total over the 2020-25 period\n\n|                                                                    |

Tailoring payment plans to customer affordability is a key goal and the advent of improved data availability from open banking stimulated an innovative method of improving our customer journey.\n\nOur idea was to utilise open banking technology to verify customer income in real time to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our customer affordability assessments. We implemented an improved customer journey in three key steps:\n\n- \u00b7 Gaining agreement to use open data for the affordability assessment;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining customer consent via an online consent portal; and\n- \u00b7 Receiving a summarised view of a customer's income straight from their bank account, including evidence of benefit payments.\n\nOpen data now forms a key part of one of our most sensitive customer journeys, and initial results showed 45 per cent of customers who were offered the option to use open banking accepted.\n\nCustomer feedback on their experience of open banking is very positive, with customers saying it was easy to use and 88 per cent saying they would use it again, despite never having used it before.\n\nThe use of open banking has streamlined customer eligibility for reduced-rate social tariffs. Were it not for this solution, customers applying for help with payment of their water bill would have had to manually collate their income and expenditure information, including evidence of benefit receipt, in preparation for their telephone affordability assessment.\n\nWhat previously would have taken weeks, can now be done in minutes, with the added benefit of increased accuracy.\n\nOpen banking improves first-time completion rate, meaning customers are given a decision on tariff eligibility there and then and a sustainable payment plan can be agreed.\n\nOpen banking could help facilitate the introduction of a national social tariff, as proposed by the Consumer Council for Water: the efficiency we've delivered into our affordability assessment process will help us manage the expected increases in volume of applications for support, meaning we can help more customers with payment of their water bill.\n\nDelivering value for:\n\n<!-- image -->",

We firmly believe that nothing we do is worth getting hurt for, and we aim to ensure all employees go home safe and well at the end of the day.\n- \u00b7 We invest in training and development to enable our employees to grow their skills and to keep them motivated.\n- \u00b7 Listening to our employees helps to create an engaged workforce, increasing job satisfaction, and through employee communications and conferences we update our people on business developments so they feel part of a team.\n\n## Long term\n\n- \u00b7 Investing in the development of current, and future, employees means we will have a workforce with the right skills for the future.\n- \u00b7 Health, safety and wellbeing extends to mental as well as physical health. We promote awareness of stress and other mental health issues, promoting an all-round healthy lifestyle in the long term which, in turn, reduces the burden on healthcare services.\n- \u00b7 We provide pension offerings that support employees in later life.\n- \u00b7 Promoting diversity and inclusion means we have a workforce that truly represents the region.\n\n## Overview\n\nOur people are critical to the success of our business and it is important we give them the opportunity to develop their skills and knowledge and support them with the most effective technology. We have continued to invest in skills training and accelerate our digital strategy. The health and wellbeing of our employees is paramount and keeping them safe remains our primary concern with 89 per cent of our employees believing our organisation supports their health, safety and wellbeing. We continue to build on our diversity and inclusion agenda, which underpins all aspects of our organisation. Increasing the diversity of our workforce ensures we have access to a broader set of views and we want colleagues to feel valued, supported and respected in the workplace.\n\nWe facilitated a smooth return of all employees working from home to the workplace in line with the government roadmap out of lockdown, transitioning around 1,800 staff into hybrid working between the office and home. The transition was well structured with robust governance, including a policy for employees setting out expectations for working in this way and upskilling and support for managers with remote teams.\n\nWe are rated 4.6 out of 5 by former and current employees on Glassdoor, and 92 per cent of our employees would recommend United Utilities as a great place to work. We are delighted to be recognised for our efforts, ranking again in the top 1 per cent of over 850 companies across Europe in the Financial Times' Statista Survey for Diversity and Inclusion Leadership, and we were the leading utility company in the Top 50 Inclusive UK Employers Index. We have been included in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 2022, one of 418 companies, showing our commitment to more equal and inclusive workplaces.\n\n## Committed to equality, diversity and inclusion\n\nWe want fantastic people to enable us to deliver a great service now and into the future. We are supporting employees to achieve their full potential and to feel valued and included, regardless of their gender, age, race, disability, sexual orientation or social background, and we make sure we are reaching and recruiting from every part of our community. We are making good progress against our refreshed diversity and inclusion strategy, validated by a recent independent audit, which recognised our strong\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImproving our performance creates employee pride in a job well done, enhancing employee satisfaction and a desire to do more.\n\nEncouraging innovative ideas from employees can lead to cost reductions, and high employee satisfaction reduces turnover, which ensures training and development costs are efficient.\n\nWe take a responsible approach to protecting the health, safety and wellbeing of our employees, ensuring we send everyone home each day safe and well.\n\nfocus on education, awareness and growing our four employee network groups with great progress in all audited areas.\n\nWe offer targeted support for future talent through our focused 'Female Leadership Pipeline' and 'Aspiring Manager' programmes, which have been designed to support employees into leadership positions. We have put efforts into developing a diverse leadership pipeline by introducing a new talent programme, the 'Stepping up programme', for employees from ethnic minority backgrounds, giving them the opportunity to develop personal and leadership skills that will help them fast-track their careers at United Utilities.\n\nIn the last 12 months, we have welcomed 28 new graduates onto our schemes, and 52 new apprentices have joined us on operational, service and futurefacing digital and environmental schemes. Thirty-seven per cent of our new apprentices and 39 per cent of our newly recruited graduates are female. This is higher than the UK average of 24 per cent for females in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) roles. We have made great progress in recruiting apprentices from more diverse backgrounds, working with our specialist recruitment partner, with 15 per cent of apprentices who joined us this year being from a minority ethnic background. In addition, 21 per cent of new apprentices disclosed a disability or learning difficulty. This represents continued success in our efforts to recruit a more diverse talent pipeline and is a positive result against a backdrop of low attrition levels, regional variations in ethnic diversity, and difficulties attracting females for STEM roles.\n\nWe made a public commitment to support the 10,000 Black Interns Programme and we will be welcoming 26 university students for placements this summer, with a further commitment for 120 placements over the next five years. We will welcome university students with autism as part of our support for the 'Ambitious about Autism' programme.\n\n## Training and development\n\nOur technical training academy, established in February 2014, continues to go from strength to strength. We are the only employer provider in the water sector to have been inspected by Ofsted and received an overall 'Good' rating. We launched our Digital Skills Academy, a new learning portal for employees to access digital learning content to upskill\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach to diversity and inclusion on pages 44 to 45\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our talent pipeline on page 63",

In the last 12 months, we have delivered 15,000 classroom training events as well as around 40,000 e-learning modules. We launched a new water quality awareness e-learning module to around 4,000 employees as part of our wider 'Water Quality First' programme, which has been designed to ensure water quality remains at the heart of our operations.\n\n## Ensuring everyone goes home safe and well\n\nOver the last few years we have introduced 'home safe and well', which focuses on the behavioural aspects of our health, safety and wellbeing culture. Home safe and well is a core thread that flows through our health, safety and wellbeing strategy, which covers our sites, assets and people using three core pillars: personal safety; process safety; and health and wellbeing. Over the last 12 months there has been a focus on employee mental health, expanding our capability in this area.\n\nSince its launch in 2018, we have trained around 5,500 colleagues in home safe and well and continue to do so with new starters. We are now in the third year of our cultural journey where we have seen improvements in our health and safety performance year on year. We continue to create an environment where we look out for ourselves and each other to ensure all our colleagues go home safe and well.\n\nOur commitment to health, safety and wellbeing has recently been externally acknowledged. In early 2022, we were awarded our tenth consecutive Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) gold standard medal, which now means we have achieved the RoSPA President's award, which is only awarded to companies who have 'achieved a very high level of performance, demonstrating well developed occupational health and safety management systems and culture, outstanding control of risk and very low levels of error, harm and loss.'\n\nWe continued to see improvement against a number of important performance measures, reducing the number and the severity of accidents, and increasing the proportion of hazards and near misses reported. Our employee accident frequency rate for 2021/22 was 0.073 accidents per 100,000 hours worked, lower than the previous year and amounting to nine accidents reported. Our contractor accident frequency rate also showed significant improvement, with 0.043 accidents per 100,000 hours worked, another improvement on the previous year and representing only five contractor accidents. Our aim is that no one will be harmed while working on our behalf, and we continue to promote, support and improve the wellbeing of our people.\n\n## 4.6/5\n\nRating on Glassdoor by former and current employees\n\n|                                                                    |                                            |                                                                                       | Against 2025        | Against 2025   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| Measure                                                            | 2025 target                                | Performance                                                                           | Annual  performance | target         |\n| KPI:                                                               |                                            |                                                                                       |                     |                |\n| Employee  engagement                                               | Upper quartile  against UK  utilities norm | Upper quartile  against UK  utilities norm Upper quartile  against UK  utilities norm |                     |                |\n| Employee opinion  survey diversity and  inclusion questions  score | UK high  performance  norm                 | UK high  performance  norm UK high  performance  norm                                 |                     |                |\n| Employee opinion  survey learning  and development  category score | UK high  performance  norm                 | UK utilities  high  performance  norm UK utilities  high  performance                 |                     |                |\n| Living Wage  accreditation                                         | Secure and  retain                         | Retained  accreditation Secured  accreditation                                        |                     |                |\n| Pension Quality  Mark +                                            | Retain  accreditation                      | Retained Retained                                                                     |                     |                |\n| Health and safety:                                                 |                                            |                                                                                       |                     |                |\n| AFR employees (per  100,000)                                       | 0.064                                      | 0.073 0.094                                                                           |                     |                |\n| AFR contractors (per  100,000)                                     | Year-on-year  improvement  in score        | 0.043 0.087                                                                           |                     |                |\n| Wellbeing Charter  accreditation                                   | Retain  accreditation                      | Retained Retained                                                                     |                     |                |\n\n## Status key:\n\nAnnual performance\n\n## Against 2025 target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMet expectation/target\n\nConfident of meeting target\n\nClose to meeting expectation/target\n\nSome work to do\n\nBehind expectation/target\n\nTarget unobtainable\n\n## Performance key:\n\n2021/22 2020/21\n\n## Top 1%\n\nFinancial Times' Statista Survey for Diversity and Inclusion Leadership\n\n## 10th\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsecutive RoSPA gold standard medal, achieving RoSPA President's award\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our early careers opportunities are focused on attracting talent for our core operational and technical roles and for key emerging skills such as digital and green jobs.\n\nShahbaz, a process controller apprentice who joined us in September 2021, is enjoying the variety an apprenticeship brings. He's developing new skills and says he's proud to work for a company that values diversity and inclusion. 'From my first day, I have felt welcomed and part of a large extended family' he said. 'The company's stance on diversity and inclusion is amazing to see and be part of. Issues raised aren't just listened to; they're actually heard, and small things like being offered a halal packed lunch on my training course make me feel included.'\n\nWe have continued to build on our award-winning apprenticeship schemes, significantly increasing our range of apprenticeships to align to core operational roles and address future skills gaps. We have created eight pathways for green jobs, a total of 31 apprenticeship vacancies for 2022/23, and these new roles will support our ambition to become carbonneutral by 2030. We went from eight apprenticeships in 2017 to 26 in 2022.\n\nNew apprenticeships pathways created include Systems Thinking, digital user experience, cyber security and data scientists.\n\nWe are pioneering a new Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) apprenticeship, and twenty-two-year-old Gabi Ord is our first HGV apprentice. Gabi has completed many hours of training, including fuel-efficient driving and handling an excavator and telehandler - skills she needs in her role transporting sludge cake from wastewater treatment works to farmers and landowners. 'Gabi is now performing to a really high standard in terms of safe driving style and fuel efficiency' said her manager, Martin Shaw. 'She has set a high benchmark for any future apprentices that follow.'\n\nWe are supporting those traditionally overlooked groups in our communities, with 44 per cent of the young people we recruited onto the Government's Kickstart Scheme now transitioning into employment. A further six Kickstarters are currently being supported with applications for our award-winning apprenticeships. One of them, who has recently started an apprenticeship in our customer services department, shared the support she's received: 'I find that, having dyslexia, it can get quite tiring' she said. 'However, I've been given a screen for my monitor, documents are printed off for me, and everyone I meet is so helpful - putting things across in a simple way so I can fully understand.'\n\nDelivering value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have continued to build on our awardwinning apprenticeship schemes, significantly increasing our range of apprenticeships to align to core operational roles and address future skills gaps.'",

        "page_content": "## How we deliver value to environment Short term\n\n- \u00b7 We meet increasingly stringent environmental consent levels, which help to improve the quality of rivers and bathing waters and so support tourism in the region.\n- \u00b7 Our investment in renewable energy generation is reducing our carbon footprint and contribution to climate change.\n- \u00b7 We have invested in new infrastructure, such as our West Cumbria project, to allow us to transfer water around the region more efficiently to avoid depletion of individual water sources.\n\n## Long term\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting campaigns to educate the public and younger generations on water usage helps protect this valuable resource and reduce usage now and for years to come.\n- \u00b7 We innovate and invest in new technologies to solve environmental challenges for future generations.\n- \u00b7 We manage our land in a way that safeguards habitats and protects wildlife that makes its home in rivers and other water bodies.\n- \u00b7 We plan far ahead to ensure our activities and investment enhance the long-term resilience of the rural and urban environment in our region.\n\n## Overview\n\nThe North West has a diverse mix of densely populated and built-up urban areas as well as many rural areas of outstanding natural beauty, and there are different environmental considerations needed for each. It is of great importance that we continue to protect and enhance the environment across our region, and manage our land responsibly to preserve and improve it for future generations.\n\nWe delivered a number of environmental improvements over AMP6, including improving 338.5 kilometres of rivers, significantly reducing our carbon footprint, and increasing our renewable energy production. We have agreed an environmental improvement programme for AMP7 that will continue to improve the river, bathing and shellfish water quality in the North West. Our investment in AMP7 is expected to result in an improvement in water quality in 1,315 kilometres of rivers. Having completed the first two years of the period, we remain on track to deliver the improvements we have committed to.\n\n## Environmental Performance Assessment and pollution reduction\n\nIn 2020, we had no serious pollution incidents for the second year running. We have been green in our serious incident performance for the last seven consecutive years - the only company to have ever achieved this. We had our best ever performance on total number of pollution incidents (categories 1-3), with a reduction of 31 per cent compared with the previous year. This is our largest ever reduction in pollution incidents, and was delivered while we maintained our excellent self-reporting performance. We expect to be green for serious pollution incidents and the total number of pollution incidents measure again in 2021.\n\nWe had no wastewater treatment works classed as failing by the EA - something that has only ever been achieved in the sector once before. With only one failing water treatment works, this represents our best ever combined water and wastewater performance, and our largest ever one-year performance improvement. We expect to remain green on this measure for 2021.\n\nThere has been increased public interest in the use of storm overflows across the industry this year, and the Environment Act 2021 requires water companies to secure a progressive reduction in the impact caused\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMany customers care about the environment, so providing the best service to customers involves protecting the places they live in and love.\n\nMany ways we protect the environment reduce cost. For example, renewable energy generation reduces our energy costs as well as our carbon footprint.\n\nWe manage water and wastewater in a responsible way that protects the environment and enhances its resilience.\n\nby storm overflows, one of several new and emerging requirements. We have made good progress in many of these areas, and launched our Better Rivers: Better North West plan that sets out how we will deliver further improvements. The additional investment we are making will help accelerate environmental outcomes, but there is more needed and this could drive significant increases in future investment, which will need to be balanced with customer affordability.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions and climate change - carbon reduction\n\nWe have committed to six carbon pledges across priority areas of our carbon strategy, including the setting of science-based targets to align with global best practice, switching to low carbon electricity, greening our fleet, restoring peatland and creating woodland. We have made substantial progress, and continue to mature our long-term carbon plans to ensure we achieve our commitments by 2030 and 2050. We are part of the global movement of 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C: Our Only Future', are signatories to the UN Race to Zero campaign and are proud to be contributing to the UK water industry's commitment to be net zero from 2030.\n\n## Climate resilience\n\nIn AMP6 we invested an additional \u00a3250 million to increase resilience to climate change, and we continue to invest to protect and enhance the climate resilience of our assets, processes and customer services. We are working to further develop our understanding of climate risk. In December 2021, we published a comprehensive assessment of our climate risks and plans in our latest climate change adaptation report. We are now further developing our approach to climate resilience, including engagement with stakeholders, as we take account of these risks in our long-term business planning process.\n\n## Biodiversity and natural capital\n\nWe continue to develop our approach to natural capital and improve our understanding to influence investment decisions, allowing us to assess the full value of our activity. We have an outcome delivery incentive (ODI) on enhancing natural capital value for customers, which encourages assessment of the added natural capital value we deliver by pursuing nature-based and catchment solutions, and we expect to outperform against our performance commitment this year. Understanding this value is a key element of driving\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our Better Rivers: Better North West plan on\n\npage 67\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our TCFD and TNFD sections on pages 86 to 99",

As part of this approach, we worked with consultants and stakeholders to develop a north west natural capital baseline to understand the natural assets the North West has, the benefits they provide and the value of them.\n\nBiodiversity is a key pillar of natural capital, and ensuring the preservation and enhancement of biodiversity is a key element of our CaST approach. As a large land owner, with a significant amount of land designated as sites of special scientific interest (SSSI), and a business delivering significant development in the North West, we will strive to play our part in nature recovery and the delivery of biodiversity net gain. We have delivered significant investment to improve the condition of habitats on our land, aiming to have 100 per cent of our SSSI land in either favourable or recovering status by 2030. We are reviewing our approach to biodiversity management and how we can better manage and enhance biodiversity through our land ownership and in the delivery of capital projects.\n\n## Leakage reduction\n\nWater is a precious resource and reducing leakage is important in ensuring its resilience. 2021/22 was the sixteenth year we outperformed our leakage target and we have reached a new low in leakage levels. We continue to deliver leakage reductions supported by a network of around 70,000 acoustic sensors, installed over the last two years.\n\nWe experienced a relatively mild winter, but the changing COVID-19 restrictions had the potential to impact leakage performance. Resourcing became a particular challenge through December, due to isolation periods, so we increased contractor resources to tackle this. The changing patterns of night use, due to changes in working from home guidance and the return to offices, created uncertainty with leakage levels. We addressed this with additional meter readings and analysis which gave better insight into usage pattern change, enabling more efficient targeting of leak detection activity.\n\nOver AMP7, we plan to reduce total leakage by at least 15 per cent. We actively look to trial new techniques to understand how these can be scaled and embedded in the most effective way, and this gives us opportunities to accelerate and target those interventions which are demonstrated to be the most effective. One such example is our smart water network trial in the Macclesfield area, where we have linked together\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1,315km\n\nRivers expected to have improved water quality from our AMP7 investment\n\nhundreds of monitors and sensors on the town's water mains. This created a machine-learning Artificial Intelligence (AI) 'brain' that supported enhanced leakage targeting, as well as detecting and preventing other non-leakage problems. We are using the learning from these trials to refine our approach to reducing leakage and applying this to our Dynamic Network Management approach for wastewater.\n\nStatus\n\n|                                                                                                    |                      |                                        | Against 2025                     | Against 2025   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------|\n| Measure                                                                                            | 2025 target          | Performance                            | Annual  performance              | target         |\n| KPI:                                                                                               |                      |                                        |                                  |                |\n| EA EPA                                                                                             | Upper quartile Upper | quartile (1) Upper quartile            |                                  |                |\n| Leakage reduction                                                                                  | 15% (2)              | 8% 5%                                  |                                  |                |\n| % waste to   beneficial use                                                                        | 98%                  | 97.8% 97.3%                            |                                  |                |\n| Enhancing natural  capital for customers                                                           | \u00a34m                  | \u00a33.234m Delivery  scheduled  from 2022 |                                  |                |\n| Number of trees  planted                                                                           | 500,000              | 244,639 216,601                        |                                  |                |\n| Better air quality:  nitrogen oxides  (NOx) emissions per  GWh of renewable  electricity generated | 1.42 NOx/ GWh        | 1.19 NOx/GWh 1.3 NOx/GWh               |                                  |                |\n| Climate change  mitigation: %  change scope 1 & 2  emissions (3) Climate change                    | 14% decrease         | 2.2% decrease 1.5% increase            |                                  |                |\n| adaptation: multiple  metrics                                                                      |                      |                                        | See TCFD section, pages 86 to 97 |                |\n\n## Status key:\n\n## Annual performance\n\n## Against 2025 target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMet expectation/target\n\nConfident of meeting target\n\nClose to meeting expectation/target\n\nSome work to do\n\nBehind expectation/target\n\nTarget unobtainable\n\n## Performance key:\n\n2021/22\n\n2020/21\n\n- (1) Based on the latest assessment, which was for 2020. 2021 performance will be reported in July 2022.\n- (2) As measured against a 2017/18 baseline.\n- (3) As measured against Science Based Target baseline year 2019/20.\n\n## 4 star\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCarbon pledges underpinned by ambitious science-based targets\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndustry-leading company in the EA's performance assessment for 2020\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

People want to swim, to enjoy riverside walks and get back to nature, and we have an important role to play by upgrading the sewerage infrastructure in the region.\n\nIn March 2022, we published a series of commitments to kick start a river revival over the next three years. Better Rivers: Better North West is a four-point plan setting out our commitments to:\n\n- \u00b7 make sure the company's operations progressively reduce impact to river health;\n- \u00b7 be open and transparent about our performance and plans;\n- \u00b7 make rivers beautiful and support others to improve and care for them; and\n- \u00b7 create more opportunities for everyone to enjoy rivers and waterways.\n\nMost of these pledges will be delivered over the next three years, including investment in wastewater systems, enhanced data monitoring and sharing, greater innovation and more use of nature-based solutions.\n\nWe have committed to deliver \u00a3230 million in environmental improvements, supporting at least a one-third sustainable reduction in the number of spills recorded from our storm overflows by 2025 compared to the 2020 baseline. This investment at sites across the region will lead to 184 kilometres of improved waterways. We will make sure that all storm overflows are monitored by 2023 and real-time data on their operation is made available to the general public.\n\nIn addition to the \u00a3230 million within our base capital programme, part of the additional investment we are making outside the scope of our final determination allowance will help accelerate these plans.\n\nBut that's only part of the solution; we can't do this on our own. Members of the public will be able to get involved too with the launch of a community fund to support local river health initiatives and, working alongside The Rivers Trust, there will be the opportunity for people to volunteer as citizen scientists to collect data on river health, which will help inform further improvement work.\n\nWe also continue to engage with the ongoing industrywide investigations by Ofwat and the Environment Agency into possible unpermitted sewage discharges.\n\n## Delivering value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnvironment\n\nMore detail can be found on our website at\n\nunitedutilities.com/corporate/responsibility/ environment/reducing-pollution",

As a responsible company, we believe in sharing our successes and have increased the additional investment we are making outside the scope of our Final Determination (FD) total expenditure (totex) allowance by \u00a3400 million to a total of \u00a3765 million, which will deliver environmental benefits and improved performance against customer outcomes.\n\n## Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE)\n\nReported RoRE of 7.9 per cent for 2021/22 comprises the base return of 3.9 per cent (including our 11 basis point fast-track reward that we receive in each of the five years of the AMP), tax outperformance of 2.7 per cent, financing outperformance of 1.6 per cent, and customer ODI outperformance of 0.5 per cent, partially offset by the total expenditure (totex) impact on RoRE of -0.8 per cent as a result of our additional investment. Underlying RoRE of 7.7 per cent has a lower tax outperformance of 2.5 per cent as it excludes the tax that will be recovered through the regulatory sharing mechanism.\n\n## Total expenditure (totex)\n\nThe totex impact on RoRE of -0.8 per cent, on both a reported and underlying basis, largely reflects the year two impact of the additional investment we are making outside the scope of our FD, for example our investment in Dynamic Network Management.\n\nOur AMP7 business plan was assessed by Ofwat as being amongst the most efficient in the sector, and our performance improvements over AMP6 meant we started AMP7 at a totex run rate that supported delivery of the stretching efficiency challenge in our FD allowance. We are not immune to the impact of inflation, both directly and indirectly through our supply chain, with many of our costs rising above the headline rate. Our totex allowance does increase with inflation, which helps to mitigate some of this cost pressure, and we continue to exploit technology and innovation to help us deliver our investment efficiently.\n\nIn this second year of AMP7, we have invested \u00a3645 million in net regulatory capital expenditure (excluding infrastructure renewals expenditure), representing the continued acceleration of our AMP7 investment\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy delivering better performance for customers we are able to achieve greater regulatory incentives, aligning improved service with investor returns.\n\nBy reducing costs in a sustainable way through innovation and efficiency, we can meet our allowed expenditure without compromising operational performance.\n\nOur strong corporate governance, prudent risk management, and clear and transparent reporting create a lower risk investment and build trust.\n\nprogramme and early expenditure against the extension to our original totex plans. Cumulatively, this is \u00a31.3 billion in the first two years of the period, which represents a good start to the delivery of our AMP7 programme. We have been able to deliver this expenditure effectively, maintaining our high performance scores against our Time, Cost and Quality index (TCQi) at over 95 per cent.\n\nOur investment strategy delivers long-term efficiency and sustainable performance improvements, and the additional \u00a3765 million investment we are making beyond the scope of our FD will drive further enhancements for customer and environmental performance. \u00a3265 million of this investment we expect to be fully recovered through regulatory mechanisms, including Green Recovery and projects that form part of our Water Industry National Environment Programme (WINEP). \u00a3250 million of this investment is improving environmental outcomes, funded through investment of outperformance, and subject to regulatory sharing mechanisms. The final \u00a3250 million of this investment will drive improved performance against customer outcomes and is supported on a business case basis, delivering improved customer ODI performance.\n\nWhile we continue to strive to deliver our investment efficiently, as we have demonstrated through this additional investment, we will invest where we are confident we can deliver improved customer or environmental outcomes and better customer ODI performance.\n\n## Customer outcome delivery incentives (ODIs)\n\nCustomer ODI outperformance of 0.5 per cent, on both a reported and underlying basis, reflects a net reward of \u00a325 million*. This is our highest ever oneyear net reward against customer ODIs, reflecting our continued improvements in performance for customers.\n\nOur customer ODI performance has been strong across the board, meeting or beating over 80 per cent of our performance commitments, giving us the confidence to increase our total AMP7 ODI guidance by a third, targeting a cumulative net ODI reward over the five-year period of around \u00a3200 million.\n\n- *  Excluding per capita consumption, which Ofwat will be revisiting at the next price review once there is a better understanding of the impact of COVID-19 and any enduring effects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our \u00a3765 million additional investment on\n\npage 71\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information about our RoRE performance will be published in July 2022 in our APR, available on our website at: unitedutilities.com/ corporate/about-us/ performance/annualperformance-report",

        "page_content": "## Our performance in 2021/22\n\nOperational performance\n\nThe additional investment we are making will help improve performance in areas where we want to do better. This includes \u00a3100 million investment in Dynamic Network Management, which will help us improve performance on sewer flooding, and around \u00a3100 million investment in improving water quality.\n\nCustomer ODI rewards and penalties in AMP7 will be adjusted in revenues on a two-year lag in accordance with the regulatory mechanism, therefore, the net reward earned this year will be reflected in an increase to revenue in 2023/24 through allowed increases in the rates charged to customers in that financial year.\n\n## Financing outperformance\n\nWe earned financing outperformance this year of 1.6 per cent, on both a reported and underlying basis, compared with 1.2 per cent last year. This increase mainly results from recent high levels of inflation, which increases the benefit of the roughly \u00a33 billion fixed rate debt we have locked in.\n\nWe have consistently issued debt at efficient rates that compare favourably with the industry average, thanks to our leading treasury management, clear and transparent financial risk management policies, and ability to act swiftly to access pockets of opportunity as they arise. This delivered significant financing outperformance during AMP6 and the rates we have locked-in for AMP7 compare favourably with the price review assumptions.\n\n## Tax outperformance\n\nThe 2.7 per cent outperformance on tax on a reported basis reflects our optimisation of available government tax incentives, including research and development tax allowances and the temporary capital allowance 'super deductions', net of the tax impact of financing outperformance. The 2.5 per cent outperformance on tax on an underlying basis excludes the tax that will be recovered through the regulatory sharing mechanism.\n\n## ESG performance\n\nWe are upper quartile across a suite of investor indices. With a score of 76 per cent we were proud to again be included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook 2022, and we have been included in the FTSE4Good Index Series, which measures the performance of companies who demonstrate strong ESG practices against globally recognised responsible business standards, since June 2001. In March 2022, we were assessed by Sustainalytics to be at low risk of experiencing material financial impacts from ESG factors, with our management of ESG material risk rated as strong. We received an ESG Risk Rating of 12.8.\n\n## 7. 9%\n\nReturn on Regulated Equity for 2021/22, double the base return\n\n|                                                                                             |                                   |                                                   | Against 2025        | Against 2025   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| Measure                                                                                     | 2025 target  Performance          |                                                   | Annual  performance | target         |\n| KPI:                                                                                        |                                   |                                                   |                     |                |\n| Underlying RoRE                                                                             | Assessed  annually                | 7.7 % 4.6%                                        |                     |                |\n| Reported RoRE                                                                               | Assessed  annually                | 7. 9 % 4.3%                                       |                     |                |\n| UK Corporate Governance  Code                                                               | Maintain  compliance              | Compliant Compliant                               |                     |                |\n| Maintain performance  across a range of trusted  investor indices                           | Upper   quartile                  | Upper   quartile Upper   quartile                 |                     |                |\n| Credit rating UUW  (Moody's, S&P, Fitch)                                                    |                                   | A3, BBB+, A-A3, BBB+,  A-  (stable  outlook)      |                     |                |\n| Gearing                                                                                     | 55-65%                            | 61% 62%                                           |                     |                |\n| Maintain sustainable                                                                        | Available/                        | Available Available                               |                     |                |\n| finance framework Fair Tax mark                                                             | continued  issuance Retain annual | Retained                                          |                     |                |\n| Sustainable dividend                                                                        | Grow by  CPIH                     | In line with  commitment In line with  commitment |                     |                |\n| Risk maturity                                                                               | Year-on-year  improvement         | Met  expectation Met  expectation                 |                     |                |\n| Anti-bribery:% of identified  employees completing  required training Investor engagement:% | 100% 75%                          | 100% 94% 80%                                      |                     |                |\n\n## Status key:\n\n## Annual performance\n\nAgainst 2025 target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMet expectation/target\n\nConfident of meeting target\n\n- Close to meeting expectation/target\n\nSome work to do\n\n- Behind expectation/target\n\nTarget unobtainable\n\n## Performance key:\n\n2021/22 2020/21\n\n## \u00a325m\n\nHighest ever one-year reward against outcome delivery incentives (ODIs)\n\n\u00a3200m Anticipated total reward against ODIs over the 2020-25 period\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus",

These projects are approved additions to our base investment programme, including Green Recovery investment and the Water Industry National Environment Programme (WINEP), and are subject to regulatory mechanisms.\n\nA further \u00a3250 million is being targeted at improving performance for customers, including \u00a3100 million investment in Dynamic Network Management, a Systems Thinking implementation in our wastewater network that is driving improvements in sewer flooding and pollution performance, as well as projects that will improve water quality.\n\nThis investment is supported on a business case basis, and will deliver improved customer outcome delivery incentive (ODI) performance in the current period. The sustainable performance improvements it will deliver also help to support better service for customers, and therefore, better ODI performance, in future periods,\n\nproviding additional benefit and creating long-term value for all stakeholders.\n\nThe remaining \u00a3250 million will help us improve environmental outcomes, such as accelerating implementation of the Environment Act 2021, including delivery of the commitments we set out in our Better Rivers: Better North West plan, and delivering improved water quality and resilience.\n\nThis is reinvestment of outperformance we have earned, and is subject to regulatory mechanisms. As a responsible company, we believe in the importance of sharing our successes for the benefit of all our stakeholders. This is in line with the approach we have taken historically, sharing over \u00a3600 million in 2010-20, and that investment has helped us to deliver the performance improvements we have achieved to date.\n\nAs well as delivering significant environmental and customer benefits, this additional investment is contributing to higher growth in our RCV, which is now expected to grow by over 10 per cent more on a nominal basis over the 2020-25 period than we expected at the beginning of the period. This, together with our financial strength and balance sheet headroom, means we expect gearing to remain within our target range of 55 to 65 per cent, retaining financial flexibility and resilience.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This award recognises FTSE350 companies who are fast payers of their invoices and can demonstrate that over the past 12 months they have paid their suppliers in less than 30 days as well as paying 95 per cent or more of all invoices on time.\n\n## Responsible sourcing through our United Supply Chain\n\nOur new approach to responsible supply chain management for AMP7, called United Supply Chain (USC), was launched in 2020 and we continue to embed this strategy across our supply chain.\n\nUSC recognises suppliers as an extension of the United Utilities family and suppliers are asked, as a minimum, to become a signatory to our Responsible Sourcing Principles. For those suppliers that are integral to our operations, we encourage them to become leaders and to work jointly with us to deliver improvements across ESG areas and to improve value for customers.\n\n## Link to strategic themes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuppliers work on our behalf, so ensuring they are motivated to deliver good quality work helps us deliver the best service to customers.\n\nDeveloping innovations with suppliers, and ensuring they deliver goods and services efficiently, contributes to a sustainable low cost for customers.\n\nWorking with responsible suppliers who share our sustainability objectives helps us achieve more in tackling environmental and social issues.\n\nIn September 2021, we held a USC event to acknowledge the efforts of our suppliers and awarded our first USC awards in Customer, Innovation and Integrity. We worked closely with one of our partner suppliers, Sapphire Utility Solutions Ltd, and awarded them our first USC accreditation badge.\n\nBy March 2022, 90 per cent of our targeted suppliers had signed up to our Responsible Sourcing Principles. We continue to engage with the remaining suppliers to reach our target of 100 per cent.\n\nThrough our partnership with Supply Chain Sustainability School, we have been able to offer our commercial colleagues and supply chain partners free resources to learn more about the Responsible Sourcing Principles.\n\nIn light of the sanctions regime introduced by the UK Government in relation to the conflict in Ukraine, we continue to review our supply chain on an ongoing basis for any potential exposure, and have taken action to mitigate this where necessary by securing alternative sourcing.\n\n## Fostering innovation\n\nOur Innovation Lab gives suppliers, often small start-up businesses who might be in the early stages of developing their idea or just starting out on their business growth journey, the opportunity to test solutions in a live environment over a 12-week programme.\n\nThis helps us find ideas where others aren't looking - in different sectors, other countries, and with suppliers we may not otherwise have worked with.\n\nIt does all this whilst being fully compliant with procurement legislation - allowing for rapid idea testing and adoption/contract award - an obstacle that most regulated companies struggle with.\n\nThe open, collaborative nature means that feedback is given more frequently and ideas get tailored for adoption by us faster than traditional product testing.\n\nWe set categories for which we are looking for solutions, all of which are designed to help develop our Systems Thinking plans and enable us to deliver a better service for customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about the world-/first water treatment process that came out of our Innovation Lab on page 75",

FIDO, which emerged from our second Lab programme to help tackle leakage detection, is becoming known as a disruptor in the global water sector, and we have first mover advantage on new developments. Following development with Typhon, we have recently completed installation of the world's first ever municipal UV LED disinfection system in operation at one of our water treatment works near Carlisle.\n\n>17,000 Jobs in the supply chain supported through our activities\n\n|                                                                                                                                      |                                   |                                                               | Against 2025        | Against 2025   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| Measure                                                                                                                              | 2025 target                       | Performance                                                   | Annual  performance | target         |\n| KPI:                                                                                                                                 |                                   |                                                               |                     |                |\n| Invoices paid within  60 days                                                                                                        | At least 95%                      | 99.34% 99.55%                                                 |                     |                |\n| Average time taken  to pay invoices                                                                                                  | <28days                           | 13 13                                                         |                     |                |\n| % suppliers in high  risk categories,  as identified by  sustainability risk assessments,  covered by enhanced  due diligence audits | 5%                                | Delivery  scheduled  from 2022 Delivery  scheduled  from 2021 |                     |                |\n| % of partner and strategic suppliers  that have  sustainability risk assessment in place                                             | 75%                               | 72% 35%                                                       |                     |                |\n| Supplier relationship  management score 90%                                                                                          |                                   | 54% 69%                                                       |                     |                |\n| % of targeted  suppliers signed up  to United Supply  Chain CIPS ethical mark                                                        | 100%                              | 90% 38%                                                       |                     |                |\n| Savings delivered  through innovation  and efficiency                                                                                | Retain annual  accreditation \u00a340m | Retained Retained \u00a36.388m  cumulative                         |                     |                |\n\n## Status key:\n\n## Annual performance\n\n## Against 2025 target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMet expectation/target\n\nConfident of meeting target\n\nClose to meeting expectation/target\n\nSome work to do\n\nBehind expectation/target\n\nTarget unobtainable\n\n## Performance key:\n\n2021/22 2020/21\n\n## 90%\n\nTargeted suppliers signed up to our United Supply Chain\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuppliers we have worked with through our Innovation Lab process\n\n>20\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStatus\n\n<!-- image -->",

Developed by Penrith firm Typhon, the technology is the only one of its kind capable of disinfecting drinking water supplies on a large scale.\n\nUltraviolet (UV) light is widely used in the drinking water treatment process to remove bacteria or tastes and odours caused by algae. However, until now, UV LED treatment systems had only been effective at treating small amounts of water for very low flows or domestic use. This project, two years in development, sees the world's first ever municipal UV LED disinfection system in operation at the site.\n\nHis Royal Highness met employees from both Typhon and United Utilities and discussed how the awardwinning system, with its advantages of superior safety, energy efficiency and low running costs, could help address safe access to water globally.\n\nTyphon CEO, Matt Simpson, said: 'We were honoured that His Royal Highness was interested to come and learn more about this hugely important leap for UV technology in the water industry. It was wonderful to be able to share the story of how a small local firm\n\nand the local water company have worked together to take the idea all the way through from demonstration scale to a marketable industrial application right here in Cumbria.\n\n'We explained how the process works, the challenges involved in developing such a unique disinfection solution, and the potential future benefits for the water industry globally and for high skilled employment opportunities in the North Lakes area.'\n\nOur head of innovation, Kieran Brocklebank, said: 'United Utilities is proving to be quite a force for innovation in the UK water sector thanks to our Innovation Lab programme, where we identify and incubate the best emerging technologies. Our relationship with Typhon is a real success story and we were delighted to help showcase what can be achieved when industry fully invests in the next generation of talent and ideas.'\n\nDelivering value for:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCustomers\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our performance in 2021/22\n\nFinancial performance\n\nRevenue for the year to 31 March 2022 increased by 3 per cent, mainly driven by higher non-household consumption as business activity has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Household bad debt has returned to 1.8 per cent of regulated revenue, lower than the 2.2 per cent last year and consistent with the level we were achieving prior to the pandemic, helped by our wide ranging affordability schemes and effective approach to managing cash collection. Operating profit was up \u00a38 million as the increase in revenue was largely offset by inflationary increases in power and other core costs.\n\nWhile inflation has increased our operating costs and net finance expense this year, it has also led to a higher level of financing outperformance and, together with the \u00a3765 million additional investment we have announced beyond the scope of our final determination, will deliver higher regulatory capital value (RCV) growth over the 2020-25 period.\n\nWe have doubled our base return on regulated equity (RoRE) for 2021/22, delivering strong performance on financing, tax and customer ODIs.\n\nWe benefit from having one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector, with an industryleading, fully funded pension scheme on a low dependency basis, a low level of customer debtor risk, and RCV gearing supporting a stable A3 credit rating with Moody's.\n\n## Revenue\n\n| 2021/22   | \u00a31,863m   |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| 2019/20   | \u00a31,859m   |\n| 2018/19   | \u00a31,819m   |\n| 2017/18   | \u00a31,736m   |\n\n## Underlying operating profit (1)\n\n| 2021/22   | \u00a3610m   |       |\n|-----------|---------|-------|\n| 2020/21   | \u00a3602m   |       |\n| 2019/20   |         | \u00a3732m |\n| 2018/19   | \u00a3678m   |       |\n| 2017/18   | \u00a3639m   |       |\n\n## Reported operating profit\n\n| 2021/22   | \u00a3610m   |\n|-----------|---------|\n| 2020/21   | \u00a3602m   |\n| 2019/20   | \u00a3630m   |\n| 2018/19   | \u00a3635m   |\n| 2017/18   | \u00a3636m   |\n\nRevenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRevenue was up \u00a355 million, at \u00a31,863 million, largely reflecting higher consumption as business activity returns to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn 2021/22 we have had a \u00a314 million reduction in the revenue cap, incorporating a 1.5 per cent real reduction in allowed wholesale revenues partly offset by a 0.6 per cent CPIH-linked increase.\n\nWith many more businesses able to operate compared with last year, when the impact of the initial lockdown was significant, non-household revenue has increased by \u00a3106 million. In contrast, consumption from households, although higher than pre-pandemic norms, has decreased \u00a358 million this year. This is due to significantly higher consumption particularly during the first half of last year reflecting the initial impact of people being locked down at home through the warm weather of late spring 2020.\n\n## Operating profit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpenses\n\n- * \u00a38m COVID-related costs was an estimate in the year ended 31 March 2021 because, with the passage of time and as conditions brought about by the pandemic have become embedded into normal business processes, the usefulness of tracking COVID-related costs speci/fically has diminished./.null\n\nUnderlying and reported operating profit at \u00a3610 million was \u00a38 million higher than last year. The \u00a355 million increase in revenue was mostly offset by higher power costs and inflationary pressures increasing our underlying cost base, predominantly in respect of materials and labour.\n\nWe have a reduction of around \u00a38 million in operating costs as last year saw additional one-off costs incurred in adapting to operate through the pandemic.\n\nThe \u00a317 million of additional costs driving ODI performance are targeted at improving performance against specific customer ODIs, such as spend associated with Dynamic Network Management.\n\nPower costs have increased by \u00a316 million this year, largely in relation to higher prices. Power is a significant cost for our business, which is why we manage this risk through a progressive policy of hedging the commodity price element of power costs to minimise short term volatility (commodity price makes up around half of our annual power costs, with the other half relating to the use-of-system charge and other levies). Through this hedging policy and self-generation, we locked in the cost on the majority of our consumption for 2021/22 before the most recent energy price rises, securing an average rate of \u00a365 per megawatt hour (MWh) for the year, which is",

We are also locked-in on over 90 per cent of expected consumption for 2022/23, and around two-thirds of expected consumption across the final two years of AMP7, at rates that compare favourably to the current market rate.\n\nCost increases of \u00a316 million largely stem from higher inflation in the period. We are not immune to the impact of the current high inflation environment, but through hedging, constructive cost challenge and commercial negotiations, we have managed to mitigate much of the cost increase to date.\n\nDuring the year, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) published clarifications on how arrangements in respect of a specific part of cloud technology Software as a Service - should be accounted for, resulting in \u00a36 million of costs that would previously have been accounted for as fixed asset additions now being treated as operating costs.\n\nHousehold bad debt is back at our lowest ever level of 1.8 per cent of regulated revenue, having reduced from 2.2 per cent in the year to 31 March 2021 as we return to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n## Profit before tax\n\nUnderlying profit before tax was \u00a3302 million, \u00a3158 million lower than last year. This reflects the \u00a38 million increase in underlying operating profit and a decrease in the share of losses of joint ventures of \u00a38 million, more than offset by a \u00a3174 million increase in underlying net finance expense. Underlying profit before tax reflects consistently applied presentational adjustments as outlined on pages 82 to 83.\n\nReported profit before tax decreased by \u00a3111 million to \u00a3440 million reflecting the \u00a38 million increase in reported operating profit and an \u00a38 million decrease in the share of losses of joint ventures, more than offset by a \u00a390 million increase in reported net finance expense (including fair value movements), and the inclusion last year of a \u00a337 million profit on disposal of our share in the joint venture AS Tallinna Vesi.\n\n## Net finance expense\n\nThe underlying net finance expense of \u00a3306 million was \u00a3174 million higher than last year, mainly due to the non-cash impact of significantly higher inflation on our index-linked debt.\n\nRegulatory capital value (RCV) gearing (2) 61%\n\nTotal dividend per ordinary share (pence)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n43.5p\n\n(1)\n\nA guide to APMs and a reconciliation between underlying profit and reported profit is shown on pages 82 to 83.\n\n(2)  Gearing calculated as group net debt/United Utilities Water Limited shadow RCV (adjusted for actual spend and timing difference).\n\nThe indexation of principal on index-linked debt, excluding the impact of inflation swaps, amounted to a net charge in the income statement of \u00a3228 million, compared with a net charge of \u00a353 million last year, resulting in an increase of \u00a3175 million. Interest on non index-linked debt of \u00a3110 million is consistent with last year, while various smaller year-on-year increases and decreases broadly offset against one another when considered together.\n\nThe \u00a3306 million underlying net finance expense included in the income statement for the year compares with \u00a3118 million net cash interest paid included in the statement of cash flows. This \u00a3188 million difference is due to non-cash inflation uplifts on index-linked debt and derivatives of \u00a3256 million, less capitalised borrowing costs of \u00a353 million and net pension interest income of \u00a314 million, both of which are non-cash items.\n\nReported net finance expense of \u00a3168 million was \u00a390 million higher than last year, reflecting the \u00a3174 million increase in underlying net finance expense, partially offset by an \u00a384 million increase in net fair value gains on our debt and derivative portfolio, excluding interest on derivatives and debt under fair value option, from \u00a354 million last year to \u00a3138 million this year.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nFor the year to 31 March 2022, we recognised a \u00a32 million loss in the income statement relating to our joint venture Water Plus, compared with a \u00a39 million net share of losses from joint ventures last year, which included a share of profits from the AS Tallinna Vesi joint venture prior to its disposal. In the year to 31 March 2021, we also recognised a \u00a337 million profit on disposal of our share in AS Tallinna Vesi, which was completed on 31 March 2021.\n\nFurther details can be found in note 12 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nHousehold bad debt as a proportion of regulated revenue 1.8%",

The reduction in underlying tax reflects a \u00a373 million tax credit relating to optimising the available research and development UK tax allowances on innovation-related expenditure we had incurred in prior years, and the impact of the capital allowance 'super deductions' announced in the March 2021 Chancellors Budget, which lowers the current tax charge significantly in the current period.\n\nThe group has a reported loss after tax of \u00a357 million this year, compared with a \u00a3453 million reported profit after tax last year. This \u00a3510 million difference reflects the \u00a3111 million decrease in reported profit before tax, and a \u00a3544 million increase in deferred tax largely due to a one-off charge to restate the brought forward deferred tax liability at the new 25 per cent future headline rate, partially offset by a \u00a3145 million positive movement in current tax primarily as a result of adjustments in respect of optimising available tax incentives on our innovationrelated expenditure in prior years. Reported basic earnings per share decreased from 66.5 pence to (8.3) pence.\n\n## Tax\n\nThe group continues to be fully committed to paying its fair share of tax and acting in an open and transparent manner in relation to its tax affairs and we were delighted to have retained the Fair Tax Mark independent certification for a third year, having been only the second FTSE 100 company to be awarded the Fair Tax Mark in July 2019.\n\nIn addition to corporation tax, the group pays significant other contributions to the public finances on its own behalf as well as collecting and paying over further amounts for its over 5,000 strong workforce. The total payments for 2021/22 were around \u00a3230 million and included business rates, employment taxes, environmental taxes and other regulatory service fees such as water abstraction charges as well as corporation tax.\n\nIn 2021/22, we paid corporation tax of around \u00a39 million, which represents an effective cash tax rate on underlying profits of 3 per cent, which is 16 per cent lower than the headline rate of corporation tax of 19 per cent. The key reconciling item to the headline rate of corporation tax continues to be allowable tax deductions on capital investment including the new temporary capital allowance 'super deductions', where the current year tax benefit was around \u00a340m representing a 13 per cent reduction to the effective cash tax rate. We expect a similar tax benefit from the temporary super deduction regime for 2023 as well.\n\nWe have expressed the effective cash tax rate in terms of underlying profits as this measure excludes fair value movements on debt and derivative instruments and thereby enables a medium-term cash tax rate forecast. We expect the average cash tax rate on underlying profits to remain below the headline rate of tax for the medium term.\n\nFor 2021/22, the group recognised an overall current tax credit of \u00a366 million in 2021/22. This includes a current tax charge relating to 2021/22 of \u00a37 million this year, compared with \u00a380 million in the previous year, key reconciling items being the lower taxable profits and the availability of capital allowance 'super deductions' for 2021/22. In addition, in the current year, there were prior period tax credits of \u00a373 million, compared with \u00a31 million in 2020/21. The current year credit mainly relates to optimising the available research and development UK tax allowances on our innovationrelated expenditure for multiple prior years.\n\nFor 2021/22, the group recognised a deferred tax charge of \u00a3562 million, compared with \u00a318 million for 2020/21. For 2021/22, \u00a3403 million relates to the government's planned increase in the rate of corporation tax from 19 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 April 2023. Subject to any legislative or tax practice changes, we would expect the total effective tax rate to continue to be broadly in line with the headline rate of corporation tax for the medium term.\n\nIn 2021/22, there are \u00a3136 million of tax adjustments recorded within other comprehensive income, primarily relating to remeasurement movements on the group's defined benefit pension schemes. As in the prior year the rate at which the deferred tax liabilities are measured on the group's defined benefit pension scheme is 35 per cent, being the rate applicable to refunds from a trust.\n\n## Dividend per share\n\nThe board has proposed a final dividend of 29.0 pence per ordinary share in respect of the year ended 31 March 2022. Taken together with the interim dividend of 14.5 pence per ordinary share, paid in February, this results in a total dividend per ordinary share for 2021/22 of 43.5 pence. This is an increase of 0.6 per cent compared with the dividend relating to last year, in line with the group's dividend policy of targeting a growth rate of CPIH inflation each year through to 2025. The 0.6 per cent increase is based on the CPIH element included within allowed regulated revenue for the 2021/22 financial year (i.e. the movement in CPIH between November 2019 and November 2020).\n\nThe final dividend is expected to be paid on 1 August 2022 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 June 2022. The ex-dividend date is 23 June 2022. The election date for the Dividend Reinvestment Plan is 11 July 2022.",

The group's net capital expenditure was \u00a3627 million, principally in the regulated water and wastewater investment programmes. This excludes infrastructure renewals expenditure, which is treated as an operating cost.\n\n## Pensions\n\nAs at 31 March 2022, the group had an IAS 19 net pension surplus of \u00a31,017 million, compared with a surplus of \u00a3689 million at 31 March 2021. This \u00a3328 million increase principally reflects an increase in credit spreads during the year, partially offset by a higher inflation assumption. The group has de-risked its pension schemes through hedging strategies applied to the underlying interest rate and future inflation. The IAS 19 position remains volatile to changes in credit spread and changes in mortality, neither of which have been hedged at this current time. This is primarily due to difficulties hedging against credit spread volatility over long durations, and, for mortality, there is lower volatility in the short term and relatively high hedging costs. The scheme specific funding basis does not suffer volatility due to credit spread movements to the same extent as it uses a prudent, fixed credit spread assumption.\n\nFurther detail on pensions is provided in note 18 ('Retirement benefits') of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Financing\n\n(34.5)\n\nNet debt at 31 March 2022 was \u00a37,570 million, compared with \u00a37,306 million at 31 March 2021. This comprises gross borrowings with a carrying value of \u00a37,980 million net of cash and short-term deposits of \u00a3241 million and net derivative assets hedging specific debt instruments of \u00a3169 million. 7,067.3 (1,005.5) 645.3 (4.9) (12.0)\n\n195.2\n\nUnderlying movements in net debt are largely a result of net operating cash inflows offset by our net capital expenditure, dividends, indexation and cash interest.\n\nLoans\n\nto joint\n\nventures\n\nGearing, measured as group net debt divided by UUW's shadow (adjusted for actual spend and timing difference) regulatory capital value of \u00a312.4 billion, was 61 per cent at 31 March 2022. This is slightly lower than gearing of 62 per cent as at 31 March 2021, and remains comfortably within our target range of 55 to 65 per cent.

In recent years, in response to Ofwat's decision to transition away from RPI inflation linkage, the group has entered into a number of transactions swapping RPI-linked cash flows to CPI-linked cash flows or swapping floating rate cash flows to CPI-linked cash flows. As a result, including these swaps, the group has RPI-linked debt exposure of \u00a33.1 billion at an average real rate of 1.3 per cent, and \u00a31.1 billion of CPI or CPIH-linked debt exposure at an average real rate of -0.6 per cent. 100.8 60.9 58.8 5.5 7,361.4\n\nA significantly higher RPI inflation charge compared with the same period last year contributed to the group's average effective interest rate of 5.1 per cent being higher than the rate of 2.5 per cent last year. The average underlying interest rate represents the underlying net finance expense adjusted for capitalised borrowing costs and net pension interest income, divided by average notional debt. More information on this can be found on page 83. 284.5\n\nThe group has fixed the interest rates on its non index-linked debt in line with its 10-year reducing balance basis at a net effective nominal interest rate of 2.2 to 2.4 per cent for the remainder of the AMP7 regulatory period.

United Utilities PLC's (UU PLC's) senior unsecured debt obligations are rated Baa1 with Moody's, A- with Fitch and BBB- with S&P, all on stable outlook.\n\n## Debt financing\n\nThe group has access to the international debt capital markets through its \u00a310 billion medium-term note (MTN) programme. The MTN programme is updated at least annually and this year's update was completed in November 2021, at which time the previous \u20ac7 billion euro programme limit was increased and redenominated to \u00a310 billion. The MTN programme does not represent a funding commitment, with funding dependent on the successful issue of the notes.\n\nIn total over 2020-25, we expect to raise around \u00a32.7 billion to cover refinancing and incremental debt, supporting our five-year investment programme. So far in AMP7, we have raised around \u00a31.4 billion, taking advantage of attractive rates available and extending our liquidity position (as at 31 March 2022) out to February 2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA3\n\ncredit rating with Moody's\n\nIn November 2020, we published our new sustainable finance framework, through which we expect to raise financing based on our strong ESG credentials alongside conventional issuance. This replaces the green funding we have previously secured through the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is no longer available post-Brexit. We issued our debut sustainable bond in January 2021, raising \u00a3300 million maturing in October 2029 and subsequently swapped to CPI-linkage.\n\nIn August 2021, we raised around \u00a374 million of term funding via the issue off our MTN programme of a JPY11 billion privately placed note swapped to GBP with a nine-year maturity, and in September 2021 we priced a \u00a3100 million fixed note with a seven-year maturity, the proceeds of which were received in early October.\n\nIn April 2022, we raised \u00a3100 million of term funding with an eight-year maturity via a bilateral loan with Export Development Canada (EDC).  AAA-rated EDC is the Canadian Government's Export Development Agency that looks to promote trade with Canadian firms worldwide. This follows collaboration with EDC in relation to some of the innovation activities that we have undertaken, and we expect such collaboration to continue.\n\nSince March 2021, we have extended \u00a3100 million of revolving credit facilities for a further year, renewed \u00a3100 million of revolving credit facilities for a further fiveyear term and entered into \u00a350 million of new revolving credit facilities for a five-year term. The group has also amended the documentation for all of its existing revolving credit facilities to remove references to LIBOR and replace with SONIA.\n\n## Interest rate management\n\nLong-term borrowings are structured or hedged to match assets and earnings, which are largely in sterling, indexed to UK price inflation, and subject to regulatory price reviews every five years.\n\nLong-term sterling inflation index-linked debt provides a natural hedge to assets and earnings. At 31 March 2022, approximately 41 per cent of the group's net debt was in RPI-linked form, representing around 25 per cent of UUW's regulatory capital value (RCV), with an average real interest rate of 1.3 per cent. A further 15 per cent of the group's net debt was in CPI or CPIH-linked form, representing around nine per cent of UUW's RCV, with an average real rate of -0.6 per cent. The long-term nature of this funding also provides a good match to the company's long-life infrastructure assets and is a key contributor to the group's average term debt maturity profile, which is around 18 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n18 years\n\naverage term debt to maturity",

        "page_content": "Our inflation hedging policy is to target around 50 per cent of net debt to be maintained in index-linked form. This reflects a balanced assessment across a range of factors.\n\nWhere nominal debt is raised in a currency other than sterling and/or with a fixed interest rate, the debt is generally swapped to create a floating rate sterling liability for the term of the debt. To manage exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group fixes underlying interest costs on nominal debt out to ten years on a reducing balance basis.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nShort-term liquidity requirements are met from the group's normal operating cash flow and its short-term bank deposits and supported by committed but undrawn credit facilities. Our MTN programme provides further support.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, we had liquidity out to February 2025, comprising cash and short-term deposits, plus committed undrawn revolving credit facilities. This gives us flexibility in terms of when and how further debt finance is raised to help refinance maturing debt and support the delivery of our regulatory capital investment programme. In October 2021, UUW prepaid a \u00a3100 million floating rate loan a year ahead of its scheduled maturity, this being efficient use of our available liquidity.\n\nWe consider that we operate a prudent approach to managing banking counterparty risk. Counterparty risk, in relation to both cash deposits and derivatives, is controlled through the use of counterparty credit limits. Our cash is held in the form of short-term money market deposits with prime commercial banks.\n\nWe operate a bilateral rather than a syndicated approach to our core relationship banking facilities.  This approach spreads maturities more evenly over a longer time period, thereby reducing refinancing risk and providing the benefit of several renewal points rather than a large single refinancing requirement.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe have delivered another good year of performance, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction underpinned by our Systems Thinking approach, improving operational performance, and long-term financial resilience, giving us confidence in our ability to continue to create value for customers, the environment, and other stakeholders.\n\nLiquidity to Liquidity to\n\nFebruary 2025 February 2025\n\nWe are accelerating our AMP7 capital programme and investing an additional \u00a3765 million over the regulatory period to help us deliver even more sustainable improvements in customer and environmental performance, and to get ahead of the requirements coming into force through the Environment Act. This investment, together with latest views of inflation, contributes to RCV growth over AMP7 of 21 per cent on a nominal basis, more than 10 per cent higher than we expected at the beginning of the period.\n\nOur sustained high level of operational performance is earning outperformance, and we have increased our target of cumulative net outperformance against customer ODIs by a third to around \u00a3200 million in total over AMP7. As a consequence of our performance in AMP7 and the additional investment we are making, we are generating around \u00a3750 million of value that we expect to receive through an RCV uplift and additional revenues in the 2025-30 period (AMP8).\n\n## 2022/23 full-year guidance\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue is expected to be around 1 per cent higher than 2021/22, largely reflecting the November 2021 CPIH inflation of 4.6 per cent, largely offset by the regulatory revenue reduction of 1.3 per cent and over-recovery in the current year due to higher than anticipated consumption.\n- \u00b7 Underlying operating costs are expected to be around \u00a3100 million higher year-on-year. Approximately half of this increase relates to inflationary cost pressures on labour, chemicals and other contract costs, while the other half largely reflects the 2022/23 operating cost impact of the \u00a3765 million additional investment.\n- \u00b7 Underlying finance expense is expected to be around \u00a3150 million higher year-on-year based on our current inflation forecast. As at 31 March 2022, we had \u00a34.3 billion of index-linked debt exposure, therefore every 1 per cent increase in inflation equates to an around \u00a343 million higher interest charge. Our cash interest in 2021/22 was \u00a3118 million and we expect this to be broadly the same in 2022/23, with the overall increase in underlying net finance expense largely relating to the non-cash indexation of our index-linked debt. Our cash metrics therefore remain strong and the higher inflation will also apply to our RCV, of which 70 per cent is exposed to the benefits of higher inflation, giving shareholders around a 1.75 times leveraged position to inflation.\n- \u00b7 Underlying tax is expected to be a small charge of up to \u00a310 million in 2022/23, as we continue to optimise the use of capital allowance 'super deductions'.\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure (capex) in 2022/23 is expected to be in the range of \u00a3640 million to \u00a3690 million, including the 2022/23 element of incremental capital expenditure in relation to the \u00a3765 million additional investment.\n- \u00b7 We are targeting a net customer ODI reward of around \u00a330 million, which is consistent with our updated investment plans and guidance of around \u00a3200 million reward in total over AMP7.\n- \u00b7 Our AMP7 dividend policy is to grow the dividend in line with CPIH inflation out to 2025, which for 2022/23 would equate to an increase of 4.6 per cent based on November 2021 CPIH inflation.",

In making this adjustment it is appropriate to add back interest on derivatives and debt under fair  value option to provide a view of the group's cost of debt which is better aligned to the return on capital  it earns through revenue. Taking these factors into account, management believes it is useful to adjust for  these fair value movements to provide a more representative view of performance. |\n| Deferred tax adjustment                                                                                                               | Management adjusts to exclude the impact of deferred tax in order to provide a more representative  view of the group's profit after tax and tax charge for the year given that the regulatory model allows  for cash tax to be recovered through revenues, with future revenues allowing for cash tax including the  unwinding of any deferred tax balance as it becomes current. By making this adjustment, the group's  underlying tax charge does not include tax that will be recovered through revenues in future periods,  thus reducing the impact of timing differences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Tax in respect of  adjustments to underlying  profit before tax                                                                       | Management adjusts for the tax impacts of the above adjusted items to provide a more representative  view of current year performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |",

Here we report on our latest progress and plans on cutting emissions to reduce future climate change, known as climate mitigation, and how we are maintaining and improving our resilience to climate change, known as climate adaptation.\n\nOur business, and the communities we serve, has already experienced the impacts of climate change, including several record-breaking weather events that caused impacts such as flooding, power cuts and travel disruption. Risks associated with flooding are heightened in the North West because it is the wettest region in the country, and this is projected to increase with climate change.

The proposed tunnelling solution has been assessed as having one of the lowest environmental and carbon impacts of all options considered, with further opportunities identified to recycle materials to local sites thus reducing impacts from vehicle movements.\n\n## Surface water separation Blackpool south\n\nWe have invested over \u00a330 million to address the combined challenges of climate change, an ageing Victorian sewer network, and increasing urbanisation in Blackpool.\n\nThe primary objective of this project was to separate surface water from the combined sewer system. New infrastructure was constructed, including a storm water interception tank, pumping stations, and a new sea outfall to provide a sustainable discharge point for surface waters. This will prevent over 800,000m/three.numr of surface water from entering the combined sewer system during wet weather. By diverting the surface water away, the flooding risks posed by storms due to the resulting excess volume of wastewater have been significantly reduced.",

As board members, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer both show personal leadership for the impact of climate change on our capacity and capability to deliver our services. Climate change-related matters have always been of interest to the corporate responsibility committee in its role to scrutinise environmental topics and initiatives. This year, climate change matters have also been discussed by the audit committee (review of carbon commitments risk) and remuneration committee (linking long-term incentive outcomes to the delivery of carbon pledges).\n\n## Management role\n\nCEO Steve Mogford has ultimate responsibility for the group's preparedness for adapting to climate change and driving our mitigation strategy. CFO Phil Aspin has executive responsibility for risk management and is supported in this role by the head of audit and risk and the corporate risk manager. Along with the executive team, they are tasked with managing the risks and mitigating actions, for example by ensuring the company has the\n\nnecessary financial resources and skilled people are in place to achieve its climate-related objectives.\n\nOur climate change mitigation strategy starts with 'vision and visibility', reflecting that consideration of climate is becoming an essential factor in both day-to-day and strategic decision-making and behaviours. All of the principal management committees have discussed climate-related matters this year. For example, our leadership team has tracked the delivery of our carbon pledges as part of the quarterly business reviews and initiated a trial of a low emission fuel HVO as a result. The capital investment committee is working to integrate climate issues into its decision-making processes including a carbon reduction incentive for capital programme delivery partners.\n\nIn 2021/22, we held two deepdive workshops to build executive team knowledge and awareness of carbon. This resulted in a refresh of our climate change mitigation governance and the creation of new director-led working groups. These focus on maturing our decisionmaking and delivering reductions of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while developing our future climaterelated strategy and engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This framework is used to identify and assess climaterelated risks. We consider both physical risks, identified as those related to climate change impacts on our operations or assets, and transitional risks, which are those associated with the necessary transition to a low-carbon economy (e.g. changes to policies, regulation and legislation).\n\nWe use a variety of approaches to assess risks, such as risk breakdown structures and PESTLE. We use complex modelling of the physical impacts of climate change in our water resources and drainage management planning, and incorporate Met Office UK climate projections. In our assessment of materiality we recognise that some risk events may happen multiple times so we compare impacts over a long-term (40-year) horizon. This accentuates where climate change, and other demographic changes, influence the frequency of events as well as the consequences.\n\nWe have found that horizon scanning for industry research and emerging legal and regulatory changes are particularly useful when considering transitional risks. In our revision of the carbon commitments risk, we incorporated the updated carbon values provided by the department for Business, Energy and Industrial strategy (BEIS). Applying these values resulted in an escalation of the risk to the executive team and board who re-evaluated our response to ensure we continue to effectively manage the risk. Incorporating longer-term climate change impacts explicitly in our corporate risk framework has raised the profile of climate change, allowing the board to consider our appetite and capacity to mitigate and control the risks from within existing risk management processes and with the same thresholds for materiality.\n\n## Managing climaterelated risks\n\nBy recognising the causes and consequences, and assessing the likelihood and the severity of impact (both financial and reputational) should the event occur, we are able to prioritise climate-related risks and take proactive and early action to reduce the frequency and severity.\n\nAs climate change is a common causal factor for our principal risks (see pages 104 to 105), a review of all event-based risks in our business risk profile was undertaken to assess their sensitivity to climate change. The most sensitive risks are outlined on page 90 and more details, including discussion and examples of activities to mitigate and control for these risks, can be found in our latest adaptation progress report.\n\n## Organisational resilience to climate change\n\nIn preparing each of our three adaptation progress reports, we assessed the organisation's resilience to specific outcomes of climate change, such as hotter, drier summers and more extreme weather events. We identified over 90 risks that could impact a single business area, for instance wastewater, but we also noted business-wide risks, interdependencies and transitional risks. The outcome of the latest assessment was 79 new or existing mitigating actions listed in our adaptation report along with an update on what has been done to manage the risk to date.\n\nWe are maturing our understanding of risk and uncertainty to build and maintain long-term resilience across the corporate, financial and operational structures of the group. Looking ahead, we will explore how innovation can help us to learn more about the profile of risk events, their causes and consequences, and to identify opportunities to improve our capacity and capability. This will help us to identify where climate risks remain uncertain or where existing controls might be inadequate to manage the risk in the long term. This will help us to be better prepared by prioritising issues.",

We expect this will significantly restrict the window of permitted recycling of biosolids to agriculture, and therefore exceed the climate change impact we have previously assessed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We undertake planning for long (25+ years), medium (5-10 years), and short-term (one year) horizons, enabling us to account for external drivers including climate change, while continuing to fulfil our purpose in a resilient and adaptable way. Our planning horizons are further described on pages 48 to 49.\n\n## Short-term climate issues\n\nExtreme weather events such as periods of hot and dry weather, cold snaps and heavy rain events impact our ability to deliver our services. Climate change is already increasing the frequency of these events (see page 93), exacerbating the impact of existing risks such as sewer flooding, asset flooding and asset deterioration as can be seen in the current top ten event-based risks shown on pages 106 to 107.\n\nThe North West has felt the significant damage caused by numerous extreme storms over recent years. The region has 28 per cent more rainfall than the average for England and Wales and climate change will further increase the likelihood and severity of intense storms. There is also a significantly higher proportion of combined sewers so, together, this means more pressure on sewerage and treatment infrastructure, and relatively more risk from sewer flooding and/or pollution from storm overflows. Managing the risk of flooding is a priority for us and other agencies in the North West.\n\n## Medium and long-term impact of climate change\n\nPredicting the effects of climate change is complex, with greater uncertainty about how our infrastructure will respond to the challenges presented by both climate and demographic changes. We considered the implications of climate change to our business risk profile to ascertain which risks were sensitive to climate change in that climate change would increase their likelihood or severity. To quantify the risk we used the highly respected and relevant Met Office UK Climate Projections 2018 (UKCP18) for\n\nweather in the North West. There are four main pathways used for climate modelling and research, each describing climate futures related to the volume of greenhouse gases emitted. For our climate sensitivity assessment we chose the Met Office climate projections for the representative concentration pathway, RCP 6.0, which has an emissions peak occurring in 2080 and an expected 3.0-3.5 o C increase in global mean temperatures from pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on our business strategy and planning\n\nWe have taken a twin track approach to addressing climate change in our business strategy and planning (see page 93). We account for the costs and benefits, of both mitigation and adaptation and in this way manage both physical and transitional climate risks as we deliver our services in a sustainable and resilient way.\n\n## Adapting to physical risks\n\nAll six of the risks most sensitive to climate change are physical risks, meaning they are disruptive or destructive to our operations or assets. This means there are tangible controls that can be put in place to improve our resistance to weather events, enhance our response and recovery preparations and realise opportunities.\n\nWe are applying a systems thinking approach which recognises the complex interdependencies within our business functions and externally across society. This means that interventions to address one risk have multiple benefits. For instance, sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) to slow down or divert rainwater run-off both reduce the risk of sewer flooding and optimise wastewater treatment capacity. Green infrastructure solutions such as SuDS provide an opportunity to deliver wider social value in the community and local environment.",

We are part of the global leadership community that is working to encourage everyone to contribute to achieving the global goal to curb emissions.\n\nIn response, our climate change mitigation strategy has four pillars (see page 91). Our focus this year has been to consolidate our ambition and commitments and to enhance the visibility and understanding of climate impacts both within the organisation and to our external stakeholders. We were proud to be the first UK water company to have its targets verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and used this to drive communication and engagement. We held deepdive sessions with the executive team, developed and launched an employee e-learning module, and had net zero as a theme in our latest Innovation Lab, in which we challenge and collaborate with new suppliers.\n\nClimate change was a topic in our CEO graduate challenge. A team of graduates focused on helping mature plans towards a net zero future by developing a tool to estimate process emissions on a site-by-site basis, promoting our carbon pledges to employees through a social media campaign, and compiling a database of over 200 potential emission reduction opportunities that we are now exploring as part of our mitigation delivery plans.\n\n## Resilience of our strategies\n\nWeather is fundamental to how our water, wastewater and bioresources operations function so it is critical we make our assets, systems and strategies climate-ready. More frequent extreme weather events increase the risk of cascade impacts. Multiple different extreme weather events can occur in a single short time frame, such as storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin in February 2022. Our ability to recognise the compound physical impacts to our system, and have various recovery tactics, is increasingly vital in effective climate change adaptation.\n\nOur public Water Resources Management Plan (WRMP) and Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan (DWMP) are examples of where adaptive planning, incorporating climate change scenarios and advanced modelling, are used to shape our plans for the long term (25+ years) whilst staying aligned with our short-term needs. In these plans we describe how we have used complex models to test how resilient our services would be against a range of possible future climate change and demand scenarios (population growth and movement, economic trends and patterns of water use). Understanding these impacts allows us to adapt our plans to improve performance and resilience across key topic areas such as water supply, leakage, sewer flooding and pollution. For example, we have decided to invest to ensure certain drought options are always available, minimising the time it takes to bring them online during dry weather conditions. This will enable us to react more quickly and make supplies more resilient during dry weather. Together with reducing demand through leakage and water efficiency, this has reduced the likelihood of requiring drought permits and temporary use bans.\n\nAs well as targeted scenario analysis in WRMP and DWMP, we have developed three companywide alternative scenarios for 2050, incorporating combinations of key factors that are both highly relevant and uncertain. These scenarios, named 'climate chaos', 'green guardianship' and 'public purpose', have associated metrics to define possible futures for water and wastewater services in the North West. The scenarios recognise climate change as one of the most critical factors shaping future services and use RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 (GHG concentration pathways adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change) to describe how well climate change has been mitigated by society in each case. These different scenarios have provided a simple way to understand the interaction of multiple factors so we can enhance resilience, help manage future uncertainty and shape long-term decisions.\n\nNote: The forward-looking scenario analyses above reflect uncertainties about the timing and magnitude of climate change in specific contexts and efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which are without historical precedent. Scenarios are hypothetical constructs and are not intended or designed to represent a full description of the future or deliver precise outcomes; they are not forecasts or predictions, nor are they sensitivity analyses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Achieved our pledge 6.\n- \u00b7 Delivered pledge 2: 100 per cent of electricity purchased has been renewable since October 2021.\n- \u00b7 Reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2.2 per cent (gross) and 3.5 per cent (net) compared to our baseline year 2019/20.\n- \u00b7 Improved data collection and tracking of fuel use enabling targeted interventions.\n\n## Future focus\n\n- \u00b7 Data improvements for scope 3 emissions with more supplier and product-based estimates, rather than spend-based.\n- \u00b7 Work to validate our long-term net zero ambition to the new SBTi Net Zero Standard.\n- \u00b7 Use BEIS carbon values as an internal carbon price in our planning for medium and long-term investments, including PR24 (e.g. for 2030 we use the low case value of \u00a3140/tCO/uni2082e).\n- Read more about delivery of our six carbon pledges on pages 86 to 87\n- Read more about 2021/22 greenhouse gas emissions and performance against our SBTs on pages 96 to 97\n- Read more about our 2021/22 operational performance on pages 52 to 75 and also in our annual performance report on our website\n\n## Metrics to assess climate-related risks\n\nOur vulnerability to climate-related risks is determined by two factors: the physical and transitional impacts we experience and the control measures we have put in place to manage the risks and realise opportunities. To manage our physical risks effectively we must track and understand patterns of weather, and weather events, and learn how they can affect us operationally. To do this we have been working with the Met Office to use both their short-term forecasts and longer-term projections, planning for up to a 4\u00b0C change in global temperature. We monitor factors relating to transitional risks, including energy pricing (of both fossil fuels and low carbon alternatives), carbon pricing (through purchasable credits, offsets and certificates), and the marketplace for the availability and cost of alternative fuelled vehicles, batteries and for emerging technologies to reduce process and fugitive emissions.\n\n## Metrics to manage climate-related risks\n\nWe manage our climate-related risks by putting in place controls such as those as set out on page 90 and in Appendix A.3 of the climate change adaptation report. The effectiveness of these controls is seen in our operational performance metrics. The following metrics are recognised as key to our resilience to a changing climate and are reported in the annual performance report:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 External flooding incidents;\n- \u00b7 Hydraulic external flood risk resilience;\n- \u00b7 Hydraulic internal flood risk resilience;\n- \u00b7 Internal sewer flooding;\n- \u00b7 Leakage;\n- \u00b7 Per capita consumption;\n- \u00b7 Raising customer awareness to reduce the risk of flooding;\n- \u00b7 Areas of low water pressure;\n- \u00b7 Risk of severe restrictions in a drought;\n- \u00b7 Risk of sewer flooding in a storm;\n- \u00b7 Sewer collapses;\n- \u00b7 Unplanned outages;\n- \u00b7 Water service resilience; and\n- \u00b7 Water supply interruptions.\n\n## Science-based targets\n\nWe have a strong track record of playing our part to mitigate climate change and have reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by over 70 per cent since 2005/06, largely through our substantial investment in renewable power generation and green energy procurement. Our ambition and commitments are based on international guidance and climate science and we were delighted in July 2021 that our four near-term science-based targets were verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In October, the remainder of our purchased electricity switched to a renewable tariff backed by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin certificates, meaning that in the future 100 per cent of our purchased electricity will be from renewable sources enabling us to deliver on our carbon pledge and our SBT. The SBTi Net Zero Standard was launched in late 2021 and we have committed to validate our 2050 ambition to this standard when we revise and revalidate our near-term targets in advance of 2025.\n\nAs well as our company-specific science-based targets, we share the UK water sector ambition for key operational emissions to be net zero from 2030. Note that this target has a smaller scope than SBTi and allows use of purchased credits, using agreed offsetting principles.",

This includes subsidiaries listed in section A8 on page 260.\n\n## Energy strategy\n\nOur energy management strategy has four objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Efficient use of energy;\n- \u00b7 Maximising self-generation and direct supply opportunities;\n- \u00b7 Reducing costs (through time of use); and\n- \u00b7 Supply resilience to ensure we can deliver our services.\n\nIn 2021/22, we set a record for renewable energy generation of 210 GWh through focus on end-toend performance of our bioresources operations, which produce electricity, heat and biomethane. We completed more solar installations during the year.\n\nEach year we serve a growing population, driving increased energy use as we strive to achieve environmental performance targets. We seek to mitigate this through our energy management programme and in recent years have maintained consistent energy use in the face of these considerable upward pressures.\n\n## Energy efficiency actions taken\n\nOur approach to energy efficiency is based on continuous improvement of:\n\n- \u00b7 people - optimising ways of working;\n- \u00b7 systems - improving visibility of use and analysis of data systems; and\n- \u00b7 technology - targeted investment to remove technological inefficiencies.\n\nOur Energy Management Programme is now firmly established and working well after activities were restricted during COVID-19. The programme carries out site-based workshops and develops ways of working to optimise operations at sites and local area and is underpinned by e-learning packages and a comprehensive energy performance reporting and analysis capability.\n\nTo support reporting and analysis, we have invested over recent years to capture data from our fiscal meters and have installed thousands of sub-meters. The resulting data is used to identify opportunities, assess impacts and benefits of trials and maintain good performance. We are piloting analytics to support pump optimisation interventions.\n\nWe have a dedicated investment programme to implement targeted energy saving opportunities for existing operations and we focus on ensuring efficient outcomes from our capital programme. Examples of invest-to-save projects include pump optimisation, time-of-use actions and improved control of wastewater treatment.\n\n## Electricity use, purchase and self generation (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGenerated: CHP plus gas to grid\n\nGenerated: solar, wind and hydro\n\nPurchased: non renewable\n\nPurchased: renewable\n\nTotal electricity used\n\n- (1) Electricity purchased plus self generated is in excess of that used.

We include scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions only in this measure. We also report the regulated emissions kilograms CO 2 equivalent per megalitre treated (using the location-based method as calculated in the CAW v16), as these are common metrics for our industry.\n\n## Scope 1 emissions\n\nWastewater and sludge processes cause 73 per cent of our scope 1 emissions as the gases released, nitrous oxide (N 2 0) and methane (CH 4 ) have much greater global warming potentials than carbon dioxide (CO 2 ).\n\nOur process emissions are currently estimated as a direct function of the amount of wastewater we treat. We are undertaking research with other UK water companies to better quantify these emissions from measured values and to find ways to reduce or capture those emissions for beneficial use.\n\nWe are investigating and trialling ways to reduce our use of fossil fuels, including for transport, through both efficiencies and use of alternative fuels.\n\n## Scope 2 emissions\n\nOur market-based scope 2 emissions have halved this year because we switched our remaining non-renewable purchased electricity to a renewable tariff in October 2021. Next year these emissions will be negligible.\n\n## Scope 3 emissions\n\nLike most organisations, most of our scope 3 emissions are in GHG Protocol category 1 (products and services) and category 2 (capital goods); the latter being those provided by our construction services suppliers. We currently calculate category 1 and 2 emissions using records of the amount we have spent. This provides an indicative estimate but does not show the GHG impact of management choices, instead fluctuating with the scale of our investment programme. This can be seen in our increase in reported emissions this year compared to last. We are working internally and with supply chain partners to enhance relevant data and systems so that we can calculate these emissions based on types and quantities of materials used, thereby showing the full impact of our management choices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRegulated emissions per megalitre water treated\n\n| 2021/22   |   106.91 |\n|-----------|----------|\n| 2020/21   |   118.51 |\n| 2019/20   |   131.98 |\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions (gross) per \u00a3m revenue\n\n2021/22\n\n2020/21\n\n2019/20\n\nRegulated emissions per megalitre sewage treated\n\n| 2021/22   |   144.21 |\n|-----------|----------|\n| 2020/21   |   152.26 |\n| 2019/20   |   168.51 |\n\nScope 1 and 2 emissions (net) per \u00a3m revenue\n\n| 2021/22   |   70.7 |\n|-----------|--------|\n| 2020/21   |   75.7 |\n| 2019/20   |   72.6 |\n\n73.0\n\n78.0\n\n74.7\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD)\n\nLaunching in 2023, the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) aims to provide a risk and disclosure framework for organisations interacting with the natural environment. It will adopt a four-pillar approach similar to that of TCFD covering governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are dependent upon, and impact, the natural environment from the quality and quantity of water we abstract for treatment and supply of drinking water, through to treated wastewater we return to rivers and biosolids we recycle to land. We are responsible for over 56,000 hectares of water catchment land.\n\nGiven the pressures from climate change and population growth on the natural environment, we do not underestimate the contribution we can make in restoring healthy and resilient ecosystems. We need to work collaboratively with like-minded organisations to deliver nature-based solutions as these offer many benefits including carbon sequestration, cleaner water and improved biodiversity. This is at the heart of our Catchment Systems Thinking Approach (CaST).\n\nWe've joined the TNFD forum as a contributing member to help us as we become an early adopter of TNFD reporting.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur interactions with the natural environment are broad and complex. Overall accountability rests with executive management who strive to comply with the legal and regulatory requirements as set out in our environmental policy. Matters are regularly reviewed at the board's corporate responsibility committee. The environmental advisory group is a management group with a remit to ensure the delivery of the environmental policy commitments including nature-related strategies (e.g. land, catchment, clean air, plastics, waste, water quality, water resources, and natural capital). Governance for these strategies is through cross-departmental working groups comprised of subject matter experts and decision makers to drive implementation. Governance around investment in naturerelated risks and opportunities is applied as part of our Internal Control Manual.\n\n## Strategy\n\nProtecting and enhancing the natural environment is a key part of the 'and more' of our purpose. We protect the environment through maintaining compliance and meeting regulatory requirements. We enhance by driving performance, adopting best asset management practices, and investing in nature-based and other environmental solutions. Our environmental policy is underpinned by a framework of strategies and long term plans in response to nature-related risks and opportunities. Some of these plans are statutory requirements, such as the Water Resources Management Plan, and are reviewed every five years as part of the price review process. Our company business plan details the delivery plans for the five years up to 2025.\n\nOur CaST approach enables individual project decisions to be made in the context of the catchment, or system, in which they are situated. This encourages goals to be set in a collaborative way, maximising the benefits that can be achieved and delivering ecosystem resilience through improvements to water quality, flood risk reduction, access to green space, nature recovery, and carbon sequestration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at unitedutilities.com/corporate/ responsibility/stakeholders/catchment-systemsthinking\n\nMuch of the land that we own is designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which indicates the importance of the habitat for biodiversity. Ninety-four per cent of SSSIs on our land now meet favourable or unfavourable recovering condition status, in part because we pioneered the use of nature-based solutions to address raw water quality when we started our SCaMP programme in 2005. Designated habitats include blanket bog, moorland and\n\nheath and are home to many important species. We recognise our role as a steward of our land and make decisions based on the benefits and impacts our operations have on the natural environment. The land we own is made up of different land cover types, such as grassland and woodland.\n\n## Land cover types across our land holding\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInnovation is embedded in our approach to solving environmental challenges. By understanding and engaging in relevant research we can integrate new technologies and practices to drive environmental enhancements.\n\n## Risk management\n\nMany key risks in our risk management assessments are linked to the natural environment. The risk breakdown structure that underpins our operational risk assessment framework includes consequences related to biodiversity, flooding, drought, water quality, recreational access, carbon storage, air quality and waste. Through our longer-term planning processes, we model a range of environmental risks such as a one in 100-year storm or drought and take appropriate action to include mitigation options in the plans.

Our climate change adaptation report highlights key physical risks related to the natural environment. Two of our carbon pledges - on tree planting and peatland restoration - are intrinsically linked to the natural environment.\n\nIn 2022, we published a discussion document jointly with The Rivers Trust on barriers to nature-based solutions, entitled PR24: Unlocking nature-based solutions to deliver greater value. This identifies some of the key risks associated with the transition to a nature-positive economy and recommendations for collaborative working with the Government and others to address these barriers. We are working with regulators, other water companies and nongovernmental organisations to take forward proposals to address these risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more at unitedutilities.com/globalassets/ documents/pdf/pr24---unlocking-nature-basedsolutions-to-deliver-greater-value.pdf\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nTo measure our performance we demonstrate delivery against contributing targets from a number of statutory requirements such as the condition of protected sites, biodiversity net gain, environmental performance and supporting strategies. Our long-term nature-based targets align with government expectations such as achieving 75 per cent favourable condition for SSSI locations by 2042. We are committed to improving surface, groundwater and bathing water quality in the immediate term and beyond. We will input to the consultation on the Environment Act water targets in\n\n2022 as these will be an important mechanism to drive environmental improvement and meet the objectives for the water environment in the Government's 25-year environment plan.\n\nWe are the only water company to set a natural capital outcome delivery incentive in our business plan for 2020-25. This is measured by demonstrating additional value created through ecosystem services for customers and the environment. We achieve this by implementing nature-based solutions where they offer best value compared against a hard-engineered solution (e.g. to improve water quality). Read more about our environmental performance on pages 64 to 67.\n\nWe were a key contributor to the North West's first natural capital account developed in collaboration with many regional organisations. By considering this baseline value, we can benchmark the impact of future changes to our natural assets and quantify improvements. It is helping to understand how valuable the region's natural capital assets are. In 2022, we will update our own corporate natural capital account as part of a five-yearly review cycle and we will report on this next year.\n\n## Next steps\n\nIn March 2022, the TNFD unveiled the first version of its nature-related risk-management and disclosure framework. The framework, which will be modified over the next 18 months, is designed to align with the International Sustainability Standards Board, which was officially unveiled at COP26. Working with the Taskforce we will continue to develop how we disclose nature-related information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our risk management\n\nOur risk and resilience framework\n\n## We have a robust risk and resilience framework for the identification, assessment and mitigation of risk.\n\n## Our approach to risk and resilience\n\nSuccessful management of risks and uncertainties enables us to deliver on our purpose to provide great water and more for the North West, and be more resilient across our corporate, financial and operational structures. A key objective of our approach is to support the sustainable achievement of the strategic themes that underpin our vision to be the best UK water and wastewater company delivering:\n\n- \u00b7 the best service to customers;\n- \u00b7 at the lowest sustainable cost; and\n- \u00b7 in a responsible manner.\n\nOur risk and resilience framework provides the foundation for the business to anticipate threats to delivering an effective service in these challenging times, and to respond and recover effectively when risks materialise. Key components of the framework include:\n\n- \u00b7 an embedded group-wide risk management process, which is aligned to ISO 31000:2018 risk management guidelines;\n- \u00b7 a board-led approach to risk appetite, based on strategic goals;\n- \u00b7 a strong and well-established governance structure giving the board oversight of the nature and extent of risks the group faces, as well as the effectiveness of risk management processes and controls; and\n- \u00b7 a portfolio of policies, procedures, guidance and training to enable consistent, group-wide participation by our people.\n\nContinuous improvement is a key feature of the framework, which incorporates a maturity assessment model to identify areas to enhance. Based on risk management capabilities relative to five levels of maturity, a recent assessment has supported the development of a road map of improvements. This includes further enhancement to risk appetite and tolerance, greater focus and analysis of crosscutting themes and improved escalation of data from operational risk management systems.\n\n## Risk appetite and tolerance\n\nFocused on supporting decision-making, the risk appetite and tolerance framework consists of a package of measures. The General Risk Appetite represents financial limits against which event-based risks are compared at each full and half-year assessment and reporting cycle. In parallel are a series of strategic statements which align directly to the principal risks (see pages 104 to 105). Each statement reflects the strategic intent, strategic theme, relevant stakeholders and governance, but fundamentally emphasises the attitude to risk taking and control relative to four descriptors:\n\n- \u00b7 Averse: A strong opposition to accept risk within business strategy or operational activity.\n- \u00b7 Prudent: A reluctance to accept risk within business strategy or operational activity, but careful acceptance within tight boundaries.\n- \u00b7 Moderate: Willingness to accept risk with regard to business strategy or operational activity provided this is within reasonable limits.\n- \u00b7 Accepting: Willingness to accept risk with regard to business strategy or operational activity.\n\nAs a regulated company providing essential public services none of the principal risks have risk accepting as a strategic direction or approach.\n\nUnderpinning each strategic statement, and currently under development, are a series of more tangible, tactical statements with specific levels and limits.\n\n## How we identify and assess risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have a number of mechanisms in place to identify risk. These include a risk universe, cross-business horizon scanning forums, consultation with third parties and comparison with National Risk Registers.\n\nEach risk is event based and is sponsored by a senior manager who is responsible for the analysis of the corresponding causal factors, consequences and the control effectiveness, taking account of both the internal and external business environment. This process quantifies the likelihood of the event occurring and the full range of potential impacts from a minimum (best case) to a maximum (worst case). Comparing this position against the desired target state, in combination with the strengths, weaknesses and gaps of the control environment, supports the decisions for further mitigation as appropriate. This ongoing analysis culminates in the biannual business unit risk assessment (BURA) which forms part of the governance and reporting process (as outlined opposite) to ensure consistency of approach and a true reflection of the risk facing the company. It also serves to calibrate the most significant risks from a financial and reputational context and to assess how these relate to our risk appetite.\n\n## Governance and reporting process\n\nThe board ensures that its oversight of risk remains effective, and in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, through a number of established reporting routes.\n\nTwice yearly the board receives an extensive update on the risk profile as part of the full and half-year reporting cycle. This provides an overview of the nature and extent of risk exposure in the context of the group's principal risks (as detailed on pages 104 to 105), and emphasises the most significant event-based risks (summarised on pages 106 to 108) in both their current state relative to the risk appetite, and target state of acceptable exposure. The board is also advised of new and emerging risks (see page 109). In addition to the biannual risk reporting, specific risk topics are reported to the board to support decision-making. The board is, therefore, able to:\n\n- \u00b7 make decisions on the level of risk it is prepared to manage relative to risk appetite and tolerance in order to deliver on the group's strategy;\n- \u00b7 engage with the business to ensure appropriate controls and mitigation are in place, and test the appropriateness of plans;\n- \u00b7 report externally on the long-term viability of the company in an informed manner; and\n- \u00b7 monitor and review the effectiveness of risk management procedures and internal control systems.",

The operational risk and resilience board provides oversight of asset and operational process, risk and resilience capability, escalates risks and issues to the group audit and risk board (GARB) and contributes to the BURA process.\n\nThe executive-led GARB focuses on: the adequacy, effectiveness and performance of governance processes; risk management and internal control; monitoring compliance and assurance activities; identification of emerging themes and trends; and resilience across the group.\n\nThe audit committee is also a fundamental component of the governance structure. Supported by company secretariat and the corporate audit teams, the audit committee reviews the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls before these are agreed by the board.\n\n## Risk profile\n\nThe business risk profile is based on the value chain of the company, with the ten principal risks representing inherent risk areas (primary and supportive) where value can be gained, preserved or lost relative to the performance, future prospects or reputation of the company. Underpinning the principal risks, the profile consists of approximately 100 event-based risks, each of which is allocated to one of the ten inherent risk areas based on the context of the event, enabling the company to consider interdependency and correlation of common themes (see page 102) and control effectiveness.\n\n## Principal risk heat map\n\nThe heat map provides an indicative only view of the current risk exposure (likelihood of occurrence and most likely impact) of each of the principal risks relative to each other.\n\nSix of the principal risks have remained relatively stable in the last twelve months with the following four demonstrating an increase in exposure:\n\n- \u00b7 Wastewater service associated with change in legislation;\n- \u00b7 Supply chain and programme delivery due to economic conditions;\n- \u00b7 Health, safety and environmental due to the uncertainty of achieving the net zero carbon commitments; and\n- \u00b7 Political and regulatory due to the challenge of delivering customer and environmental improvements whilst maintaining fair value to customers\n\nSee pages to 104 to 105 for further details of the principal risks.\n\n## Risk exposure\n\nAn indication of the current exposure of each principal risk relative to the prior year.\n\nDecreased\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStable\n\n- Increased\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The governance and reporting process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principal risks\n\n- 1 Water service\n- 2 Wastewater service\n- 3 Retail and commercial\n- 4 Supply chain and programme delivery\n- 5 Resource\n- 6 Finance\n- 7 Health, safety and environmental\n- 8 Security\n- 9 Conduct and compliance\n- 10 Political and regulatory\n\n<!-- image -->",

Preventative and responsive controls, which incorporate the four components of resilience (resistance; reliability; redundancy; and response/recovery), are applied to reduce the likelihood of the event occurring and limit the impact if the event were to materialise. New and emerging circumstances in respect of causes, consequences and controls make the profile multifaceted and dynamic. Analysis of the profile highlights common themes, notably associated with the causes and consequences. These common themes can then be considered more holistically, which combined with the analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, gaps and interdependency of control across the business, enables a more integrated approach to risk mitigation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Common causal themes\n\nThe event-based risks include multiple causal factors, which individually or in combination, could trigger the risk event to occur. Categorisation illustrates six common causal themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Extreme weather/climate change: In the majority of cases our water resources, asset base and operations can cope with extreme weather conditions, although these can become overwhelmed in intense situations. Climate change projections highlight increased temperatures, rainfall, wind and more frequent extreme variations in weather patterns. This means that climate change remains a key focus for us, because of its impact on our capacity and capability for service delivery, and because of the effect on the environment that we strive to protect and enhance. We are committed to the principles set by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) - see pages 86 to 97.\n- \u00b7 Demographic changes: Demographic changes, including population growth and evolving age profiles, can impact the capacity and capability of water and wastewater treatment and network assets; can affect demand on water resources; and increase uncertainty in relation to pension obligations.\n- \u00b7 Legislative and regulatory change: Changes in legislation and/or regulation can have implications for the business model, asset base and ways of working. For example: post-Brexit changes in law bring an element of uncertainty; and the introduction of competition, while positive to customers and markets, can affect ongoing revenue and the asset base.\n- \u00b7 Economic conditions: Macro events can have multiple financial implications, including: lower revenue; increased bad debt; increased operational cost; increased cost of borrowing; and a reduction in the Regulatory Capital Value. The events can also impact the wider supply chain with knock-on effects to our service delivery and cost to serve.\n- \u00b7 Asset health: General use, exposure to natural hazards, pressure and load all contribute to the deterioration of assets. In addition, other factors such as technological obsolescence and operating assets beyond their optimal capacity to cope with increased demand (population growth and/ or climate change) also affect asset health. Ageing assets, therefore, provide an underlying and cross-business risk and uncertainty both to efficiency and for the long-term resilience of asset integrity and the associated service capability.\n- \u00b7 Culture: Embedded through processes, reward mechanisms, values and behaviours, corporate culture is important to maintain high performance and cuts across the majority of risks in the profile. In an increasingly challenging business environment, our focus is to continue to embed a culture of innovation, customer service and behaving in a responsible manner at the same time as being open and transparent.\n\n## Common consequence themes\n\nEach consequence is analysed for the financial and reputational implications relative to multiple stakeholders. Categorisation of the consequences\n\nillustrates four common impact themes:\n\n- \u00b7 Customers: Customers are impacted through our service offering, the quality of their experience when dealing with us, and how our operational and capital schemes affect them in the community.\n- \u00b7 Environment: Our assets, operations and capital programmes can have a significant impact on the environment in both rural and urban settings. As a major land owner and operator of a large fleet of vehicles, the way we manage these also has environmental implications.\n- \u00b7 Investors: The vast majority of risks in the profile have financial implications that could affect shareholder investment in the short and long term. Reputational impact associated with ethics, environmental protection and efficiency is also relevant for investors' interest in the company.\n- \u00b7 Employees: Our employees are fundamental to delivering our service requirements as well as our strategic objectives. Equally, our employees can be affected by multiple risks across the business, but primarily in relation to employment and health, safety and wellbeing risks.",

business risks\n\n## Notes\n\n- (1) Principal risks: Based on the value chain of the company, principal risks represent inherent areas where value can be gained, preserved or lost. Water, wastewater (including bioresources) and retail and commercial areas are the primary activities, with all other areas as supportive/contributing activities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTop five event-based business risks\n\n- (2) Appetite and tolerance: Averse: A strong opposition to accept risk within business strategy or operational activity. Prudent: A reluctance to accept risk within business strategy or operational activity, but careful acceptance within tight boundaries. Moderate: Willingness to accept risk with regard to business strategy or operational activity provided this is within reasonable limits. Accepting: Willingness to accept risk with regard to business strategy or operational activity. (NB As a regulated company providing essential public services none of the principal risks have risk accepting as a strategic direction or approach).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our risk management\n\n## The company's most significant event-based risks\n\nThe most significant event-based risks represent the ten highest-ranked risks by exposure (likelihood of occurrence of the event multiplied by the most likely financial impact) and those risks which have been assessed as having a significantly high impact, but low likelihood. Depending on the circumstances, financial impacts will include loss of revenue, additional or extra cost, fines, regulatory penalties and compensation. Reputational impact relative to our multiple stakeholders is also assessed, reported and considered as part of the mitigation.\n\nSummarised below are the top ten ranking risks (1-10), and those assessed as having high impact, but low likelihood (A-F):\n\n## 1. Price Review 2024 outcome\n\nRisk exposure: This risk focuses on the capacity and capability to develop a business plan that creates value for customers, communities, and the environment that is sustainable and resilient for the long term relative to the unique characteristics of the region we serve, in light of multiple influencing factors - notably changing demographics, climate change and asset health.\n\nControl/mitigation: We have established cross-cutting work streams and theme owners to identify the products and evidence required for the submission and we will maintain a close dialogue with Ofwat throughout the process.\n\nAssurance: Extensive customer research and several external providers have been commissioned for technical optioneering. Second line assurance is provided through a dedicated price review team and a PR24 programme board. An internal audit is scheduled and external assurance is currently under procurement.\n\n## 7. Failure to treat sludge\n\nRisk exposure: This risk relates to the interdependency between wastewater and bioresource treatment activity in light of changing demographics, asset health and legislative/regulatory change. Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) now applying to biological treatment of sewage sludge within AMP 7, with no investment assigned to this requirement is a key factor.\n\nControl/mitigation: The Throughput, Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (T-RAM) of our facilities is a key area of mitigation, with formal service level agreements between the two core activities. In relation to IEDs, discussions at national level are being held to move the high capital cost improvements into PR24.\n\nAssurance: Wholesale assurance and engineering technical governance provide second line assurance. Subject to cyclical internal audit and ad-hoc external strategic reviews.\n\n## A. Pension deficit\n\n## B. Financial outperformance\n\n## C. Dam failure\n\nRisk exposure: The potential for the pension scheme funding deficit to increase because of life expectancy rates leading to additional contributions.\n\nControl/mitigation: Constant monitoring combined with hedging against interest rates, inflation and growth asset risk.\n\nAssurance: Policy and oversight is led by the pensions review management group, taking into account advice from accountancy and law firms. Pension governance is subject to periodic internal audits.\n\nRisk exposure: Failure to achieve financial outperformance due to macro economic conditions and efficiency challenges, impacting the cost of debt and delivery of the company business plan.\n\nControl/mitigation: Interest rate and inflation management, ongoing monitoring of markets and regulatory developments, and company business planning.\n\nAssurance: Second line assurance and oversight is provided by the board and treasury committee in addition to executive quarterly business reviews. Subject to cyclical internal audit reviews.\n\nRisk exposure: Uncontrolled release of a significant volume of water from reservoirs due to flood damage, overtopping, earthquake or erosion leading to catastrophic impacts downstream.\n\nControl/mitigation: Each reservoir is regularly inspected by engineers. Where appropriate, risk reduction interventions are implemented through a prioritised investment programme.\n\nAssurance: Various sources of second line assurance, including supervising engineers, dam safety group, wholesale assurance and regular board reviews. Independent assurance is provided by panel engineers and internal audit.\n\nunitedutilities.com/corporate\n\n## 2. Failure of the Haweswater Aqueduct\n\n## 3. Wastewater network failure (sewer flooding)\n\nRisk exposure: The Haweswater Aqueduct is a key asset with current low resilience due to deterioration, with failure potentially resulting in water quality issues and/or supply interruptions to a large proportion of the United Utilities customer base.\n\nControl/mitigation: A capital project to replace the tunnel sections of the aqueduct has already commenced with the completion in November 2020 of one section. The remaining sections are due to be replaced as part of Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP) by 2029.\n\nAssurance: Technical and geological advice and modelling have been sought throughout the programme development, with second line assurance including engineering technical governance. Independent assurance is provided by cyclical internal audits and external assurance over the competitively appointed provider.\n\n## 8. Recycling of biosolids to agriculture\n\nRisk exposure: This risk represents various impact scenarios including operational failures, increased restrictions or total ban of recycling biosolids to agriculture. Referencing the EA's interpretation of the Farming Rules for Water (FRfW) regulations and the increasing threat to recycling a large proportion of biosolids.\n\nControl/mitigation: United Utilities is accredited to the UK Biosolids Assurance Scheme (BAS), which certifies that our treatment and recycling activities meet regulatory requirements and best practice. We also work closely with farmers and landowners and have robust standard operating procedures established with contractors.\n\nAssurance: Wholesale assurance and engineering technical governance provide second line assurance. Subject to both cyclical internal and external audit.\n\nRisk exposure: Equipment failure, collapses/ bursts or inadequate hydraulic/operational capacity to cope with extreme weather and population growth, resulting in sewer flooding.\n\nControl/mitigation: Preventative maintenance and inspection regimes, customer campaigns and sewer rehabilitation programmes.\n\nAssurance: Second line assurance provided by wholesale assurance, engineering technical governance and flood review panel. Subject to regular internal audits and external assurance of regulatory reporting.\n\n## 9. Price volatility\n\nRisk exposure: This risk reflects the inflationary pressures across all commodities, notably energy, associated with the post COVID-19 economic bounce back which have been exacerbated further by the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nControl/mitigation: Contract provision with suppliers, hedging policy and supply agreements manage volatility and minimise vulnerability in the contract and price risk with the suppliers including periods of agreed fixed pricing and negotiation of CPI/H uplift on an annual basis.\n\nAssurance: Market analysis and supplier engagement, combined with quarterly business reviews provide second line assurance. Due to the scale of procurement an energy governance panel has oversight over procurement and use.",

        "page_content": "## New and emerging risks\n\nFollowing horizon scanning activity undertaken by the business, a watching brief is held over risks/issues which are worthy of note due to their new, emerging or reputational status, and typically have too high levels of uncertainty or complexity to quantify.\n\n- \u00b7 Plastics: Attention on single-use plastic and microplastic (plastics less than 5 mm) pollution is ongoing, with their presence in the environment being linked to the water cycle. We are responding proactively and have formed a two pillar approach to addressing plastics, focusing on operational plastic waste and plastic in the water cycle.\n- \u00b7 Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS): There is a growing focus on PFAS chemicals including from our public liability insurers who are looking to exclude related liability claims. PFAS are manufactured chemicals used in everyday products. Known as 'forever chemicals', they are persistent, bioaccumulate and may be toxic even at low levels. We have completed an assessment of the likely presence of PFAS in raw water sources, the results of which are incorporated into the Drinking Water Safety Plan and aligned to the requirements set out by the Drinking Water Inspectorate.\n\n## Conflict in Ukraine\n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has led to a number of risks emerging (growing, developing or becoming more prominent) from a security and economic perspective.\n\n- \u00b7 Cyber: The likelihood of the cyber risk has been increased to reflect the rising tensions between Russia and the west, while taking into account the adoption of increased security measures which include security operations teams on extended high alert and the rapid deployment of technical blocking of critical indicators of compromise.\n- \u00b7 Price volatility: This risk reflects inflationary uplift across multiple commodities with energy the most volatile.\n- \u00b7 Security of the supply chain: This risk reflects the knock on impact of inflationary pressure on manufacturing output with some production facilities reducing operations. It also reflects sanctions imposed against Russia and Belarus and the restriction or prevention of access to certain goods.\n- \u00b7 Cash collection: Inflationary pressure is having a significant impact on the cost of living, affecting customers' ability to pay bills.\n- \u00b7 Supplier viability: This risk reflects the impact the unprecedented price increases are having on suppliers who cannot honour locked prices in contracts and the threat of suppliers going into administration with a knock-on effect to operations and the capital delivery programme.\n- \u00b7 Credit rating: Whilst underlying credit quality is not a concern, the impact of high inflation on finance expense  results in the potential for Credit Agency thresholds to be breached when combined with other factors such as additional investment spend to meet environmental and service improvements over and above price review allowances.\n\n## Material litigation\n\nThe group robustly defends litigation where appropriate and seeks to minimise its exposure by establishing provisions and seeking recovery wherever possible. Litigation of a material nature is regularly reported to the group board.\n\nIn relation to the Manchester Ship Canal Company matter reported in previous years, a hearing was held in the Court of Appeal at the end of March 2022. A decision is expected during summer 2022, which may provide further clarity in relation to the rights and remedies afforded to the parties and others in relation to discharges by water companies into the canal and other watercourses.\n\nBeyond this, there is nothing to report regarding material litigation, including in respect of the Argentina multiparty 'class action' reported on in previous years, and to which there have been no material developments.\n\n## Legislative/regulatory change\n\nIn addition to the emerging economic conditions exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, legislative and regulatory change is also a prominent emerging theme which impacts a number of event-based risks.\n\nRelatively recent developments include uncertainty associated with the Environment Agency's interpretation of the Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) and Farming Rules for Water (FRfW) and implications for ongoing compliance, process and investment across wastewater and bioresources risk.\n\nAs a responsible company, United Utilities is committed to the protection and enhancement of the environment and can demonstrate many previous and current initiatives, the most recent being the road map to 'better river health' including a pledge to invest \u00a3230 million into 184 kilometres of rivers by 2025. We will continue to work closely with all our regulators and partners to deliver better solutions including full cooperation with the ongoing industry wide investigation by Ofwat and the Environment Agency into possible unpermitted sewage discharges into rivers and watercourses.\n\nThe Environment Act, which was enacted in November 2021, has potentially far more significant implications for the water sector, due to it being the UK's new framework of environmental protection. Depending on how the new legislation will be interpreted and applied, meeting its requirements may demand a fundamental shift in the water industry's approach to environmental risks, requiring significant investment across multiple AMPs.",

At 31 March 2022, seven out of the remaining nine directors were independent non-executive directors.\n- \u00b7 The company secretary attends all board and committee meetings and advises the Chair on governance matters. The company secretariat team provides administrative support.\n- \u00b7 The directors' biographies (see pages 112 to 115) include specific reasons why each director's contribution is, and continues to be, important to the company's long-term sustainable success.\n- \u00b7 All directors are subject to annual election at the annual general meeting (AGM) held in July. The board concluded, following the completion of the evaluation of the effectiveness of the board, that each director continues to contribute effectively.\n- \u00b7 The board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of those directors standing for a further term at the forthcoming AGM, as they will be doing in respect of their individual shareholdings.\n\n## Quick links\n\nSchedule of matters reserved for the board: unitedutilities.com/corporate-governance\n\nA copy of the Financial Reporting Council's 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code can be found at frc.org.uk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe board is proud to serve customers in the North West and keen to work with organisations operating in our region that share our values.\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\nAs I write, and cast my thoughts back to the early part of the year, our way of life and world of work was still very much dominated by restrictions associated with the pandemic. By the end of our financial year, we have transitioned at pace in some respects to the normality of our working lives before COVID-19. Virtual board meetings became a necessity during the pandemic, and, notwithstanding the usual electronic hiccups that we are all now so familiar with, provided an efficient alternative enabling us to ensure the usual governance mechanisms were adhered to. Still, it is good now to be again sitting alongside colleagues in meetings - and to be joined by Liam Butterworth, who was appointed as an independent non-executive director in January 2022. More detail on his appointment can be found on page 133.\n\n## Listening to our employees\n\nOur Employee Voice panel (the panel) is chaired by Alison Goligher. The panel's work has been insightful in helping the board understand how management was responding to employees' needs and wellbeing during the pandemic. Having myself attended a meeting of the panel during the year, as did Kath Cates and Paulette Rowe, I saw first-hand that Alison's style as chair encourages open and interactive debate and meetings are very well attended. Panel meetings provide a rich source of employee-derived information for Alison to bring back to contribute to board discussions, and a view on whether there is any misalignment between the culture that the board sees and hears about from interactions and reporting by management, and the culture at grassroots level within the business.\n\nThe panel was involved in the planning and implementation of the hybrid working model which has now been applied to suitable roles across the organisation, a move undoubtedly accelerated as an outcome of the pandemic and now very much an important element for prospective employees in the employment market.\n\n## Proving our purpose\n\nThroughout last year our employees were unstinting in their efforts to support our purpose to provide great water and more for the North West. The board extends its gratitude for their considerable commitment in serving customers, particularly during the additional challenges of the pandemic. We experienced unprecedented household consumption of water, putting immense pressure on water stocks, particularly in the Lake District during the summer of 2021, adding to the impact on our operational teams.\n\n## Diversity, equality and inclusion\n\nAs a board we are mindful of the benefits across the organisation of being a diverse, equitable and inclusive employer, and seek to bring about change to the demographics of our employees so that they better represent the traditionally overlooked groups within the communities we serve. The progress against our plans that has been achieved during the year is set out on pages 44 to 45. There are a number of limiting factors to the pace of change, particularly given the locations of our major hubs of employment, the large",

The policy was further amended: increasing the target for female representation on the board to at least 40 per cent and by including a target for the appointment of a female to one of the senior board positions.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\nOn pages 86 to 94 of this annual report we have included climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the recommendations and recommended disclosures of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). For a number of years we have reported against the TCFD, and for the first time at the forthcoming 2022 annual general meeting in July, the notice of meeting includes a resolution seeking an advisory vote on our climate-related financial reporting. Our stakeholders and other interested parties are increasingly seeking more reassurance on our environmental credentials. Proposing a resolution to shareholders at the annual general meeting, on an advisory basis, seems a logical next step as part of our strategy to deliver our services in an environmentally sustainable, economically beneficial and socially responsible manner. Furthermore, as part of the remuneration committee's review of the directors' remuneration policy, opportunities were sought to better reflect environmental matters in our executive remuneration arrangements. From 2022, our long-term incentives will include carbon measures, and in the new policy that will be put to shareholders for approval at the AGM there is an increased focus on environmental outcomes.

The S172(1) Statement is on page 40.\n\nThe board is satisfied it has applied principle B - see page 16. See pages 125 to 126 and 183 for our reporting against provisions 2 and 5.\n\n## Providing great water and more for the North West\n\n## Embedding our purpose\n\nBoard members, individually and collectively, are cognisant of their statutory duties as set out in the Companies Act 2006 (the Act). In accordance with section 172 of the Act, directors are individually required to act in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. In doing so, the directors must have regard to the likely consequences of any decision in the long term and the interests of, among other matters, employees, customers, suppliers, the community and the environment, and on the company's reputation. By virtue of the long-term nature of the water and wastewater industry, thinking about our stakeholders is an integral part of our decision-making process and underpinned by our regulatory contract. The board's 2021/22 S172(1) Statement can be found on page 40, and provides examples of how our purpose is embedded in board decisions.\n\n## Incorporating sustainability in our stewardship along side creating value\n\nLong-term sustainability is a key component of the way in which the board manages the business. With many parts of the water and wastewater network across the North West built over 100 years ago, the board continues to apply the ethos of sustainability and building assets that last, and, crucially, operate efficiently and effectively to serve customers' needs. The group's planning horizons can be found on pages 46 to 49. During the year, the board held deep-dive sessions to consider the group's Water Resources Management Plan and its Drainage and Wastewater Management Plan. Sustainability and environmental protection drivers underpin both these plans.\n\nSet out on page 22, as part of our business model, is how value is created for our shareholders and other stakeholders in a sustainable manner. The board's governance approach, its culture and the way it operates the business is to behave responsibly towards all of the group's stakeholders.\n\n## Being a guardian for future generations\n\nEnvironmental issues are high on the list of matters considered by the board. The corporate responsibility committee takes the lead in overseeing management's development of our climate change mitigation strategy, and reports regularly to the board on the matter. Plans are progressing to drive the group's transition to a low carbon future by minimising our contribution to global warming through a reduction in our carbon emissions. Carbon has been incorporated as a factor to be considered in:\n\n- \u00b7 our investment appraisal and decision-making processes;\n- \u00b7 our land management practices to enhance/ improve natural capital;\n- \u00b7 the innovation that we encourage both within our operations and through working with our partners and suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 our implementation of a 'circular' mindset.\n\nThe board is kept fully informed by management on the impacts of climate change from an operational perspective. Extreme weather events impacting our region and our operations in recent years are increasingly common. When such incidents occur,",

The board would be informed of any material points of learning identified in the post-incident review process, and progress with the implementation of material actions. Our reporting against TCFD can be found on pages 86 to 94.\n\n## Improving river health and recreation\n\nDuring the year, the board has been fully engaged in considering the criticism aimed at the group for its part in the health of some of the rivers in our region. This criticism has also been widely made in relation to a number of other companies operating in the wastewater sector. The sewerage network in the North West carries sewage and rainwater.  Storm overflows are incorporated into the wastewater network to help to prevent the flooding of streets, homes and businesses during periods of heavy rainfall. When sewers and treatment plants are operating at full capacity they can spill storm water (including diluted sewage) into rivers via the storm overflow. The board has committed to \u00a3230m in environmental improvements, supporting at least a one third sustainable reduction in the number of spills recorded from our storm overflows by 2025 compared to the 2020 baseline.\n\n## Working with our regulators\n\nOfwat has introduced a new approach for major capital construction projects, namely Direct Procurement for Customers (DPC). The group's first project that has been approved for procurement via the DPC method is the Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme (HARP), which the board considered during the year. The information currently available suggests that the DPC route has the potential to offer the best value for customers and therefore supports the position that this should be tested by progressing HARP through a DPC procurement process. Given the importance of this asset to the business, this decision is included in the statement by the directors in performance of their statutory duties in accordance with S172(1) of the Act and set out on page 40.\n\n## Diversity, equality and inclusion\n\nThe board recognises the need to recruit and retain fantastic people to enable the delivery of a great service as part of the long-term sustainable success of the business. Good progress has been made on the journey to drive forward diversity, equality and inclusion within the business, as evidenced by the findings of the specialist inclusion partner who conducted a progress review during the year, observing that there was now much greater recognition of the strategic importance of diversity, equality and inclusion within the  business with 'great progress in all audited areas', since their initial engagement in October 2020. Further information on diversity, equality and inclusion can be found on pages 44 to 45. Furthermore, as part of the board diversity policy (see page 133) the 'tone from the top' by the Chair has been set, by including the requirement for an inclusive and belonging environment being fostered in the boardroom encouraging open and frank contributions from all board members.\n\n## Delivering against our regulatory contract\n\nUnder the current regulatory model, we are a monopoly supplier of water and wastewater services to our domestic customers. Simplistically, the opportunities for improving our financial performance are based on outperforming our five-year contract. Underlying this is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview of the board's responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Sets the strategy of the group, ensuring the long-term success of the group for customers, investors and wider stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Is responsible for challenging and encouraging the executive team in its interpretation and implementation of how it manages the business, and that it is doing so in accordance with the strategic goals the board has set.\n- \u00b7 Has responsibility for ensuring the company's internal control systems (including financial, operational and compliance) and processes are sound and fit for purpose (see pages 154 to 155).\n- \u00b7 Must ensure that the company has the necessary financial resources and people with the necessary skills to achieve its objectives. It reviews managerial performance annually.\n- \u00b7 Approves appointments to and removals from the board and membership of the committees.\n- \u00b7 Applies the principles of the code and reports against the provisions.\n- \u00b7 Has oversight of major capital expenditure projects within UUW that exceed \u00a3150 million, and any project which materially increases the group's risk profile or is not in the ordinary course of the group's business.\n\n## Quick link\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerms of reference: unitedutilities.com/corporate-governance",

The governance structure encompassing the board, its principal committees and the principal management committees (and set out in the diagram below) contributes to ensuring that the group focuses on its strategic themes.\n\nIn line with the code, the board delegates certain roles and responsibilities to its principal board committees. While the board retains overall responsibility, a subcommittee structure allows these committees to probe the subject matters more deeply and gain a greater understanding of the detail. The committees then report back to the board on the matters discussed, decisions taken, and, where appropriate, make recommendations to the board on matters requiring its approval. The reports of the principal board committees required by the code can be found on the subsequent pages. Minutes of the board and principal\n\nboard committee meetings (with the exception of the remuneration committee) are tabled at board meetings and the chairs of each of the board committees report verbally to the board on their activities. The Chair chairs the nomination committee; all other principal board committees are chaired by independent non-executive directors who have particular skills or interests in the activities of those committees.\n\nThe executive team is chaired by the CEO, and its members are the senior managers who have a direct reporting line to the CEO. The executive team meets monthly. It is responsible for the day-to-day running of the business and other operational matters and implementing the strategies that the board has set. The diagram below shows the principal management committees and a brief description of their roles. These committees are vital to the implementation of the group's strategic themes, enabling senior management to meet together to discuss the needs of the business, raise issues, identify and delegate appropriate actions, and monitor p/r.ss03og/r.ss03ess. The board receives reports providing an updated overview of the business, and its financial and operational performance at every scheduled meeting,\n\nShort biographies of the executive team can be found on the company's website at unitedutilities.com/ executive-team\n\nGovernance structure of the board and its principal committees and the principal management committees\n\n## Group board\n\nChair - Sir David Higgins\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChief Executive Officer - Steve Mogford\n\n## Principal management committees\n\n## Executive team\n\nChair:\n\nSteve Mogford, CEO\n\nContribution to our strategy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis forum is responsible for implementing the board's strategy and the day-to-day operation of running the business and the CEO will cascade decisions made by the board to the business via this forum.\n\n## Group audit and risk board\n\nChair: Steve Mogford, CEO Contribution to our strategy:\n\nSee page 101\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Quarterly business review\n\nChair:\n\nSteve Mogford, CEO\n\nContribution to our strategy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis forum is responsible for the quarterly review of operational, financial and health and safety performance.\n\n## Political and regulatory group\n\nChair: Gaynor Kenyon, corporate affairs director\n\nContribution to our strategy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis forum is responsible for discussing political and regulatory issues affecting the company, where any 'horizon scanning' issues are raised and business responses to consultations are agreed.\n\nCapital investment committee\n\nChair:\n\nSteve Mogford, CEO\n\nContribution to our strategy:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe committee is responsible for authorising expenditure relating to the capital investment programme.",

A number of other board meetings and telephone conferences were held during the year, as the need arose. The table below shows the number of scheduled meetings attended and the maximum number of scheduled meetings that the directors could have attended. Only in exceptional circumstances would directors not attend board and committee meetings. Similarly, every effort is made to attend ad hoc meetings either in person or via the use of video or telephone conferencing facilities if needs be. None of the non-executive directors has raised concerns over the time commitment required of them to fulfil their duties. Scheduled meetings are normally\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nheld face to face, but due to the COVID-19 restrictions impacting the early part of the year, meetings were held virtually.\n\nOn the evening before most scheduled board meetings all the non-executive directors meet either by themselves, or together with just the CEO, or with the entire board and the company secretary. This time is usefully spent enabling board members to build a rapport with each other and a relationship on a personal level, share views and consider issues impacting the company, resulting in better board dynamics and decision-making. In the early part of the year, due to the COVID-19 restrictions, these informal pre-board meeting sessions were held virtually.\n\nCorporate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                   | Board meetings (1)   | Audit committee   | Remuneration committee   | Nomination  committee   | responsibility committee   | Treasury committee   |\n|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|\n| Sir David Higgins | 8   8                |                   |                          | 6 6                     |                            |                      |\n| Steve Mogford     | 8   8                |                   |                          |                         | 4 4                        |                      |\n| Phil Aspin        | 8   8                |                   |                          |                         |                            | 3 3                  |\n| Mark Clare        | 8   8                |                   | 5 5                      | 6 6                     |                            |                      |\n| Liam Butterworth  | 1 (2)   1            | 1 (2)   1         |                          | 2 (2) 2                 |                            |                      |\n| Stephen Carter    | 8   8                | 3 (3) 4           |                          | 4 (3) 6                 | 4 4                        |                      |\n| Kath Cates        | 8 8                  |                   | 5 5                      | 6 6                     |                            |                      |\n| Alison Goligher   | 8   8                |                   | 5 5                      | 6 6                     | 4 4                        |                      |\n| Brian May         | 4 (4)   4            | 1 (4) 1           | 2 (4) 2                  | 1 (4) 1                 |                            | 1 (4) 1              |\n| Paulette Rowe     | 8   8                | 4 4               |                          | 6 6                     | 1 (5) 1                    |                      |\n| Doug Webb         | 8 8                  | 4 4               | 3 (6) 3                  | 6 6                     |                            | 2 (6) 2              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Meetings attended Possible meetings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Purpose, vision, values and culture\n\nOur purpose is to provide great water and more for the North West. Our vision is to be the best UK water and wastewater company through providing the best service to customers, at the lowest sustainable cost and in a responsible manner. In setting the company's purpose, the board took into account information and views from stakeholders, utilising much of the research and engagement that contributed to our 2020-25 business plan submission and feedback obtained from customers as part of the company's brand refresh undertaken during 2019/20. For the year ended 31 March 2022, the board is satisfied that the formulation of our aspirations in terms of our purpose, values and culture have been informed by our stakeholders and we operate our business in such a way that will create long-term value for all.\n\nOur values demonstrate how we behave individually and collectively as the board and how we ask our employees to behave. Our employees are fundamental to delivering our strategy and achieving our purpose. Our values of being customer focused, trustworthy and innovative underpin our culture of behaving as a responsible business in the way we interact with all the stakeholders we serve. We must continually reinforce these values so that the right behaviours cascade throughout the organisation, ensuring our culture of behaving responsibly drives what we do.\n\n## Monitoring our culture\n\nThroughout the organisation, our culture is monitored to ensure behaving responsibly drives what we do. Key to this is taking action to address any issues where there is misalignment with the company's culture.\n\nWe are pleased to have received external validation of our approach to monitoring culture, featuring as a best practice case study with the Financial Reporting Council 'Creating Positive Culture Opportunities and Challenges Report', December 2021. A recent independent audit found our approach to be a 'pragmatic and effective model' for supporting the board in their role of monitoring and assessing culture and a 'useful framework for driving improvements and interventions' (PwC, February 2021).\n\n## 01 Dashboard of cultural metrics\n\nIn addition to the existing reporting, management has developed a dashboard of cultural metrics, providing a comprehensive overview to support the board in fulfilling its role in monitoring and assessing culture. The dashboard comprises relevant metrics derived from: the annual employee engagement survey; human resources policies in relation to diversity, equality and inclusion along with associated training; whistleblowing reporting; health, safety and wellbeing policies and practices; and other key performance indicators relating to how we behave as a responsible business. During the year, the United Utilities culture model was developed as set out below.\n\n## 02 Existing reporting structures\n\n## for discussion\n\nThere are a number of existing reporting structures that allow these cultural metrics to be measured, discussed and challenged by the board and its committees, many of which are regularly provided to the board at its scheduled board meetings.\n\n03\n\nAlignment with purpose, values and strategy\n\nThe board was satisfied that policies, practices and behaviours within the business were aligned with the company's purpose, values and strategy.\n\nUnited Utilities culture model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 We have agreed four categories which are key for setting our culture - people, values, strategy and purpose.\n- \u00b7 There is a supporting dashboard of cultural metrics, many of which are presented and considered by the board and its committees throughout the year.\n- \u00b7 We have separate board updates on our Employee Voice panel to share the 'lived experience' of employees, together with an update on our annual employee opinion survey.",

Alison Goligher, the current designated non-executive director for engagement with the workforce, facilitates two-way dialogue between the board and employees. There is an open invite to all board members to attend meetings of the panel and during this year, Sir David and Kath Cates have participated and answered questions from panel members on board strategy.\n\nAlison chairs the Employee Voice panel (the panel) formed from representatives of a number of employee groups and employee networks from within the business and with representatives drawn from across the geographical region. Alison has met the panel virtually four times throughout the year. In order to ensure two-way communication, Alison provides updates to the panel from the perspective of the board and its committees, and similarly she provides feedback to the board on the work of the panel. Alison also has regular meetings with senior trade union representatives as part of the agreed panel approach.\n\nThe panel has adapted its approach during the pandemic and moved from face-to-face and site meetings to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee voice panel Chair: Alison Goligher (non-executive director)\n\nEmployee networks groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Multicultural\n- \u00b7 GENEq\n- \u00b7 Armed Forces\n- \u00b7 LGBT+\n- \u00b7 Ability\n\nEmployee champion groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Health, safety and wellbeing champions\n- \u00b7 Engagement champions\n- \u00b7 Colleague engagement group\n- \u00b7 Career development forums\n\n## Early careers and management:\n\n- \u00b7 The Early Careers board\n- \u00b7 Aspiring managers\n- \u00b7 Apprentices\n- \u00b7 Graduates\n- \u00b7 Bands 3 and 4 managers\n\nUnion partners\n\n- \u00b7 UNISON\n- \u00b7 Unite\n- \u00b7 GMB\n- \u00b7 Prospect\n\nvirtual meetings. These have proved popular with panel members, particularly field-based operational staff who find it much easier to attend virtually than travel from their operational sites. There are 30 members of the panel and membership rotates approximately every two years.\n\nThe panel has been provided with business updates and information sessions to broaden their knowledge of the board and corporate governance. The three key sub-groups have focused on the continual improvement of the employee opinion survey, supporting our employee networks to promote diversity and inclusion across the company, and to explore in more detail the drivers and measures of organisation culture. The culture sub-group has focused its energies on obtaining a grass-roots view of the changes to the ways of working during the pandemic and contributed to the 'next ways of working' project. It also contributed to discussions on topical issues relating to culture, such as the focus on racial inequality.\n\nEmployees' views are measured annually through the employee engagement survey with the objective of taking any required action to improve how permanent employees feel about the company and understand its direction. Employees are provided with information through briefings and access to online materials, to enable them to understand the financial and economic factors affecting the group's performance. Along with our employee relations team, our CEO holds regular face-toface meetings with senior trade union representatives to facilitate two-way communication and engagement with the views of employees' representatives.\n\nThe group has a commercial arrangement with a third party for the provision of agency staff and contractors. Engagement and communication in relation to these members of the wider workforce is managed directly by the third party via a dedicated third party account manager who liaises directly with the company's human resources team. If there is any significant change activity, a representative of the third party joins the project team, thereby ensuring consistency when communicating key information to employees, agency staff and contractors.\n\nSet out on page 30 is the company's approach to our engagement with and creating value for employees, with health, safety and wellbeing a priority. Furthermore, an explanation of the company's approach to rewarding the workforce can be found in the report of the remuneration committee on page 183.\n\n## Employee Voice panel\n\nOutcomes from the work since the panel was established to strengthen the 'employee voice' in the boardroom include:\n\n- \u00b7 The transfer of the governance of the annual employee survey to the Employee Voice panel. The panel enhanced the underlying anonymity of the survey for employees and provided more opportunities to provide free text comments. Survey questions were updated to reflect key topics, including: wellbeing; inclusivity; and working differently;\n- \u00b7 Additional administrative and communications resource was made available for network groups and executive sponsors identified; and\n- \u00b7 Panel members' views were sought on the 'next ways of working' project, the 'home safe and well' project and the 'diversity and inclusion' audit.",

        "page_content": "## Whistleblowing policy\n\nThe following sets out the company's compliance with code provision 6.\n\nAs part of our two-way communication the board has responsibility for reviewing the group's arrangements for individuals to raise matters of concern and the arrangements for the investigation of such matters. The group's whistleblowing policy (the policy) supports the culture within the group where genuine concerns may be reported and investigated without reprisals for whistleblowers. A confidential telephone helpline and a web portal are available to enable employees (including agency workers and contractors) to raise matters of concern in relation to possible incidents of fraud, dishonesty, corruption, theft, security and bribery. Furthermore, employees are encouraged to raise any matters relating to health and safety and any activities of the business that have caused or may cause damage to the environment, such as pollution or other contamination. Both the helpline and web portal are operated by a third party, enabling any concerns to be reported anonymously. The policy states that no employee will be victimised for raising a matter in accordance with the policy. Matters raised with the helpline/portal are in the first instance raised with the relevant director and investigated by senior managers independent of any involvement of the issues being considered. Details of the findings of the investigation and proposed solution are considered by the whistleblowing committee (whose membership comprises the company secretary, the customer services and people director, the strategy, policy and regulation director, the head of internal audit and the commercial, engineering and capital delivery director) and which meets quarterly. The board routinely reviews matters considered by the whistleblowing committee, the outcome of the investigation and the ways in which the matters were brought to a conclusion, thus ensuring that the core value of integrity is upheld and fostering an environment where employees feel it is 'safe to speak up' and to do so without fear of reprisal.\n\n## Board engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders\n\nThe board as a whole accepts its responsibility for engaging with shareholders and is kept fully informed about information in the marketplace through the following channels:\n\n- \u00b7 The investor relations adviser produces an annual survey of investors' views and perceptions about United Utilities, the results of which are presented and discussed by the board;\n- \u00b7 The board receives regular updates and feedback on investor meetings involving the CEO, CFO and/ or investor relations team and reports from sector analysts to ensure that the board maintains an understanding of investors' priorities; and\n- \u00b7 The executive and non-executive directors are available to meet with major shareholders and institutional investors. When revising the directors' remuneration policy, the chair of the remuneration committee invited engagement from the company's major shareholders. Feedback from any such engagement would be shared with all board members.\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nAs well as current investors, we engage actively with institutional investors who do not currently hold shares in United Utilities, as we are keen to ensure our business is well understood across the investment community, and to hear and discuss the views of all investors.\n\nWe have an active investor relations programme, which includes:\n\n- \u00b7 An invitation to major shareholders to meet with the Chair;\n- \u00b7 A regular schedule of meetings between the CEO and CFO and representatives from our major shareholders, supplemented with meetings hosted by our investor relations team;\n- \u00b7 Presentations by the CEO and CFO to groups of institutional investors, both on an ad hoc basis and linked to our half and full-year results announcements and at our 'Capital Markets Days' and an event focusing on ESG matters;\n- \u00b7 The programme covers a range of major global financial centres, typically including the UK, Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific region;\n- \u00b7 Regular feedback provided to the board on the views of our institutional investors following these meetings; and\n- \u00b7 Close contact maintained between the investor relations team and a range of City analysts that conduct research on United Utilities.\n\nIn 2021/22, our investor relations activities were conducted through a combination of virtual and faceto-face meetings. We met or offered to meet with 80 per cent (2020/21: 81 per cent), by value, of the active targetable institutional shareholder base (after adjusting for shareholders who do not typically meet with companies, such as indexed funds).\n\nFrequent areas of common interest arising in meetings with investors include operational and environmental performance, customer service, capital investment, efficiency initiatives, regulatory performance, regulatory changes and ESG matters. Investors are always keen to observe financial stability and are interested in: the level of gearing versus regulatory assumptions; cost of finance; our debt portfolio and debt maturity profile; future financing requirements; and dividends. Investors are keen to understand how the company is performing relative to the price review allowances and targets each year, along with the potential implications of regulatory change.\n\n## Retail shareholders\n\nDespite the privatisation process being around 30 years ago, we have retained a large number of individual shareholders with registered addresses in the North West - in fact, over 50 per cent of registered shareholdings on the share register. We have historically held our AGM in our region in Manchester, which enables our more local shareholders, many of whom are customers, to attend the meeting. The 2022 AGM will be held in a hybrid format. There is a considerable amount of information on our website, which provides information on our key social and\n\n## Investor dialogue with the Chair\n\nDuring the year, the Chair offered to meet with 13 institutional investors, and nine meetings were held. Common themes from these discussions were:\n\n- \u00b7 our corporate reporting of ESG matters;\n- \u00b7 board governance topics;\n- \u00b7 board succession; and\n- \u00b7 the recent Ofwat/Environment Agency investigation into the operation of storm overflows.",

Together with the annual and half-yearly results announcements, our annual report and financial statements are also available on our website; these are the principal ways by which we communicate with our retail shareholders. Our company secretariat and investor relations teams, along with our registrar, Equiniti, are on hand to help our retail shareholders with any queries. Information for shareholders can also be found on the inside back cover of this document, with a number of useful website addresses.\n\n## Other stakeholders\n\nThe board has direct contact with other stakeholder representatives, including: Ofwat and YourVoice (the independent customer challenge group). The chair of YourVoice attends a UUW board meeting to provide an opportunity for discussion, in-depth customer insight and the sharing of views.\n\nThe remuneration committee regularly engages with stakeholders, including employees. During the year, a consultation exercise was undertaken to gather stakeholders'  views on the proposed directors' remuneration policy and the intention to introduce carbon measures in to the long-term incentive arrangements, with supportive feedback being received.\n\nEngagement with representatives of all our stakeholder groups occurs widely across many aspects of the business, and more information can be found on pages 30 to 32.\n\nFurther information on stakeholder engagement can be found in the report of the corporate responsibility committee on page 156 and in the measures reported on pages 52 to 74.\n\n## Relations with banks and credit investors\n\nRunning a water and wastewater business, by its very nature, requires a long-term outlook. Our regulatory cycle is based on five-year periods, and we raise funding to build and improve our water and wastewater treatment works and associated network of pipes for each five-year cycle and beyond. We are heavily reliant on successfully raising long-term funding from banks and credit investors to fund our capital investment programme and refinance upcoming debt maturities.\n\n## Outcome of 2021 AGM\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, votes were cast in relation to approximately 70 per cent of the issued share capital (2020: 69 per cent; 2019: 67 per cent). All 21 resolutions proposed by the board were passed by the required majority; there were no significant votes cast against the board's recommendations.\n\nVotes cast in favour of the election/reappointment of the board directors were as follows:\n\nSir David Higgins 99.72%\n\nKath Cates\n\n99.91%\n\nSteve Mogford\n\n99.96%\n\nAlison Goligher\n\n99.74%\n\nPhil Aspin\n\n99.91%\n\nPaulette Rowe\n\n99.74%\n\nMark Clare\n\n91.59%\n\nDoug Webb\n\n99.91%\n\nStephen Carter\n\n99.74%\n\nThis requires long-term support from our credit investors who invest in the company by making term funding available in return for receiving interest on their investment and repayment of principal on maturity of the loans or bonds. We arrange term debt finance in the debt capital markets (with maturities typically ranging from seven years to up to 50 years at issue). Debt finance is primarily raised via the group's London listed multi-issuer Euro Medium Term Note Programme (the programme limit was increased and redenominated from EUR7 billion to \u00a310 billion in November 2021), which gives us access to the sterling and euro public bond markets and privately arranged note issues. Committed credit facilities are arranged with our relationship banks on a bilateral basis.\n\nAdditionally, the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is the financing arm of the European Union (EU), remains a significant lender to United Utilities Water, currently providing around \u00a31.1 billion of loan funding supporting past capital investment programmes, with our existing EIB loan portfolio expected to 'run-off' in line with the scheduled maturities of each loan.\n\nA greater proportion of the group's term finance is therefore likely to come from the debt capital markets, including funding raised under the group's sustainable finance framework that was established in November 2020. In July 2021, the group published its inaugural sustainable finance framework allocation and impact report, which provides credit investors with details on the use of proceeds of our debut sustainable bond issue, along with the selected case studies on eligible projects funded.\n\nThe group currently has gross borrowings of circa \u00a37,979.8 million. Given the importance of debt funding to our group, we have an active credit investor programme coordinated by our group treasury team, which provides a first point of contact for credit investors' queries and maintains a dedicated area of the company's website. Oneto-one meetings are held with credit investors through a programme aimed at the major European fund managers known to invest in corporate bonds that may be existing holders of the group's debt or potential holders. Regular mailings of company information are sent to keep credit investors informed of significant events. The treasury team has regular dialogue with the group's relationship banks, the EIB and the credit rating agencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information can be found on our website at unitedutilities.com/corporate/investors/ credit-investors\n\nRating agency services continue to be provided to the group by Moody's Investors Service Limited, Fitch Ratings Ltd and S&P Ratings UK Limited under contracts signed at the beginning of 2020 for an initial three-year term. Debt capital markets issuance by the group has therefore been made on a solicited basis by all three rating agencies during the 2021/22 financial year.",

The board demonstrated constructive challenge and offered strategic guidance and advice to management in relation to the delivery of the Haweswater Aqueduct Resilience Programme using the Direct Procurement for Customers approach (see page 40).\n\n## Chair of the board\n\nThe role and behaviour of the Chair is fundamental to the effective operation and decision-making of the board and in creating an atmosphere where open and frank discussion is facilitated and encouraged. The roles and responsibilities of the Chair are set out as part of the company's governance framework. Sir David was independent on appointment when assessed against the circumstances set out in provision 10 of the code.\n\nIt is the role of the Chair, supported by the company secretary, to drive forward the business agenda of board meetings to ensure that the board is kept abreast of the regulatory drivers and strategic needs of the business, and to ensure that the directors receive accurate, timely and clear information. The Chair and company secretary hold regular meetings to discuss agenda items and board materials. Board packs are distributed electronically five days before the meeting. Ensuring board materials are of an appropriate length, on what can be particularly complex and technical issues, is a constant challenge, and progress has been made during the year by the introduction of a revised board paper template.\n\n## Conflicts of interest and time commitment\n\nThe following section sets out the company's compliance with provision 7.\n\nThe company's articles of association contain provisions which permit unconflicted directors to authorise conflict situations. Each director is required to notify the Chair of any potential conflict or potential new appointment or directorship. Additionally, the board reviews the position of each director annually. No changes were recorded that would impact the independence of any of the directors. No conflicts of interest had arisen during the year.\n\nThe board does not specify the precise time commitment it requires from its non-executive directors in taking on the role as they are expected to fulfil it and manage their diaries accordingly. The board is content that none of its directors is overcommitted and unable to fulfil their responsibilities as a board director for United Utilities. Each individual's circumstances are different, as is their ability to take on the responsibilities of a non-executive directorship role. Should a director be unable to attend meetings on a regular basis, not be preparing appropriately or not contributing appropriately to board discussions, the Chair would be responsible for discussing the matter with them and agreeing a course of action.\n\nDuring the year, permission was sought from the board to take on additional non-executive responsibilities by: Kath Cates as a non-executive director of Brown Shipley, and by Steve Mogford who will join the board of QinetiQ Group plc as a non-executive director with effect from 1 August 2022.\n\nExecutive directors are not normally allowed to take on more than one non-executive position, a nonexecutive role is considered to be beneficial from a developmental perspective.",

On joining the board, all independent non-executive directors become members of the nomination committee.\n- \u00b7 The role of the committee is to lead the process for appointments to the board and ensure plans are in place for orderly succession to both the board and senior management positions and oversee a diverse pipeline for succession.\n- \u00b7 The company secretary attends all meetings of the committee.\n- \u00b7 The customer services and people director has responsibility for human resources, she regularly attends meetings and is responsible for engaging with executive search recruitment advisers.\n- \u00b7 The CEO is not a member of the committee, but from time to time is invited to attend. Neither the Chair nor the CEO would participate in the recruitment of their own successor.\n\n## Quick link\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTerms of reference: unitedutilities.com/corporate-governance\n\nThe appointment of a new chief executive officer for any company is an important decision, and a responsibility that the nomination committee must think long and hard about to ensure it appoints the best person to fit the role, the company and its culture, and meet the expected challenges ahead.\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\nDuring the year, the committee has spent considerable time on improving and developing a more structured approach to executive succession planning, a need highlighted during the 2020/21 evaluation of the committee's performance. We announced on 27 April 2022 that Steve Mogford had expressed his wish to step down as CEO in early 2023, and that Louise Beardmore, customer service and people director, would be appointed as a director and CEO designate with effect from 1 May 2022. The committee engaged Lygon Group to undertake the CEO succession process, further information on the process can be found on page 133.\n\nDuring his tenure as CEO, Steve has led the transformation of the group to become one of the top performers in the water and wastewater sector. Steve has championed the company's ethos of behaving as a responsible business for so many years. The committee was acutely aware that Steve's successor would need to demonstrate the same passion and commitment to ensuring the continued implementation of the group's strategic themes; providing the best service to customers; at the lowest sustainable cost and in a responsible manner. Since her appointment in 2016 as customer service and people director, Louise has spearheaded the customer initiatives on affordability and looking after the needs of vulnerable customers. She has a strong strategic mind set, and a track record of leading teams that have delivered major transformational change within regulated utility and service structures, improving profitability and delivering enhanced outcomes for multiple stakeholders. Louise is a passionate advocate of United Utilities. Suffice to say, the company and its ethos are in her DNA and she was a natural fit to succeed Steve.\n\n## Nomination committee members:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir David Higgins Chair of the nomination committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLiam Butterworth\n\nStephen Carter\n\nKath Cates\n\nAlison Goligher\n\nPaulette Rowe\n\nDoug Webb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Clare",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, the committee was particularly pleased that Louise will have the opportunity to work alongside Steve prior to his retirement next year.\n\nIn making the appointment, the committee took into account the importance of the CEO:CFO dynamic, concluding that Louise and Phil Aspin, with their combined skills and experience, would be a strong team, having extensive knowledge of the group, its culture and an in-depth understanding of the water sector and the regulatory framework it operates within. As was the case with Phil's appointment in 2021, Louise has been a core part of Steve's team in implementing the group's transformational journey over the last 11 years. After the rigorous external and internal appointment process, identifying Louise as the outstanding candidate, the committee was particularly pleased to promote an internal candidate to the CEO designate role, and it demonstrates the strength in the senior management team that Steve, as CEO, has developed and fostered.\n\nThe committee, as part of the planned board succession, conducted a search during the year for the appointment of a new independent non-executive director to replace Mark Clare who is approaching nine years' service on the board. Serving beyond a nine-year term for a non-executive director is identified in the code as being one of the reasons that could affect a non-executive director's independence. For this reason, we say a fond farewell to Mark, our senior independent director since 2014, at the annual general meeting in July 2022. Furthermore, Stephen Carter, chair of the corporate responsibility committee, informed the board that he would not be seeking re-election at the annual general meeting after nearly an eight-year term. We express our thanks and gratitude to both Mark and Stephen for their considerable contribution to the group. The committee's search concluded in the appointment of Liam Butterworth as an independent non-executive director in January 2022. As a serving CEO, Liam brings strong engineering and industrial technology experience to the board and his experience of managing performance will provide additional commercial focus as we embark on the 2025-30 regulatory price review process. Having grown up in the North West, he has a close affinity with our region.\n\n## Main responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Lead the process for board appointments and make recommendations to the board about filling vacancies on the board, including the company secretary.\n- \u00b7 Consider the succession planning of directors and members of the executive team.\n- \u00b7 Make recommendations to the board on refreshing the membership of the board's principal committees.\n- \u00b7 Review directors' conflict authorisations.\n- \u00b7 Consider requests from executive directors for election to the boards of other companies and make a recommendation to the board.\n- \u00b7 Consider requests from non-executive directors for election to the boards of other companies; this role has been delegated to the Chair (other than in respect of his own requests).\n\nAs a consequence of the various board changes, the committee reviewed the membership and diversity of the board committees (more information can be found on page 133).\n\nWith Mark Clare stepping down, the committee needed to consider who among its members was best placed to succeed Mark as the senior independent director (SID). Alison Goligher was felt to be best placed to fulfil this important role. Her board colleagues recognise that she is an outstanding leader and her communication style, approach and values fit well with the ethos of the company. Furthermore, with this as her first SID role, it would provide a new challenge for Alison.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, 30 per cent of the board were female. At the conclusion of the annual general meeting in July 2022, subject to all board directors receiving the required number of votes, our board diversity policy targets will be met, namely that: at least 40 per cent of the board be female, at least one of the senior board positions be held by a female and that at least one member of the board is from a minority ethnic background.\n\nAs a collective, and with some relatively new board members among us, we are working hard to prepare for the forthcoming price review process.\n\n## Sir David Higgins\n\nChair of the nomination committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteve has championed the company's ethos of behaving as a responsible business for so many years.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach as a responsible business on page 12\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about diversity, equality and inclusion on pages 44 to 45",

Both appointments and succession plans should be based on merit and objective criteria and, within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths.\n\nThe board is satisfied it has applied principle J. An explanation of the board appointment and succession planning activities can be found on pages 133 to 134 and forms our disclosure as part of provision 23, our policy on board diversity is on set out below and details of the gender balance of senior management on page 134. Information on the company's approach to diversity, equality and inclusion is set out on pages 44 to 45. Our disclosure against provision 20 is on page 133.\n\n## Principle K:\n\nThe board and its committees should have a combination of skills, experience and knowledge. Consideration should be given to the length of service of the board as a whole and membership regularly refreshed.\n\n## Principle L:\n\nAnnual evaluation of the board should consider its composition, diversity and how effectively members work together to achieve objectives. Individual evaluation should demonstrate\n\nThe board is satisfied it has applied principle K. Biographies of the board can be found on pages 112 to 115. An overview of directors' areas of expertise is set out in the skills matrix on page 134 and the length of service of board members on page 132. Board biographies include our reporting against provision 18.\n\nwhether each director continues to contribute effectively.\n\nThe board is satisfied it has applied principle L. Details of the board evaluation and disclosure against provision 23 can be found on pages 135 to 137.\n\n## Summary of the board diversity policy\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure the selection process for board appointments provides access to a range of candidates. Any such appointments will be made on the basis of merit and objective criteria, and within this context should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths.\n- \u00b7 Ensure that the policies adopted by the group will promote diversity in the broadest sense among senior managers who will in turn aspire to a board position.\n- \u00b7 Ensure that the board, led by the Chair, collectively fosters an inclusive and belonging environment in the boardroom, enabling open and frank contributions from all board members.\n- \u00b7 In selecting candidates for board positions, only use the services of executive search firms who have signed up to the voluntary code of conduct for executive search firms.\n- \u00b7 Adopt measurable objectives from time to time for achieving diversity on the board, which shall be to maintain at least 40 per cent female representation, to have at least one director from a minority ethnic background*, and to have at least one of the positions of: chair, CEO, senior independent director or CFO held by a female.\n- * Defined by reference to categories recommended by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) excluding those listed by ONS as coming from a white ethnic background.\n\n## What has been on the committee's agenda during the year?\n\n## Board succession\n\nThe succession planning matrix tool and skills matrix (see page 134) for board directors is used to support the planning process for board appointments. The skills matrix captures the skills and experience board directors' need as a collective, to be able to deliver the company's purpose and strategic themes. The succession planning matrix tool highlights the code governance requirements; existing directors' terms of appointment and a forecast/anticipated time frame when an individual might leave the business; the projected strategic needs of the business and resulting preferred experience of any potential new board member; existing potential internal successors to a role (where identified) and those who could act as an interim should the need arise. A candidate suitable for the role of CEO would need to demonstrate that their management approach would fit with the company's culture of behaving responsibly. The committee would seek to consult with the incumbent CEO, given his unique knowledge and perspective of the group, on his view of the needs of the business going forward. Neither the Chair nor the CEO would be involved in the appointment process of their successor.\n\n## Board succession - non-executive\n\nIn line with the board succession plan, and the approximate timescales therein, the process of the appointment of Liam Butterworth as an independent non-executive director was undertaken during the year with a view to replacing Mark Clare as he approached almost nine years on the board. The committee is supported during any non-executive director recruitment process by the customer services and people director, Louise Beardmore, as part of her human resources responsibilities. The executive search firm Lygon Group were engaged as part of the recruitment process.\n\n## Board succession - executive\n\nAs stated above, the committee sought the views of Steve Mogford on the attributes of the candidate best placed to succeed him in the CEO role, but he was not involved in the final decision. The Chair, supported by the company secretary, led the process to identify suitable candidates for the CEO role and the executive search firm Lygon Group were engaged as part of the recruitment process, having demonstrated, of the executive search firms considered, that they had the best understanding and knowledge of the group and its culture. Against the brief for the role, Lygon Group undertook the internal appraisal process for a number of internal candidates and identified a number of potential external candidates for the committee to consider. Louise Beardmore, in relation to her human resources responsibilities, had no involvement in the process other than being an internal candidate.\n\nOther than providing executive search services on previous occasions Lygon Group have no other connection with the company.\n\n## Membership of the principal board committees\n\nDoug Webb took over the role as chair of the audit committee and of the treasury committee when Brian May left the board in July 2021. Doug had served as a member of the audit committee since his appointment in September 2020 and chairs the audit committee at Johnson Matthey plc. Prior to his appointment as chair of the treasury committee, Doug had attended a meeting of the committee. Doug also replaced Brian as a member of the remuneration committee. On his appointment, Liam Butterworth was appointed as a member of the audit committee.",

Having been a significant contributor to the work on diversity, equality and inclusion, and with an interest in social matters, and as a former trustee and chair of a children's charity, Paulette is well placed to lead the committee.\n\nOn Alison Goligher's appointment as SID at the conclusion of the AGM she will step aside as chair of the remuneration committee, although remaining as a member of the committee, to be succeeded by Kath Cates. Kath has considerable experience as a remuneration committee chair, having held the role for three years at RSA Insurance Group plc.\n\nThe board has applied the board diversity policy to the board committees, thereby ensuring female representation on each committee. Furthermore, it is satisfied that the membership of the audit committee is in accordance with provision 24, and that the membership of the remuneration committee is in accordance with provision 32.\n\n## Board diversity\n\nThe board diversity policy is to 'ensure the selection process for board appointments provides access to a range of candidates. Any appointments will be made on the basis of merit and objective criteria, and within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths, but with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the board, including gender diversity.'

The selection process and application of the board diversity policy aims to attract board members whose values reflect those of the company and that of our strategic theme of behaving in a responsible manner. As referred to above, our board diversity policy would be brought to the attention of any executive search firm used as part of the selection and appointment process for a board position. Feedback would be sought from the search firm in terms of their success in attracting potential candidates in terms of their diversity of attributes. Feedback would also be gathered first hand through the interview process with candidates conducted by other board members and taken into consideration in identifying those suitable for the role in question.\n\nAs a board, the benefits of diversity and inclusion and associated benefits to the decision-making process are widely recognised and is a topic regularly discussed with major investors. When Mark Clare and Stephen Carter step down from the board at the annual general meeting, the measurable targets of at least 40 per cent female representation on the board and one director from an minority ethnic background will be met. On the board at 31 March 2022, female representation was 30 per cent and there was 10 per cent representation by a director from a minority ethnic background. Amongst the workforce, employees from a minority ethnic background represented 2.7 per cent (9 per cent of employees choose not to disclose). We recognise the benefits of diversity across our business with initiatives in place to support women in the workplace and tackle the ethnic imbalance of our workforce, thereby aligning with our strategic theme of operating our business in a responsible manner (see page 12).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                 | Sir David  Higgins   | Steve  Mogford   | Phil   Aspin   | Louise Beardmore   | Mark  Clare   | Stephen Carter   | Kath  Cates   | Alison   Goligher   | Paulette  Rowe   | Doug  Webb   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------|\n| Finance/ accounting             |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Utilities                       |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Regulation                      |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Government                      |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Construction/ engineering       |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Industrial                      |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Customer- facing                |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| FTSE  companies                 |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Digital/ technology             |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| ESG                             |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Current CEO/ CFO of FTSE  350 * |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n| Former CEO/                     |                      |                  |                |                    |               |                  |               |                     |                  |              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year the evaluation was facilitated internally by the company secretary, in consultation with the Chair and the board committee chairs. The most recent external evaluation was conducted by Independent Audit Limited during 2020/21. The process of how the evaluation was conducted is set out below.\n\nOverall, the self assessment evaluation completed by the directors and others attending and supporting the board committees, concluded that the board and its committees functioned well, were well chaired and the position was positive. Members of the committees had the appropriate skills, experience and a particular interest in the work of the committee to debate issues and provide challenge to management. All of the individual directors demonstrated the expected level of commitment to the role and contributed effectively during board discussions.\n\n## Internally facilitated self-assessment evaluation process\n\n## 1 Questionnaires\n\nThe evaluation was based on the completion of questionnaires (including questions to be scored and free text questions) by board members assessing both the performance of the board and each of its principal committees, as well as that of the Chair. Each director also completed a self-assessment questionnaire assessing their own performance.\n\nBoard members were also asked to provide a view on how well the actions identified in the 2020/21 evaluation had been addressed.\n\nIn addition to board members, other members of the executive team and representatives of external advisers who regularly attend and support the committee meetings were asked to participate in the evaluation process.\n\n## 2 Appraisal\n\nThe results were collated by the company secretary.\n\n## 3 Consultation\n\nThe results were then shared and reviewed with the Chair and each of the chairs of the relevant committees and presented at a meeting of the relevant committee and discussed. The results of the board evaluation were presented to the board for discussion.\n\nThe Chair reviewed the performance of the individual directors.\n\nMark Clare, as the senior independent non-executive director (SID) led the review of the Chair. He held a discussion with the non-executive directors without the Chair present. The SID also discussed the Chair's performance with the CEO and CFO. Detailed feedback was provided to the Chair.\n\n## 4 Evaluation and actions\n\nThe conclusions of the evaluation were reached and actions identified as set out on page 136.",

The diversity among the personalities provided a good mix, and there was a good dynamic  between members.

Deep  dives on risk topics (see pages 121 to 123) provided during the year had been particularly well received.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Support and  information                   | Respondents felt meetings were well chaired and the board arrangements and administration provided  by the company secretary and his team were effective. Views were sought on the use of virtual  meetings, with the consensus being that, whenever possible, board members and key contributors  should be present either all virtually or all face to face. From time to time, it would be satisfactory for  guests attending for just a short section of the meeting to attend virtually.                                                                               |\n| Committees                                 | \u00b7  Audit committee:  there was a good balance in meetings over in-depth discussions and time  management. More focus on risk management, processes and controls would be beneficial and on  the growing importance of non-financial/ESG reporting. \u00b7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                                            | Remuneration committee:  the committee worked well with all views being heard and debates focused  and inclusive. The committee should ensure any future ESG metrics were understood and incorporated in  a meaningful way into the new directors' remuneration policy and long-term plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|                                            | \u00b7  Nomination committee:  there was a good level of debate and discussion, and it would be helpful  to expand discussion on all aspects of diversity of any potential candidates. Improved focus on  long-term succession planning was needed along with ensuring talent management and retention                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Individual directors                       | The responses from the questionnaires completed by each director assessing their own effectiveness  were reviewed by the Chair. Individual directors were asked, among other things, to identify how they  could improve their overall contribution to the board and its committees and if they had any skill or  knowledge gaps that could be addressed. The following were identified: to attend more site visits and  interactions with specific areas of the business and more interaction and engagement opportunities  with the senior management team and employees. |",

As part of the individual director's element of the board evaluation exercise, directors are asked to identify any skills or knowledge gaps they would like to address. Directors made a number of suggestions, as set out on page 136.\n\nConsideration of ESG issues are fundamental to the way in which we operate as a responsible business at United Utilities; such matters are central to board discussions (see the summary of board activity on pages 121 to 123 and the report of the corporate responsibility committee on pages 156 to 159). The board's approach to these matters is reflected in our strategic themes, and our corporate culture of behaving in a responsible manner as reflected throughout the strategic report. Through presentations and discussions with representatives of YourVoice, the independent customer challenge group, whose role is predicated on protecting customer interests in how the group goes about its business, the board is kept informed of customer, in-region environmental affairs and social matters.\n\nIn addition to this less formal approach to board development, during the year the board received briefings from both Slaughter and May (legal and governance matters) and KPMG (governance changes relating to reporting requirements), along with a number of other advisers. Non-executive directors completed an in-house online training course on water quality awareness. A number of board members attended events organised by Ofwat for non-executive directors.\n\nOur non-executive directors are conscious of the need to keep themselves properly briefed and informed about current issues and to deepen their understanding of the business. During the year, Alison Goligher has again chaired the Employee Voice panel as part of the ongoing work to ensure the board has a direct link to understanding the views of employees\n\n(see page 126) of the business. Paulette Rowe has contributed to the work on diversity, equality and inclusion (see pages 44 to 45).\n\n## Induction of new non-executive directors\n\nAn induction programme is arranged for new non-executive directors. The programme for Liam Butterworth is set out on page 135. On joining the board, non-executive directors would meet members of the operational teams and visit some of the key operational sites and capital projects to ensure they get a first-hand understanding of the water and wastewater business. New directors receive information on the key duties of being a director of a regulated water company. They are required to meet with representatives of Ofwat prior to appointment.\n\n## Wider succession pipeline and talent management\n\nFor a number of years, the group has had a written succession plan for the executive directors and other members of the executive team, which includes outline timescales. The plan was developed further during the year and a more structured approach adopted towards the executive succession pipeline. The plan identifies an interim internal successor to fill a role in the short term should the need arise, and the longerterm development needs of potential successors to be able to fulfil a role on a more permanent basis. As with all board appointments, in aiming to appoint the best person to fulfil a role, it would be common when recruiting for a senior role, for an external search to be conducted alongside an internal candidate recruitment process.\n\nAny changes that are required to the profile of the management team to reflect the changing needs of the business are considered by the board in the executive succession plan. Succession and development initiatives for senior executives include executive mentoring and coaching and/or participating in an executive business school programme, as appropriate. Leadership development centres have been delivered to identify and validate potential for future director and senior leader positions and develop a number of",

Senior managers are encouraged to take on a non-executive directorship role as part of their personal development, but it is recognised that this is very much a personal commitment for each individual. The current talent programme at a senior level is well embedded and we believe a non-executive appointment for senior managers provides an excellent opportunity for both personal and career development, and is a way of gaining valuable experience that may be applied at United Utilities so long as no conflicts of interest occur.\n\nDuring the year, board directors had a number of opportunities to meet with members of the executive team, both formally when senior managers were required to present at board meetings on matters related to their responsibilities, and on more informal occasions.\n\nHistorically, our industry has been male dominated, but measures are in place to increase diversity in broad terms among our employees (see pages 44 to 45).  At present fifty per cent of our executive team (excluding the CEO and CFO) is female, as yet there is no ethnic diversity among the team. The gender balance of the direct reports of the executive team is 65 per cent male and 35 per cent female, representation of ethnic minorities is 3 per cent. Gender pay data can be found on page 44.\n\nAlong with the wider employee population, we continue to work towards improving the diversity of our succession pipeline as part of our ongoing diversity and inclusion plans.\n\nOur graduate and apprentice programmes are thriving and from time to time, board members have the opportunity to attend events and meet with members of these programmes and other employees identified as potential talent within the business.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In accordance with provision 25, an explanation of the independence and effectiveness of the external audit process can be found on pages 148 to 149, and the reappointment of the statutory auditor on page 150. The board considered and was satisfied on the integrity of the financial and narrative statements, as advised by the audit committee in accordance with DTR 7.1.3(5).\n\nWe have applied principle N, as confirmed by our disclosure against provision 27, which can be found on page 198 and is supported by our disclosure against provision 25 on pages 147 to 148.\n\nOur risk management framework and principal risks are on pages 100 to 109. Further information on the company's internal audit function and controls can be found on pages 153 to 154 and together set out our application of principle O.\n\n## Board's responsibility for financial oversight\n\nOne of the fundamental roles of the board is to oversee the financial performance of the business. The board is supported in this role by the audit committee whose activities are described on pages 143 to 154. The board reviews the financial performance of the company at every scheduled board meeting, receiving a report from the CFO which provides the board with the up-to- date position of the consolidated financial statements, interpretative analysis and other key performance indicators, metrics and ratios. The board takes into account the review by the audit committee of the financial and narrative statements, and the auditor's views on the key risks and judgements identified and given particular focus in their audit work and set out in their report (see pages 202 to 209), and the information and explanations provided by management in relation to their key judgements and adjustments to APMs (see page 82). The board considered the review and assurance process undertaken by management, and considered by the audit committee to support the application of principle N. The board concluded that in the 2021/22 annual report and financial statements it had presented a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company's position and prospects, and the board was satisfied on the integrity of the financial and narrative statements. Furthermore, the board approved the accounts and provision of the directors' responsibility statement at its meeting on 25 May 2022, see page 198.\n\n## Oversight of financial aspects of ESG\n\nESG, and behaving responsibly, has been a long-term commitment and part of the board ethos for many years and is embedded throughout the business. It naturally flows through into the board's approach to the integrity of the group's financial reporting. Recognising that climate change is a key risk to the group's provision of water and wastewater services (see page 102), 2021/22 is the third year that the group has reported against the TCFD recommendations. As part of the processes supporting the provision of the 'fair, balanced and understandable' statement, the board took into account the existing processes of review and assurance of the TCFD and wider narrative reporting. Management reviewed the assurance processes relating to narrative reporting and ESG matters, particularly those relating to TCFD reporting, and determined that the levels of assurance provided by the combination of the work by internal audit and of the various third parties was satisfactory at this time - a stance endorsed by the audit committee. The TCFD report addresses the TCFD recommendations and includes, for the second year, scenario analysis (see page 92). Inclusion of climate-related information in accordance with the TCFD is mandatory for the company in its 31 March 2023 annual report.\n\n## Board's approach to risk management and internal control\n\nThe board discharges its responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the risks that it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives through the risk appetite framework. As a key part of the risk management framework, risk appetite (see page 100) captures the board's desire to take and manage risk relative to the company's obligations, stakeholder interests and the capacity and capability of our key resources.\n\nThe board is responsible for ensuring that the company's risk management and internal control systems are effectively managed across the business and that they receive an appropriate level of scrutiny and board time. The risk profile is reviewed in conjunction with the full and half-year reporting cycle alongside deep dives and routine performance reviews.\n\nThe group's risks predominantly reflect those of all regulated water and wastewater companies. These generally relate to the failing of regulatory performance targets or failing to fulfil our obligations in any five-year planning cycle, potentially leading to the imposition of fines and penalties, in addition to reputational damage. Climate change is a causal risk theme that underpins our core operations and provision of water and wastewater services to customers (see page 102).\n\n## Review of the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems\n\nDuring the year, the board reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management systems and internal control systems, including financial, operational and compliance controls. Taking into account the principal risks and uncertainties set out on pages 100 to 109, the ongoing work of the audit committee in monitoring the risk management and internal control systems (see pages 153 and 154) on behalf of the board, (and to whom the committee provides regular updates), the board:\n\n- \u00b7 was satisfied that it had carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the company, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity; and",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance report\n\nFinancial oversight responsibilities of the board\n\n- \u00b7 had reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management and internal control systems, including all material financial, operational and compliance controls (including those relating to the financial reporting process) and no significant failings or weaknesses were identified.\n\nAfter review, the board concluded that through a combination of the work of the board, the audit committee and the UUW board (which has particular responsibility for operational and compliance controls), the company's risk management and internal controls were indeed effectively monitored throughout the year.\n\nThe board's review of the effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems took into account:\n\n- \u00b7 the biannual review of significant risks and emerging risks (see pages 100 to 109);\n- \u00b7 the assurance (both internal and external) of the most significant business and operational risks of the group;\n- \u00b7 the review of matters correlating to specific event based operational risks (see pages 106 to 107);\n- \u00b7 the outcome of the biannual business unit risk assessment process (see page 100);\n- \u00b7 the activities and review of the effectiveness of the internal audit function (see page 153);\n- \u00b7 the opinion provided by internal audit in relation to their work, that 'the governance, risk management and internal control framework was suitably designed and effectively applied within the areas under review';\n- \u00b7 the self-assessment provided by management confirmed compliance with a range of key internal policies, processes and controls (see page 154);\n- \u00b7 the review of reports from the group audit and risk board (see page 101);\n- \u00b7 the oversight of treasury matters, in particular debt financing and interest rate management (see page 155); and\n- \u00b7 the review of the business risk management framework and management's approach and tolerance towards risk (see page 100).\n\n## Going concern and long-term viability\n\nThe following section sets out the company's compliance with part of provisions 30 and 31.\n\nThe board, following the review by the audit committee, concluded that it was appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting (see page 217). Similarly, in accordance with the principles of the code, the board concluded, following the recommendation from the audit committee, that it was appropriate to provide the longterm viability statement based on an assessment period of seven years. Assurance supporting these statements was provided by the review of: the group's key financial measures and contingent liabilities; the key credit financial ratios; and the group's liquidity and ongoing ability to meet its financial covenants. As part of the assurance process, the board also took into account the principal risks and uncertainties facing the company, and the actions taken to mitigate those risks, and include emerging and more topical risks.\n\nThese principal risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 100 to 109, as are the risk management processes and structures used to monitor and manage them. Biannually, the board receives a report detailing\n\nmanagement's assessment of the most significant risks facing the company. The report gives an indication of the level of exposure, subject to the mitigating controls in place, for the risk profile of the group, while also highlighting the reputational and customer service impact. This provides the board with information in two categories: group-wide business risks; and operational risks. The board also receives information during the year from the treasury committee (to which the board has delegated matters of a treasury nature - see page 155), including such matters as liquidity policy, the group's capital funding requirements and interest rate management.\n\n## Long-term viability statement\n\nThe directors have assessed the viability of the group, taking account of the group's current position, the potential impact of the principal risks facing the business in severe but reasonable scenarios, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions. This assessment has been performed in the context of the group's prospects as considered over the longer term. Based on this viability assessment, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the seven-year period to March 2029.\n\n## Basis of assessment\n\nThis viability statement is based on the fundamental assumption that the current regulatory and statutory framework does not substantively change. The longterm planning detailed on page 46 assesses the group's prospects and establishes its strategy over a 25-year time horizon consistent with its rolling 25-year licence and its published long-term strategy. This provides a framework for the group's strategic planning process, and is key to achieving the group's aim of providing the best service to customers at the lowest sustainable cost and in a responsible manner over the longer term, underpinning our business model set out on pages 20 to 83.\n\nIn order to achieve this aim and promote the sustainability and resilience of the business, due consideration is given to the management of risks over the long term that could impact on the business model, future performance, credit ratings, solvency and liquidity of the group. Specifically, risks associated with current levels of economic uncertainty and climate change have been incorporated into the baseline position and factored into the various scenarios modelled as part of the group's assessment. An overview of our risk management approach that supports the group's long-term planning and prospects, together with the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business, can be found on pages 100 to 109. This approach considers the full range of categories of risk that could impact the company, such as financial, operational and regulatory risks. In addition, consideration is given to the adequacy of workforce policies and practices, all liabilities including pension liabilities, any exposure to revenue variations, and expectations of future performance taking account of past performance in delivering for customers.\n\nWithin the context of this long-term planning and management of risks, the group's principal business operates within five-year regulatory price control cycles. Medium-term planning considers the current price control period, over which there is typically a high degree of certainty, and looks beyond this in order to facilitate smooth transitions between price control periods. This results in the board concluding a recurring period of seven years to be an appropriate period over which to perform a robust assessment of the group's long-term viability.",

        "page_content": "## Viability assessment: resilience of the group\n\nThe viability assessment is based upon the group's medium-term business planning process, which sits within the overarching strategic planning process and considers:\n\n- \u00b7 the group's current liquidity position - with \u00a31.1 billion of available liquidity at March 2022 providing a significant buffer to absorb short-term cash flow impacts;\n- \u00b7 the group's robust capital solvency and credit rating positions - with a debt to regulatory capital value (RCV) ratio of circa 60 per cent, a robust pension position and current credit ratings of A3/ BBB+/A- with Moody's, S&P and Fitch respectively, this provides considerable headroom supporting access to medium-term liquidity where required;\n- \u00b7 the group's expected performance, underpinned by its historical track-record; and\n- \u00b7 the current regulatory framework within which the group operates - which provides a high degree of cash flow certainty over the regulatory period and the broader regulatory protections outlined below.\n\nThe group has a proven track-record of being able to raise new finance in most market conditions, and expects to continue to do so into the future. This is despite the group no longer having access to future EIB funding following the UK's exit from the EU.\n\nFrom a regulatory perspective, the group benefits from a rolling 25-year licence and a regulatory regime in which regulators - including the economic regulator, Ofwat - are required to have regard to the principles of best regulatory practice. These include that regulation should be carried out in a way that is transparent, accountable, proportionate, consistent and targeted. Ofwat's primary duties provide that it should protect consumers' interests, by promoting effective competition wherever appropriate; secure that the company properly carries out its statutory functions; secure that the company can finance the proper carrying out of these functions - in particular through securing reasonable returns on capital; and secure that water and wastewater supply systems have long-term resilience and that the company takes steps to meet long-term demands for water supplies and wastewater services.\n\nIn addition, from an economic perspective, given the market structure of water and wastewater services, threats to the group's viability from risks such as reduced market share, substitution of services and reduced demand are low compared to those faced by many other industries.\n\n## Viability assessment: resilience to principal risks facing the business\n\nThe directors have assessed the group's viability based on the resilience of the group and its ability to absorb a number of 'severe but reasonable' scenarios, derived from the principal risks facing the group, as set out on pages 100 to 109. The baseline plan against which the viability assessment has been performed incorporates the estimated impact of current high levels of inflation which are expected to endure in the near term before falling to more normal levels. This baseline plan is then subject to further stress scenarios and reverse stress testing that takes into account the potential impact of the group's principal risks. Such risks include: environmental risks such as the occurrence of extreme weather events and other impacts of climate change, further details of which are included in the group's TCFD disclosures on pages 86 to 94; political and regulatory risks; the risk of critical asset failure; significant cyber\n\nsecurity breaches; current economic uncertainties including high levels of inflation and a squeeze on the cost of living impacting the group's customer base; and the potential for a restriction to the availability of financing resulting from a capital markets crisis.\n\nThe scenarios considered are underpinned by the group's established risk management processes, taking into account those risks with a greater than 10 per cent (1 in 10) cumulative likelihood of occurrence. Risks associated with current economic conditions are reflected within the baseline position, with further potential downside risks (most notably in relation to bad debt and low inflation) covered by the individual scenarios modelled, and collectively within a combined scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about signi/ficant issues on pages 151 to 152\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about relations with banks and credit investors on page 128\n\n<!-- image -->",

This assessment has demonstrated the group's ability to absorb the impact of all severe but reasonable scenarios modelled, without the need to rely on the key mitigating actions detailed below.\n\nThe most extreme of the severe but reasonable scenarios modelled, without any mitigating action, resulted in: the group comfortably retaining investment grade credit ratings; liquidity of more than one year; and no projected breaches of financial debt covenants.\n\n## Viability assessment: reverse stress testing\n\nAs part of the assessment, reverse stress testing of two extreme theoretical scenarios focusing on totex overspend and persisting low inflation have been performed to understand the extent to which the group could further absorb financial stress before it reaches a sub-investment grade credit rating. This reverse stress testing demonstrated that these extreme conditions would have to be significantly outside what would be considered 'severe but reasonable' scenarios before the group's long-term viability would be at risk.\n\n## Viability assessment: key mitigating actions\n\nIn the event of more extreme but low likelihood scenarios occurring, there are a number of key mitigations available to the group, the effectiveness of which are underpinned by the strength of the group's capital solvency position.\n\nAs well as the protections that exist from the regulatory environment within which the group operates, a number of actions are available to mitigate more severe scenarios, which include: the raising of new finance, including hybrid debt; capital programme deferral; reduction in other discretionary totex spend; the close-out of derivative asset positions; the restriction of dividend payments; and access to additional equity.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe analysis underpinning this assessment has been through a robust internal review process, which has included scrutiny and challenge from the audit committee and board, and has been reviewed by the group's external auditor, KPMG, as part of their normal audit procedures.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe directors also considered it appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, as explained in the basis of preparation note to the accounts.",

He retired from his most recent executive role at Meggitt PLC in 2018.\n- \u00b7 All members of the committee are independent non-executive directors and the board is satisfied that the committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector. Attendance at audit committee meetings is set out on page 124, and the relevant directors' biographies can be found on pages 112 to 115.\n- \u00b7 Other regular attendees at meetings at the invitation of the committee include the CEO, the CFO, the company secretary, the head of audit and risk, the group controller, and representatives from the statutory auditor, KPMG LLP (KPMG). None of these attendees are members of the committee.\n- \u00b7 The representatives from KPMG and the head of audit and risk each have time with the committee and the company secretary to raise freely any concerns they may have without management being present.\n- \u00b7 The committee is authorised to seek outside legal or other independent professional advice as it sees fit, but has not done so during the year.\n\n## Quick link\n\nTerms of reference: unitedutilities.com/corporate-governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAudit quality has again been high on the committee's list of priorities, in particular, its scrutiny of the findings of the Financial Reporting Council's 2021 audit quality review which, as applicable to the group, it challenged the auditor to address.\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\nThis is my first report to you as chair of the audit committee, having succeeded Brian May who stepped down at the AGM in July 2021. I joined the board as a non-executive director and as a member of the committee in September 2020, which enabled me, prior to taking over as chair, to experience a year in the group's audit cycle (see the diagram on page 145). My background is in finance, having qualified as a chartered accountant with Price Waterhouse. I currently serve as chair of the audit committee at Johnson Matthey plc and I previously chaired the audit committee at SEGRO plc, until stepping down as a non-executive director in 2019. I was chief financial officer at Meggitt PLC from 2013 to 2018, I believe my financial experience has prepared me well to lead the committee in providing challenge both to management and to the external auditor.\n\nThis is a time of considerable change and evolution in the role of the audit committee - with the increasing demands for greater assurance in areas of narrative and non-financial reporting which have not traditionally been part of the committee's role. This is the third year the company has reported against the TCFD's recommendations (see pages 86 to 94), and ahead of the mandatory climate-related financial disclosure for the company for the year ending 31 March 2023. The statement, as required by Listing Rule 9.8, can be found on page 86. In readiness for next year, the committee asked management to further enhance the assurance processes (see page 148) underpinning the provision of the TCFD report along with other elements of the narrative reporting, further contributing to the assessment of whether 'the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy'.\n\n## Audit committee members:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDoug Webb Chair of the audit committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStephen Carter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaulette Rowe\n\nLiam Butterworth",

Management was supported in this review by an independent third party who commented that the current maturity of the group's capabilities, governance and operating model pertaining to internal controls over financial reporting was higher that was typically seen currently within other UK listed businesses. However, further enhancements could be made to address the evolving landscape. The committee was reassured by this review and its contribution to enhancing the group's audit and assurance processes, and to steps taken during the year towards the formulation of an audit and assurance policy (see page 151). Management has also discussed with the committee the group's preparedness toward the provision of a resilience statement, if required, in future years (see page 147). Based on assessments of the group's viability, resilience and long-term prospects that are currently formed, the group is well positioned to address developments in this area.\n\nAudit quality has again been high on the committee's list of priorities, in particular its scrutiny of the findings of the FRC's 2021 audit quality review (AQR) published in July 2021 (and available on the FRC's website). The committee's challenge to KPMG was to address the lessons of the 2021 AQR's findings as they were applicable to the group, as well as enhancing the quality and transparency of the services provided as auditor. Ian Griffiths, KPMG's lead audit partner, responded to the committee's challenge by committing to provide to the committee the details of the independent partner's review of the audit, as part of the 2022 year-end sign-off processes. Other audit quality processes (see page 148) included a technical review and a second-line of defence review by another team independent of the audit team.\n\nIn its assessment of the effectiveness of the statutory audit process relating to the year ended 31 March 2021, the committee committed to assessing whether\n\n## Main responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Make a recommendation to the board for the appointment or reappointment of the auditor, and to be responsible for the tender of the audit from time to time and to agree the fees paid to the auditor.\n- \u00b7 Establish policies for the provision of any non-audit services by the auditor.\n- \u00b7 Challenge the auditor on the scope and the results of the annual audit and report to the board on the effectiveness of the audit process and how the independence and objectivity of the auditor has been safeguarded.\n- \u00b7 Review the half-year and annual financial statements and any announcements relating to financial performance, including reporting to\n\nthe additional audit quality processes that had been proposed for the 31 March 2021 audit such as: improving the communication between the KPMG audit team and the internal audit team through regular discussion sessions; raising audit points in a timely manner and improved project management of the year-end process, had been effectively implemented. The findings of the assessment (see page 149) were presented to the committee in September 2021, which concluded that the additional processes had been effectively implemented, and would be retained for the 31 March 2022 year-end audit.\n\nAuditor independence is a key principle and contributing factor to audit quality. It is reviewed as part of the audit scope and re-examined prior to the accounts being approved and signed by the board. The auditor must be independent of the company. The committee has time set aside during its meetings to meet with the auditor without management in order that they can speak freely and raise any concerns.\n\nIndependence is a key focus for the auditor, whose staff must comply with their firm's own ethics and independence criteria which must be consistent with the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019). Information on how the committee assesses the independence of the auditor can be found on page 149. The statutory auditor presents its audit findings to the shareholders as the owners of the business (see pages 202 to 209).\n\nThe evaluation of the committee's performance for 2021/22 was facilitated internally by the company secretary and his team, which has provided some useful feedback and points for action (see page 136) and reiteration of the need for the committee to stay abreast of developments, particularly the work of the International Sustainability Standards Board as it develops reporting standards for sustainability topics encompassing many aspects of ESG.\n\nI am pleased to welcome Liam Butterworth, who joined the board on 1 January 2022, as a member of the committee. The membership of the committee will be revised after the forthcoming AGM in July 2022 (details can be found on page 133).\n\nThis report was approved by the committee at its meeting held on 17 May 2022.\n\n## Doug Webb\n\nChair of the audit committee\n\n- the board on the significant issues proposed by management and in particular those challenged by the committee in relation to the financial statements and how these were addressed.\n- \u00b7 Approve the scope, remit and effectiveness of the internal audit function and the group's internal control and risk management systems.\n- \u00b7 Review the group's procedures for reporting fraud and other inappropriate behaviour and to receive reports relating thereto.\n- \u00b7 Report to the board on how it has discharged its responsibilities.\n- \u00b7 Apply the principles of the code and report against the provisions.",

The committee's role is to ensure that management's disclosures reflect the supporting detail provided to the committee or challenge them to explain and justify their interpretation and, if necessary, re-present the information. The committee reports its findings and makes recommendations to the board accordingly. The committee is supported in this role by using the expertise of the statutory auditor, who, in the course of the audit, considers whether the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and whether adequate accounting records have been kept. In doing so it ensures that high standards of financial governance, in line with the regulatory framework along with market practice for audit committees going forward, are maintained. Furthermore, the company's own internal audit team contributes to the assurance process by reviewing compliance with internal processes. The committee's financial reporting cycle, which starts each year in September, is shown below. There were four meetings of the committee held during the year, the committee intends to continue to hold the two meetings in September and March virtually. Items of business considered by the committee are set out on pages 146 to 147.\n\nAudit committee financial reporting cycle\n\n<!-- image -->",

The committee also considered whether the significant issues considered by the committee in relation to the financial statements include those identified by the auditor in their report on pages 202 to 209.\n\nManagement has again considered and sought to enhance the review processes to provide support to the board in forming its view on whether the accounts and financial statements were fair, balanced and understandable, as it concluded they were and set out on page 198. In particular, a member of the executive team not involved in the drafting process was appropriately briefed to review and challenge the content to ensure that the activities and issues faced by the business were reported in a fair and balanced manner.\n\nThe committee received updates on the calculation of underlying operating profit measures as one of the principal alternative performance measures (APMs) used by management, a full guide to APMs can be found on page 82.\n\nMany of our regulatory performance commitments are used by management as key performance indicators and are monitored by our regulators,  who set the methodology against which we report.

As part of its review of the 2021/22 audit in July 2022, the committee will seek to review the effectiveness of these processes and interactions.\n\nThe processes and interactions included:\n\n- \u00b7 providing sight of their interim control findings to the committee early in the audit process and sharing their knowledge and best practice recommendations;\n- \u00b7 improving communication and sharing of information and insight between the external and internal audit teams by implementing regular discussion sessions prior to the scheduled committee meetings;\n- \u00b7 raising audit points in a more timely manner with the financial reporting team during the audit process by holding regular discussions with the external audit team and financial reporting team;\n- \u00b7 using a project manager to assist with the delivery of the year-end audit cycle; and\n- \u00b7 enhanced visibility of the key challenges and findings of the second-line of defence review performed by another team independent of the audit team, and of the independent KPMG partner's review of the audit.\n\nstrategic report, the directors' report and the corporate governance statement), and the financial statements, taking into account the auditor's knowledge obtained in the audit, or the auditor's understanding of the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the 'other information' and 'statutory other information'. The TCFD and Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting (SECR) disclosures are deemed to be 'other information' as they are included in the company's strategic report, as they are important to the company. Other assurance of the TCFD and SECR disclosures (see pages 86 to 97) is undertaken both by third parties and our internal audit team. Our disclosures against the code are reviewed by the internal audit team and reported to the committee.\n\nAdditionally, the committee was satisfied that all the key events and issues which had been reported to the board in the executive team's monthly board reports during the year, both good and bad, had been adequately referenced or reflected within the annual report.\n\n## How we assessed the effectiveness of the statutory audit process\n\nThe committee, on behalf of the board, is responsible for the relationship with the auditor, and part of that role is to examine the effectiveness of the statutory audit process. Audit quality is regarded by the committee as the principal requirement of the annual audit process. KPMG presented the strategy and scope of the audit for the forthcoming financial year at the meeting of the committee held in September, highlighting any areas which would be given special consideration (these key audit matters are included in the auditor's report on pages 202 to 209). KPMG reported against their audit scope at subsequent committee meetings, providing an opportunity for the committee to monitor progress and raise questions, and challenge both KPMG and management.\n\nThroughout the year, management presents its up-to-date view of the key accounting issues and its resulting judgements to the committee. In response, KPMG informs the committee whether, in its professional view, the judgements management proposes, or has taken, are appropriate. A number of these issues manifest themselves as the significant issues considered by the committee in relation to the financial statements, which are set on pages 151 to 152 in respect of 2021/22. As required by auditors' professional standards, KPMG exercise their professional scepticism in their audit of these significant issues.\n\nPrivate meetings are held at committee meetings between the committee and representatives of the auditor without management being present to encourage open and transparent feedback by both parties on any matters they wish to raise, and provide the committee with an opportunity to obtain from the auditor greater insight on the extent to which the auditor has challenged management's analysis and presentation of information.\n\nPrior to the board's approval of the year-end financial statements, the committee provides its view to the board on the outcome of the statutory audit, explaining: management's key accounting issues and judgements; the outcome of the auditor's assessment of key audit matters; other areas of audit focus and control deficiencies (if any), and how the statutory audit contributed to the integrity of the financial reporting process. The independent nature and financial expertise of committee members further contributes to the integrity of the process.",

        "page_content": "## Statutory auditor's fees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKPMG updated the committee on its ongoing Audit Quality Transformation Plan (AQTP). KPMG's AQTP includes: a more standardised audit approach; holding companies to account for the quality of the information provided in the audit process; providing more feedback to companies on the findings of their audit and providing additional senior-level support to the KPMG audit teams during the audit; all of which are well embedded in the audit process. In planning for the 2021/22 audit, KPMG provided a report to the committee on the quality interventions that they had implemented during the 2020/21 audit. Each year the committee considers the annual review by the FRC's Audit Quality Review Team and challenges KPMG to ensure continuous improvement.\n\nOn completion of the annual audit process the views of those involved in the audit on how well KPMG performed the audit are sought. All members of the committee, key members of the senior management team and those who regularly provide input into the audit committee or have regular contact with the auditor, complete a feedback questionnaire, thereby ensuring a wide range of views are taken into account. The questionnaire reviewing the 2021 audit process was issued in July 2021.\n\nViews of the respondents were sought in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 the robustness of the external audit process and degree of challenge to matters of significant audit risk and areas of management subjectivity;\n- \u00b7 whether the scope of the audit and the planning process were appropriate for the delivery of an effective and efficient audit;\n- \u00b7 the quality of the delivery of the audit and whether planned quality improvements had been delivered and whether the committee had insight into the auditor's internal quality procedures;\n- \u00b7 the expertise of the audit team conducting the audit and their understanding of the company's business risks to assess if there was an impact on the audit;\n- \u00b7 whether the auditor made appropriate use of the work of the internal audit team;\n- \u00b7 that the degree of professional scepticism applied by the auditor was appropriate;\n- \u00b7 the appropriateness of the communication between the committee and the auditor in terms of technical issues;\n- \u00b7 the quality of the service provided by the auditor;\n- \u00b7 their views on the quality of the interaction between the audit engagement partner, the audit senior manager and the company;\n- \u00b7 whether the audit process had been kept on schedule, despite the remote working due to COVID-19 restrictions of both the audit and management teams; and\n- \u00b7 whether the statutory audit contributed to the integrity of the group's financial reporting.\n\nThe feedback was collated and presented to the committee's meeting in September 2021. The committee noted KPMG's quality interventions as part of its AQTP to improve audit quality, including: the additional oversight provided by senior KPMG personnel during the 2020/21 audit. The committee concluded that the statutory audit process and services provided by KPMG were satisfactory and effective, with additional measures for further enhancement encouraged.\n\n## How we assessed the independence of the statutory auditor\n\n## The following section sets out the company's compliance with part of provision 26.\n\nThere are two aspects to auditor independence that the committee monitors to ensure that the auditor remains independent of the company.\n\nFirst, in assessing the independence of the auditor from the company, the committee takes into account the information and assurances provided by the auditor confirming that all its partners and staff involved with the audit are independent of any links to United Utilities. KPMG confirmed that all its partners and staff complied with their ethics and independence policies and procedures which are fully consistent with the FRC's Ethical Standard, including that none of its employees working on our audit hold any shares in United Utilities Group PLC. KPMG is required to provide written disclosure at the planning stage of the audit in the form of an independence confirmation letter. Their letter discloses matters relating to their independence and objectivity, including any relationships that may reasonably be thought to have an impact on its independence and the integrity and objectivity of the audit engagement partner and the audit staff. The audit engagement partner must change every five years and other senior audit staff rotate at regular intervals.\n\nSecondly, the committee develops and recommends to the board the company's policy on non-audit services and associated fees that are paid to KPMG. In accordance with the FRC's Revised Ethical Standard (2019), an auditor is only permitted to provide certain non-audit services to public interest entities (i.e. United Utilities Group PLC) that are closely linked to the audit itself or that are required by law or regulation, as such services could impede their independence. Permitted non-audit services fees paid to the statutory auditor are subject to a fee cap of no more than 70 per cent of the average annual statutory audit fee for the three consecutive financial periods preceding the financial period in which the cap applies.\n\nThe 70 per cent non-audit services fee cap has been applied to the group for the year ended 31 March 2022. The average of audit fees is \u00a3447,000 (calculated as the average of the audit fees for the three preceding financial years (2021: \u00a3430,000; 2020: \u00a3474,000; 2019: \u00a3437,000). Non-audit services fees during the year were \u00a3130,500, (2021: \u00a3119,500; 2020: \u00a377,000; 2019: \u00a366,000) so well below the cap of \u00a3313,900 (70 per cent of \u00a3447,000). In 2022, fees for non-audit services represent 19.3 per cent of the average audit fees on which the cap is based. Permitted services (which remain subject to the 70 per cent cap, apart from the regulatory audit) can be approved by the CFO subject to a cap of \u00a310,000 applied for individual items. Individual items in excess of \u00a310,000 require the approval of the committee. Auditor-provided permitted services include the non-audit fees paid to the statutory auditor for: the interim review; the regulatory audit; agreed-upon procedures for regulatory reporting; limited assurance work relating to the group's sustainable financing framework; the Euro Medium Term Note Programme and Law Debenture Trust compliance work.",

While this work could be performed by a different firm, the information is in fact more granular breakdowns of data that form part of the statutory audit, and by KPMG undertaking the work it reduces duplication and saves considerable cost.\n\nDuring the year, the committee agreed a small additional fee in respect of the limited assurance work relating to the group's sustainable financing framework.\n\nTaking into account our findings in relation to the effectiveness of the audit process and in relation to the independence of KPMG, the committee was satisfied that KPMG continues to be independent, and free from any conflicting interest with the group.\n\n## Statutory auditor reappointment for the year ending 31 March 2023\n\nThe following section sets out the company's compliance with part of provision 26.\n\nThe 2021/22 year-end audit has been KPMG's eleventh consecutive year in office as auditor; they were reappointed after the committee conducted a formal tender process in December 2019 and as reported by the committee in the 2020 annual report. Prior to this, a formal tender was last undertaken in 2011, and resulted in the appointment of KPMG who thereafter presented\n\ntheir report to shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2013. An audit tender review was held in September 2015. The diagram shown below shows the historical tendering and rotation of the role of statutory auditor. The company, as a public interest entity, is required to conduct a competitive tender process every ten years, and rotate auditors after 20 years at most. As a matter of good practice, the committee continually keeps the performance of the auditor under review.\n\nThe 2021/22 audit has been the second year for Ian Griffiths as audit engagement partner. The audit engagement partner changes at least every five years.\n\nUnited Utilities has complied fully with the provisions of The Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 for the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\nAt its meeting on 17 May 2022, the committee recommended to the board that KPMG be proposed for reappointment for the year ending 31 March 2023 at the forthcoming AGM in July 2022. There are no contractual obligations that restrict the committee's choice of auditor; the recommendation is free from third-party influence and no auditor liability agreement has been entered into.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Audit and assurance policy\n\nDuring the year, management took steps, prompted by the BEIS consultation and with a view to providing a more standardised approach, to begin to develop an audit and assurance policy as a means of tailoring proportionate assurance relating to the narrative disclosures in the annual report and referencing the assurance of the regulatory reporting relating to UUW. Feedback from the committee was incorporated into the drafting process.\n\n## Going concern and long-term viability\n\nThe committee challenged and scrutinised management's detailed assessment of the group's long-term viability and its ability to continue as a going concern. In doing this the committee took into account the risks facing the business, and its ability to withstand a number of severe but reasonable scenarios. Having considered management's assessment, the committee approved the long-term viability statement set out on page 140. Management apprised the committee of its preparedness to provide a resilience statement in future years, which would encompass the going concern and long-term viability statement should this be a recommendation of the BEIS Consultation on 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance'.\n\n## Significant issues considered by the committee in relation to the financial statements\n\n## Material and/or judgemental areas of the financial statements\n\n| Significant issues considered                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | How these were addressed by the committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful  receivables  (see pages 218, 220, 229 to 230, 257 and 259)  - due to the nature of the group's business, the extent to  which revenue is recognised and expected credit losses  are recognised in relation to doubtful customer debts is an  area of considerable judgement and estimation. This has  particularly been the case in the current year as the cost  of living has increased and is forecast to increase further  into the next year. The future economic situation is highly  uncertain, but it is expected that this could impact the ability  of some customers to pay their bills as they become due. | \u00b7  The committee reviewed the approach taken by management in estimating the impact  that increases in the cost of living could have on future cash collection under a range  of scenarios, recognising that the situation is highly uncertain. Having challenged  management's approach, the committee concluded that while cash collection  rates during the year have been good, the rate at which expected credit losses  are accounted for needs to consider future cash collection risk and that the rates  proposed by management are reasonable given the scenario analysis undertaken; and \u00b7  The committee challenged management's judgement around the appropriate period  over which to consider cash collection history in assessing the level of expected  future credit losses, and concurred that the judgement around the period chosen was |\n| Capitalisation of fixed assets  (see pages 203, 218 to 219,  226 to 228 and 258 to 259) - fixed assets represents a  subjective area, particularly in relation to costs permitted  for capitalisation and depreciation policy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | \u00b7  The committee assessed the reasonableness of the group's capitalisation policy  and the basis on which expenditure is determined to relate to enhancement or  maintenance of assets and, having also considered the work performed by KPMG in  this area, deemed both to be appropriate; and                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Retirement benefits  (see pages 204, 219, 232 to 244, 250  to 255 and 260) - the group's defined benefit retirement  schemes is an area of considerable judgement, the  performance and position of which is sensitive to the  assumptions made.

        "page_content": "## Internal controls and risk management systems\n\nThe main features of the group's internal controls and risk management systems are summarised below:\n\n## Internal audit function\n\nThe internal audit function is a key element of the group's corporate governance framework. Its role is to provide independent and objective assurance, advice and insight on governance, risk management and internal control to the audit committee, the board and to senior management. It supports the organisation's vision and objectives by evaluating and assessing the effectiveness of risk management systems, business policies and processes, systems and key internal controls. In addition to reviewing the effectiveness of these areas and reporting on aspects of the group's compliance with them, internal audit makes recommendations to address any key issues and improve processes and, as such, provides an indication of the behaviours being exhibited by employees in the areas under review. Once any recommendations are agreed with management, the internal audit function monitors their implementation and reports to the committee on progress made at every meeting.\n\nA five-year strategic audit planning approach is applied. This facilitates an efficient deployment of internal audit resource in providing assurance coverage over time across the whole business, as well as greater variation in the nature, depth and breadth of audit activities. This strategic approach supports the annual audit plan, which is then endorsed by management, and which the committee reviews, challenges and approves. The plan focuses the team's work on those areas of greatest risk to the business. Building on the strategic planning approach, the development of the plan considers risk assessments, issues raised by management, areas of business and regulatory change, prior audit findings and the cyclical review programme. The purpose, scope and authority of internal audit is defined within its charter which is approved annually by the audit committee. As set out in the charter, internal audit perform their work in accordance with the mandatory aspects of the International Professional Practice Framework of the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors; and with integrity (honestly, diligently and responsibly) and objectively (without conflicts of interest).\n\nInternal audit, led by the head of audit and risk, covers the group's principal activities and reports to the committee and functionally to the CFO, both of whom approve the head of audit's annual personal objectives. The head of audit and risk attends all scheduled meetings of the audit committee, and has the opportunity to raise any matters with the members of the committee at these meetings without the presence of management. He is also in regular contact with the chair of the committee outside of committee meetings.\n\nThe in-house team is expanded as and when required with additional resource and skills co-sourced from external providers ensuring that the internal audit function has sufficient resources and expertise to deliver the annual audit plan. The committee keeps the relationship with co-source providers under review to ensure the independence of the internal audit function is maintained and there is a documented process to manage possible conflicts of interest with the cosourced resource. Ensuring that any co-source resource remains independent in the course of its work is crucial to the integrity of its work. Following a competitive tender process, PwC was last re-appointed as co-source resource provider during 2020/21.\n\nThe internal audit function liaises with the statutory auditor, discussing relevant aspects of their respective activities which ultimately supports the assurance provided to the audit committee and board.\n\n## Assessing the effectiveness of the internal audit function\n\nThe effectiveness of the internal audit function's work is continually monitored using a variety of inputs, including the ongoing audit reports received, the audit committee's interaction with the head of audit and risk, an annual review of the department's internal quality assurance report, a quarterly summary dashboard providing a snapshot of the progress against the internal audit plan tabled at each committee meeting as well as any other periodic quality reporting requested.\n\nAn annual stakeholder survey in the form of a feedback questionnaire is circulated to committee members, senior management and other managers who have regular contact with the internal audit function, including representatives from the auditor KPMG and the co-source audit provider PwC. The responses were anonymous to encourage open and honest feedback, and were consistently favourable, as were previous surveys.\n\nPeriodically, the quality and effectiveness of the internal audit function is also assessed externally, with the most recent review being undertaken in early 2019.\n\nTaking all these elements into account, the committee concluded that the internal audit function was an effective provider of assurance over the organisation's risks and controls and appropriate resources were available as required.\n\n## Risk management systems\n\nThe group designs its risk management activities to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve its strategic objectives.\n\nThe committee receives updates and reports from the head of audit and risk on key activities relating to the company's risk management systems and processes at every meeting. These are then reported to the board, as appropriate. A diagram and explanation of the risk management governance and reporting process can be found on page 101. The CFO has executive responsibility for risk management and is supported in this role by the head of audit and risk and the corporate risk manager and his team. The group audit and risk board (GARB) is a sub-committee of the executive team. The GARB meets quarterly and reviews the governance processes and the effectiveness and performance of these processes along with the identification of emerging trends and themes within and across the business. The work of the GARB then feeds into the information and assurance processes of the audit committee and into the board's assessment of risk exposures and the strategies to manage these risks.\n\nSupplementing the more detailed ongoing risk management activities within each business area, the biannual business unit risk assessment process (BURA) seeks to identify how well risk management is embedded across the different teams in the business. The BURA involves a high-level review of the effectiveness of the controls that each business unit has in place to mitigate risks relating to activities in their business area, while identifying new and emerging risks and generally to facilitate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about /financial oversight responsibilities of the board on pages 139 to 140\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our risk and resilience framework on pages 100 to 102",

The outcome of the BURA process is communicated to the executive team and the board. This then forms the basis of the determination of the most significant risks that the company faces which are then reviewed by the board. The group utilises risk management software in order to maintain an up to date view of the assessment of risk. The maturity of the risk management framework and its application across the business is assessed on an annual basis against a defined maturity model. This assessment provides an objective appraisal of the degree of maturity in how the risk management system is being applied against the key elements of  ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management Standard. The results of the maturity assessment are reported to the GARB, and actions agreed with business units.\n\nAn external assessment of the risk management framework last took place in 2017/18.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe committee reviews the group's internal control systems and receives updates on the findings of internal audit's investigations at every meeting, prior to reporting any significant matters to the board. Internal control systems are part of our 'business as usual' activities and are documented in the company's internal control manual which covers financial, operational and compliance controls and processes. Internal control systems are the responsibility of the CFO, with the support of the GARB, the financial control team and the internal audit team, although the head of audit and risk and his team are directly accountable to the audit committee.\n\nConfirmation that the controls and processes are being adhered to throughout the business is the responsibility of managers, but is continually tested by the work of the internal audit team as part of its annual plan of work which the committee approves each year as well as aspects being tested by other internal assurance providers. Compliance with the internal control system is monitored annually by the completion of a self-assessment checklist by senior managers in consultation with their teams. The results are then reviewed and audited on a sample basis by the internal audit team and reported to the committee.\n\nDuring the year, the committee asked management to commission an independent review of the maturity of the group's internal control framework over financial reporting in light of the recent BEIS consultation, and the likely evolution of the UK internal control requirements, in general terms but also more specifically in relation to controls over financial reporting. The key findings of the independent\n\n## Independent review of the fraud risk management structure\n\nDuring the year, the committee asked management to commission an independent review of the group's fraud risk management framework to assess its maturity and identify any enhancements required given the evolving nature of business processes and the working environment. This was felt to be timely, particularly in light of the need for remote working during the pandemic and the subsequent move to hybrid working in some areas of the business. An action plan to strengthen the approach to fraud risk assessment has been implemented, overseen in the first instance by the security steering group forum and with the final report presented to the committee.\n\nreview were that: there was a high level of coverage of the financial statement line items in both the consolidated income statement and the balance sheet; risk and control matrices were in operation; and the fundamental building blocks underpinning an internal control framework over financial reporting were in place which would contribute to an audit and assurance policy (see page 151).\n\n## Anti-fraud and anti-bribery\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for reviewing the group's procedures for detecting fraud, and the systems and controls for preventing other inappropriate behaviour. In the first instance of an incident being reported, a summary of the allegations is passed to the fraud and whistleblowing committee (consisting of the company secretary, the customer services and people director, the strategy, policy and regulation director, the commercial, engineering and capital delivery director and the head of internal audit and risk) to decide on the appropriate course of action and investigation and by whom.\n\nDuring the year, the audit committee was kept fully apprised in regular updates on the progress and findings of investigations of cases of alleged fraud and any remedial actions taken.\n\nIn line with the group's anti-fraud culture and zerotolerance attitude towards fraud, a fraud incident forum has been established to identify and understand potential threats, and optimise the group's response and mitigation and ensure consistency across the business.\n\nThe company has an anti-bribery policy to prevent bribery being committed on its behalf, which all employees must follow, and processes in place to monitor compliance with the policy. Employees in certain roles are required to complete anti-bribery training materials. As part of the anti-bribery programme, employees must comply with the group's hospitality policy. The hospitality policy permits employees to accept proportionate and reasonable hospitality for legitimate business purposes only and all hospitality (and gifts) offered and accepted has to be logged, and approved when accepted. Employees and representatives of the group's suppliers must comply with the group's responsible sourcing principles and United Supply Chain approach. The group will not tolerate corruption, bribery and anti-competitive actions and suppliers are expected to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and in particular never to offer or accept any undue payment or other consideration, directly or indirectly, for the purposes of inducing any person or entity to act contrary to their prescribed duties.\n\nAs part of the internal control self-assessment checklist (part of the group's internal control processes), senior managers in consultation with their teams are required to confirm, among other things, that they have complied with the group's anti-bribery and hospitality policies. The anti-bribery programme is monitored and reviewed biannually by the committee.",

Approximately \u00a3425 million of new term funding was raised, with financial market conditions being closely monitored as central banks began tightening monetary policy in response to surging inflation, amidst heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nThe continuation of our funding programme, on top of the \u00a3900 million of term funding raised in 2020/21, has positioned the group well with regard to its circa \u00a32.7 billion financing requirement across the AMP7 regulatory period. The committee also completed a 'deep dive' review of the group's inflation and interest rate hedging policies.\n\nThe committee oversaw the group's successful implementation of the transition of benchmark reference rates used in the group's financial derivatives and loan and credit facilities, from GBP LIBOR to replacement 'risk free rates', with SONIA replacing GBP LIBOR effective from the end of 2021.\n\nIn November 2021, we increased the size, and redenominated the group's multi-issuer, London listed, Euro Medium Term Note Programme from EUR7 billion to \u00a310 billion to facilitate future debt issuance. This programme, in conjunction with our sustainable finance framework launched in November 2020, is expected to continue to be the primary vehicle for the group accessing funding in the debt capital markets.  In July 2021, the group published its inaugural sustainable finance framework allocations and impact report.

The committee supported steps to strengthen internal carbon governance, recognising the company has a clear plan to 2030. It welcomed the increased regulatory focus on climate change.\n\nThe committee commented on the company's third adaptation report ahead of its publication in December 2021 with particular attention on how the company is improving the management of climate change risk and raising its profile within the organisation and with external stakeholders. The committee noted how the report addressed the expected impact of global warming at around 2/uni2070C and that a more extreme scenario of up to 4/uni2070C is being considered for PR24 and beyond to stress test the plan.\n\nRiver water quality and storm overflows have been prominent political and societal issues this year, embodied by an amendment to the Environment Act that requires water companies to progressively reduce the impact from overflows. The committee considered how the management team was handling this important reputational matter and supported its approach, in particular the emphasis on developing partnership opportunities alongside actions to be taken by the company. It was clear to committee members that the water sector alone cannot deliver good ecological status in rivers and that collaboration with regional stakeholders is a vital part of any approach.\n\nOver the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee discussed the public's changing attitude to the environment as more people connect to green\n\n## Corporate responsibility committee members:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStephen Carter Chair of the corporate responsibility committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlison Goligher\n\nPaulette Rowe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSteve Mogford",

The growing visitor pressure at the company's recreational sites, coupled with an increase in anti-social behaviour, have led to local stakeholder concerns. The committee was presented with an update on the company's land management approach, appreciating the challenge of balancing the sometimes competing demands of water, wildlife and access.\n\nWhile the majority of COVID-19 measures eased over the year, the committee considered the company's response to social issues amplified by the pandemic. Support provided to customers as part of the company's affordability and vulnerability response is monitored through regular review of the lower income dashboard. Given the North West's high levels of social and economic deprivation, the committee welcomed the company's support for the Consumer Council for Water's recommendation that a national social tariff is introduced.\n\nIt was pleasing to see the results of the Employee Opinion Survey 2021, in particular the high levels of employee engagement. Efforts to bring the employee voice to the boardroom and to provide a two-way flow of communication have played their part alongside the additional support provided during the pandemic.\n\nIn recent years, there has been greater investor interest in Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters. The committee discussed investor views of ESG and performance in ESG indices. The long standing commitment to clear and transparent disclosure has ensured the company's performance in ESG has remained strong. The committee endorsed a targeted approach to engage with the most relevant independently assessed indices so that the company can demonstrate to investors that its strong responsible business credentials are externally evaluated.\n\nThe committee reviewed performance against the suite of measures and targets adopted by the company to provide evidence to its stakeholders that it is fulfilling its purpose to provide great water and more for the North West. These form part of the performance section of this report on pages 52 to 75. Publishing a set of performance measures and targets in this way enables stakeholders to judge for themselves whether or not the company is delivering on its purpose.\n\n## Main responsibilities\n\nThe committee approved a slightly modified set of terms of reference in February 2022. Its main duties are to:\n\n- \u00b7 consider and recommend to the board the broad corporate responsibility (CR) policy, taking into account the company's desired CR positioning;\n- \u00b7 keep under review the group's approach to CR and ensure it is aligned with the group strategy including the company purpose and values;\n- \u00b7 review CR issues and objectives material to the group's stakeholders and identify and monitor the extent to which they are reflected in group strategies, plans and policies;\n- \u00b7 monitor and review the status of the company's reputation and examine the contribution the group's corporate responsibility activities make towards protecting and enhancing this;\n\nIn addition, specific papers on gender pay and community investment expenditure were presented to the committee.\n\nThe committee sought insight on how the company's approach to purpose and responsible business is integrated. It received reports on how digital/data and the AMP7 investment programme are embracing a purpose-led approach. The committee supported plans to launch a digital academy and the digital contribution to major transformation activities such as the wastewater Dynamic Network Management programme. It praised progress in implementing sustainability in all aspects of capital delivery activities and the contribution to the company's net zero carbon commitment.\n\nFrom a committee governance perspective, members agreed to a minor amendment to its terms of reference to refer to 'purpose' and 'values' in a clause under Policy Direction. As part of its annual evaluation of performance the committee sought a discussion to ensure it focuses its efforts on the right topics given the rapidly evolving interest in ESG.\n\nOn behalf of the board, it has been a real privilege to oversee the company's responsible business agenda for the past six years. I am confident that the company has built the right foundations so it can deliver on its purpose and to create value for all of its stakeholders. As I prepare to hand over chair of the corporate responsibility committee to Paulette Rowe, I know that she will ensure it continues to champion corporate responsibility on behalf of the board. I wish Paulette, and the company, every success.\n\nAs a listed company, United Utilities complies with the UK Corporate Governance Code and continues to drive for the highest standards of board leadership, transparency and governance.\n\n## Stephen Carter\n\nChair of the corporate responsibility committee\n\n- \u00b7 monitor and review compliance with the board's CR policy and scrutinise the effectiveness of the delivery of the CR policy requirements;\n- \u00b7 develop and recommend to the board CR targets and key performance indicators and receive and review reports on progress towards the achievement of such targets and indicators;\n- \u00b7 monitor and review the steps taken by the company to support customers in vulnerable circumstances; and\n- \u00b7 review all approved specific giving where the aggregate financial contribution exceeds \u00a3100,000 over the period of the proposed funding and to review all community giving expenditure annually.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about our approach as a responsible business on pages 12 to 13\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about Dynamic Network Management\n\non page 43",

The committee welcomed steps to capture key climate change risks in the corporate risk framework and the use of the latest UK Climate Projections (2018) in developing the Water Resources Management Plan (WRMP24). It supported strengthening the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures in the 2021 Annual Report through the inclusion of an assessment of the financial impact of climate risk.\n\n## Land management update\n\nThe committee was updated on the strategic review of the group's land management approach, reflecting on the challenge to balance changing expectations of stakeholders and the behaviour of some visitors with the drivers of water quality and quantity. The committee discussed applying strategies such as adopting an asset management approach, exploring opportunities to invest in the estate and connecting customers to the company's land ownership.\n\n## Approach to clean air\n\nAn overview of the company's approach to clean air was discussed by the committee. It noted plans to undertake further research to understand the scope of the risk posed by poor air quality, to baseline activity to capture the total extent of the company's emissions and the opportunity to engage with government and regulators on the topic.\n\n## Social\n\n## National social tariff\n\nThe committee discussed the recommendation by the Consumer Council for Water to introduce a national social tariff for customers struggling to pay their water bills. It noted plans by Defra to consult on this in 2022 and commented that similarities could be drawn with the implementation of a national social tariff in the electricity sector and how lessons could be learnt. The committee requested an update in September 2022.\n\n## Affordability and vulnerability: lower income groups\n\nTwo updates were provided to the committee on the company's performance in assisting customers on low incomes. The committee noted the positive performance across many measures.\n\n## Next ways of working\n\nAs pandemic restrictions eased, the committee discussed the 'next ways of working' project and welcomed the return to office for hybrid roles. The potential disadvantages of hybrid working for those in the early stages of their careers and maintaining engagement for those not in hybrid roles were debated alongside methods for meeting these challenges.\n\n## Gender pay report\n\nThe committee commented on the draft gender pay report and commended the work undertaken to attract more women to the company to address, in particular, middle and upper senior manager roles. It welcomed the use of leading indicators and the success of the company's aspiring manager programme to nurture a pipeline of talent for senior roles.\n\n## Community investment expenditure 2020/21\n\nThe annual update on community giving expenditure was presented to the committee. It noted that total expenditure was lower than usual due to restrictions on community activity arising from COVID-19 lockdown measures. Lessons to be learnt from other companies were discussed.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Employee Voice\n\nTwice a year the committee reviews progress on employee and board engagement. It noted how the Employee Voice panel had met virtually while COVID-19 restrictions were in place, providing a valuable mechanism for employees to give feedback, particularly on how they had been supported throughout the pandemic. Topics presented to the panel included the company's reward strategy, HR support for people managers and progress updates from each sub-group: employee opinion survey; employee networks; and culture. The committee noted that the company was satisfied that activities and progress enabled it to demonstrate compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Employee opinion survey 2021\n\nThe committee welcomed the results of the annual employee opinion survey and the high levels of engagement. It noted that the values of the organisation, the approach to health and safety and reward had a direct correlation to the employment relationship and support for employees during the pandemic. Committee members were updated on plans by the company to ensure high levels of engagement were retained through local action planning.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement and reputation\n\nEngagement and reputation remained a standing agenda item allowing time to examine the relationship between responsible business and reputation. Each paper provided an update on national and regional political and regulatory engagement, and interaction with people and organisations representing regulatory, social and environmental interests. In particular, the committee sought to understand the role of environmental NGOs and the media in driving awareness of storm overflows and it welcomed the company's first investor ESG webinar.\n\n## Progress against demonstrating purpose\n\nThe committee endorsed a set of stakeholder value measures and targets through which the company will demonstrate how it is fulfilling its purpose. Performance updates were provided on two occasions and members asked that consideration be given to how improvements over AMP7 are made evident and to ensure that the measures stay relevant.",

This reflected the increasing interest from ESG stakeholders that companies demonstrate they are 'purpose-led' and generate public value. The amended terms of reference were recommended for approval to the group board.\n\n## CR committee evaluation\n\nThe committee reviewed the external evaluation results, in particular points about ensuring papers were succinct and future topics for committee discussion given the rapidly evolving ESG landscape. The committee discussed its membership in this context and it was agreed that it would be reviewed by the nomination committee for approval by the board.\n\n## Cross cutting\n\n## Responsible business digital and data framework\n\nAn update on the company's approach to digital and its alignment with purpose and responsible business was presented to the committee. This included the 'next ways of working' project, shaped by the company's pandemic response, and updates on major transformation projects such as the wastewater Dynamic Network Management programme and the West Cumbria Operating Strategy. The committee discussed issues such as seeking user consent in relation to their data, plans to baseline digital skills and the launch of a digital skills academy.\n\n## Investors and ESG\n\nThe committee was updated on investors' views of ESG and agreed with the company's approach to demonstrate its responsible business credentials through continued transparency and engagement with selected investor ESG indices and ratings. Members discussed investor interest in diversity and inclusion and nature and endorsed early disclosure on these topics.\n\n## Brexit and regulatory convergence - environmental and employment legislation\n\nFollowing conclusion of the Brexit transition period, an overview of UK environmental and employment legislation was discussed. It focused in particular on the Environment Act and statutory targets on air quality, biodiversity, water and waste; new duties for water companies; the Office for Environmental Protection which will hold public bodies including UUW to account on their environmental obligations; and governance mechanisms such as regional water groups and internal drainage boards. The committee agreed that no further updates in relation to Brexit are required.\n\n## Capital programme: delivery of sustainability objectives\n\nHow the company's purpose, and ESG in general, is being implemented across its capital programme was presented to the committee. It welcomed progress in implementing sustainability in all aspects of the capital programme, especially on the West Cumbria project, and the contribution to the company's net zero carbon commitment. The committee discussed whether, looking ahead to PR24, there was scope to be more ambitious in realising ESG objectives.\n\n## Looking to the next year, the committee will:\n\n- \u00b7 review new or updated responsible business strategies including the company's approach to education, its community strategy and approach to smart metering;\n- \u00b7 consider the responsible business themes emerging for PR24;\n- \u00b7 return to several issues to review progress including land management, air quality, waste and circular economy including plastics, embedding multi-capital thinking, diversity and inclusion and talent and young people;\n- \u00b7 review performance on how the company is fulfilling its purpose, ESG rating performance and the dashboard tracking the company's efforts to support customers on low incomes;\n- \u00b7 on behalf of the board, review progress and issues arising from the Employee Voice panel and the company's approach to culture;\n- \u00b7 continue to examine the interaction between purpose, ESG and reputation and review the approach to stakeholder engagement and the management of reputational risks;\n- \u00b7 oversee matters of general governance such as reviewing the gender pay report; and\n- \u00b7 undertake matters of committee governance such as reviewing its rolling calendar of agenda items, the annual committee evaluation and examination of the committee's terms of reference.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Being less than two years into the regulatory period, the committee was satisfied that, overall, our current approach remained appropriate for at least the next three years and that there was no need to make material changes to the current policy. A key area of focus however, was how the committee might strengthen the extent to which environmental, social and governance matters are reflected in executive remuneration arrangements, and the incentive plans in particular. Additionally, with only one year remaining before the current mechanism for delivering long-term incentives (our Long Term Plan 2013) would require renewal or replacement, there was an opportunity for us to make sure that the rules of any revised plan reflected contemporary corporate governance best practice and the expectations of shareholders.\n\nBetween January and March 2022, we consulted directly with major shareholders and other key stakeholders, including our employees via our employee voice panel, about our proposals on these and a number of other matters. That process was valuable, confirming stakeholder support for the changes and enhancements we proposed, and in particular supporting our intention to introduce carbon measures into our long-term incentive arrangements. Having considered the feedback received through the consultation process we were able to finalise our proposed new policy, and further information about the policy review, along with full details of the proposed policy, are shown on page 163 and pages 169 to 176.\n\nWe will also use our AGM to ask shareholders to approve a revised version of our Long Term Plan that will operate on a similar basis to the current plan. Details of the new plan will be included in our Notice of AGM 2022.\n\n## Remuneration committee members:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlison Goligher Chair of the remuneration committee\n\nKath Cates\n\nDoug Webb\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMark Clare",

        "page_content": "## Improving transparency and clarity\n\nIn February 2022, I received David Black's (Ofwat interim Chief Executive) letter concerning performance related executive pay for 2021/22, a copy of which was sent to the remuneration committee chairs of all regulated water and wastewater and water-only companies and which was published on Ofwat's website.\n\nThe committee recognises the scrutiny and concern that has been focussed on the water sector during the year, and agrees that incentive outcomes for executives should be aligned with performance across the range of stakeholder groups - including customers and the environment - to demonstrate legitimacy. We also agree that companies should provide clear and accessible explanations about their executive remuneration arrangements so that customers and other stakeholders can understand how they operate and how incentive outcomes are determined. This is something we have consistently sought to do in our annual remuneration reports, evolving and improving our reporting wherever possible. We aspire to be a leader in the development, application and transparency of our approach to executive remuneration and to help drive strong standards both within the water sector and the FTSE100 more broadly.\n\nIn my response to Ofwat's letter I set out the ways in which the committee could demonstrate that it took its responsibilities seriously, including in regard to the concerns raised. Making sure that our incentive arrangements are aligned with the interests of all of our stakeholders is fundamental to our approach, and this is summarised on page 166. Our incentive arrangements are based on measures which are heavily weighted to the delivery of stretching performance outcomes for customers and the environment, and our plan to introduce carbon measures into our long-term incentive from 2022 will enhance this further. Our remuneration policy enables the committee to override formulaic outcomes and to exercise discretion on incentive outcomes if deemed necessary. Indeed, the committee has exercised and disclosed the use of such discretion in recent years by applying downward adjustments to the executive directors' bonuses on two occasions, recognising performance issues that became apparent during the year. Noting that performance or other issues might become known after incentives have already been paid, the remuneration policy includes withholding and recovery provisions (malus and clawback) so that the committee is able to respond appropriately in certain circumstances. These provisions have been reviewed during the year and the circumstances in which they can be used will be extended for future incentive awards, as detailed on page 163, and on page 171. This will provide all stakeholders with greater clarity over such key matters.\n\n## Alignment with stakeholder interests\n\nAs a committee we continue to be mindful of the extent to which the remuneration of the executives aligns with the experience of our customers, the environment, and other stakeholder groups.\n\nAs outlined above and on page 166 the outcomes of our executive incentive arrangements are materially influenced by our performance for customers and the environment.\n\nWith regards to employees, my role as the designated non-executive director for workforce engagement enables me to gain direct feedback across a wide range of topics, including pay and conditions. It is also helpful that the committee has a well-established\n\npractice of receiving updates on relevant matters affecting the workforce from our customer services and people director and head of reward at each meeting. Insights received from the workforce are of real value to the committee and can certainly influence our decision-making processes. Indeed, when engaging with the employee voice panel as part of our consultation on the new directors' remuneration policy it was clear that, in particular, the workforce was supportive of the proposal to introduce carbon measures to our long-term incentive arrangement.\n\n## Implementation of the director's remuneration policy during 2021/22\n\n## Salary\n\nBoard members did not receive salary increases in September 2020 in recognition of the COVID-19 pandemic but in 2021 the committee judged that the personal performance and contributions of Steve Mogford and Phil Aspin justified each receiving a base salary increase of 2 per cent with effect from 1 September 2021, which was the same as the headline increase applied across the wider workforce.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe same bonus scorecard applies throughout the company, to ensure a shared focus on the business plan at all levels. As outlined in the strategic report, we have seen another good year of performance, maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction, improving operational performance, and long-term financial resilience.\n\nOur customer performance has been strong across the board, achieving or exceeding over 80 per cent of our performance commitments and earning our highest ever one-year outcome delivery incentives (ODIs). Strong performance on customer service this year has helped drive a 14 per cent reduction in written complaints, achieving our lowest ever volume.\n\nUnderlying operating profit was up compared to last year, and the good start to the delivery of our AMP7 programme has continued, with our Time, Cost and Quality index (TCQi) score of 95.6 per cent demonstrating that we are managing our capital programmes effectively.\n\nOverall company results have led to an annual bonus scorecard out-turn of 86 per cent compared to around 82 per cent last year, and has resulted in a companywide bonus pool totalling around \u00a320 million (it was c\u00a318 million in the prior year). Prior to the committee determining the individual bonus outcomes for the executive directors, Steve Mogford informed us of his wish to unconditionally waive \u00a3150,000 of his bonus, and this is reflected in the details shown on page 178. The company has decided to use the funds to support students from the North West to pursue STEM subjects at university.\n\n## Long-term incentives\n\nThe Long Term Plan (LTP) awards granted in 2019 were the last awards to be based on three equally-weighted measures, namely relative total shareholder return, return on regulated equity (RoRE), and customer service excellence. The outcome will be confirmed in the summer of 2022 and the awards are estimated to vest in full, reflecting performance above the stretch level on each of the three measures.\n\nRelative total shareholder return over the three-year performance period was 48.1 per cent, compared to the stretch target of 39.3 per cent.

The customer service excellence measure is based on Ofwat's C-MeX (contacts) measure and written complaints. The final outcome of this element will not be known until the volume of written complaints received by other companies are available later in 2022 and the overall vesting level can be confirmed, but we estimate that we will be ranked 2nd out of the water and wastewater companies, which is one position better than the stretch target of 3rd position. The award for Steve Mogford will vest only after the completion of a holding period taking the overall vesting period to five years from the grant date, during which the shares will remain subject to withholding provisions. Phil Aspin was granted his award prior to his appointment as an executive director and so in line with the policy his award will be treated according to its original terms, with no holding period applying. In line with the shareholding guidelines, Phil will be required to hold the shares upon vesting (net of tax) and they will vest into a nominee account.\n\n## Remuneration committee oversight\n\nln addition to reviewing performance against the specific targets set under the annual bonus and LTP, the committee carefully consider the outcomes to be delivered in the context of the wider performance of the business and the experience of our stakeholders. Taking account of performance in areas such as those outlined on pages 52 to 75, the committee was satisfied that the overall results reflected the exceptional efforts and high levels of performance of the company and therefore no discretion was used to adjust the formulaic outcome under the bonus or provisional LTP vesting. As stated above, Steve Mogford's request to waive part of his bonus was actioned.\n\n## Chief executive officer succession\n\nIn April 2022, the company announced that Steve Mogford had expressed his wish to retire in early 2023, and that following a comprehensive internal and external evaluation process, Louise Beardmore would be appointed as his successor. As a committee, we are delighted at Louise's appointment, and have particularly valued her excellent contributions to the work of the committee in her role as customer services and people director.\n\nTo enable a smooth transition Louise was appointed to the board on 1 May 2022 as CEO designate, leading the creation of the company's PR24 business plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur policy review focused on how we might strengthen the extent to which environmental, social and governance matters are reflected in our executive remuneration arrangements.'\n\ncovering the next five-year regulatory period. The committee determined that on her appointment to the board her salary should be set at \u00a3425,000 and her other remuneration arrangements would be set in line with the current remuneration policy, including pension arrangements in line with those available to the wider workforce. However, in anticipation that the proposed policy will be approved at the forthcoming AGM, Louise agreed that her notice period would be 12 months for each party (rather than the differing periods stipulated under the existing policy).\n\nLater in the year, the committee will consider the salary and remuneration arrangements that should apply on Louise's appointment as CEO in 2023. Full details about her remuneration during 2022/23 and her package as CEO will be provided in next year's report.\n\n## Agenda for 2022/23\n\nWe are confident that the annual bonus measures used in 2021/22 will continue to support the business strategy in 2022/23, but that it is also the right time to supplement the bonus scorecard with some new performance measures. We have introduced two new measures for the year, one focusing on improving the appearance of drinking water, and the other on delivering our Better Rivers commitments. We have also revised our existing TCQi measure to place renewed emphasis on the efficiency of our capital programme delivery, and also to take account of the carbon impact of enhancement projects.  Further information about these measures and the overall bonus scorecard is shown on page 181.\n\nThe 2022 LTP awards will operate similarly to those granted in 2021, with four new carbon measures being included in the customer basket. We have accelerated the target-setting process compared to previous years so that the measures and targets that are expected to apply to the awards can be included in this report, with full details being shown on pages 181 to 182. As referred to earlier in this letter, we are seeking approval of the new Long Term Plan 2022 at the AGM, and so we will wait until late July to grant the LTP awards in order that they might be granted under this new plan if it is approved. If it is not approved, the awards will again be granted under the existing LTP 2013.\n\nIn March, the company announced that after nearly nine years on the board Mark Clare will not seek reappointment at the 2022 AGM. I would like to thank Mark for all of his contributions to the committee over the years. Having reviewed the membership of board committees we have confirmed that I will succeed Mark in the role of senior independent nonexecutive director, and so I will step down as chair of the remuneration committee, although I will remain a member of the committee. I am delighted that Kath Cates, who has been a member of the committee since September 2020, will take over as committee chair when these changes take effect from 22 July 2022.\n\nWe hope we will continue to receive your support again this year for the remuneration resolutions at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Alison Goligher\n\nChair of the remuneration committee",

The committee retains overarching discretion in both the annual bonus and LTP schemes to adjust payouts where the formulaic outcomes are not considered reflective of underlying business performance and individual contributions. Robust withholding and recovery provisions apply to variable incentives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\nPerformance measures used in our variable incentive schemes are selected to be consistent with the company's purpose, values and strategy. The use of annual bonus deferral, LTP holding periods and our shareholding requirements provide a clear link to the ongoing performance of the group and ensure alignment with shareholders, which continues after employment.\n\n## Remuneration approach\n\nThere are three key principles of our approach to executive remuneration.\n\n1\n\nAlign to our purpose, vision and strategy\n\n2\n\n3\n\nIncentivise great customer service\n\n## Create long-term value\n\nfor all of our stakeholders\n\n<!-- image -->",

Many of the performance measures are key performance indicators (KPIs) for the regulatory period 2020-25 (see pages 50 to 51).

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration policy\n\nThis part of the directors' remuneration report sets out the remuneration policy for the company and has been prepared in accordance with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. The policy in this report will be put to a binding shareholder vote at the AGM on 22 July 2022 and will take formal effect from that date, subject to shareholder approval. It is intended that the policy will apply for three years beginning on the date of approval.\n\n## Overview of remuneration policy\n\nThe company's remuneration arrangements are designed to promote the long-term success of the company. The company does not pay more than is necessary for this purpose. The committee recognises that the company operates in the North West of England in a regulated environment and therefore needs to ensure that the structure of executive remuneration reflects both the practices of the markets in which its executives operate, and stakeholder expectations of how the company should be run.\n\nThe committee monitors the remuneration arrangements to ensure that there is an appropriate balance between risk and reward and that the long-term performance of the business is not compromised by the pursuit of short-term value. There is a strong direct link between incentives and the company's strategy, and if the strategy is delivered within an acceptable level of risk, senior executives will be rewarded through the annual bonus and long-term incentives. If it is not delivered, then a significant part of their potential remuneration will not be paid.\n\nThe committee also understands that listening to the views of the company's key stakeholders plays a vital role in formulating and implementing a successful remuneration policy over the long term. The committee thus actively seeks the views of shareholders and other key stakeholders to inform the development of the remuneration policy, particularly where any changes to policy are envisaged. Account is taken of employee views when consulting on the policy, typically via the employee voice panel. Additionally, the company carries out annual employee engagement surveys and regular discussion takes place with union representatives on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements, all of which can provide insight which is of value to the committee. The general base salary increase and broader remuneration arrangements, including pension provision, for the wider employee population are considered by the committee when determining remuneration policy for the executive directors. As outlined on page 184 processes are in place for the committee to regularly review and consider any remuneration-related matters that may arise from the activities undertaken by the board to take account of the 'employee voice'.\n\n## Future policy for directors\n\n## Base salary\n\nPurpose and link to strategy: To attract and retain executives of the experience and quality required to deliver the company's strategy.\n\n## Operation\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nNormally reviewed annually, typically effective 1 September.\n\nSignificant increases in salary should only take place infrequently, for example where there has been a material increase in:\n\n- \u00b7 the size of the individual's role;\n- \u00b7 the size of the company (through mergers and acquisitions); or\n- \u00b7 the pay market for directly comparable companies (for example, companies of a similar size and complexity).\n\nOn recruitment or promotion to executive director, the committee will take into account previous remuneration, and pay levels for comparable companies, when setting salary levels. This may lead to salary being set at a lower or higher level than for the previous incumbent.\n\nCurrent salary levels are shown in the annual report on remuneration.\n\nExecutive directors will normally receive a salary increase that is generally no greater than the increase awarded to the general workforce, unless one or more of the conditions outlined under 'Operation' is met.\n\nWhere the committee has set the salary of a new hire at a discount to the market level initially, a series of planned increases can be implemented over the following few years to bring the salary to the appropriate market position, subject to individual performance.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone",

From 1 January 2023 arrangements for such executive directors will be aligned to the approach available to the wider workforce.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone\n\n## Benefits\n\nPurpose and link to strategy: To provide market competitive benefits to help recruit and retain high-calibre executives.\n\n## Operation\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nProvision of benefits such as:\n\n- \u00b7 health benefits;\n- \u00b7 green travel allowance;\n- \u00b7 relocation assistance;\n- \u00b7 life assurance;\n- \u00b7 group income protection;\n- \u00b7 all employee share schemes (e.g. opportunity to join the ShareBuy scheme);\n- \u00b7 travel; and\n- \u00b7 communication costs.\n\nAny reasonable business-related expenses can be reimbursed (and any tax thereon met if determined to be a taxable benefit).\n\nExecutives will be eligible for any other benefits that are introduced for the wider workforce on broadly similar terms and additional benefits might be provided from time to time if the committee decides payment of such benefits is appropriate and in line with emerging market practice.\n\nAs it is not possible to calculate in advance the cost of all benefits, a maximum is not predetermined.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone",

'Target' performance is typically set in line with the business plan for the year, following rigorous debate and approval of the plan by the board. Threshold to stretch targets are then typically set based on a sliding scale on the basis of relevant commercial factors.\n\nOnly modest rewards are available for delivering threshold performance levels, with rewards at stretch normally requiring substantial outperformance of the business plan. Details of the measures used for the annual bonus are given in the annual report on remuneration.\n\nThe current Long Term Plan (LTP) measures were selected by the committee following an extensive review and shareholder consultation in 2018/19, to align with the company's key strategic goals for the five-year regulatory period which began in 2020, and be closely linked to the creation of long-term shareholder value as follows:\n\n| Measure                            | What is it?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Key reasons for selection                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Return on Regulated Equity  (RoRE) | RoRE is the return that the company is  expected to earn relative to the equity portion  of its Regulatory Capital Value.

All assessments of performance are ultimately subject to the committee's judgement. Any discretion exercised, and the rationale, will be disclosed in the annual remuneration report.\n\nAll historic awards that were granted under any current or previous bonus or share schemes operated by the company and remain outstanding remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms.",

Copies of non-executive directors' letters of appointment can also be viewed on the company's website.\n\nThe notice period in the service contracts for executive directors' appointed on or after 1 May 2022 is one year. For executive directors appointed prior to 1 May 2022 the notice period is up to one year when terminated by the company and at least six months' notice when terminated by the director.  The policy on payments for loss of office is set out in the next section.\n\nThe Chair and other non-executive directors have letters of appointment rather than service contracts.

Any such payments would be limited to a reasonable estimate of value of remuneration lost when leaving the former employer and would reflect the delivery mechanism (i.e. cash and/or share-based), time horizons and whether performance requirements are attached to that remuneration. Shareholders will be informed of any such payments at the time of appointment.\n\n## Maximum level of variable pay\n\nThe maximum level of long-term incentives that may be awarded to a new executive director will be limited to the maximum Long Term Plan limit of 200 per cent of salary per annum. Therefore, the maximum level of overall variable pay that may be offered will be 330 per cent of salary (i.e. 130 per cent annual bonus plus 200 per cent Long Term Plan). These limits are in addition to the value of any buyout arrangements which are governed by the policy above.\n\nIn the case of an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role would be allowed to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other previously awarded entitlements would continue, and be disclosed in the next annual report on remuneration.\n\n## Base salary and relocation expenses\n\nBase salary levels for new executive directors will be set in accordance with the policy, taking into account the experience of the individual recruited and the market rate for the role. The committee has the flexibility to set the salary of a new appointee at a discount to the market level initially, with a series of planned increases implemented over the following years to bring the salary to the appropriate market position, subject to individual performance in the role.\n\nThe committee may agree that the company will meet certain relocation and/or incidental expenses as appropriate.\n\n## Annual bonus performance conditions\n\nWhere a new executive director is appointed part way through a financial year, the committee may set different annual bonus measures and targets for the new executive director from those used for other executive directors (for the initial part-year only).\n\n## Appointment of non-executive directors\n\nFor the appointment of a new Chair or non-executive director, the fee arrangement would be set in accordance with the approved remuneration policy in force at that time. Non-executive directors' fees are set by a separate committee of the board; the Chair's fees are set by the remuneration committee.",

Time prorating will normally apply unless the committee determines otherwise. Awards may alternatively be exchanged for new equivalent awards in the acquirer, where appropriate.",

The committee judged that the increase was supported by very good individual and business performance.\n\n|                    | Base salary \u00a3'000   | Base salary \u00a3'000   |\n|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Executive director | 1 September 2021    | 1 September 2020    |\n| Steve Mogford      | 790.7               | 775.2               |\n| Phil Aspin         | 408.0               | 400.0               |\n\n## Pensions\n\nSteve Mogford has a contractual entitlement to receive a cash allowance of 22 per cent of base salary in lieu of pension. In accordance with Code provision 38, his pension arrangements will be aligned to those of the wider workforce with effect from 1 January 2023 and will reduce to 12 percent of base salary from that date. Phil Aspin receives a cash allowance of 12 per cent of base salary in lieu of pension which aligns with the workforce rate, and again illustrates the committee's intention to reposition the overall executive remuneration package. For employees, the company doubles any contributions that employees make up to a maximum of 14 per cent of salary.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFor executive directors, benefits included: a car allowance of \u00a314,000; health, life cover and income protection insurance; travel costs; and communication costs. Aside from the transition from a car allowance to a green travel allowance under the proposed policy no material changes are expected to benefits during the year commencing 1 April 2022.\n\n## External appointments\n\nPhil Aspin was a member of the UK Endorsement Board during the year ended 31 March 2022 for which he received and retained an annual fee of \u00a314,000.",

        "page_content": "## Corporate governance report\n\nAnnual report on remuneration\n\n## Annual bonus\n\n## Deferred Bonus Plan awards made in the year ended 31 March 2022 (audited information)\n\nBonuses are earned by reference to performance in the financial year and paid in June following the end of the financial year. Fifty per cent of any bonus is deferred into shares under the Deferred Bonus Plan. These awards vest after three years and are subject to withholding provisions. There are no service or additional performance conditions attached.\n\nThe table below provides details of share awards made on 16 June 2021 to the executive directors as at that date in respect of deferred share bonus payments for the 2020/21 financial year.\n\n| Executive director   | Type of award      | Basis of award   | Number of shares   | Face value of award (1) (\u00a3'000)   | End of deferral period   |\n|----------------------|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Steve Mogford        | Conditional shares | 50% of bonus     | 39,987             | \u00a3412                              | 17.6.2023                |\n| Phil Aspin           | Conditional shares | 50% of bonus (2) | 16,246             | \u00a3167                              | 17.6.2023                |\n\n## Annual bonus in respect of financial year ended 31 March 2022 (audited information)\n\nThe performance measures, targets and outcomes in respect of the executive directors' annual bonus for the year ended 31 March 2022 are set out below. The table on page 166 summarises how the performance measures are linked to our business strategy, including delivery for customers and the environment. As disclosed in last year's report, the annual bonus for 2021/22 was wholly aligned to the group bonus scorecard with no specific personal performance element, although when determining the overall outcomes and whether any discretion should be exercised the committee takes into account the personal contributions of each individual. The committee was satisfied that the bonus scorecard outcome was reflective of overall company performance during the year and was aligned with the delivery of outcomes for our stakeholders (including those detailed on pages 52 to 75) and, as such, it would not seek to exercise its discretion over the bonuses for the executive directors. As outlined on page 161, prior to the committee determining the individual bonus outcomes for the executive directors, Steve Mogford expressed his wish to unconditionally waive \u00a3150,000 of any bonus that would otherwise have been due, and so this is reflected in the details shown in the table below.\n\nVesting\n\n| Measure                                             | % weighting  of

As Steve Mogford was an executive director when his award was granted in 2019 it will normally vest following an additional holding period so that the overall vesting period is at least five years from the grant date, and the unvested shares will remain subject to withholding provisions during this holding period. Phil Aspin was not an executive director when his award was granted and so in line with the remuneration policy this historic award will vest once the final outcome is confirmed. Under the shareholding guidelines he will be required to hold the vesting shares (on a net of tax basis).\n\nPerformance against each of the three measures applicable to the 2019 LTP has been very strong as shown in the table below. Note that the final outcome for the customer service excellence measure (which forms one-third of the award) will not be known until the customer service scores for the other water and wastewater companies are published in late summer 2022. The values of the 2019 LTP awards in the single total figure of remuneration table are therefore estimated and will be restated if necessary in next year's report.\n\nOnce the final outcome of the customer service excellence measure is known, before approving the final vesting outcome for the awards the committee will determine whether the underpins have been met and will also consider whether there should be any discretion applied.\n\nAchieved\n\n|

When determining the measures that should form the customer basket component of the awards the committee took into account feedback received from customer research and focus groups (as to which areas of service and performance they considered the highest priority) and the performance commitments agreed with Ofwat in the final determination for the regulatory period, thereby ensuring that the measures selected reflected the views and priorities of key stakeholders. The committee is pleased that alongside focusing on areas of performance that will have meaningful and tangible outcomes for customers, the measures chosen reflect its commitment to recognising evolving expectations in regard to environmental, social and governance matters.\n\nDetails about the 2021 LTP performance measures and targets are shown in the following table. Performance is measured over the threeyear period 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2024. The table on page 166 summarises how these performance measures are linked to our business strategy, including delivery for customers and the environment.\n\nTargets\n\n(1)\n\n| Measure                                                  | Threshold (25% vesting)                                                                                           | Stretch (100% vesting)                                                                                             | Weighting   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE)                        | Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE)                                                                                 |                                                                                                                    |             |\n| Company RoRE                                             | Equal to the average of Ofwat's allowed RoRE over the three financial years of the performance period             | 1.5% (or more) above the average of Ofwat's allowed RoRE over  the three financial years of the performance period | 50.0%       |\n| Customer basket of measures (2)                          | Customer basket of measures (2)                                                                                   |                                                                                                                    |             |\n| C-MeX ranking out of all the  other water and wastewater | Ranked 8th                                                                                                        | Ranked 4th (or better)                                                                                             | 5.0%        |\n| companies (3) Water poverty (3)                          | 64,300 customers have been lifted  out of water poverty                                                           | 83,900 (or more) customers have  been lifted out of water poverty                                                  | 5.0%        |\n| Priority services (3)                                    | No threshold target.

This new measure will focus on the delivery of our programme milestones.                                                               |\n| Capital programme delivery incentive  (CPDi) | The new CPDi measure is an evolution of the Time, Cost and Quality (TCQi) measure  we have used in recent years, in which the time, cost and quality of our capital  programme delivery remains important, but with an increased emphasis on efficiency.  CPDi also takes account of the carbon impact of our enhancement projects, providing a  further environmental element to the annual bonus arrangements. |\n\nThe table below summarises the measures, weightings and targets for the 2022/23 bonus.

This provides the committee with time to consider and respond appropriately to any matters that were not known at the end of the relevant performance period but become apparent during the deferral period. This could include the use of the withholding and recovery provisions.\n\n## 2022 LTP awards with a performance period ending 31 March 2025\n\nThe 2022 LTP award level for executive directors will remain unchanged at 130 per cent of base salary. As outlined on page 163 the committee is seeking approval of the new Long Term Plan 2022 at the 2022 AGM, and so we will wait until late July to grant the LTP awards in order that they might be granted under this new plan if it is approved. If it is not approved, the awards will again be granted under the existing LTP 2013.\n\nWhile awards will not be granted until after the AGM, the committee has accelerated the target-setting process compared to previous years so that the measures and targets that are expected to apply to the awards are available to shareholders in this directors' remuneration report.\n\nConsistent with the approach in 2020 and 2021 the awards will be based on Return on Regulated Equity and a customer basket of measures, with each component being equally weighted at 50 per cent.\n\nStretching targets have been set for the RoRE measure taking into account the allowed return over the period (as set out in the final determination) and the expected returns to be generated through financial and operational performance.\n\nIn respect of the customer basket, the approach used to date means that award outcomes are directly attributable to clearly identified customer, environmental and social measures, including those which are within scope of our key regulators.",

This runs to the heart of living our purpose to provide great water and more for the North West.\n\nClimate change is a priority risk to the company and its stakeholders because the affordability and resilience of our operations and services fundamentally rely on a stable climate and a healthy natural environment. You can find out more about our long-standing approach to both carbon reduction (mitigation) and climate resilience (adaptation) as detailed in our TCFD on pages 86 to 99.\n\nWe have recently enhanced our carbon commitments and governance after achieving previous goals to further grow our renewable energy generation capabilities and purchase only certified green electricity. We made six new carbon pledges in 2020, and in 2021 we became the first UK water company to independently verify that we have international best practice Science-Based Targets (SBTs). This means that our targets have been assessed to ensure they follow a reduction trajectory sufficient to help prevent the most damaging effects of climate change by limiting average global warming to no more than 1.5 o C.\n\nIn our 2022 LTP we will introduce four measures covering four priority areas of our carbon agenda, each with an equal weighting of 2.5 per cent, so that 10 per cent of the overall LTP outcome is directly related to carbon-related performance. In the longer term, as we further mature our carbon plan, we aspire to introducing one or two holistic carbon measures that are directly aligned to our SBTs for 2030.\n\nTo create space for the new carbon measures we have removed the C-MeX and water quality contacts measures used in previous LTP awards on the basis that they are both covered under the 2022/23 annual bonus. With these new carbon measures, the whole of the customer basket now focuses executives on areas of performance that are in the interests of customers and have an environmental or social impact.\n\nTargets\n\n(1)\n\n| Measure                                             | Threshold (25% vesting)                                                                                                                      | Stretch (100% vesting)                                                                                                                                                       | Weighting   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE)                   | Return on Regulated Equity (RoRE)                                                                                                            |                                                                                                                                                                              |             |\n| Company RoRE                                        | 0.25% above the average of Ofwat's allowed RoRE over the three financial years of the performance period                                     | 2.00% (or more) above the average of Ofwat's allowed RoRE over  the three financial years of the performance period                                                          | 50.0%       |\n| Customer basket of measures (2)                     | Customer basket of measures (2)                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                              |             |\n| Carbon - green fleet                                | 170 electric or other low carbon vehicles will be deployed in our fleet by                                                                   | 200 (or more) electric or other low  carbon vehicles will be deployed in our  fleet by 31 March 2025                                                                         | 2.5%        |\n| Carbon - peatland restoration                       | 31 March 2025  527 hectares of peatland will be restored and certified to the Peatland Carbon Code (or equivalent standard) by 31 March 2025 | 644 hectares (or more) of peatland will  be restored and certified to the Peatland  Carbon Code (or equivalent standard) by                                                  | 2.5%        |\n| Carbon - woodland creation                          | 77 hectares of woodland will be created and certified to the Woodland Carbon Code (or equivalent standard) by 31 March 2025                  | 31 March 2025 94 hectares (or more) of woodland will  be created and certified to the Woodland  Carbon Code (or equivalent standard)                                         | 2.5%        |\n| Carbon - supply chain                               | No threshold target.

At each of its meetings the committee receives an update on notable matters affecting pay and benefits among the wider workforce since its previous meeting, and at least annually the committee formally reviews and discusses a report detailing all elements of the workforce's pay and benefits.\n\nThe committee has mechanisms through which it hears from and engages with the workforce on executive pay. As chair of the committee, insights related to remuneration that arise via Alison Goligher in her role as designated non-executive director for workforce engagement can be quickly and appropriately considered, and a formal report is presented to the committee at least annually in this respect. Alison hosts sessions with the Employee Voice panel which cover topics including the alignment of our executive pay approach with that of the wider workforce, providing valuable opportunities for open discussions and feedback. See page 126 for further details. During the year, the committee sought views from the Employee Voice panel as part of the consultation on the proposed directors' remuneration policy.\n\nThe figures below show how the percentage change in the CEO's salary, benefits and bonus earned in 2020/21 and 2021/22 compares with the percentage change in the average of each of those components for a group of employees. The table below that shows the same information in respect of each board member.\n\n## Change in CEO remuneration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Change in other board member remuneration\n\n|                             | Salary/Total Fees (1)   | Salary/Total Fees (1)   | Benefits (6)      | Benefits (6)      | Bonus             | Bonus             |\n|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Year ended 31 March         | 2022 versus  2021       | 2021 versus  2020       | 2022 versus  2021 | 2021 versus  2020 | 2022 versus  2021 | 2021 versus  2020 |\n| Executive directors         |                         |                         |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Steve Mogford               | 6.5%                    | -4.2%                   | -23.9%            | -14.1%            | -11.8%            | 16.7%             |\n| Phil Aspin (7)              | 1.2%                    | n/a                     | 61.6%             | n/a               | 7. 6 %            | n/a               |\n| Non-executive directors (8) |                         |                         |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Sir David Higgins           | 6.5%                    | 111.1%                  | 1,555.9%          | -96.6%            | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Liam Butterworth (9)        | n/a                     | n/a                     | n/a               | n/a               | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Stephen Carter              | 6.3%                    | -4.4%                   | 1,556.3%          | -93.0%            | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Kath Cates (9)              | 6.5%                    | n/a                     | 1,555.9%          | n/a               | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Mark Clare                  | 6.3%                    | -4.4%                   | 1,555.9%          | -96.6%            | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Alison Goligher (10)        | 11.5%                   | 9.4%                    | 708.6%            | -81.0%            | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Brian May (7)               | 6.5%                    | -4.4%                   | 5,076.4%          | -96.6%            | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Paulette Rowe               | 6.5%                    | -4.2%                   | 782.1%            | -95.2%            | n/a               | n/a               |\n| Doug Webb (9) (11)          | 23.6%                   | n/a                     | 1,418.0%          | n/a               | n/a               | n/a               |",

The ratios have been calculated in accordance with the regulations which provide for three different approaches to determine the pay ratio (Options A, B and C).\n\nThe data in the tables below has been calculated using Option A which is considered to be the most accurate methodology and uses the same calculation basis as required for the CEO's total remuneration as shown in the single figure table on page 177.\n\n- \u00b7 We identified all employees who received base salary during the year ended 31 March 2022 and who were still employed on that date.\n- \u00b7 The calculations were carried out using their total pay and benefits received in respect of the year ended 31 March 2022, including bonuses earned by reference to performance in the financial year and paid in June following the end of the financial year.\n- \u00b7 For employees who were employed on a part-time basis, or who were not employed for the full year, their remuneration has been annualised to reflect the full-time equivalent.\n- \u00b7 No other estimates or adjustments have been used in the calculations and no other remuneration items have been omitted.\n\nFinancial year\n\n|                                                    | 2021/22   | 2020/21   | 2019/20   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Methodology used                                   | A         | A         | A         |\n| Average number of employees                        | 5,866     | 5,570     | 5,461     |\n| Ratio of CEO single figure total remuneration: (1) |           |           |           |\n| - To employee at the 25th percentile               | 92:1      | 97:1      | 87:1      |\n| - To employee at the 50th percentile               | 69:1      | 72:1      | 66:1      |\n| - To employee at the 75th percentile               | 54:1      | 57:1      | 53:1      |\n| Ratio of CEO base salary plus annual bonus:        |           |           |           |\n| - To employee at the 25th percentile               | 44:1      | 52:1      | 47:1      |\n| - To employee at the 50th percentile               | 37:1      | 38:1      | 37:1      |\n| - To employee at the 75th percentile               | 30:1      | 30:1      | 31:1      |\n| Ratio of CEO base salary:                          |           |           |           |\n| - To employee at the 25th percentile               | 24:1      | 26:1      | 26:1      |\n| - To employee at the 50th percentile               | 20:1      | 19:1      | 20:1      |\n| - To employee at the 75th percentile               | 17:1      | 15:1      | 17:1      |\n| Additional details                                 |           |           |           |\n| CEO total single figure (\u00a3'000)                    | 3,178     | 3,323     | 2,925     |\n| CEO base salary plus annual bonus (\u00a3'000)          | 1,511     | 1,560     | 1,476     |\n| CEO base salary (\u00a3'000)                            | 784       | 736       | 769       |\n| Employees total pay and benefits (\u00a3'000)           |           |           |           |\n| - at the 25th percentile                           | 35        | 34        | 33        |\n| - at the 50th percentile                           | 46        | 46        | 44        |\n| - at the 75th percentile                           | 59        | 58        | 56        |\n| Employees base salary plus annual bonus (\u00a3'000)    |           |           |           |\n| - at the 25th percentile                           | 34        | 30        | 32        |\n| - at the 50th percentile                           | 41        | 42        | 40        |\n| - at the 75th percentile                           | 51        | 52        | 48        |\n| Employees base salary (\u00a3'000)                      |           |           |           |\n| - at the 25th percentile                           | 32        | 29        | 30        |\n| - at the 50th percentile                           | 39        | 39        | 38        |\n| - at the 75th percentile                           | 47        | 50        | 44        |\n\nAlong with the ratios comparing total remuneration, the committee keeps under review the ratios for salary and salary plus annual bonus, and tracks how these change over time. With a significant proportion of the remuneration of the CEO linked to company performance and share price movements over the longer term, it is expected that the headline ratios will depend primarily on the Long Term Plan (LTP) outcome, and, accordingly, may fluctuate from year to year. Participation in the LTP is currently limited to around 55 executives and senior leaders, with none of the individuals identified as P25, P50 and P75 in this group. On the other hand, employees at all levels participate in the annual bonus scheme, and so the committee considers this ratio as well as the ratio comparing only salary, to provide helpful additional context.\n\nThis year the pay ratio of CEO single figure total remuneration to the median employee (P50) has reduced slightly compared to last year at 69:1, with a reduction also being noticeable at P25 and P75. The committee observes a similar picture across the other reported ratios, which is to be expected given our approach to cascading the annual bonus and having aligned executive director salary increases with the broader workforce. The committee will continue to consider the pay ratios in the context of other important metrics such as the gender pay gap and employee engagement levels.",

The company does not make regular purchases of shares into the Trust nor employ a share purchase hedging strategy, and shares are bought to satisfy the vesting of share plans. The rules of the Deferred Bonus Plan do not permit awards to be satisfied by newly issued shares and must be satisfied by market purchased shares. The rules of the Long Term Plan permit the awards to be satisfied by newly issued shares but the company has decided to satisfy awards by market purchased shares.\n\nShould the company's method of satisfying share plan vestings change (i.e. issuing new shares) then the company would monitor the number of shares issued and their impact on dilution limits set by the Investment Association in respect of all share plans (10 per cent in any rolling ten-year period) and executive share plans (5 per cent in any rolling ten-year period). No treasury shares were held or utilised in the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\n## Company performance and CEO remuneration comparison\n\nThe total shareholder return (TSR) chart below illustrates the company's performance against the FTSE 100 over the past ten years. The FTSE 100 is an appropriate comparator as the company is a member of the FTSE 100 and it is a widely published benchmark for this purpose. The chart shows the growth in the value of a hypothetical \u00a3100 holding invested in the company over the ten-year period. The chart also shows the CEO's single total figure remuneration over the ten years ended 31 March 2022 for comparison.

The CFO is supported by a specialist team of tax professionals with many years of tax experience within the water sector and led by the head of tax.\n\nThe head of tax has day-to-day responsibility for managing the group's tax affairs and engages regularly with key stakeholders from around the group in ensuring that tax risk is proactively managed. Where appropriate, he will engage with both external advisers and HMRC to provide additional required certainty with the aim of ensuring that any residual risk is typically low. All significant tax issues are reported to the board regularly.\n\nConsistent with the group's general risk management framework, all tax risks are assessed for the likelihood of occurrence and the negative financial or reputational impact on the group and its objectives, should the event occur. In any given period, the key tax risk is likely to be the introduction of unexpected legislative or tax practice changes which lead to increased cash outflow which has not been reflected in the current regulatory settlement. The group is committed to actively engaging with relevant authorities to manage any such risk.\n\nIn any given year, the group's effective cash tax rate on underlying profits may fluctuate from the standard UK rate mainly due to the available tax deductions on capital investment. These deductions are achieved as a result of utilising tax incentives, which have been explicitly put in place by successive governments precisely to encourage such investment. This reflects responsible corporate behaviour in relation to tax.\n\n## Taxes/contributions to public finances for 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Under the regulatory framework the group operates within, the majority of any benefit from reduced tax payments will typically not be retained by the group but will pass to customers; reducing their bills. For 2021/22, the impact of tax deductions on capital investment alone reduced average household bills by around \u00a320.\n\nThe group's principal subsidiary, United Utilities Water Limited (UUW), operates solely in the UK and its customers are based here. All of the group's profits are taxable in the UK and the group's one remaining overseas subsidiary, a non-trading former holding company in the Netherlands, is currently in liquidation.\n\nEvery year, the group pays significant contributions to the public finances on its own behalf as well as collecting and paying further amounts for its 5,000 strong workforce. Details of the total payments for 2022 of around \u00a3230 million are set out opposite.\n\nThe above tax policy disclosure meets the group's statutory requirement under Paragraph 16(2) of Schedule 19 of Finance Act 2016 to publish its UK tax strategy for the year ended 31 March 2022.\n\nSee our website for our latest separate annual tax report, which includes further details in relation to the following key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 How much tax we pay;\n- \u00b7 How we ensure that we pay the right tax at the right time; and\n- \u00b7 How we ensure that our tax affairs are transparent for all our stakeholders.\n\nRecognising the group's ongoing commitment to paying its fair share of tax and acting in an open and transparent manner in relation to its tax affairs, we were delighted to have retained the Fair Tax Mark independent certification for a third year, having been only the second FTSE 100 company to be awarded the Fair Tax Mark in July 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The wide definition of donations in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, however, covers activities which form part of the necessary relationship between the group and our political stakeholders. This can include promoting United Utilities' activities at the main political parties' annual conferences, as well as occasional stakeholder engagement in Westminster. The group incurred expenditure of \u00a315,834 (2021: \u00a35,801; 2020: \u00a323,627) as part of this process. At the 2021 AGM, an authority was taken to cover such expenditure.\n\nA similar resolution will be put to shareholders at the 2022 AGM to authorise the company and its subsidiaries to make such expenditure.\n\nAs the provider of services to seven million people across the North West, customers can sometimes contact their constituency MP and ask that they raise an issue with the company on their behalf. In 2021/22, we received 378 such MP contacts covering a wide variety of topics, including flooding, water supply and land management. As part of our work to build constructive relationships with all our stakeholders, we encourage MPs and members of their offices to work closely with us to address constituency concerns and arrange case work events to discuss such issues in detail. Throughout the year, when COVID-19 guidelines allowed, we held face-to-face meetings with key MPs to discuss a number of topics, including river water quality, storm overflows and recreational land management.\n\nWe engage regularly with the two devolved administrations in the North West - the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) and the Liverpool City Region (LCR) - as well as the region's local authorities, on a range of topics of shared interest, such as tackling flooding risk and enhancing the North West's natural capital. Our sponsorship of the All Party Political Groups for GMCA and LCR helps bring MPs and peers of all parties together with key leaders to help maximise future investment in these area for the benefit of local communities.\n\nIn addition, the company's activities to engage with political stakeholders on matters relevant to the water industry and its operating footprint of North West England extend to its membership of trade associations. This is described in the section below.\n\nWe are members of a small number of trade associations. Some have a national focus, such as Water UK, the representative body of the UK water industry, and the Confederation of British Industry. Others focus on specific professions such as the 100 Group representing the views of the finance directors of FTSE 100 and large UK private companies and the GC 100, the voice of general counsel and company secretaries in FTSE 100 companies. The company is a member of regional bodies, such as the North West Business Leadership Team which encourages engagement across the public and private sectors. Our total contribution to these associations in 2021/22 was \u00a3408,441 (2020/21:\u00a3420,403; 2019/20: \u00a3400,916).\n\nThrough Water UK, the company has supported efforts to interact with parliamentary bodies, such as Select Committees and Chairs of specific committees, to provide information on topics such as the performance of storm overflows in relation to river water quality. The company supported Water UK in its effort to engage the Government as the Environment Bill passed through its parliamentary stages, including preparation of the 21st century rivers report.\n\nThrough our membership with both the CBI, in particular as a member of its North West regional council, and the North West Business Leadership Team, we have engaged with regional MPs and political stakeholders, such as local authorities and metro mayors, to explore how the business community can work more effectively with the public sector to drive economic growth in the region and tackle some of the North West's pressing social issues. For example, we have participated in discussions as part of the unlocking regional growth/levelling up agenda, and employee resilience and wellbeing.\n\nOur policies on employee consultation and on equal opportunities for all employees can be found on pages 22 and 24. Applicants with disabilities are given equal consideration in our application process, and disabled colleagues have equipment and working practices modified for them as far as possible and where it is safe and practical to do so. Importance is placed on strengthening employees' engagement (see page 30). The effect of our regard towards employees in relation to the decisions taken during the financial year is included in our S172(1) Statement on pages 40 to 41.\n\nEmployees are encouraged to own shares in the company through the operation of an all employee share incentive plan (ShareBuy).\n\nInformation on our average number of employees during the year can be found in note 3 on page 221.",

Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements on the same basis.\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company and of the group's profit or loss for that period.  In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;\n- \u00b7 state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 assess the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006.  They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a strategic report, directors' report, directors' remuneration report and corporate governance statement that complies with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website.  Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nIn accordance with Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 4.1.14R, the financial statements will form part of the annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format under the TD ESEF Regulation.  The auditor's report on these financial statements provides no assurance over the ESEF format.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report/directors' report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nApproved by the board on 25 May 2022 and signed on its behalf by:\n\n## Sir David Higgins\n\nChair\n\n## Phil Aspin\n\nChief Financial Officer",

Our opinion is unmodified\n\nWe have audited the financial statements of United Utilities Group PLC ('the company') for the year ended 31 March 2022 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated and Company statements of financial position, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, the Company statement of changes in equity, the Consolidated and Company statements of cash flows, and the related notes, including the accounting policies on pages 217 to 219 and 257 to 261.\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31 March 2022 and of the group's loss for the year then ended;\n- \u00b7 the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and\n- \u00b7 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law.  Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion is consistent with our report to the audit committee.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders on 22 July 2011.  The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 11 financial years ended 31 March 2022.\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities. No non-audit services prohibited by that standard were provided.\n\n## Overview\n\nMateriality: group financial statements as a whole\n\n\u00a316.5m (2021: \u00a319.0m)\n\n5.6% (2021: 4.1%) of normalised group profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Coverage          | 100% (2021: 100%) of group profit before tax                    |                        |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Key audit matters | Key audit matters                                               | Change in risk vs 2021 |\n|                   | Recurring Revenue recognition and  allowance for customer debts | \uf074 \uf075                    |\n|                   | Capitalisation of costs relating to  the capital programme      | \uf074 \uf075                    |\n|                   | Valuation of retirement benefit  obligations                    | \uf074 \uf075                    |\n\n## 2. Key audit matters: our assessment of risks of material misstatements\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. We summarise below the key audit matters, in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.",

The financial statements (see accounting policies on page 218) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the group.\n\n## Subjective classification:\n\nThe group has a substantial capital programme which has been agreed with the Water Services Regulation Authority (Ofwat) and therefore incurs significant annual expenditure in relation to the development and maintenance of both infrastructure and non-infrastructure assets.\n\nThe determination of in-year project costs as capital or operating expenditure is inherently judgemental. We determined that the costs capitalised has a high degree of judgement, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole. The financial statements (see accounting policies on pages 218 to 219) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the group.\n\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on the group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting analysis: assessed the derecognition of revenue for compliance with relevant accounting standards where the collection of consideration is not probable on the date of initial recognition;\n- \u00b7 Methodology choice: assessed the appropriateness of the customer debt provisioning policy based on historical cash collections, credits, re-bills and write-off information, and estimates of future economic scenarios and their impact on credit losses;\n- \u00b7 Sensitivity analysis: considered the sensitivity of the key assumptions; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: assessed the adequacy of the group's disclosures of its revenue recognition and customer debt provisioning policies, including the judgement involved in recording revenue and estimation uncertainty of the doubtful debts provision.\n\n## Our results:\n\n- \u00b7 We found the amount of the revenue recognised to be acceptable (2021: acceptable); and\n- \u00b7 We considered the level of doubtful debt provisioning to be acceptable (2021: acceptable).\n\nWe performed the detailed tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the group's controls because our knowledge of the design of these controls indicated that we would not be able to obtain the required evidence to support reliance on controls.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Accounting analysis: assessed the group's capitalisation policy for compliance with relevant accounting standards;\n- \u00b7 Tests of details: critically assessed the capital nature of a sample of projects against the capitalisation policy focusing on new projects approved, project overspend, forecast cost to complete; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: assessed the adequacy of the group's disclosures of its capitalisation policy including the judgement involved in assessing expenditure as capital.\n\n## Our results:\n\n- \u00b7 We found the group's classification of expenditure as capital or operating to be acceptable (2021: acceptable).",

The financial statements (see page 253) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the group.\n\n## Low risk, high value:\n\nThe carrying amount of the parent company's investment in United Utilities PLC represents 100 per cent (2021: 99 per cent) of the company's total assets. The recoverability is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due to the materiality in the context of the parent company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.\n\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on the group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Our actuarial expertise: used our own actuarial specialists to challenge key assumptions and estimates used in the calculation of the retirement benefit obligations; and perform a comparison of key assumptions against our own benchmark ranges derived from externally-available data and against those used by other companies reporting on the same period;\n- \u00b7 Methodology assessment: used our own actuarial specialists to assess the appropriateness and consistency of the methodology applied by management in setting the key assumptions;\n- \u00b7 Assessing external actuary's credentials: assessed competence and independence of the external actuary engaged by the group; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing transparency: considered the adequacy of the group's disclosure in respect of retirement benefits, in particular the gross defined benefit obligation and the assumptions used, which are set out in notes 18 and A5 to the financial statements.\n\n## Our results:\n\n- \u00b7 We found the resulting estimate of the retirement benefit obligations to be acceptable (2021: acceptable).\n\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the company's controls because testing for recoverability through detailed testing is inherently the most effective means of obtaining audit evidence.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Tests of detail: compared the carrying amount of the investment with the draft balance sheet of United Utilities PLC to identify whether the net assets, being an approximation of the minimum recoverable amount, is in excess of the carrying amount and, if not, comparing it with the expected value of the business based on a suitable premium to the regulatory capital value.\n\n## Our results:\n\n- \u00b7 We found the group's assessment of the recoverability of the investment in United Utilities PLC to be acceptable (2021: acceptable).\n\nIn the previous year the capitalisation of overheads was included in the capitalisation of costs relating to the capital programme key audit matter. We continue to perform procedures over the capitalisation of overheads but we've excluded it from the key audit matter as the size of the balance is less significant than the judgement around the capitalisation of project costs.\n\n## Valuation of retirement benefit obligations\n\n\u00a33,018.9 million (2021: \u00a33,295.7 million)\n\nRefer to page 151 (Audit committee report), pages 219 and 260 (accounting policy) and pages 232 to 233 and 250 to 255 (financial disclosures)\n\n## Recoverability of parent company's investment in United Utilities PLC\n\nInvestment in United Utilities PLC - \u00a36,326.8 million (2021: \u00a36,326.8 million)\n\nRefer to page 257 (accounting policy), and page 229 (financial disclosures).",

Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\n\nMateriality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a316.5 million (2021: \u00a319.0 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of group profit before tax of \u00a3297.0 million, normalised to exclude this year's net fair value gains or losses on debt and derivative instruments as disclosed in note 6, of which it represents 5.6 per cent (2021: 4.1 per cent).\n\nMateriality for the parent company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a38.5 million (2021: \u00a39.0 million), determined with reference to a benchmark of company total assets, of which it represents 0.1 per cent (2021: 0.0 per cent).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality was set at 75 per cent (2021: 75 per cent) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a312.3 million (2021: \u00a314.2 million) for the group and \u00a36.4 (2021: \u00a36.7 million) for the parent company.

        "page_content": "## Independent auditor's report to the members of United Utilities Group PLC only\n\n## 4. The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nWe have considered the potential impacts of climate change on the financial statements as part of planning our audit.\n\nThe group has set out its climate targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5\u00baC by 2030, and to be climate net zero by 2050. The majority of the group's carbon emissions are from the burning of fossil fuels, fuels used for transport and the grid electricity purchased. The group continues to develop its assessment of climate change. Climate change initiatives impact the group in a variety of ways including opportunities and risks relating to renewable energy sources and extreme weather events. Further information is provided on pages 86 to 97. While the group has set out its targets, it is continually developing its assessment of the impact of climate change on capital expenditure, the cost base and impacts on cash flows. The group considered the impact of climate change and the group's targets in the preparation of the financial statements, including an evaluation of critical accounting estimates and judgements. The group concluded that this did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements, as described on page 219.\n\nAs part of our audit, we have made enquiries of directors and operational managers to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risks on the group's financial statements, including their assessment of critical accounting estimates and judgements, and the effect on our audit. We have performed a risk assessment to evaluate the potential impact, including the estimates made regarding useful economic lives of property, plant and equipment, and the valuation of certain unquoted pension assets.\n\nWe held discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment. Taking into account the expected remaining useful lives of property, plant and equipment, and the nature of unquoted pension assets, we assessed that there is not a significant impact on our audit for this financial year. There was no significant impact of climate on our key audit matters.\n\nWe have read the group's disclosure of climate-related information in the front half of the annual report as set out on pages 86 to 97 and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 5. Going concern\n\nThe directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the group or the company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the group's and the company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the group's and company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risk that we considered most likely to adversely affect the group's and company's available financial resources and metrics related to a one-off total expenditure impact.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity or covenant compliance in the going concern period by assessing the directors' sensitivities over the level of available financial resources and covenant thresholds indicated by the group's financial forecasts taking account of severe, but plausible, adverse effects that could arise from these risks individually and collectively.\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessing key assumptions in the forecasts: critically assessing assumptions in base case and downside scenarios relevant to liquidity and covenant metrics such as inflation rate growth compared to market forecasts, forecast bonus payments compared to historical bonus payments and forecast dividend payments compared to group dividend policy. This included assessing whether downside scenarios applied assumptions which are mutually consistent, using our assessment of the possible range of each key assumption and our knowledge of inter-dependencies;\n- \u00b7 Funding assessment: considering the availability of existing debt arrangements and committed loan facilities, including testing compliance with covenants and expected maturity dates;\n- \u00b7 Historical accuracy of managements forecasts: comparing historical budgets to actual results to assess the directors' track record of budgeting accurately;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating directors' intent : evaluating the achievability of the actions the directors consider they would take to improve the position should the risks materialise, including assessment of mitigating actions within their control; and\n- \u00b7 Assessing the completeness and accuracy of the matters covered in the going concern disclosure: considering whether the going concern disclosure in the accounting policies to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities.\n\n## Our conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u00b7 we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7 we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's or company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the accounting policies to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the group and company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in the accounting policies to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7 the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 140 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the group or the company will continue in operation.",

Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 enquiring of directors, the audit committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the group's high level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- \u00b7 reading board/audit committee minutes; and\n- \u00b7 considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for directors including Long Term Plan awards.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit.\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls and the risk of fraudulent revenue recognition, the risk that group management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries, and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements such as revenue recognition and provisions for household customer debt and capitalisation of costs relating to the capital programme. Further detail in respect of the above accounting estimates and judgements is set out in the key audit matter disclosures in section 2 of this report.\n\n## We also performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying journal entries to test based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included journals relating to revenue, capitalised costs and treasury posted to unexpected or unrelated accounts; and\n- \u00b7 assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), from inspection of the group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the entity's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of noncompliance throughout the audit.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, pension legislation and taxation legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: Ofwat, Environment Agency, Drinking Water Inspectorate, health and safety, anti-bribery, employment law, regulatory capital and liquidity and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the group's activities and its legal form. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed noncompliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect noncompliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 7. We have nothing to report on the other information in the annual report\n\nThe directors are responsible for the other information presented in the annual report together with the financial statements. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.",

Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the group's and company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit committee, including the significant issues that the Audit committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nWe are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review. We have nothing to report in this respect.\n\n## 8. We have nothing to report on the other matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nUnder the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nWe have nothing to report in these respects.\n\n## 9. Respective responsibilities\n\n## Directors' responsibilities\n\nAs explained more fully in their statement set out on page 198, the directors are responsible for: the preparation of the financial statements including being satisfied that they give a true and fair view; such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and using the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue our opinion in an auditor's report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. Further detail can be found in note A7.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, and with UK-adopted international accounting standards. They have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments, accounting for the transfer of assets from customers, and the revaluation of infrastructure assets to fair value on transition to IFRS.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods presented. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results, ultimately, may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis as the directors have a reasonable expectation that the group has adequate resources for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements and that there are no material uncertainties to disclose.\n\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting the directors have reviewed the resources available to the group in the form of cash and committed facilities as well as consideration of the group's capital adequacy, along with a baseline plan that incorporates latest views of the current economic climate, including high levels of inflation in the near term. The directors have considered the magnitude of potential impacts resulting from uncertain future events or changes in conditions, and the likely effectiveness of mitigating actions that the directors would consider undertaking. The baseline position has been subjected to a number of severe but reasonable downside scenarios in order to assess the group's ability to operate within the amounts and terms (including relevant covenants) of existing facilities. These scenarios consider: the potential impacts of increased totex costs, including a significant one-off totex impact arising in the assessment period; lower CPIH inflation; elevated levels of bad debt; outcome delivery incentive penalties; and the impact of these factors materialising on a combined basis. Mitigating actions were considered to include deferral of capital expenditure; a reduction in other discretionary totex spend; the close out of derivative asset balances; and the deferral or suspension of dividend payments.\n\nConsequently, the directors are satisfied that the group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements, and that the severe but reasonable downside scenarios indicate that the group will be able to operate within the amounts and terms (including relevant covenants) of existing facilities. The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Adoption of new and revised standards\n\nThere were no new standards, interpretations and amendments, effective for the year ended 31 March 2022, that were relevant to the group or would have a material impact on the group's financial statements, or that were not early adopted in previous years.\n\n## 'Phase II' - IBOR reform\n\nIn January 2021, the Secretary of State for BEIS and the EU endorsed the IASB-published amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' in respect of interest rate benchmark reform, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021 with early adoption\n\npermitted ('Phase II ' IBOR Reform). The group chose to earlyadopt the Phase II reforms for the year ended 31 March 2021, though this has had no impact on the financial statements for the year then ended.\n\nThe group also subscribed to the ISDA 2020 IBOR fallbacks protocol in the previous financial year, with these protocols embedding fallback provisions into the group's interest rate derivative contracts enabling a contractual replacement of LIBOR as a benchmark with SONIA. All of the group's derivative counterparties subscribed to the protocol and from 1 January 2022 the group's derivative portfolio transitioned from referencing LIBOR to referencing SONIA as the underlying floating interest rate.\n\nAs part of the transition, where applicable, the group has applied the relevant practical expedients from certain requirements in IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 relating to changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows of financial assets, financial liabilities and hedge accounting.\n\nOn 31 December 2021, the group had a balance of \u00a3501.6 million loan instruments, along with an additional \u00a3800.0 million of undrawn committed facilities that transitioned away from referencing LIBOR as the floating benchmark rate.\n\nDerivatives with a notional value of \u00a35,166.0 million also transitioned on this date, with this figure being inclusive of \u00a32,117.8 million notional value of derivatives designated within fair value hedge relationships. Immaterial hedge effectiveness was recorded in the group's income statement through the transition as a result of maintaining economic equivalence within the fair value hedge relationships.\n\nDetail on the derivation of this net balance can be found in note A4, along with further information on the group's transition to alternative benchmarks.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying its accounting policies set out in note A7, the group is required to make certain estimates, judgements and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on the information available. These judgements, estimates and assumptions affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognised during the reporting periods presented. Changes to these estimates, judgements and assumptions could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, the group evaluates its estimates using historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. As estimates carry with them an inherent level of uncertainty, the group performs sensitivity analysis where this is practicable and where, in management's opinion, it provides useful and meaningful information. This sensitivity analysis is performed to understand a range of outcomes that could be considered reasonably possible based on experience and the facts and circumstances associated with individual areas of the financial statements that are subject to estimates. Actual results may differ significantly from the estimates, the effect of which is recognised in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\n\nAs part of the evaluation of critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty, the group has considered the implications of climate change on its operations and activities, further details of which are set out below.\n\nThe following paragraphs detail the estimates and judgements the group believes to have the most significant impact on the annual results as reported in accordance with IFRS,",

        "page_content": "## Accounting policies\n\nincluding specific considerations in light of current economic circumstances such as the cost of living experienced by customers.\n\n## Revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful receivables\n\nAccounting estimate - The group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery and when collection of the resulting receivable has been deemed probable. In estimating the amount of revenue to recognise, where the group considers that the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for a transaction, revenue recognition is delayed until such time as collectability is deemed probable. There are two different criteria whereby management does not recognise revenue for amounts which have been billed to those customers on the basis that collectability is not probable. These are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The customer has not paid their bills for a period of at least two years; and\n- \u00b7 The customer has paid their bills in the preceding two years, but has previously had bills de-recognised and has more than their current year debt outstanding.\n\nThis two-criteria approach resulted in a \u00a326.6 million reduction in revenue compared with what would have been recognised had no adjustment been made for amounts where collectability is not probable. Had management made an alternative judgement that where customers have paid in the preceding two years, and have more than their current year debt outstanding, the recoverability of the entirety of their debt was deemed to be probable (i.e. the second criteria were disapplied), the required adjustment to revenue would have been \u00a312.4 million lower.\n\nAccounting estimate - At each reporting date, the company and each of its subsidiaries evaluate the estimated recoverability of trade receivables and record allowances for expected credit losses based on experience. Estimates associated with these allowances are based on, among other things, a consideration of actual collection history. The actual level of receivables collected may differ from the estimated levels of recovery, which could impact operating results positively or negatively. At 31 March 2022, an allowance for expected credit losses relating to household customer debt of \u00a378.3 million was supported by a six-year cash collection projection. Based on a five-year or seven-year cash collection projection the allowance for doubtful receivables would have increased by \u00a31.1 million or reduced by \u00a30.5 million respectively.\n\nSince early 2020, the group's expected credit loss assessment in respect of trade receivables has been significantly impacted by the economic uncertainty brought about as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst economic uncertainty linked to the COVID-19 pandemic has receded somewhat during the year ended 31 March 2022, with households and businesses adjusting to a new post-pandemic norm, a high level of economic uncertainty remains due largely to increases in the cost of living during the year and that are forecast to continue in the near future. This could have a significant impact on many of the group's customers that could in turn affect the ability of some customers to pay their bills.\n\nIn recognition of this ongoing future uncertainty, the basis on which the allowance for expected credit losses covering the group's household customer base is assessed has been updated during the year. Whereas in the prior year the allowance for expected credit losses was determined based on the assumption that cash collection experienced over the last two years continues into the future, this would no longer be expected to give a reasonable view of cash collection risk. This is because cash collection for the year has performed strongly and therefore may overstate future cash collection forecasts when considering\n\nthe current economic climate, while cash collection for the year ended 31 March 2021 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in much lower levels of cash collection than might be expected on an ongoing basis.\n\nIn light of this, a longer run four-year average of cash collection has been modelled and is deemed to give a more realistic forecast for future collection taking into account all of the above factors, including expected increases in the cost of living. This assumption supports the reported household bad debt charge of 1.8 per cent of household revenue. Had future cash collection been assessed based on the average cash collection during the current year only, the bad debt charge would have been 1.6 per cent of household revenue resulting in a reduction in the charge of \u00a32.7 million, with similar results based on using average cash collection from the last two or last three years. If average cash collection from the prior year only was used the bad debt charge would have been 2.0 per cent of household revenue resulting in an increase in the charge of \u00a33.4 million. Consideration of this range of reasonably possible scenarios indicates that, based on current levels of economic uncertainty, the allowance for expected credit losses is within a reasonable range, and that a longer run four year average results in a balanced position in light of current levels of uncertainty.\n\nAccounting estimate - United Utilities Water Limited raises bills in accordance with its entitlement to receive revenue in line with the limits established by the periodic regulatory price review processes. For household water and wastewater customers with water meters, the receivable billed is dependent on the volume supplied, including the sales value of an estimate of the units supplied between the dates of the last water meter reading and the billing date. Meters are read on a cyclical basis and the group recognises revenue for unbilled amounts based on estimated usage from the last billing through to each reporting date. The estimated usage is based on historical data, judgement and assumptions; actual results could differ from these estimates, which would result in operating revenues being adjusted in the period that the revision to the estimates is determined.\n\nRevenue recognised for unbilled amounts for these customers at 31 March 2022 was \u00a3145.8 million. Had actual consumption been 5 per cent higher or lower than the estimate of units supplied, this would have resulted in revenue recognised for unbilled amounts being \u00a35.0 million higher or lower respectively. For customers who do not have a meter, the receivable billed and revenue recognised is dependent on the rateable value of the property as assessed by an independent rating officer.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nAccounting judgement - The group recognises property, plant and equipment (PP&E) on its water and wastewater infrastructure assets where such expenditure enhances or increases the capacity of the network, whereas any expenditure classed as maintenance is expensed in the period as incurred. Determining enhancement from maintenance expenditure requires an accounting judgement, particularly when projects have both elements within them. Enhancement spend was 57 per cent of total spend in relation to infrastructure assets during the year. A change of +/- 1 per cent would have resulted in \u00a33.9 million less/more expenditure being charged to the income statement during the period. In addition, management capitalises time and resources incurred by the group's support functions on capital programmes, which requires accounting judgements to be made in relation to the appropriate capitalisation rates. Support costs allocated to PP&E represent 40 per cent of total support costs. A change in allocation of +/- 5 per cent would have resulted in \u00a32.3 million less/more expenditure being charged to the income statement during the period.",

When management identifies that actual useful economic lives differ materially from the estimates used to calculate depreciation, that charge is adjusted prospectively. Due to the significance of PP&E and intangibles investment to the group, variations between actual and estimated useful economic lives could impact operating results both positively and negatively. As such, this is a key source of estimation uncertainty. The depreciation and amortisation expense for the year was \u00a3418.2 million. A 10 per cent increase in average asset lives would have resulted in a \u00a338.2 million reduction in this figure and a 10 per cent decrease in average asset lives would have resulted in a \u00a341.6 million increase in this figure.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nAccounting estimate - The group operates two defined benefit pension schemes which are independent of the group's finances. Actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years. Profit before tax and net assets are affected by the actuarial assumptions used. The key assumptions include: discount rates, pay growth, mortality, and increases to pensions in payment and deferred pensions. It should be noted that actual rates may differ from the assumptions used due to changing market and economic conditions and longer or shorter lives of participants and, as such, this represents a key source of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities in respect of the assumptions used during the year are disclosed in note A5.\n\nAccounting estimate - Included within the group's defined benefit pension scheme assets are assets with a fair value estimated to be \u00a3271.7 million that are categorised as 'level 3' assets within the IFRS 13 'Fair value measurement' hierarchy, meaning that the value of the assets is not observable at 31 March 2022. Estimates of the fair value of these assets have been performed by the investment managers' valuation specialists using the latest available statements of each of the funds that make up the total level 3 asset balance, updated for any subsequent cash movements between the statement date and the year end reporting date.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nAccounting estimate - The model used to fair value the group's derivative financial instruments requires management to estimate future cash flows based on applicable interest rate curves. Projected cash flows are then discounted back using discount factors that are derived from the applicable interest rate curves adjusted for management's estimate of counterparty and own credit risk, where appropriate. Sensitivities relating to derivative financial instruments are included in note A4.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe group is continually developing its assessment of the impact that climate change has on the assets and liabilities recognised and presented in its financial statements.\n\nThe natural environment within which the group operates is constantly changing, and this influences how its water and wastewater services are to be delivered in the future. In addition, the group has embedded ambitious climate-related targets within its own operations, with this affecting the portfolio of assets required to deliver such services.\n\nThe impact of climate change has been considered in the preparation of these financial statements across a number of areas, predominantly in respect of the valuation of the property, plant and equipment held by the group.\n\nAsset life reviews are undertaken regularly for facilities impacted by climate change, environmental legislation or the group's decarbonisation measures. This can result in the acceleration\n\nof depreciation of assets that are deemed to be commercially obsolete or for which no further use is planned, in part as a result of the group's decarbonisation strategy. In recent years this has resulted in material accelerations in respect of bioresources facilities impacted by changes in environmental legislative requirements. No further material accelerations were required in the current financial year, however this is subject to continuous assessment.\n\nThe group is exposed to potential asset write-downs following flooding resulting from extreme weather events, the frequency of which are expected to increase as the effects of climate change become more apparent. Following large-scale flooding, items are identified that have been damaged beyond repair and require immediate accounting write-downs. No such charges were required in the current financial year.\n\nIn addition to the risks posed by an increased likelihood of large-scale flooding events in future years, climate change also presents challenges relating to prolonged periods of hot and dry weather, the frequency of which is expected to increase. This could potentially impact the viability of certain types of assets in future years such as those associated with the intake of water from the natural environment, or require a strategic reconfiguration of assets to respond to such challenges. It is expected that if any such impact were to materialise this would be over a longer period of time rather than within a single financial year, and no financial impact has been identified in the current year.\n\nIn recent years the group has sought to further enhance the accuracy of its useful life assessments through the introduction of more forward-looking information in asset life reviews. This includes the use of disposal data to identify trends that may inform the group's view of useful lives into the future. This information is used alongside other decommissioning data and data from strategic asset planning systems to inform useful asset lives.\n\nThe group mitigates the exposure that the carrying value of its book asset base has to climate-related risks through strategic planning activities that incorporate defined climate scenarios, climate change mitigation pledges, and long-term climate projections. The group installs permanent flood defences and other resilience measures at the most vulnerable facilities to protect its assets.",

The group's performance is measured against financial and operational key performance indicators which align with its three strategic themes to deliver the best service to customers, at the lowest sustainable cost, in a responsible manner. The board reviews revenue, operating profit and gearing, along with operational drivers at a consolidated level (see pages 50 to 83). In light of this, the group has a single segment for financial reporting purposes.\n\n## 2 Revenue\n\nThe group's revenue arises from the provision of services within the United Kingdom.\n\n|                              | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wholesale water charges      | 776.5     | 751.0     |\n| Wholesale wastewater charges | 946.3     | 941.5     |\n| Household retail charges     | 68.9      | 64.1      |\n| Other                        | 71.0      | 51.4      |\n|                              | 1,862.7   | 1,808.0   |\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 15, revenue has been disaggregated based on what is recognised in relation to the core services of supplying clean water and the removal and treatment of wastewater. Each of these services is deemed to give rise to a distinct performance obligation under the contract with customers, although following the same pattern of transfer to the customer who simultaneously receives and consumes both of these services over time.\n\nWholesale water and wastewater charges relate to services provided to household customers and non-household retailers. Household retail charges relate solely to the margin applied to the wholesale amounts charged to residential customers. These wholesale charges and the applicable retail margin are combined in arriving at the total revenues relating to water and wastewater services provided to household customers. No margin is applied to wholesale water and wastewater services provided to non-household retailers.\n\nOther revenues comprise a number of smaller non-core income streams, including those relating to energy generation and export, property sales, and those associated with activities, typically performed opposite property developers, which impact the group's capital network assets, including diversions works to relocate water and wastewater assets, and activities that facilitate the creation of an authorised connection through which properties can obtain water and wastewater services.\n\n## 3 Directors and employees\n\nDirectors' remuneration\n\n|                                 |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Fees to non-executive directors |       0.8 |       0.8 |\n| Salaries                        |       1.2 |       1.2 |\n| Benefits                        |       0.3 |       0.2 |\n| Bonus                           |       0.7 |       0.7 |\n| Share-based payment charge      |       1.8 |       1.7 |\n|                                 |       4.8 |       4.6 |\n\nFurther information about the remuneration of individual directors and details of their pension arrangements are provided in the Directors' remuneration report on pages 166 to 182.\n\nRemuneration of key management personnel\n\n|                                           |   \u00a3m |   \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Salaries and short-term employee benefits |  6.2 |  6.3 |\n| Share-based payment charge                |  2.6 |  3   |\n|                                           |  8.8 |  9.3 |\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nKey management personnel comprises all directors and certain senior managers who are members of the executive team.",

This was most notable in relation to power costs, which increased by \u00a316.0 million compared with the prior year, largely due to price increases. Through its progressive hedging policy the group was able to lock in the commodity price on the majority of its consumption for the year ended 31 March 2022 before the most recent energy price rises, and therefore secured an average rate over the year of \u00a378 per MWh. This compares favourably with the market rate of over \u00a3200 per MWh as at the year end reporting date and has been fundamental to the group's ability to minimise the impact of price rises on its cost base.\n\nIncremental costs totalling \u00a35.8 million have been incurred during the year in relation to the implementation of Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangements, which are increasingly expected to be recognised within operating costs in accordance with clarifications on the appropriate accounting treatment issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) during the year. The majority of SaaS implementation costs in previous years have been accounted for as intangible asset additions. These prior year amounts have not been restated to reflect the group's updated approach as they are not material.\n\nResearch and development expenditure for the year ended 31 March 2022 was \u00a31.2 million (2021: \u00a31.0 million). In addition, \u00a35.9 million (2021: \u00a36.2 million) of costs have been accrued by United Utilities Water Limited in relation to the Innovation in Water Challenge scheme operated by Ofwat for AMP7. These expenses directly offset amounts recognised in revenue during each year intended to fund innovation projects across England and Wales as part of an industry-wide scheme to promote innovation in the sector. The amounts accrued will either be spent on innovation projects that the group successfully bids for or will be transferred to other successful water companies in accordance with the scheme rules.\n\nDuring the year, the group obtained the following services from its auditor:\n\n|                                                             | \u00a3'000   | \u00a3'000   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Audit services                                              |         |         |\n| Statutory audit - group and company                         | 169     | 170     |\n| Statutory audit - subsidiaries                              | 506     | 508     |\n|                                                             | 675     | 678     |\n| Non-audit services                                          |         |         |\n| Regulatory audit services provided by the statutory auditor | 64      | 71      |\n| Other non-audit services                                    | 116     | 120     |\n| Total audit and non-audit services                          | 855     | 869     |\n\n2022\n\n2021",

The year-on-year amount will depend on the amount capitalised.\n\nOther timing differences includes a range of small value items where there is a timing difference between the accounting and tax recognition.\n\nThe decrease in joint venture losses is due to a reduction in our share of the losses in relation to Water Plus.\n\nThe increase in income not taxable is mainly due to the additional 30 per cent element of the temporary capital allowances superdeductions introduced in 2021.\n\nDepreciation charged on non-qualifying assets relates to accounting depreciation where there is no corresponding tax deduction.\n\nWhere permitted under HMRC rules, any available UK tax losses will be carried forward and utilised in future periods, when the tax rate is at 25 per cent.\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n| Tax on items recorded within other comprehensive income                                                                                | \u00a3m    | \u00a3m     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Current tax                                                                                                                            |       |        |\n| Relating to other pension movements                                                                                                    | -     | (3.3)  |\n| Deferred tax  (see note 19)                                                                                                            |       |        |\n| On remeasurement gains/(losses) on defined benefit pension schemes                                                                     | 111.1 | (26.0) |\n| Relating to other pension movements                                                                                                    | -     | 3.3    |\n| On net fair value gains/(losses) on credit assumptions for debt reported at fair value through     profit and loss and cost of hedging |       |        |\n|                                                                                                                                        | 26.1  | (8.8)  |\n| Share-based payments                                                                                                                   | (1.0) | -      |\n| Total tax charge on items recorded within other comprehensive income                                                                   | 136.2 | (34.8) |\n\nThe prior year current tax amount of \u00a33.3 million relating to other pension movements is the contributions in excess of the amounts in the profit and loss account which has to be allocated against the actuarial loss. No adjustment is required in the current year due to the actuarial gain.\n\nThe tax adjustments taken to other comprehensive income primarily relate to remeasurement movements on the group's defined benefit pension schemes. Management considers that the most likely method of realisation would be through a refund, which would be taxed at the rate applicable to refunds from a trust (currently 35 per cent).\n\n## 8 Earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                               | \u00a3m         | \u00a3m         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| (Loss)/profit after tax attributable to equity holders of the company - continuing operations | (56.8)     | 453.4      |\n|                                                                                               | 2022 pence | 2021 pence |\n| Basic                                                                                         | (8.3)      | 66.5       |\n| Diluted                                                                                       | (8.3)      | 66.3       |\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing profit after tax for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the company by 681.9 million being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year (2021: 681.9 million).

Due to the nature of the group's operations, many of the group's leases have extremely long terms, ranging from one year to 999 years. The group does not typically lease assets on a short-term basis or enter into leases for low value asset and therefore no material costs were incurred during the year, either individually or in aggregate, in relation to lease contracts with a duration of less than 12 months or for low value assets.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the group had entered into contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment amounting to \u00a3280.8 million (2021: \u00a3355.8 million). In addition to these commitments, the group has long-term expenditure plans which include investments to achieve improvements in performance required by regulators and to provide for future growth.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company had no property, plant and equipment or contractual commitments for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment at 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021.",

As reported in the group's annual report for the year ended 31 March 2021, at that date a fully drawn \u00a332.5 million revolving credit facility extended to Water Plus by United Utilities PLC, which was presented within amounts owed by related parties included within trade and other receivables, was considered to form part of the group's long-term interest in the Water Plus joint venture as there was a clear expectation that it would be converted to additional equity share capital. As such, the group's \u00a314.2 million share of losses recognised in the income statement for the year then ended (comprising the group's share of Water Plus losses for the year of \u00a38.9 million and \u00a35.3 million of the group's previously unrecognised share of losses relating to prior years) was allocated against this fully drawn facility, resulting in a net reported balance of \u00a318.3 million at 31 March 2021, which was included in amounts owed by related parties.\n\nThe conversion of this facility to equity share capital was executed on 23 April 2021 and therefore the brought forward balance of \u00a318.3 million has been included as an addition to the group's joint ventures balance during the period.\n\nDetails of transactions between the group and its joint ventures and other investments are disclosed in note A6.\n\n## Company\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the company's investments related solely to its investments in United Utilities PLC, which was recorded at a cost of \u00a36,326.8 million (2021: \u00a36,326.8 million).\n\n## 13 Inventories\n\n| Group                      |   \u00a3m |   \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------|------|------|\n| Properties held for resale |  1.6 |  2.5 |\n| Other inventories          | 16.6 | 15.8 |\n|                            | 18.2 | 18.3 |\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\nIncluded within other inventories are \u00a30.4 million (2021: nil) of assets that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business, but where sales are not expected to occur within 12 months of the reporting date.

They therefore typically reverse in subsequent months, with all amounts held in relation to these contract assets at the beginning of the reporting period having subsequently reversed into the income statement during the year. At 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, the group had no accrued income that was past due. In instances where the collection of consideration is not considered probable at the point services are delivered, no accrued income balance is recognised, as the criteria to recognise revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 has not been met.\n\n## Company\n\nAt 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, the company had no trade receivables that were past due. Of the \u00a395.2 million (2021: \u00a391.9 million) owed by subsidiaries, \u00a375.0 million (2021: nil) was classified as non-current at the reporting date. This follows an exercise performed during the year to reassess the nature of the intercompany receivable balances. As a result, the group executed an agreement to split the existing intercompany receivable balance owed by United Utilities PLC, which had been classified as a current asset in prior years, into an intercompany term loan of \u00a375.0 million that is repayable at 31 March 2027 with the remaining amount continuing to form part of the intercompany cash pooling arrangements presented within current assets.\n\nThe carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021.\n\n## 15 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n|                                                          |         |         | 2021    | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n|                                                          | 2022 \u00a3m | 2021 \u00a3m | 2022 \u00a3m | \u00a3m     |\n| Cash at bank and in hand                                 | 9.9     | 88.9    | -       | -      |\n| Short-term bank deposits                                 | 231.0   | 655.2   | -       | -      |\n| Cash and short-term deposits                             | 240.9   | 744.1   | -       | -      |\n| Book overdrafts (included in borrowings, see note 16)    | (20.8)  | (10.5)  | -       | -      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows | 220.1   | 733.6   | -       | -      |\n\nGroup\n\nCompany\n\nCash and short-term deposits include cash at bank and in hand, deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and have a maturity of three months or less.

Capital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law and spread the tax relief due over a pre-determined standard number of years. This contrasts with the accounting treatment, where the expenditure is treated as an asset with the cost being depreciated over the useful life of the asset, or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially. Due to the group's continued significant annual capital expenditure, the deductions for capital allowances are expected to exceed depreciation for the medium term and continue to impact future corporation tax payments.\n\nGiven the fully funded nature of the group's defined benefit pension schemes, the retirement benefit obligations primarily relate to deferred taxation on the pensions schemes surplus position. This amount is significantly impacted by financial market conditions and long-term inflation expectations and therefore it is difficult to forecast future movements. However, these movements have no impact on medium-term future corporation tax payments as they only impact year-on-year deferred tax movement.\n\nDeferred tax on retirement benefit obligations can also arise where there are year-on-year differences between the contributions paid and the associated amounts charged to the profit and loss account. However, given the fully funded nature of our pension schemes, any such deferred tax movements, together with the associated impact on future corporation tax payments, are not expected to be significant for the medium term.\n\nThe other net short-term temporary differences of \u00a31.7 million includes \u00a335 million relating to tax losses which have been carried forward, where permitted under HMRC rules, to be utilised in future periods when the tax rate is at 25 per cent. Also included are other short-term timing differences in relation to the year-on-year movement in financial transactions which are sensitive to fair value movement on treasury derivatives and can therefore fluctuate significantly from year to year. However, these fair value movements have no impact on future corporation tax payments as they only impact the year-on-year deferred tax movement.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company had no deferred tax assets or liabilities at 31 March 2022 or 2021.",

The merger reserve arose in the same year on consolidation and represents the capital adjustment to reserves required to effect the reverse acquisition.\n\nThe group recognises the cost of hedging reserve as a component of equity. This reserve reflects accumulated fair value movements on cross-currency swaps resulting from changes in the foreign currency basis spread, which represents a liquidity charge inherent in foreign exchange contracts for exchanging currencies and is excluded from the designation of cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments.\n\nThe group designates a number of swaps hedging non-financial risks in cash flow hedge relationships to give a more representative view of operating costs. Fair value movements relating to the effective part of these swaps are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company's other reserves at 31 March 2022, 31 March 2021 and 1 April 2020, were comprised entirely of a \u00a31,033.3 million capital redemption reserve that arose as a result of a return of capital to shareholders following the acquisition of United Utilities PLC by the company in the year ended 31 March 2009.\n\n## 23  Share capital\n\n| Group and company                   | million   | \u00a3m    | million   | \u00a3m    |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-------|-----------|-------|\n| Issued, called up and fully paid    |           |       |           |       |\n| Ordinary shares of 5.0 pence each   | 681.9     | 34.1  | 681.9     | 34.1  |\n| Deferred shares of 170.0 pence each | 274.0     | 465.7 | 274.0     | 465.7 |\n|                                     | 955.9     | 499.8 | 955.9     | 499.8 |\n\n2022\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2021\n\nDetails of the voting rights of each category of shares can be found within the directors' report on pages 194 to 195.\n\nThe 170.0 pence deferred shares were created to facilitate a return of capital to shareholders following the reverse acquisition of United Utilities PLC by United Utilities Group PLC in the year ended 31 March 2009 (see company statement of changes in equity on page 214), and represent the amount of a special dividend paid on B shares at that time.

In April 2020, a group of over 100 PSCs, comprising companies within the groups that had previously issued notice of intended claims, served proceedings on all of the water and sewerage undertakers in England and Wales, including United Utilities Water Limited, for an unspecified amount of compensation. This is an industry-wide issue, and while the litigation has progressed during the year it remains in its early stages. The litigation's likely direction and the quantum of any compensation being claimed is uncertain at this stage; however, based on the information currently available, the likelihood of the claim's success is considered to be low, and any potential outflow is not expected to be material.\n\nThe group has credit support guarantees as well as general performance commitments and potential liabilities under contract that may give rise to financial outflow. The group has determined that the possibility of any outflow arising in respect of these potential liabilities is remote and, as such, there are no contingent liabilities to be disclosed in this regard (2021: none).\n\nThe company has not entered into performance guarantees as at 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021.\n\n## 25  Events after the reporting period\n\nIn March 2022, the process to market the group's renewable energy business, United Utilities Renewable Energy Limited (UURE), for sale commenced having been approved by the group's board of directors earlier in the year. As at the 31 March 2022 reporting date, the criteria for presenting the assets and liabilities of the UURE disposal group as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' had not yet been met as the active programme to locate a buyer and complete the planned sale was only subsequently initiated in May 2022. The assets that are subject to the sales process primarily comprise property, plant and equipment with a carrying value of \u00a364.6 million in the group's consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2022.\n\nIn addition to this, in April 2022 the group issued a \u00a3100 million term loan facility to Export Development Canada due April 2030, and entered into a further two undrawn committed borrowing facilities with a total amount available of \u00a350 million.",

As well as managing our exposure to these risks, these policies help the group maintain compliance with relevant financial covenants, which are in place primarily in relation to borrowings from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and include interest cover and gearing metrics. These policies are reviewed by the treasury committee for approval on at least an annual basis, or following any major changes in treasury operations and/or financial market conditions.\n\nDay-to-day responsibility for operational compliance with the treasury policies rests with the treasurer. An operational compliance report is provided monthly to the treasury committee, which details the status of the group's compliance with the treasury policies and highlights the level of risk against the appropriate risk limits in place.\n\nThe group's treasury function does not act as a profit centre and does not undertake any speculative trading activity.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe group looks to manage its liquidity risk by maintaining liquidity within a board-approved duration range. Liquidity is actively monitored by the group's treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the group had \u00a31,040.9 million (2021: \u00a31,444.1 million) of available liquidity, which comprised \u00a3240.9 million (2021: \u00a3744.1 million) of cash and short-term deposits and \u00a3800.0 million (2021: \u00a3700.0 million) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.\n\nThe group had available committed borrowing facilities as follows:\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n| Group                                              | \u00a3m    | \u00a3m      |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------|---------|\n| Expiring within one year                           | 100.0 | 100.0   |\n| Expiring after one year but in less than two years | 150.0 | 100.0   |\n| Expiring after more than two years                 | 550.0 | 600.0   |\n| Total borrowing facilities                         | 800.0 | 800.0   |\n| Facilities drawn                                   | -     | (100.0) |\n| Total borrowing facilities                         | 800.0 | 700.0   |\n\nThese facilities are arranged on a bilateral rather than a syndicated basis, which spreads the maturities more evenly over a longer time period, thereby reducing the refinancing risk by providing several renewal points rather than a large single refinancing point.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company did not have any committed facilities available at 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nConcentrations of risk may arise if large cash flows are concentrated within particular time periods. The maturity profile in the following table represents the forecast future contractual principal and interest cash flows in relation to the group's financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis. Derivative cash flows have been shown net where there is a contractual agreement to settle on a net basis; otherwise the cash flows are shown gross. This table does not include the impact of lease liabilities for which the maturity profile has been disclosed in note 17.\n\n| Group At 31 March 2022           | Total (1) \u00a3m   | Adjust- ment (2)  \u00a3m   | 1 year or  less \u00a3m   | 1-2 years  \u00a3m   | 2-3 years  \u00a3m   | 3-4 years  \u00a3m   | 4-5 years  \u00a3m   | More than  5 years  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|\n| Bonds                            | 11,289.3       |                        | 1 3 7. 6             | 138.6           | 589.7           | 267.2           | 130.0           | 10,026.2                 |\n| Bank and other term borrowings   | 2,041.2        |                        | 332.3                | 133.4           | 268.9           | 269.5           | 131.4           | 905.7                    |\n| Adjustment to carrying value (2) | (5,411.6)      | (5,411.6)              |                      |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          |\n| Borrowings                       | 7,918.9        | (5,411.6)              | 469.9                | 272.0           | 858.6           | 536.7           | 261.4           | 10,931.9                 |\n| Derivatives:                     |                |                        |                      |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          |\n| Payable                          | 1,209.5        |                        | 42.5                 | 59.5            | 58.9            | 146.3           | 41.1            | 861.2                    |\n| Receivable                       | (1,756.0)      |                        | (123.0)              | (141.7)         | (122.2)         | (193.5)         | (86.5)          | (1,089.1)                |\n| Adjustment to carrying value (2) | 226.3          | 226.3                  |                      |                 |                 |                 |                 |                          |\n| Derivatives - net assets (3)     | (320.2)        | 226.3                  | (80.5)               | (82.2)          | (63.3)          | ( 4 7. 2 )      | (45.4)          | (227.9)                  |",

While the opening of the non-household retail market to competition from 1 April 2017 has impacted on the profile of the group's concentration of credit risk, as discussed further below, the group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations that could have an impact on its ability to continue as a going concern or its longer-term viability.\n\nThe group manages its risk from trading through the effective management of customer relationships. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables from household customers are limited due to the customer base being comprised of a large number of unrelated households. However, collection can be challenging as the Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Industry Act 1999) prohibits the disconnection of a water supply and the limiting of supply with the intention of enforcing payment for certain premises, including domestic dwellings.\n\nFollowing the non-household retail market opening to competition, credit risk in this area is now concentrated in a small number of retailers to whom the group provides wholesale water and wastewater services. Retailers are licensed and monitored by Ofwat and as part of the regulations they must demonstrate that they have adequate resources available to supply services. The credit terms for the group's retail customers are set out in market codes.\n\nIn reaction to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes were made to the payment terms set out within the market codes. These changes provided the option for extended credit terms for retailers. However, this has now ended and all outstanding payments have been made. As at 31 March 2022, Water Plus was the group's single largest debtor, with amounts outstanding in relation to wholesale services of \u00a328.6 million (2021: \u00a327.2 million). During the year, sales to Water Plus in relation to wholesale services were \u00a3363.1 million (2021: \u00a3362.9 million). Details of transactions with Water Plus can be found in note A6.\n\nUnder the group's revenue recognition policy, revenue is only recognised when collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Considering the above, the directors believe there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables (see note 14).\n\nThe group manages its credit risk from treasury activities by establishing a total credit limit by counterparty, which comprises a counterparty credit limit and an additional settlement limit to cover intra-day gross settlement of cash flows. In addition, potential derivative exposure limits are established to take account of potential future exposure which may arise under derivative transactions. These limits are calculated by reference to a measure of capital and credit ratings of the individual counterparties and are subject to a maximum single counterparty limit.\n\nCredit limits are refreshed annually and reviewed in the event of any credit rating action. Additionally, a control mechanism to trigger a review of specific counterparty limits, irrespective of credit rating action, is in place. This entails daily monitoring of counterparty credit default swap levels and/or share price volatility. Credit exposure is monitored daily by the group's treasury function and is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.",

At 31 March 2022, the group held \u00a349.2 million (2021: \u00a350.7 million) as collateral in relation to derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe group's exposure to market risk primarily results from its financing arrangements and the economic return which it is allowed on the regulatory capital value (RCV).\n\nThe group uses a variety of financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage the exposure to these risks.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nThe group earns an economic return on its RCV, comprising a real return through revenues and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV.\n\nFor the 2020-2025 regulatory period, from 1 April 2020 the group's RCV is 50 per cent linked to RPI inflation and 50 per cent linked to CPIH inflation, with any new additions being added to the CPIH portion of the RCV.\n\nThe group's inflation hedging policy aims to have around half of the group's net debt in index-linked form (where it is economic to do so), by issuing index-linked debt and/or swapping a portion of nominal debt. This is currently weighted towards RPI-linked form, with circa 75 per cent of the hedge linked to RPI and circa 25 per cent linked to CPI and/or CPIH. These weightings are consistent with the prior financial year.\n\nThe group believes this is an appropriate inflation hedging policy, taking into account a balanced assessment of the following factors: economic hedge of United Utilities Water Limited's (UUW) RCV and revenues; cash flow timing mismatch between allowed cost of debt and the group's incurred cost of debt; the inflation risk premium that is generally incorporated into nominal debt costs; income statement volatility; hedging costs; debt maturity profile mismatch risk; and index-linked hedging positioning relative to the water sector.\n\nAs a result of the evaluation of the above factors, the group continues to identify opportunities to maintain around 50 per cent of the group's net debt being hedged for inflation, which can be evidenced by the increase in the CPI/CPIH-linked hedge proportion over the past few years. Inflation risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee in the operational compliance report.\n\nThe carrying value of index-linked debt held by the group, including the carrying value of the nominal debt swapped to CPI, was \u00a34,220.4 million at 31 March 2022 (2021: \u00a34,093.3 million).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe following table details the sensitivity of profit before tax to changes in the RPI and CPI on the group's index-linked borrowings. The sensitivity analysis has been based on the amount of index-linked debt held at the reporting date and, as such, is not indicative of the years then ended. In addition, it excludes the impact of inflation on revenues and other income statement costs as well as the hedging aspect of the group's regulatory assets and post-retirement obligations.\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n| Increase/(decrease) in profit before tax and equity   | \u00a3m     | \u00a3m     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 1% increase in RPI/CPI                                | (37.0) | (35.4) |\n| 1% decrease in RPI/CPI                                | 3 7. 0 | 35.4   |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes a 1 per cent change in RPI and CPI having a corresponding 1 per cent impact on this position over a 12-month period. It should be noted, however, that there is a time lag by which current RPI and CPI changes impact on the income statement, and the analysis does not incorporate this factor. The portfolio of index-linked debt is calculated on either a three- or eightmonth lag basis. Therefore, at the reporting date the index-linked interest and principal adjustments impacting the income statement are fixed and based on the annual RPI or CPI change either three or eight months earlier.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company had no material exposure to inflation risk at 31 March 2022 or 31 March 2021.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe group's policy is to structure debt in a way that best matches its underlying assets and cash flows. The group currently earns an economic return on its RCV, comprising a real return through revenues, determined by the real cost of capital fixed by the regulator for each five-year regulatory pricing period, and an inflation return as an uplift to its RCV (see inflation risk section for changes being introduced by Ofwat to inflation indexation from 2020).",

        "page_content": "## A4  Financial risk management continued\n\nFrom 1 April 2020 for the regulatory period to 2025, Ofwat has continued to set a fixed real cost of debt in relation to embedded debt (80 per cent of net debt), but has introduced a debt indexation mechanism in relation to new debt (20 per cent of net debt), where the allowed rate on new debt will vary in line with specific debt indices. The debt indexation mechanism will be settled as an end of regulatory period adjustment.\n\nTherefore, sterling index-linked debt is left unswapped at inception, in accordance with our inflation hedging policy goal to maintain around half of the group's net debt in index-linked form. Conventional nominal debt is hedged as set out below.\n\nWhere conventional long-term debt is raised in a fixed-rate form, to manage exposure to long-term interest rates, the debt is generally swapped at inception to create a floating rate liability for the term of the liability through the use of interest rate swaps. These instruments are typically designated within a fair value accounting hedge.\n\nTo manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates, the group fixes underlying interest rates on nominal debt out to 10 years in advance on a reducing balance basis. As such, at the start of each regulatory period, a proportion of the projected nominal net debt representing new debt for that regulatory period, will remain floating until it is fixed via the above 10-year reducing balance basis, which should approximate Ofwat's new debt indexation mechanism.\n\nThis interest rate hedging policy dovetails with our inflation hedging policy should we need to swap a portion of nominal debt to real rate form to maintain our desired mix of nominal and index-linked debt.\n\nThe group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining its interest rate exposure within a board-approved range. Interest rate risk is reported to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe following table details the sensitivity of the group's profit before tax and equity to changes in interest rates. The sensitivity analysis has been based on the amount of net debt and the interest rate hedge positions in place at the reporting date and, as such, is not indicative of the years then ended.\n\nGroup\n\nCompany\n\n| Increase/(decrease) in profit before tax and equity   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|\n| 1% increase in interest rate                          | 89.5      | 130.7     | (18.0)    | ( 1 7. 8 ) |\n| 1% decrease in interest rate                          | (94.3)    | (134.7)   | 18.0      | 1 7. 8     |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis assumes that both fair value hedges and borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss are effectively hedged and it excludes the impact on post-retirement obligations. The exposure largely relates to fair value movements on the group's fixed interest rate swaps which manage the exposure to medium-term interest rates.

To manage exposure to currency rates, foreign currency debt is hedged into sterling through the use of cross-currency swaps and these are often designated within a fair value accounting hedge. The group seeks to manage its risk by maintaining currency exposure within board-approved limits. Currency risk in relation to foreign currency denominated financial instruments is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report. The group and company have no material net exposure to movements in currency rates.",

In the run up to 31 December 2021, the group fully transitioned all of its financial instruments away from GBP LIBOR.\n\nFloating rate loans payable were re-documented to replace references to GBP LIBOR with appropriate sterling risk free rates or, where the maturity date was sufficiently short, repaid early to avoid re-documentation. Derivatives were transitioned away from GBP LIBOR by the group and all of its counterparties adhering to the ISDA 2020 IBOR fall-backs protocol, which has automatically replaced references in derivatives to GBP LIBOR with risk free rates, and systems were upgraded to enable accurate recording and valuation of transitioned financial instruments. Inter-company loans and loans receivable with the group's principal joint venture have also been restructured to reference the Bank of England Base Rate.\n\nThe group is not exposed to any other benchmark reference rate and so its activities in relation to interest rate benchmark reform are now complete.\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase II, Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (the Phase II Amendments), and the group has applied all relevant amendments when accounting for the impact of the IBOR transition in the year.\n\nApplying the ISDA fall-back provisions in transitioning the group's derivative portfolio has maintained economic equivalence across the financial instruments held in fair value hedges and, as a result, immaterial hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the group's income statement in the year.\n\nThe amount of financial instruments that transitioned to alternative benchmarks is set out below. Non-derivative financial instruments are presented at their carrying value, with the derivatives at their nominal value, in order to give the fairest representation of the magnitude of instruments that transitioned to RFRs. In addition to the below, the group held \u00a3800 million of undrawn committed facilities as at 31 December 2021 that transitioned away from referencing LIBOR to reference sterling risk free rates.\n\nAmounts\n\n| Type of financial instrument                         | transitioned to RFR \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities (pay GBP LIBOR) | 501.6                    |\n| Derivative instruments (pay GBP LIBOR)               | 2,343.9                  |\n| Derivative instruments (receive GBP LIBOR)           | (2,822.1)                |\n| Net position                                         | 23.4                     |",

The repricing analysis demonstrates the group's exposure to floating interest rate risk.\n\nOur largest concentration of floating interest rate risk is with index-linked instruments.

To the extent that electricity prices remain floating over this period, this exposes the group to volatility in its operating cash flows. The group's policy, therefore, is to manage this risk by fixing a proportion of electricity commodity prices in a costeffective manner. The group has fixed the price on a proportion of its anticipated net electricity usage out to the end of the regulatory period from 2020 to 2025, partially through entering into electricity swap contracts.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDetails of electricity swaps designated as hedging instruments to manage electricity price risk are summarised below:\n\n1 year or less\n\n1 to 2 years\n\n2 to 5 years\n\nOver 5 years\n\n| Notional amount MWh                  |   306,480 |   329,400 |   350,280 | -   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----|\n| Average contracted fixed price \u00a3/MWh |     46.52 |     46.35 |     45.95 | -   |\n\nElectricity swaps have been designated in cash flow hedge relationships.

The board therefore believes that it is appropriate to maintain RCV gearing, measured as group consolidated net debt (including derivatives) to regulatory capital value (RCV) of UUW, within a target range of 55 per cent to 65 per cent. As at 31 March 2022, RCV gearing was within the range at 61 per cent (2021: 62 per cent).\n\nAssuming no significant changes to existing rating agencies' methodologies or sector risk assessments, the group aims to maintain long-term issuer credit ratings for UUW of at least A3 with Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and BBB+ with S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and a senior unsecured debt rating for UUW of at least A- with Fitch Ratings (Fitch). Debt issued by UUW's financing subsidiary, United Utilities Water Finance PLC, is guaranteed by UUW and is therefore rated in line with UUW.\n\nTo maintain its targeted credit ratings, the group needs to manage its capital structure with reference to the ratings methodology and measures used by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. The ratings methodology is normally based on a number of key ratios (such as RCV gearing, adjusted interest cover, post maintenance interest cover (PMICR), Funds from Operations (FFO) to debt, and debt to EBITDA) and threshold levels as updated and published from time to time by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. The group looks to manage its risk by maintaining the relevant key financial ratios used by the credit ratings agencies to determine a corporate's credit rating, within the thresholds approved by the board. Capital risk is reported monthly to the treasury committee through the operational compliance report.\n\nFurther detail on the precise measures and methodologies used to assess water companies' credit ratings can be found in the methodology papers published by the rating agencies.",

In the absence of an appropriate quoted price, the group has applied discounted cash flow valuation models utilising market available data in line with prior years. The \u00a3497.2 million decrease (2021: \u00a32,906.2 million increase) in level 1 fair value measurements primarily reflects the maturity of the 5.75 per cent \u00a3375 million bond in March 2022, which was classified as a level 1 fair value measurement in the prior financial year, and a reduction in the number of observable quoted bond prices in active markets at 31 March 2022.\n\nDuring the year, changes in the fair value of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss resulted in a \u00a30.4 million loss (2021: \u00a323.9 million loss). Included within this was a \u00a34.2 million gain (2021: \u00a343.3 million loss) attributable to changes in own credit risk, recognised in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount due to changes in credit spread was \u00a339.9 million profit (2021: \u00a335.7 million profit). The carrying amount is \u00a3143.8 million (2021: \u00a3147.5 million) higher than the amount contracted to settle on maturity.\n\n## Company\n\nThe company does not hold any financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value or where fair value has been separately disclosed in the notes as the carrying value is not a reasonable approximation of fair value.",

Benefits are payable on death and following other events such as withdrawing from active service. No other post-retirement benefits are provided to these employees.\n\nThe assets of these schemes are held in trust funds independent of the group's finances. The trustees are composed of representatives of both the employer and employees, who are required by law to act in the interests of all relevant beneficiaries and are responsible for the investment policy with regards to the assets plus the day-to-day administration of the benefits.\n\nAs at 31 March, the total fair value of the schemes' assets, and the present value of the defined benefit obligations, and therefore the value of the net retirement benefit surplus included in the consolidated statement of financial position, was as follows:\n\n| Group                                        | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total fair value of schemes' assets          | 4,035.7   | 3,984.7   |\n| Present value of defined benefit obligations | (3,018.9) | (3,295.7) |\n| Net retirement benefit surplus               | 1,016.8   | 689.0     |\n\nEstimated future benefits payable\n\nThe defined benefit obligation includes benefits for current employees, former employees and current pensioners as analysed in the table below:\n\n| Group                                      | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total value of current employees' benefits | 504.7     | 783.5     |\n| Deferred members' benefits                 | 602.1     | 574.4     |\n| Pensioner members' benefits                | 1,912.1   | 1,937.8   |\n| Total defined benefit obligation           | 3,018.9   | 3,295.7   |\n\nMovements in the present value of the defined benefit obligations are as follows:\n\n| Group                                                                  | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| At the start of the year                                               | (3,295.7) | (3,057.6) |\n| Interest cost on schemes' obligations                                  | (66.5)    | (68.5)    |\n| Actuarial gains/(losses) arising from changes in financial assumptions | 164.0     | (429.7)   |\n| Actuarial gains arising from changes in demographic assumptions        | 52.4      | 80.6      |\n| Actuarial (losses)/gains arising from experience                       | (5.0)     | 25.4      |\n| Curtailments/settlements arising on reorganisation                     | -         | (0.6)     |\n| Member contributions                                                   | (2.3)     | (2.4)     |\n| Benefits paid                                                          | 141.7     | 162.0     |\n| Current service cost                                                   | ( 7. 5 )  | (4.9)     |\n| At the end of the year                                                 | (3,018.9) | (3,295.7) |\n\nThe duration of the combined schemes is around 17 years.

        "page_content": "## A5  Retirement benefits continued\n\n## Funding of future benefits payable\n\nUnder UK legislation there is a requirement that pension schemes are funded prudently, and that funding plans are agreed by pension scheme trustees. The defined benefit schemes are subject to funding valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries, in conjunction with the schemes' trustees, on a triennial basis. These valuations inform the level of future contributions to be made by the group in order to ensure that the schemes are appropriately funded and therefore that benefits can be paid. The latest finalised funding valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2021, and determined that the schemes were fully funded on a low-dependency basis without any funding deficit that requires additional contributions from the company over and above those related to current service and expenses.\n\nThe schemes' funding plans are reviewed regularly, including between funding valuations. The group expects to make further contributions of \u00a39.1 million in the year ending 31 March 2023, \u00a38.0 million in respect of current service contributions and \u00a31.1 million in respect of expenses. Annual contributions are expected to be broadly similar to this until at least the point at which the next triennial valuation (due as at 31 March 2024), is finalised, which is expected to be towards the end of the year ending 31 March 2025. At this point a detailed re-evaluation of the level of annual contributions, and the basis on which these are made, will take place.\n\nThe group and trustees have agreed long-term strategies for reducing investment risk in each scheme. This includes an asset-liability matching policy which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension plan by investing in assets, such as corporate bonds and gilts, supplemented by swap and gilt long-term hedges of interest and inflation rates, which perform in line with the liabilities so as to hedge against changes in interest and inflation rates. Both the UUPS and ESPS schemes are fully hedged for inflation exposure through external market swaps and gilts. Further details of the derivatives used in reducing investment risk are disclosed in the 'Schemes' assets' section of this appendix.\n\nIn addition to the strategies implemented to date, the group and trustees are committed to exploring further de-risking options that may be implemented in the future, including in relation to longevity risk.\n\nThe basis on which scheme liabilities are valued for funding purposes differs from the basis required under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', with liabilities on a funding basis being subject to assumptions at the valuation date that are not updated between revaluations. Funding deficits vary significantly from company to company, but neither the deficits, the assumptions on which they are based, the associated sensitivities, nor the risk exposures are disclosed by many companies and, therefore, meaningful cross-company comparisons are not possible. Conversely, scheme liabilities are valued on a consistent basis between companies under IAS 19 and are subject to assumptions and sensitivities that are required to be disclosed. Consequently, the relative economic positions of companies are comparable only on an IAS 19 basis, subject to normalisation of assumptions used between companies.\n\nA retirement benefit surplus was recognised as an asset in the consolidated statement of financial position at both 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 as, under both the UUPS and ESPS scheme rules, the group has an unconditional right to a refund of the surplus assuming the gradual settlement of plan liabilities over time until all members have left the plans.\n\n## Impact of scheme risk management on IAS 19 disclosures\n\nUnder the prescribed IAS 19 basis, pension scheme liabilities are calculated based on current accrued benefits. Expected cash flows are projected forward allowing for RPI and CPI and the current member mortality assumptions. These projected cash flows are then discounted using a high-quality corporate bond rate, which comprises an underlying interest rate and a credit spread.\n\nThe group has de-risked its pension schemes through hedging strategies applied to the underlying interest rate and future inflation. Both UUPS and ESPS fully hedge RPI inflation exposure along with underlying interest rates through external market swaps and gilts (including gilt repurchase instruments), the value of which is included in the schemes' assets (net of associated derivative liabilities).\n\nConsequently, the reported statement of financial position under IAS 19 remains volatile due to changes in credit spread and changes in mortality, neither of which have been hedged at the current time.\n\nChanges in credit spreads have not been hedged primarily due to difficulties in doing so over long durations. In contrast, the schemes' specific funding bases are unlikely to suffer from significant volatility due to credit spread, because a prudent, fixed credit spread assumption is applied.\n\nChanges in mortality have not been hedged due to this exposure being subject to lower volatility in the short term and relatively high hedging costs, though the group and scheme trustees are committed to exploring options to de-risk changes in mortality, or pension longevity, in future periods, as outlined above.\n\nPension benefits under the defined benefit element of the UUPS hybrid section, which represents a relatively small proportion of total defined benefit obligations, are linked to CPI rather than RPI.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2022, the discount rate increased by 0.75 per cent (2021: 0.25 per cent decrease), which includes a 0.35 per cent increase in credit spreads and a 0.4 per cent increase in gilt yields over the year. The IAS 19 remeasurement gain of \u00a3313.6 million (2021: \u00a382.7 million loss) reported in note 18 has largely resulted from an increase in credit spreads during the year partially offset by an RPI inflation assumption increase of 0.4 per cent (2021: 0.55 per cent increase). The impact of movements in credit spreads is less pronounced on a scheme funding basis compared with the remeasurement loss recognised on an IAS 19 accounting basis as the discount rate used for valuing obligations utilises a fixed credit spread assumption.",

The results of the funding valuation have been adjusted to take account of experience over the period, changes in market conditions, and differences in the financial and demographic assumptions. The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service costs, were measured using the projected unit credit method.\n\nMember data used in arriving at the liability figure included within the overall IAS 19 surplus has been based on the finalised actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2021 for both UUPS and ESPS.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nThe main financial and demographic assumptions used by the actuary to calculate the defined benefit surplus of UUPS and ESPS are outlined below:\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n| Group                                          | % p.a.   | % p.a.   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Discount rate                                  | 2.80     | 2.05     |\n| Pension increases                              | 3.75     | 3.35     |\n| Pensionable salary growth (pre-2018 service):  |          |          |\n| ESPS                                           | 3.75     | 3.35     |\n| UUPS                                           | 3.75     | 3.35     |\n| Pensionable salary growth (post-2018 service): |          |          |\n| ESPS                                           | 3.75     | 3.35     |\n| UUPS                                           | 3.20     | 2.75     |\n| Price inflation - RPI                          | 3.75     | 3.35     |\n| Price inflation - CPI (1)                      | 3.20     | 2.75     |\n\nNote:\n\nThe discount rate is consistent with a high-quality corporate bond rate, with 2.80 per cent being equivalent to gilts plus 1.10 basis points (31 March 2021: 2.05 per cent being equivalent to gilts plus 75 basis points). The corporate bond population used in deriving this rate comprises corporate bonds rated at least AA by one or more credit rating agencies.\n\nIn accordance with the scheme rules, pensionable salary growth is linked to RPI for UUPS for service pre-2018 and CPI for service post-2018, for ESPS the growth is linked to RPI.\n\nAssumed pension increases are aligned to the RPI price inflation assumption as the vast majority of benefits across the schemes have a direct RPI linkage.\n\nIn September 2019, the Chancellor of the Exchequer highlighted the UK Statistic Authority's proposals to change RPI to align with CPIH (Consumer Prices Index, including housing costs). Plans to reform RPI and bring it in line with CPIH from 2030 were confirmed on 25 November 2020, though this is subject to judicial review. Broadly CPIH increases are expected to average around 1 per cent per annum below RPI in the long-term (about the same as CPI), so this change could have a significant impact on many pension schemes.\n\n## Demographic assumptions\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the base tables used for the mortality in retirement assumption are the Continuous Mortality Investigation's (CMI) S3PA (2021:S2PA) year of birth tables, with a scaling factor of 109 per cent (2021: 106 per cent) and 115 per cent (2021: 109 per cent) for male pensioners and non-pensioners respectively and 110 per cent (2021: 104 per cent) and 111 per cent (2021: 105 per cent) for female pensioners and non-pensioners respectively, reflecting the profile of the membership. At 31 March 2022, future improvements in mortality are based on the extended CMI 2021 (2021: CMI 2020) projection model, with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent (2021: 1.25 per cent). To adjust for the impact of circumstances arising as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic on future mortality trends for the schemes' membership, an adjustment has been made to reflect an expectation that the direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic will have an adverse impact on longevity in the short to medium term. Accordingly, in arriving at the mortality assumptions for the current year, the group has included a w2021 parameter of 10 per cent within the CMI 2021 projections, which is a subjective estimate that has an impact of circa \u00a330 million decrease in the defined benefit obligation. All other parameters within the future improvements model are consistent with the prior year.",

These estimates inherently involve judgement, and the measurement of the defined benefit surplus is sensitive to changes in these key assumptions. These sensitivities, together with further information on the judgements involved and level of estimation uncertainty, are presented below. Sensitivity calculations allow for the specified movement in the relevant key assumption, while all other assumptions are held constant. This approach does not take into account the interrelationship between some of these assumptions or any hedging strategies adopted, however it demonstrates how reasonably possible changes could impact on the measurement of the defined benefit surplus.\n\n- \u00b7 Asset volatility - If the schemes' assets underperform relative to the discount rate used to calculate the schemes' liabilities, this will create a deficit. The schemes hold some growth assets (equities, diversified growth funds and emerging market debt) which, though expected to outperform the discount rate in the long term, create volatility in the short term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes' long-term objectives.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate - An increase/decrease in the discount rate of 0.25 per cent would have resulted in a \u00a3119.7/\u00a3127.7 million (2021: \u00a3142.1/\u00a3151.9 million) decrease/increase in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2022, although as long as credit spreads remain stable this will be largely offset by an increase/decrease in the value of the schemes' bond holdings and other instruments designed to hedge this exposure. The discount rate is based on high-quality corporate bond yields of a similar duration to the schemes' liabilities. High quality corporate bonds are considered to be those that have a credit rating of AA or above with at least one rating agency. An alternative approach could be taken whereby only those bonds rated AA or higher by at least two rating agencies are used. While this alternative approach may provide additional comfort around the quality of these corporate bonds, management believes that the wider population of corporate bonds under a 'single agency' approach gives a more representative indication of high quality corporate bonds that are aligned to the schemes' liabilities, and therefore provides a more robust estimate.\n- \u00b7 Price inflation - An increase/decrease in the inflation assumption of 0.25 per cent would have resulted in a \u00a3111.5/105.2 million (2021: \u00a3144.3/\u00a3136.1 million) increase/decrease in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2022, as a significant proportion of the schemes' benefit obligations are linked to inflation. However, nearly all of the schemes' liabilities were hedged for RPI in the external market at 31 March 2022, meaning that this sensitivity is likely to be insignificant as a result. The sensitivity to price inflation allows for the impact of changes to pensionable salary growth and pension increases, which are both assumed to be linked to price inflation. While inflation may be volatile in the near term, as has been the case during the year ended 31 March 2022, the value of the schemes' liabilities is based on inflation assumptions that reflect the full profile of the liabilities, in particular the long-term nature.\n- \u00b7 Consistent with market practice, and reflecting the possibility that inflation may rise or fall more than expected in the future, in arriving at the company's best estimate for RPI, an inflation risk premium of 0.2 per cent (2021: 0.2 per cent) has been deducted from the breakeven inflation rate for the year ended 31 March 2022. The impact of this is a decrease in the defined benefit obligation of around \u00a390 million and therefore an increase in the net defined benefit surplus compared with no inflation risk premium being deducted. There is no allowance for any further change in the inflation risk premium post 2030 as a result of RPI reform. A reduction in expected RPI will result in a reduction to the value of pension scheme liabilities; however, as our pension schemes are hedged for RPI inflation movements, this will result in a comparable reduction to the value of pension scheme assets.\n- \u00b7 The assumption for CPI is set by deducting a 'wedge' from the RPI inflation assumption to reflect structural differences. For pre-2030 inflation this wedge has been estimated at 0.9 per cent per annum, reducing to 0.1 per cent per annum post-2030 given that RPI and CPI are expected to converge. The impact of this reduction in the post-2030 wedge as a result of RPI reform is a circa \u00a38 million increase to the defined benefit obligation and therefore a decrease in the net defined benefit surplus compared with the wedge remaining at 0.9 per cent per annum after 2030.\n- \u00b7 Mortality long-term improvement rate - An increase in the mortality long-term improvement rate from 1.25 per cent to 1.50 per cent would have resulted in a \u00a329.1 million decrease in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2022 (2021: \u00a333.2 million decrease in the schemes' liabilities).\n- \u00b7 Life expectancy - An increase/decrease in life expectancy of one year would have resulted in a \u00a3135.0 million (2021: \u00a3152.8 million) increase/decrease in the schemes' liabilities at 31 March 2022. The majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member and, as such, the schemes' liabilities are sensitive to these assumptions.",

At that date, the facility formed part of the group's long-term interest in the Water Plus joint venture given that there was a clear expectation that this revolving credit facility would be replaced with additional share capital, with this transaction subsequently executed in April 2021. Accordingly, this \u00a318.3 million balance ceased to be treated as a related party receivable and was recognised as an addition to the group's joint ventures balance during the year ended 31 March 2022 (see note 12).\n\nA further \u00a31.4 million (2021: \u00a31.4 million) of non-current receivables was owed by other related parties at 31 March 2022.\n\nDuring the year, United Utilities PLC provided guarantees in support of Water Plus in respect of certain amounts owed to wholesalers. The aggregate limit of these guarantees was \u00a354.1 million, of which \u00a332.1 million related to guarantees to United Utilities Water Limited.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, amounts owed to related parties were nil (March 2021: \u00a32.4 million). The amount outstanding at 31 March 2021 included \u00a31.1 million due to Water Plus for the surrender of consortium relief tax losses including other amounts due to be settled in accordance with normal credit terms. These amounts were paid during the current year bringing this balance to a nil position.\n\n## Company\n\nThe parent company receives dividend income and pays and receives interest to and from subsidiary undertakings in the normal course of business. Total dividend income received during the year amounted to \u00a3295.5 million (2021: \u00a3291.9 million) and total net interest payable during the year was \u00a321.0 million (2021: \u00a324.2 million). Amounts outstanding at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021 between the parent company and subsidiary undertakings are disclosed in notes 14, 16 and 21.\n\nAt 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021, no related party receivables and payables were secured and no guarantees were issued in respect thereof. Balances will be settled in accordance with normal credit terms. No allowance for doubtful receivables has been made for amounts owed by subsidiary undertakings as at 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2021.",

        "page_content": "## A7  Accounting policies\n\nOf the accounting policies outlined below, those deemed to be the most significant for the group are those that align with the critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty set out on pages 217 to 218.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries), and incorporate the results of its share of joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. The results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the date control is obtained or until the date that control ceases, as appropriate.\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used under the relevant local GAAP into line with those used by the group. Amounts attributable to non-controlling interests are presented separately in equity and total comprehensive income where material.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the group. Control is achieved where the group is exposed to, or has the rights to, variable returns from its involvement in an entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In the parent company accounts, investments are held at cost less provision for impairment.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Joint ventures\n\nJoint ventures are entities in which the group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which are jointly controlled with one or more parties under a contractual arrangement. The group's share of joint venture results and assets and liabilities is incorporated using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment in a joint venture is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the group's share of the profit or loss.\n\nOn losing control of a subsidiary disposed of to a joint venture, the group recognises the gain or loss attributable to measuring the investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of water, wastewater and other services represents the fair value of the consideration receivable in the ordinary course of business for the goods and services provided, exclusive of value added tax and foreign sales tax. Where relevant, this includes an estimate of the sales value of units supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the period end.\n\nThere are two main areas of the group's activities considered to result in revenue being recognised:\n\n- \u00b7 the provision of core water and wastewater services, accounting for more than 97 per cent of the group's revenue; and\n- \u00b7 capital income streams relating to diversions work, and activities, typically performed opposite property developers, that facilitate the creation of an authorised connection through which properties can obtain water and wastewater services.\n\nThe core water and wastewater services, which are deemed to be distinct performance obligations under the contracts with customers, follow the same pattern of transfer to the customer who simultaneously receives and consumes both of these services over time.\n\nRevenue is generally recognised at the time of delivery, with consideration given as to whether collection of the full amount under the contract is considered probable. Should the group consider that the criteria for revenue recognition has not been met for a transaction, revenue recognition would be delayed until such time as collectability is reasonably assured.\n\nPayments received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred income. This includes the revenue in respect of connection activities, itself a district performance obligation. The revenue in respect of these activities is released to the income statement over a period of 60 years, which is deemed to be the time over which the performance obligation for providing the connection is satisfied.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating profit is stated after charging operational expenses but before investment income and finance expense.\n\n## Borrowing costs and finance income\n\nExcept as noted below, all borrowing costs and finance income are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability are included in the initial fair value of that instrument. Where borrowing costs are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, such costs are capitalised as part of the specific asset.\n\n## Tax\n\nTax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Assessing the outcome of uncertain tax positions requires judgements to be made regarding the application of tax law and the result of negotiations with, and enquiries from, tax authorities. A current tax provision is only recognised when the group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the group will be required to settle that obligation to a taxing authority.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period and is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date.\n\nTaxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.\n\nCurrent tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the tax is dealt with in equity.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are provided, using the liability method, on all taxable temporary differences at each reporting date. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements - appendices\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at each reporting date.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is dealt with in equity.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment comprises water and wastewater infrastructure assets and overground assets.\n\nThe useful economic lives of these assets are primarily as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Water and wastewater infrastructure assets:\n- \u00b7 Impounding reservoirs 200 years;\n- \u00b7 Mains and raw water aqueducts 30 to 300 years;\n- \u00b7 Sewers and sludge pipelines 60 to 300 years;\n- \u00b7 Sea outfalls 75 years;\n- \u00b7 Buildings 10 to 60 years;\n- \u00b7 Operational assets 5 to 80 years; and\n- \u00b7 Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 3 to 40 years.\n\nEmployee and other related costs incurred in implementing the capital schemes of the group are capitalised.\n\nThe group is required to evaluate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever circumstances indicate, in management's view, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. An impairment review requires management to make uncertain estimates concerning the cash flows, growth rates and discount rates of the cash generating units under review.\n\nCosts associated with a major inspection or overhaul of an asset or group of assets are capitalised within property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the period of time expected to elapse between major inspections or overhauls.\n\n## Water and wastewater infrastructure assets\n\nInfrastructure assets comprise a network of water and wastewater pipes and systems. Expenditure on the infrastructure assets, including borrowing costs where applicable, relating to increases in capacity or enhancements of the network, is treated as additions. Amounts incurred in maintaining the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service are expensed in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Infrastructure assets are depreciated by writing off their cost (or deemed cost for infrastructure assets held on transition to IFRS), less the estimated residual value, evenly over their useful economic lives.\n\n## Other assets\n\nAll other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nHistorical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items, including relevant borrowing costs, where applicable, for qualifying assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the financial period in which they are incurred.\n\nFreehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated. Other assets are depreciated by writing off their cost, less their estimated residual value, evenly over their estimated useful economic lives, based on management's judgement and experience.\n\nDepreciation methods, residual values and useful economic lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes are accounted for prospectively. The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in other operating costs.\n\n## Transfer of assets from customers and developers\n\nWhere the group receives from a customer or developer an item of property, plant and equipment (or cash to construct or acquire an item of property, plant and equipment) that the group must then use, either to connect the customer to the network, or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services, or to do both, such items are capitalised at their fair value and included within property, plant and equipment, with a credit of the same amount to deferred grants and contributions. The assets are depreciated over their useful economic lives and the deferred contributions released to revenue over the 60 years, which is the estimated period over which an average connection through which the group provides water and wastewater services is expected to be in place (or where the receipt of property, plant and equipment is solely to connect the customer to the network, the deferred contribution is released immediately to revenue). This accounting treatment has been applied to transfers of assets from customers received on or after 1 July 2009.\n\nAssets transferred from customers or developers are accounted for at fair value. If no market exists for the assets then incremental cash flows are used to arrive at fair value.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are measured initially at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives. The carrying amount is reduced by any provision for impairment where necessary. On a business combination, as well as recording separable intangible assets already recognised in the statement of financial position of the acquired entity at their fair value, identifiable intangible assets that arise from contractual or other legal rights are also included in the acquisition statement of financial position at fair value.\n\nInternal expenditure is capitalised as internally generated intangibles only if it meets the criteria of IAS 38 'Intangible Assets'.\n\nIntangible assets, which relate primarily to computer software, are generally amortised over a period of three to 10 years.\n\nThe group expenses costs incurred in the implementation and ongoing operation of computing systems built and delivered on a 'software as a service' (SaaS) basis and hosted in an external cloud environment. These do not generally give rise to an identifiable intangible asset that the group controls. In limited circumstances, costs incurred in association with the implementation and customisation of a SaaS system may enhance the group's existing digital infrastructure and would be expected to generate broader future economic benefit. Where this results in an identifiable intangible asset that the group controls, the costs are capitalised in accordance with IAS 38 and subsequently amortised over a period of three to 10 years.\n\n## Impairment of assets\n\nWhere appropriate, assets are reviewed for impairment at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication that those assets may have suffered an impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.",

        "page_content": "The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value in use. Value in use represents the net present value of expected future cash flows, discounted on a pre-tax basis, using a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset, for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. Impairment losses in respect of non-current assets are recognised in the income statement within operating costs.\n\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the reversal is recognised in the income statement and the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but not so as to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.\n\n## Capitalisation of costs associated with regulatory price review programmes\n\nAs a regulated business the group's principal subsidiary, United Utilities Water Limited, is required to submit business plans to its regulator, Ofwat, on a cyclical basis. The costs to develop these business plans, which can be significant, largely relate to the development of material capital programmes to be delivered over the next five-year price control period. As such, the majority of these costs are considered to be directly attributable to bringing capital solutions into working condition, giving rise to future economic benefit in the form of reduced project costs as the capital programme is delivered, and supporting the enhancement of the company's infrastructure network as a whole. Such costs are therefore capitalised within property, plant and equipment where appropriate, and depreciated over a period of five years as the economic benefit is realised through the delivery of the capital programme.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell. Non-current assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as having been met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised and derecognised in the group's statement of financial position on the trade date when the group becomes/ceases to be a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\n## Cash and short-term deposits\n\nCash and short-term deposits include cash at bank and in hand, deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash, have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value. In the consolidated statement of cash flows and related notes, cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term deposits, net of book overdrafts.\n\n## Financial investments\n\nInvestments (other than interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and fixed deposits) are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs. Investments classified as financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL) in accordance with IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value. Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised in the net profit or loss for\n\nthe period. The business model employed in respect of financial assets is that of a hold-to-collect model.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, less any impairment for irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience of the receivables balance.\n\n## Trade payables\n\nTrade payables are initially measured at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities and equity\n\nFinancial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the group after deducting all of its liabilities.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity instruments issued by the group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nThe group's default treatment is that bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value, being the cash proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost applying the effective interest method. The difference between the net cash proceeds received at inception and the principal cash flows due at maturity is accrued over the term of the borrowing.\n\nThe default treatment of measuring at amortised cost, while associated hedging derivatives are recognised at fair value, presents an accounting measurement mismatch that has the potential to introduce considerable volatility to both the income statement and the statement of financial position. Therefore, where feasible, the group takes advantage of the provisions under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' to make fair value adjustments to its borrowing instruments to reduce this volatility and better represent the economic hedges that exist between the group's borrowings and associated derivative contracts.\n\nWhere feasible, the group designates its financial instruments within fair value hedge relationships. To apply fair value hedge accounting, it must be demonstrated that there is an economic relationship between the borrowing instrument and the hedging derivative and that the designated hedge ratio is consistent with the group's risk management strategy.\n\n## Borrowings designated within a fair value hedge relationship\n\nWhere designated, bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value, being the cash proceeds received net of any direct issue costs. They are subsequently adjusted for any change in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged at each reporting date, with the change being charged or credited to finance expense in the income statement.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, or where the hedge relationship no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', changes in the group's own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Borrowings designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nDesignation is made where the requirements to designate within a fair value hedge cannot be met at inception despite there being significant fair value offset between the borrowing and the hedging derivative. Where designated, bonds and loans are initially measured at fair value being the cash proceeds received, and are subsequently measured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value being charged or credited to finance expense in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements - appendices\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe group's default treatment is that derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at each reporting date, with changes in fair value being charged or credited to finance expense in the income statement. The group enters into financial derivatives contracts to manage its financial exposure to changes in market rates (see note A4).\n\n## Derivative financial instruments designated within a cash flow hedge relationship\n\nGains or losses resulting from the effective portion of the hedging instrument are recognised in other comprehensive income and in the cash flow hedge reserve with any remaining gains or losses recognised immediately in the income statement. The cash flow hedge reserve is adjusted to the lower of the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument and cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item. At the maturity date, amounts paid/ received are recognised against operating expenses in the income statement.\n\nUpon discontinuation of a cash flow hedge, the amount accumulated in other comprehensive income remains in the cash flow hedge reserve if the hedged future cash flows are still expected to occur. Otherwise the amount is immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Derivatives and borrowings - valuation\n\nWhere an active market exists, designated borrowings and derivatives recorded at fair value are valued using quoted market prices. Otherwise, they are valued using a net present value valuation model. The model uses applicable interest rate curve data at each reporting date to determine any floating cash flows. Projected future cash flows associated with each financial instrument are discounted to the reporting date using discount factors derived from the applicable interest curves adjusted for counterparty credit risk where appropriate. Discounted foreign currency cash flows are converted into sterling at the spot exchange rate at each reporting date. Assumptions are made with regard to credit spreads based on indicative pricing data.\n\nThe valuation of debt designated in a fair value hedge relationship is calculated based on the risk being hedged as prescribed by IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. The group's policy is to hedge its exposure to changes in the applicable underlying interest rate and it is this portion of the cash flows that is included in the valuation model (excluding any applicable company credit risk spread).\n\nThe valuation of debt designated at fair value through the profit or loss incorporates an assumed credit risk spread in the applicable discount factor. Credit spreads are determined based on indicative pricing data.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. For properties held for resale, cost includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites, including borrowing costs where applicable.\n\nNet realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations\n\nThe group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, which are independent of the group's finances, for its employees. Actuarial valuations to determine the funding of the schemes, along with future contribution rates, are carried out by the pension scheme actuary as directed by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years. In any intervening years, the trustees review the continuing appropriateness of the funding and contribution rates.\n\nFrom a financial reporting perspective and in accordance with IAS 19 'Employee Benefits', defined benefit assets are measured at fair value while liabilities are measured at present value, using the projected unit credit method. The difference between the two amounts is recognised as a surplus or obligation in the statement of financial position. Where this difference results in a defined benefit surplus, this is recognised in accordance with IFRIC 14 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction', on the basis that the group has an unconditional right to a refund of any surplus that may exist following the full settlement of plan liabilities in a single event.\n\nThe pension cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with the advice of a firm of actuaries based on the latest actuarial valuation and assumptions determined by the actuary, which are used to estimate the present value of defined benefit obligations. The assumptions are based on information supplied to the actuary by the company, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management. The assumptions are disclosed in note A5.\n\nThe cost of providing pension benefits to employees relating to the current year's service (including curtailment gains and losses) is included within employee benefits expense, while the interest on the schemes' assets and liabilities is included within investment income and finance expense respectively. Remeasurement gains/losses on scheme assets and liabilities are presented in other comprehensive income.\n\nIn addition, the group operates a defined contribution pension section within the United Utilities Pension Scheme. Payments are charged as employee costs as they fall due. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\n\n## Share-based compensation arrangements\n\nThe group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans, issued to certain employees. The equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest. Fair value is based on simulation models, according to the relevant measures of performance. The group has the option to settle some of these equity-settled share-based payments in cash. At each reporting date, the group revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable with the impact of any revision being recognised in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and the amount can be reliably estimated. Expenditure that relates to an existing condition caused by past operations that does not contribute to current or future earnings is expensed.\n\nForeign currency translation\n\n## Transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates applicable on the dates of the transactions. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the relevant rates of exchange applicable on that date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period.\n\nExchange differences arising on investments in equity instruments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are included in the gains or losses arising from changes in fair value which are recognised directly in equity. To hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into contracts for derivative instruments (see note A4).",

        "page_content": "## Group companies\n\nOn consolidation, the statements of financial position of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures (none of which has the currency of a hyperinflationary economy) are translated into sterling at exchange rates applicable at each reporting date. The income statements are translated into sterling using the average rate unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly, in which case the exchange rate at the date the transaction occurred is used. Exchange differences resulting from the translation of such statements of financial position at rates prevailing at the beginning and end of the period, together with the differences between income statements translated at average rates and rates ruling at the period end, are dealt with as movements on the group's cumulative exchange reserve, a separate component of equity. Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.\n\n## Grants and contributions\n\nGrants and contributions receivable in respect of property, plant and equipment are treated as deferred income, which is credited to the income statement over the estimated useful economic lives of the related assets.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract the group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. Where a lease is present, a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognised at the commencement date. The lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments due over the term of the lease, with the right-ofuse asset recognised as property, plant and equipment at cost. This is generally equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe group has elected to apply a practical expedient permitted by IFRS 16 whereby for the fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment asset class of leases the lease and non-lease components of the contracts are not separated, and instead are both accounted for as if they were a single lease component. Where non-lease components exist they are embedded within the lease payments, and the group deems that separation of such contracts into their constituent parts for this asset class would generally not be practicable nor have a material effect on the financial statements. IFRS 16 requires that where this practical expedient is applied, it is applied to the entire class of similar assets. The group has not applied this expedient to the remaining lease asset classes. Non-lease components include service charges, maintenance charges, and monitoring charges. For lease asset classes where the expedient has not been applied, non-lease components are excluded from the projection of future lease payments and are recorded separately within operating costs on a straight-line basis.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the group's incremental rate of borrowing if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined. For materially all of the group's leases, the group's incremental rate of borrowing is used. This rate is calculated using a number of inputs, being observable risk-free gilt rates, specific data based on bonds already in circulation for the relevant group company, as well as data from the wider utility sector. Further adjustments for payment profile and the term of the lease are made.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is increased for the accretion of interest (being the unwinding of the discounting applied to future lease payments) and reduced by lease payments made. In addition to this the carrying amount is updated to reflect any remeasurement or lease modifications. Remeasurements are typically required as a result of rent reviews or changes to the lease term. In these cases a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset is made.\n\nDepreciation of right-of-use assets is charged on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease payments are instead\n\ncharged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.\n\nWhere leases have a term of less than 12 months from the commencement date and do not have a purchase option, the group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption available under IFRS 16. The group applies the low value recognition exemption permitted by the standard to leases of assets with a value of less than \u00a32,500. Payments for short-term and low value leases are instead charged to operating costs on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\n## Grants and contributions received\n\nGrants and contributions received arise from transactions with customers, typically property developers, that result in the expansion of the group's water and wastewater network and therefore its fixed asset base. Given that these grants and contributions are used to fund expenditure that results in the enhancement of the group's network assets, the cash inflows are classified within investing activities in the period.\n\n## Interest payments and receipts\n\nIFRS allows interest payments and interest receipts to be classified within operating activities or financing activities/ investing activities. The group classifies interest payments and interest receipts within operating activities, with management viewing these in conjunction with other operating cash flows in assessing the ability of the group to maintain its operating capability.\n\n## Support costs\n\nCosts of time and resources incurred by the group's support functions that is capitalised in the period (see page 218) is included in purchase of property, plant and equipment within investing activities. These cash flows represent expenditures that have been made for resources intended to generate future income and cash flows, and the group deem these to therefore meet the definition of an investing activity.\n\n## Cash flows on derivatives\n\nThe cash flows on derivatives as a result of the group's hedging activities are presented together with the cash flows relating to the underlying hedged item to provide a more faithful representation of the substance of the transaction.\n\n## Taxes paid\n\nTaxes paid by the group are presented as cash flows from operating activities. The group deem it impracticable to identify the tax cash flows with respect to individual transactions, which may themselves be presented in investing activities or financing activities, and instead present total tax cash flows as operating activities.\n\n## Dividend receipts\n\nDividends received from joint ventures have been presented in investing activities, with these cash receipts deemed to represent a return on investments previously made by the group.",
