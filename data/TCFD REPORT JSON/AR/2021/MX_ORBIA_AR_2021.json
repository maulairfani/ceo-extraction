As we enter the third year of grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic, Orbia and our people have shown resilience in facing compounding challenges of health constraints, economic uncertainty and labor, material and supply chain disruptions. 2021 for us demonstrated what it truly is to transform.\n\nWe made the most of our integrated portfolio and applied ingenuity to delivering the cleaner, greener, essential solutions that our stakeholders need to live well and thrive. We witnessed time and time again how our purpose to advance life around the world propelled our rise to meet new challenges. And we realized that pursuing this purpose was inextricable from solving for the greatest challenge and opportunity for our present and future generations: climate change.\n\nAchieving triple bottom-line sustainability for people, planet and profit is-as it has been for over 65 yearsour commitment and reason for existence. It has shaped who we are, how we show up and clearly links to our ImpactMark: a transparent performance indicator that shows our year-over-year impact on key metrics. To maintain growth and get to a net-zero future, our commitment requires action. While our 2021 performance demonstrated that we are on the right path, our growth agenda has also had to change with our times.\n\nOur mandate to the executive team in 2021 continued to be putting health and safety first and caring for the\n\nJuan Pablo del Valle Perochena Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, we saw benefits from our integrated portfolio, as owning raw material assets and material chemistry acumen provides us with advantages in security of supply as well as product and cost efficiencies.'\n\nneeds of our community and stakeholders in the hardesthit regions worldwide. With rigorous safety protocols in place in all of our sites, teleworking in play for nearly half of our workforce and health risk management policies prepared, we stayed focused on safety first and were also pleased to report a 19% reduction in total recordable incidents versus 2020, reversing the trend that we saw in the previous year and bringing us back on course to zero accidents. We will continue to set aggressive goals for our teams and work relentlessly to attain them, with the support of our leaders and their contributions to risk management, continuity planning and new ways of working.\n\nWith over 22,000 employees working for impact, we continued to build on the momentum that started in the second half of 2020. In 2021, we saw benefits from our integrated portfolio, as owning raw material assets and material chemistry acumen provides us with advantages in security of supply as well as product and cost efficiencies. It also comes with a bigger responsibility: to invest in improving the way by which fluorine, polymers and other materials are made sustainable and into sustainable solutions. From field to table, mine to market, ground to home and lab to everyday life, we sought to support food and water security, building and infrastructure resilience, data connectivity and health and well-being.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our success in this-and in any business strategy-starts and ends with governance.'\n\nWith our eyes set on value creation, our business groups focused on operating safely and capitalized on synergiesespecially those between Polymer Solutions, Precision Agriculture and Building and Infrastructure-and expanded into high-margin categories. We invested in capacity, increased connectivity with our customers and pursued bolt-on acquisitions and organic growth opportunities.\n\nIn Polymer Solutions, we operated at high utilization rates to ensure our global customers' access to materials for water, sanitation and everyday health solutions and advanced research on bio-based PVC options. In Building and Infrastructure, we expanded our offerings in segments including stormwater management and indoor climate control for resilience and energy efficiency in all the places we call home. In Precision Agriculture, we improved the sustainability of our precision irrigation offerings and moved into turnkey greenhouse solutions to help our global stakeholders keep growing more with less. In Data Communications, we invested in large-scale, dig-once fiber and conduit projects to bring connectivity to more populations and communities around the world. And last but certainly not least, in Fluorinated Solutions, we expanded our portfolio of next-generation refrigerants, medical propellants and energy storage technologies to drive a decarbonized future.\n\nDespite disruptions in raw materials, transportation and labor as well as material cost increases, we saw revenue and EBITDA reach historic highs at $8.8 billion and $2.0 billion respectively, representing an increase of 37% and\n\n55% year-over-year. In addition, our operating cash flow was $982 million in 2021 as compared to $871 million in 2020, driven by the significant improvement in EBITDA. This was partially offset by higher working capital needs tied to higher raw material and other operating costs which in turn led to higher inventory values and selling prices. Optimizing our working capital and improving our operating cash flow will be areas of focus for 2022. And going forward, we are looking to invest in geographic expansion, extend our service offerings and technologies and pursue targeted acquisitions across our businesses to sustain us as we deliver on our purpose. Our success in this-and in any business strategy-starts and ends with governance.\n\nWith a change of leadership in 2021, we ushered in decisive moves to continue strengthening our worldclass corporate practices with our Board of Directors providing invaluable guidance to safeguard our purpose and values, oversee our management performance, promote responsible corporate citizenship and serve our shareholders. While our esteemed Board members Eugenio Clariond, Fernando Ruiz, Ignacio del Valle and Adolfo del Valle retired and Anil Menon stepped down in 2021 after decades of leadership and dedicated service, we appointed two new independent Board members. Mark Rajkowski, former Chief Financial Officer of Xylem and an executive advisor guiding Fortune 500 companies through transformation, and Mihir Desai, a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School with expertise in corporate governance, tax policy and corporate finance joined our Board, bringing deep experience and new perspective to our transformation journey.\n\nIn 2021, Orbia's Corporate Practices and Sustainability Committee also took steps to better align Board and management practices with shareholder interests by establishing a new long-term equity incentive plan that links a significant portion of management compensation to Orbia share value. Our Corporate Practices Committee approved share ownership guidelines for senior management to be implemented in 2022 and revised the charter to make our leaders' ESG responsibilities more\n\nexplicit, further embedding sustainability into our daily work and rewarding value creation against ESG metrics. We revamped our risk management systems to stay ahead of emerging risks and streamline protocols, recognizing climate change as the most critical challenge to solve for humankind and our planet.\n\nTo address material topics core to our performance, we maintained focus on fortifying our greatest capital: our people. To support employee fulfillment, development and well-being and foster a diverse community, we dedicated attention to attracting, developing and retaining the best talent through implementing a peoplecentered management strategy, expanded our learning and training resources through Orbia's flagship e XP career development program and engaged thousands in our global community in ongoing innovation projects related to 'moving the mark' on the ESG metrics that constitute our ImpactMark. To ensure that the company has the best future-fit team and players in place, we also initiated a succession planning process for our senior leaders to identify, recruit and retain key executives who will move us forward.\n\n2021 was a pivotal year for making progress against our ambitious environmental goals for net-zero carbon emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050. We also aligned our business objectives to this end by implementing new Scope 3 emissions reduction targets and issued our inaugural Sustainability-Linked Bond. We mapped physical and transitional risks to our strategic plans to meet the recommendations outlined by the Task Force on Climate-Related Disclosures (TCFD) and saw the results of supporting renewable energy adoption and green production processes. As of 2021, our revenue from products that contribute to advancing the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) increased by 24% year-over-year, with 23% of our sites powered by renewables.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With employees speaking up in greater numbers, we've had the opportunity to improve our workplace practices and have unveiled new resources to supplement our annual Ethics Survey, Ethics Month programming and Ethics and Compliance webcasts.

More than 3,000 Orbia employees also participated in ImpactMark programming to translate ideas into initiatives that improved the six ImpactMark indicators.\n\n## Upskill Our Workforce\n\nIn 2021, Orbia scaled digital learning platforms that supported thousands of employees to engage in over 17,000 courses, spanning leadership to project management and more. Orbia's Innovation Academy inspired hundreds of employees to invest in over 9,000 hours of specialized training.\n\n## Evolve to an Innovative Solutions Provider\n\nIn 2021, Orbia invested $68.5 million in innovation and R&D to continue to expand our portfolio of products and services. Orbia's corporate venture capital fund screened over 700 investment opportunities of promising enterprise startups and made eight investments in climate-related technology enterprises. LaunchPad, our internal innovation program, delivered outstanding engagement and impact levels with 6,000 employees participating and submitting more than 850 new ideas.\n\n## Optimize Our Investments\n\nIn 2021, Orbia led integration and geographic expansion activities, extended into value-added services and technologies and strategically pursued bolt-on acquisitions to achieve a 13.9% ROIC as compared to 7.1% in 2020, fortifying our company for a high-growth future.\n\n## Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n\nIn 2021, Orbia eliminated more than 60,000 tons of CO2 emissions with a combination of activities focused on optimizing manufacturing processes through efficiencies and transitioning to renewables and lower carbon energy sources. This led Orbia to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 10% vs. the 2019 baseline. In addition, Orbia established a new 30% Scope 3 emissions reduction target by 2030.\n\n## Reduce Waste Sent to Landfill\n\nIn 2021, Orbia saw a reduction of process-related waste-to-landfill coming in at 20% lower than in 2020. Orbia has led a consistent reduction in waste generated year-over-year, and 39% of plants sent zero waste to landfills in 2021.\n\n## Increase Women in Management\n\nIn 2021, Orbia improved empowerment and support of women in management roles to achieve 22% representation (vs. 19% in 2020) and drive 33% representation among new leadership hires.

To drive growth, we invest in our core markets, in geographic expansion and in adjacent products, services and technologies. Many of our businesses provide solutions for climate resilience and decarbonization and we will move further in this direction.\n\nOur plans include a significant investment in integrated PVC capacity, where we will leverage our access to raw materials to build market share at a time when supply is extremely tight and announced expansions do not meet medium-term demand. We will also leverage our unique position in fluorine to grow in high-value, high-growth applications connected to energy storage.\n\nWe view mergers and acquisitions as a tool to achieve our strategic objectives and will prioritize small-to-medium sized transactions where we can identify material synergies and growth potential.\n\nOrbia will continue to invest in programs and opportunities that enable us to realize synergies across our business groups and value chains. Vertical integration brings supply security and cost efficiencies across our business groups, especially those participating in the PVC chain. We see opportunities to innovate and develop fitfor-use products. Our Building and Infrastructure group, for instance, could supply PVC pipes to our Precision Agriculture group, where PVC makes up 50% of the cost of a typical project.\n\nBusiness Group\n\nSpotlights\n\nGovernance\n\nSustainability\n\nPeople\n\nWe will leverage geographic and asset synergies, to ensure we are making optimal use of our footprint and capabilities.\n\nFinally, we will invest in an operational excellence system that seeks to deploy common tools, processes and frameworks across our business groups in specific-function verticals. Through this system, we will take advantage of opportunities for standardization.\n\nOur approach to capital allocation throughout our growth journey is highly disciplined. We are encouraged that we can achieve our growth ambitions primarily through organic growth projects in our core markets. These initiatives are largely under our control and generally come at a cost below 4x expected EBITDA at maturity.\n\n## Investment Thesis\n\n- 1.

Customers relied on Alphagary for general purpose plasticizers for PVC compounds as well as a variety of other plasticizers for the food sector, the medical industry, and for generaland specialty-use applications.\n\n## Innovation\n\nVestolit's innovation process is being constantly fed by customer input. Among other projects, a new prototypal PVC line for non-thermoplastic applications in scrub resistance, gloss control, UV curable coatings, and lightweight applications is under development. During the year, Vestolit ramped up its fast-fusion (low energy consumption) copolymer line for use in automotive applications. Alphagary started beta testing a new type of plasticizer made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles. Across a range of applications and industries from consumer goods to building and infrastructure, this range of plasticizer offers flexibility and a green pathway for more than 150 million PET bottles per year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategy\n\nCOVID-19\n\nGovernance\n\nSustainability\n\nPeople\n\n2021 Highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operational Excellence\n\nVestolit implemented a global manufacturing organization and standardized system of KPIs across facilities to drive performance improvement in critical areas operating general resin plants at a 92% utilization rate. Vestolit provided 40% of intercompany PVC requirements, reducing exposure to market volatility, expanding industry knowledge and supporting R&D collaboration across Orbia's businesses. Alphagary expanded its footprint through the majority-share acquisition of Shakun Polymers Ltd. in India. This acquisition extends Alphagary's local manufacturing and delivery of halogen-free compounds on the Indian subcontinent, in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Africa with a broadened innovation horizon for developing cross-linkable and semiconductive materials.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nPolymer Solutions made gains in transitioning to renewables. Vestolit purchased 17.5 megawatt-hours of renewable electricity in 2021 to power its energy-intensive electrolysis processing for a reduction of 4,700 tons of CO2. Alphagary also invested in renewable energy in 2021 at its Melton facility to see a 99% reduction in CO2 in just one year. Vestolit upgraded the gas boilers at its Henry facility, enabling the shut down of its coal-fired boiler system. This project eliminated SOx emissions at Henry, reduced Orbia's emissions by 18%, and delivered $1.4 million per year in savings.\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nPolymer Solutions recorded breakout earnings, with high demand across the businesses, driving strong performance in resins and plasticizers. Despite global raw material shortages, the business group sustained growth by aligning processes, investing in upgrading equipment and focusing on the customer experience.\n\n## KEY MARKETS\n\nVestolit and Alphagary are leading global vinyl players, with strong positions in the Americas and Europe.\n\n## TOTAL REVENUE\n\n## $3,438 million\n\n(35% of Orbia revenues)\n\nTOTAL EMPLOYEES\n\n3,600\n\n(16% of Orbia employees)\n\nIn spite of headwinds due to supply chain disruptions, freight challenges and inflation/shortages with key raw materials, Alphagary overall saw strong performance in 2021 driven by robust performance in our plasticizer vertical as well as in compounds in many regions we serve. 2021 also saw us complete the acquisition of a majority stake in Shakun Polymers in India where the business performance once again has been very strong and the integration is proceeding smoothly.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGautam Nivarthy\n\nExecutive Vice President & President, Orbia Polymer Solutions (Alphagary)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial\n\nHighlights\n\nBusiness Group Spotlights\n\n<!-- image -->",

By working attentively to understand and address the needs of our employees, we continuously created a strong global platform of engagement, value creation and sustainable growth. Among our actions during the year, we incorporated new offerings in alignment with each of our People Strategy pillars:\n\n## Fulfillment\n\n## \u00b7  Orbia Helping Refugees\n\nWe invested in hiring and training refugees from around the world together with TENT Partnership for Refugees and their global network. By identifying recruitment needs and opportunities, we hired 33 refugees in three of our main operations (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico).\n\n## Development\n\n## \u00b7  Harvard ManageMentor Spark\n\nWe scaled the Harvard ManageMentor Spark Platform to expand professional learning and training offerings to our people, directly from Harvard Business Publishing. With rich multimedia content offerings, this platform opened access to as-you-need-it, how-you-prefer-it remote resources.\n\n## Well-Being\n\n## \u00b7  Global People Hub\n\nOrbia launched its first-ever global Well-Being Survey, providing us with first-hand data on our employees needs. From there, we developed programs and launched a one-stop hub for all our people to access timely updates, protocols and learning designed to improve well-being and wellness, with offerings from meditation sessions to online collaboration and support communities.\n\nGovernance\n\nSustainability\n\nPeople People\n\nHealth, Safety and Environment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
