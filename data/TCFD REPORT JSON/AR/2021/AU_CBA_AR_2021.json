including general banking services, lending, financial crime detection and supply chain management - can identify and mitigate human rights abuses, including modern slavery.\n\nCBA is committed to playing its part in limiting climate change in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and supporting the transition to net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nDuring the year, the Board endorsed a Group-wide work program to strengthen our approach to climate risks and opportunities across the Bank, and establish new medium and long-term targets for our operational emissions.\n\nThe Bank has continued to develop products which provide opportunities for businesses to benefit from sustainability initiatives, including the provision of low carbon finance, energy efficient equipment finance, green bonds, and incentives for solar power usage.\n\nFor retail customers we now provide lower cost financing, for eligible home loans, to support investment in sustainable and energy efficient solutions such as solar panels and other technologies that use renewable energy or lower emitting energy sources. Our latest report applying the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) appears on pages 22-33 of this Annual Report and explains our approach to climate-related governance, strategy, risk management and metrics and targets.\n\n## Strong business performance and capital position\n\nThe Bank performed well in the year to 30 June 2021, with disciplined execution delivering strong outcomes, despite the impacts of the pandemic.\n\nCash net profit after tax was 20% higher reflecting the improved economic conditions and outlook, resulting in a lower loan impairment expense, and a strong contribution from operational performance.\n\nDuring the year the Bank also continued its program of divestments of non-core businesses, in line with its strategy to become a simpler bank. Since the divestment program began in 2018 it has generated $6.2 billion in excess capital.\n\nBenefits from divestments, the strong balance sheet, and continued discipline on capital management, resulted in a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.1% at 30 June, well in excess of the APRA's 'unquestionably strong' benchmark of 10.5%.\n\nThe year's performance and capital position has allowed CBA to deliver strong returns for shareholders. The Board determined a final dividend of $2.00 per share, taking the total full year dividend to $3.50 per share, fully franked, resulting in shareholders receiving $6.2 billion in dividends in relation to the financial year.\n\nAfter considering our capital management options, we have also announced an off-market buy-back of up to $6 billion of CBA shares.\n\nWe believe that an off-market buy-back will benefit all our shareholders whether or not you decide to participate. This is because the buy-back will reduce the number of CBA shares on issue, thereby supporting the return on equity, earnings per share and dividend per share, for all shareholders who continue to hold shares in CBA.\n\n## Board focus on mix of skills, experience and intellectual capacity\n\nThe Board has an ongoing focus on ensuring that it has the appropriate diversity of skills, experience and strategic thinking capabilities that are required to lead Australia's largest financial institution and be at the forefront of digital banking.\n\nDuring the year, two new directors were appointed to the Board.\n\nSimon Moutter joined the Board in September 2020. Simon was most recently Managing Director of Spark New Zealand Limited, New Zealand's largest telecommunications and digital services company for seven years, and has extensive experience in technology, process effectiveness and business strategy.\n\nIn March 2021, the Board welcomed Peter Harmer. Peter was previously Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of IAG where he drove digital innovation across the business. In addition to a focus on customer service, Peter has expertise in the impact of climate change on financial services firms and the economy more generally.\n\nThese appointments have further strengthened the mix of skills, knowledge and experience relevant to the Bank's strategic priorities, particularly in digital technology and leadership in the transition of the Australian economy.\n\n## The future\n\nOver the past year CBA has evolved its strategy, updated its brand, refined its core values to reflect the progress over the past three years, and set out a more ambitious agenda to build tomorrow's bank today.\n\nFor CBA, this includes the development of new digital products and services, which reimagine the way financial services can be tailored to individual customers, and an ambition to provide a leading digital experience.\n\nThe refinement of the strategy also reflects our purpose and values, with an explicit intent for the Bank to play a significant role in Australia's economic recovery and to contribute to the nation's transition to a digital and sustainable economy, thereby underpinning Australia's prosperity and social wellbeing.\n\nIn aspiring to these ambitions, we recognise the importance of achieving the best balance of outcomes for all stakeholders.\n\nI thank all of our employees, customers and shareholders for your support this year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCatherine Livingstone AO Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Living our purpose and values\n\nOur purpose - to improve the financial wellbeing of customers and communities - is the reason we come to work every day, the reason we exist.\n\nOver the past three years, strengthening culture and accountability has been a priority for the Bank. The change has been values-led with strong leadership from the Board, the CEO and management team.\n\nWe clarified what we expect of our people through our purpose, values and Code of Conduct to guide our actions and ensure these changes remain part of how we operate.\n\nThis is an ongoing process, not a one-off exercise. We are determined to meet and exceed customer, regulator, shareholder and community expectations now and into the future.\n\n## Refining our values\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic reinforced/uni00A0our important role supporting our customers and the broader economy through challenging times. Our people took pride and motivation in providing practical and meaningful assistance to individuals, families and businesses in need.\n\nWe offered loan deferrals, relief funding, fee and interest waivers, financial counselling and more. Our/uni00A0people engaged with their customers and stakeholders in ways/uni00A0we/uni00A0could never have imagined.\n\nWe saw our people at their best and/uni00A0took the opportunity to refine our/uni00A0values: care, courage and commitment. Our values reflect the behaviours we saw, and/uni00A0continue to see, from/uni00A0our/uni00A0people every day. Together, they/uni00A0represent us at/uni00A0our/uni00A0most purposeful.\n\n## Guiding our actions\n\nOur Code of Conduct is the ultimate guide for how we do things. This year further work was done to embed our Code, providing absolute clarity about the outcomes we want to achieve and a comprehensive set of tools to enable us to achieve them.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe care about our customers and each other - we serve with humility and transparency.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have the courage to step in, speak up and lead by example.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are unwavering in our commitment - we do what's right and we work together to get things done.\n\n## 'Should We?'\n\n## A simple test for complex times\n\nDoing the right thing sounds simple, but we realised we needed a fast and effective test to help our people through challenges. When faced with a decision or situation where the right thing to do is not clear, we ask one simple question: 'Should We?'\n\n'Can We?' is not enough, because it focuses on/uni00A0capability and compliance, not suitability. The 'Should We?' test is equally important. It is part of how we operate every day and is helping us build a better bank. It guides us on how to act and make decisions that align with our values.\n\nOur customers and communities expect us to exercise good judgement. When the right answer is not obvious, we encourage our people to speak up and challenge their own, each other's and the Bank's thinking.\n\n## Can you answer 'yes' to all/uni00A0of/uni00A0these/uni00A0questions?\n\n- \u00b7 Is this consistent with our values and policies?\n- \u00b7 Am I being clear and transparent?\n- \u00b7 Would I be comfortable if I had to/uni00A0tell my family or a friend?\n- \u00b7 Is this fair to customers and the community?\n\n## Our roadmap for/uni00A0change\n\nThe Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) Prudential Inquiry report provided us with a clear roadmap for change. We fully embraced the recommendations and developed an action plan that would help us become a better bank.\n\nCultural change is an ongoing journey. We/uni00A0have made good progress, but much remains to ensure we sustain the outcomes of our action plan. It is important for our long-term performance, and the Board/uni00A0regularly tests that we are living up to our commitments. We celebrate those who live our values and help/uni00A0us create a/uni00A0positive risk culture. We have focused on:\n\n## Embedding the 'Should/uni00A0We?'/uni00A0test\n\nWe use the 'Should We?' test in/uni00A0all our interactions and decisions. It is a simple way to ensure our actions meet/uni00A0community/uni00A0expectations.\n\n## Resolving risks\n\nRisk management is a strategic priority. The voices of risk and compliance have been elevated. We have also improved our identification and escalation protocols, and/uni00A0our focus on resolving risk issues. Our aim is to deliver better customer and risk outcomes by taking a proactive approach to risk and continually improving how we manage non-financial risk.\n\n## Improving oversight of/uni00A0non-financial risk\n\nOur awareness and reporting of non-financial risk, including emerging risks, has significantly improved. The Executive Leadership Team's collective accountability for risk management is now embedded.\n\n## The role of remuneration\n\nRemuneration is directly tied to risk, customer and reputation outcomes, and/uni00A0considers our values and behaviours. Our senior leaders understand that they must exemplify our values each and every day. Unsatisfactory risk management outcomes and behaviours have negative remuneration consequences (including to zero). Equally, to reinforce a positive risk culture, employees who rate 'exceptionally managed' for risk are formally recognised and rewarded.\n\n## Strengthening our risk culture\n\nOur culture is dynamic, reflective and encouraging of constructive challenge. Risk/uni00A0management/uni00A0is/uni00A0a part of every activity. Our positive risk/uni00A0culture drives better decisions and outcomes for/uni00A0all our stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We are dedicated to honouring this legacy by being there for our country, our customers, our communities and our shareholders as the recovery continues.\n\nThe past year has demonstrated the resilience of Australian communities, businesses and the economy. While the economy recovered stronger than expected from the height of the pandemic, we will continue to provide targeted assistance to those who need it most.\n\nThrough short-term repayment deferrals we have supported many of our customers through the financial challenges posed by COVID-19. Since the onset of the pandemic, we've helped 158,000 home loan customers and 83,000 business customers, while more than six million customers have visited our COVID-19 support page.\n\nWe remain dedicated to supporting our customers through the most significant events in their lives, as well as the\n\nongoing uncertainty, whether it be due to the COVID-19 restrictions, severe weather events or natural disasters.\n\n## Setting a new ambitious strategy\n\nThree years ago, we set out to become a simpler, better bank. We've made significant progress and are now in a stronger position to set a more ambitious agenda: building tomorrow's bank today for our customers. Our strategic priorities include:\n\nLeadership in Australia's economic recovery and transition to support our customers and the country to recover from the disruption of the past year. We are building Australia's leading business bank, with a particular focus on health, agriculture, property, manufacturing and business services. We are also directing capital to help our economy become more modern, resilient and sustainable.\n\n## Reimagined products and services\n\nto offer a unique and differentiated customer proposition that embraces open banking and integrates with new services and ventures. We're using our digital innovation, data and analytics capabilities, and deep understanding\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof 7.6 million digital customers, to offer more personalised and relevant experiences. This includes Bill Sense in the CommBank app, which analyses transaction data to make more than 60 million bill predictions each day to help customers predict upcoming bills and payments, and Cash Flow View which over 830,000 of our customers use to get a complete picture of their income, spending and saving each month.\n\nGlobal best digital experiences and technology to build deep, trusted relationships with our customers and set the standard in financial services. Our ambition is to make our digital experiences the best of any company globally. For the 12th consecutive year, we have been rated #1 for online and mobile banking by Canstar, while independent research firm Forrester has also rated the CommBank app as the overall digital experience leader among mobile banking apps in Australia for the fifth year in a row.\n\n## Simple, better foundations to\n\nkeep the bank strong and safe and make it easier for our people to get things done. Through sustained and transparent risk management we aim to excel at managing both financial and non-financial risk while reducing costs where we can and managing capital with discipline.\n\n## Delivering performance\n\nThe Bank has delivered a strong financial result this year. This has been achieved through customer focus, digital engagement and operational excellence. Operating income increased 2% due to continued above system volume growth in home lending, business lending and deposits and a focus on our turnaround times. This offset the impact of historically low interest rates and strong competition. As a result of an improvement in economic conditions, our loan impairment expense decreased significantly this year.\n\nContinued balance sheet strength is critical to our ability to serve our customers, drive core business outcomes and deliver strong and sustainable returns for our shareholders. During the year, our capital position was supported by organic capital generated by our businesses, the proceeds received from the sale of our Life Insurance businesses, and other previously announced divestments.\n\nOur surplus capital position, combined with our strong cash earnings, has allowed us to return $6.2 billion in dividends to shareholders this year.\n\n## Partnering with our communities\n\nWe have continued to lead in the support we provide to communities. Through our Next Chapter program, we've extended our support for people impacted by financial abuse. We are also proud to have become the official partner and bank of the Australian women's football team, the Matildas, as well as the Junior Matildas and Young Matildas. Combined with our long-term sponsorship of women's cricket, we believe CBA is one of the largest ever investors in Australian women's sport.\n\n## A better place to work\n\nOnce again, our people have gone above and beyond to support our customers and communities when they have needed us the most, and I thank them for the care and commitment they've shown throughout the year.\n\nOur evolved strategy, brand and values strongly resonate with our people, and they continue to feel a strong sense of pride in working for CBA. They also see how their work directly contributes to our strategy, and as a result, employee engagement remains high at 78%.\n\n## Support during challenging times\n\nHelping our customers and the broader economy as recovery continues is our priority.\n\nWhile the Australian economic recovery continued strongly through most of 2021, the pandemic continues to have an impact on the Australian economy, as well as the health of our communities. The ongoing roll-out of the vaccination program and government support packages will be important to help Australians and the economy on the path back towards full economic activity.\n\nAs the past 18 months have shown, Australia has a very strong, stable and secure financial system. This includes well-capitalised and strong banks like the Commonwealth Bank, which together with the support of the federal and state governments, regulators and the broader industry, have helped the country through the worst pandemic in living memory.\n\nWe are prepared for a range of different economic scenarios and are well placed to support our customers. We are committed to new and ongoing support measures for those most impacted by COVID-19 and other events, and will continue to work closely with our retail and business customers to understand their needs.\n\nLooking ahead, we anticipate ongoing economic impacts and earnings pressure from lower interest rates. We will continue to invest in the business to reinforce our product offering to our retail and business customers and extend our digital leadership.\n\nThrough disciplined execution and our people's care and commitment, we will continue to deliver for our customers, community and our shareholders as we build tomorrow's bank today.\n\nMatt Comyn CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This support enabled the business to take advantage of the domestic tourism market, offering new routes in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. Coral Expeditions is now enjoying strong interest for future cruises.\n\n## Supporting small businesses\n\nProviding an integrated platform to simplify operations.\n\nAs the pandemic created uncertainty for regular operations, Gene Kapaufs, owner of Advieh - a Middle Eastern caf\u00e9 in Melbourne's inner west - decided to use Doshii to connect his food ordering apps with the caf\u00e9's Point of Sale (POS). By integrating all functions into a single system, Doshii helps hospitality businesses run their venues more effectively. The platform helped Gene reduce costs, speed up delivery, and eliminate staff mistakes with orders sent instantly to the kitchen and drink printers.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This year the Board reaffirmed our climate-related ambitions to accelerate our pace of change.\n\nThis year the Board and management focused on developing sectoral glidepaths for priority sectors consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe Board endorsed a Group-wide climate work program to uplift our action across our business. It also endorsed Environmental and Social (E&S) risk as a strategic risk that could have a material impact on our business.\n\nThis year the Board Nominations Committee endorsed, and the Board approved, E&S as a reference skill in the Board Skills Matrix.\n\nIn further recognition of the importance of E&S considerations, this year we established an Executive Leadership Team E&S Committee. It is the approval body and point of escalation for decisions relating to the climate work program underway across the Bank. It is supported by a new Business E&S Action Group.\n\nThe E&S Framework applies across the Bank, and provides a reference point for our people and stakeholders on our standards, ambition, and the governance and oversight in place. The E&S Policy also outlines the governance and accountabilities to support embedding of the Framework across our business.\n\nFor more information on our E&S Policy and associated E&S Framework, see commbank.com.au/policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate-related governance framework\n\n## Board\n\n## Oversees the management of climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nPolicy Approves the Environmental & Social Policy and Framework\n\nOpportunities Endorses climate-related opportunities from management\n\nRisk management Approves the approach to managing climate-related risks\n\n## Board Risk and Compliance Committee\n\nMonitors the Bank's climate-related risk profile (including emerging risks).

In addition to considering the risks of climate change, our strategy also seeks to harness the significant existing and emerging opportunities to help our customers reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change.\n\nClimate change is a source of both risk and opportunity for the Bank. Severe weather events can cause assets we hold as collateral to lose value. Failing to respond adequately to the potential impacts of climate change will negatively affect the Bank's long-term performance.\n\nClimate change also presents many significant opportunities. These include greening the electricity grid, electrifying transport and industrial processes, supporting agricultural innovation and sustainability, and replacing or refurbishing economic and physical infrastructure.\n\nGiven the systemic nature of climate change, we acknowledge that our role in enabling a more resilient and sustainable economy extends to collaborating with government, business and the broader community on new banking and industry standards. We also aim to support our customers and communities when impacted by extreme weather events.\n\n## Our climate work program\n\nWe have uplifted our approach to climate by developing a Board-endorsed climate work program. The program focuses on short-term actions across each business unit to establish strong foundations for a medium-term plan. Our approach includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Reducing our own environmental footprint for our operations and supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Pursuing strategic opportunities created by climate change.\n- \u00b7 Supporting our customers and people in the transition to a low carbon economy.\n- \u00b7 Increasing the resilience of our business to climate risks.\n\n## Our greenhouse gas emissions ('000s tCO2-e) 1\n\n242\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n40%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nreduction in Group/uni00A0Scope 1 and 2 emissions (including Australian data centres) since 2014\n\n\uf0a2 Scope 1 & 2 (excluding data centres)\n\n\uf0a2 Scope 3 (excluding data centres)\n\n\uf0a2 Data centres (Scope 3)\n\n\uf0a2 Data centres (Scope 2)\n\n- Scope 1 & 2 (including Scope 3 data centres)\n\n- 1  From FY14 to FY19, CBA data centres were deemed as non-operational control (Scope 3) and reclassified as operational control (Scope 2) from FY20.\n\n## Reducing our own operational footprint\n\nWe continue to reduce our/uni00A0environmental footprint through continued investment in smart/uni00A0technologies and practices. By/uni00A0increasing the energy efficiency of our buildings, we have reduced Group Scope 1 and 2 operational emissions (including Australian data centres) by 40% since 2014. We/uni00A0use renewable electricity equivalent to 100%/uni00A0of our Australian power needs and fully offset any residual emissions in Australia and New Zealand. We aim to achieve carbon neutrality by offsetting residual emissions from our global operations in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Building our bankers' climate capability\n\nThis year, the Bank partnered with Monash University to develop a climate science and opportunities program which is delivered to senior institutional bankers.

These include supporting our retail, business and/uni00A0institutional customers as they make their transitions to long-term sustainability.\n\n## Retail\n\nWe are responding to growing customer demand for climate-related products and services. For our retail customers we are focused on products and services to/uni00A0incentivise and help them reduce emissions.\n\nWe also provide other services to help customers manage their energy costs and usage. The Bank has partnered with a renewable electricity retailer, Amber Electric,/uni00A0to provide our customers with access to wholesale energy prices and real-time data. This access allows them to manage their energy usage and costs.\n\nWe are also leveraging our digital platforms to engage with customers to increase awareness and build climate change resilience.\n\n## Business and Institutional\n\nOur business customers and institutional clients are focused on opportunities to procure or manufacture renewable energy, electrify industrial processes, explore carbon offset and abatement options, and to replace and refurbish machinery to achieve efficiency gains in/uni00A0agriculture and land use.\n\nWe have accelerated our focus on sustainable finance, executing on a number of significant transactions and meeting our business customers' and institutional clients' strategic objectives.\n\nIn the Business Bank, we have issued over $900 million of new funding in investment and construction loans for Green Star and NABERS rated commercial properties of 5-star and above.\n\n## Supporting the low carbon transition\n\nThe Bank's financial performance could be impacted if revenues foregone from carbon intensive customers are not replaced by opportunities in new 'green' industries. To mitigate the risk and harness the opportunity, we continue to track towards our Low Carbon Funding Target of $15 billion in funding by 2025 to renewable energy projects, 6-star rated commercial green buildings, energy efficiency projects and low carbon transport. This year we have set a broader Sustainability Funding Target, and next year will commence tracking progress against this target of $70 billion in cumulative financing between the 2021 and 2030 financial years, replacing our Low Carbon Funding Target.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Efficient Equipment Finance\n\nWe continue to provide our Energy Efficient Equipment Finance program to help Australian businesses invest in the most efficient asset classes available in their industries and reduce their carbon footprint. This year we financed more than 750/uni00A0assets. Cumulative new funding increased by 23%, including financing business customers to purchase and install electric vehicles and buses, rooftop solar panels, and small scale solar and wind farms.\n\n## Future industries\n\nWe are working with our institutional clients to deploy capital in a way that supports economy-wide decarbonisation. The Bank supported IGO Limited, an ASX-listed diversified mining and exploration company, transition to a clean energy metals company. We provided a debt facility to invest in the world's lowest-cost and highest-grade lithium mine together with a share in Australia's first battery-grade lithium hydroxide plant.\n\n## Future economy\n\nThe Bank is committed to building Australia's future economy by supporting the development of a transparent and liquid market in Australian carbon credit units. We are directing capital and capability to mobilise the lowest cost abatement in the economy and support our clients to meet their own voluntary demand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Introducing ultra-low rate Green Loans to retail customers\n\nWe are providing low-fee, low-rate, 0.99% per annum fixed-rate Green Loans to encourage households to invest in clean energy technology that reduces their energy bills and makes their homes more energy efficient. Customers with an eligible CommBank home loan or investment loan can use the Green Loan to buy and install eligible clean energy products such as solar panels, battery packs and solar hot water systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Designing products to help customers improve efficiency\n\nASB launched Back My Build, targeted at customers building a new home from scratch and aimed at helping address New Zealand's housing supply challenges. In addition to a low interest rate, Back My Build customers who commit to achieving a New Zealand Green Building Council Homestar sustainability rating to certify the home's energy efficiency can receive a cash back contribution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Facilitating sustainable business finance\n\nWe are supporting business customers by providing term debt facilities with pricing incentives linked to sustainability-related KPIs. This year we acted for a number of institutional clients, including Lendlease, NSW Treasury Corporation and Canberra Metro, helping them issue green bonds or green loans. We were involved in $6.9 billion in ESG bond arrangement.\n\n## Addressing risk and resilience for our/uni00A0mortgage customers\n\nThis year we targeted communications with 140,000 home loan customers in high peril risk areas (e.g. bushfire, flood or storm) to educate and inform them of the requirements and benefits of adequate building insurance.\n\n## Supporting a sustainable agricultural sector\n\nIn New Zealand, ASB is working with rural customers to understand their environmental challenges and help them invest in sustainability. This year ASB launched the discounted Rural Sustainability Loan targeted at improvements such as reducing emissions, improving biodiversity and conserving water.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This transparency will ensure customers, communities, regulators, governments and other stakeholders understand our risk-based approach to transitioning to a net zero emissions economy by 2050.\n\nWe are developing priority sector-level glidepaths ('glidepaths'), informed by science-based climate scenarios. These measures will allow us to transparently track alignment to the Paris Agreement at a sector level.\n\nTo this end, this year we began developing science-based sector-level glidepaths in four of the most emissions-intensive sectors in our portfolio: thermal coal mining, upstream oil, upstream gas and power generation.\n\nOur initial drafts of the glidepaths have used the underlying reference scenario IEA SDS 2020, a 'well below 2 degrees' scenario in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We will, within 12 months, review the ongoing suitability of this scenario, having regard to the policy context, scientific literature, data availability and quality, and the global and domestic emissions trajectory.\n\nIn the coming year, we intend to implement these/uni00A0four glidepaths internally. This implementation will/uni00A0help us understand our lending decisions' impact at a portfolio level. We expect to begin publishing these glidepaths in the 2022 Annual Report once they have been appropriately embedded in business practices.\n\nAfter embedding our four priority glidepaths, we expect to/uni00A0develop further glidepaths covering significant sectors and continue to evolve our approach as industry practice develops and measurement and methodological standards emerge.\n\nWe note that this staged approach reflects the limited availability of/uni00A0fully established methodologies, tools and data to measure/uni00A0and manage emissions across all priority sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What is a glidepath?\n\nGlidepaths are a way to set and articulate interim/uni00A0and long-term aspirations with respect to/uni00A0emissions as they relate to a bank's financing activities. Glidepath design is underpinned by/uni00A0several methodological choices, which should be reviewed as technologies and procedures evolve.\n\nGlidepaths are typically set at the sector level. Data and tool limitations make it challenging to set/uni00A0and manage glidepaths for certain sectors. As such, most banks take a staged approach to setting glidepaths. There are/uni00A0five steps to embedding a glidepath:\n\n- 1. Select reference scenario : Define required emissions trajectory with scenario informed by science.\n- 2. Determine baseline : Based on design choices, select an emissions metric and calculation methodology, then/uni00A0calculate the portfolio's current emissions.\n- 3. Project momentum pathway : A forward-looking projection using independent data sources of how the emissions of the portfolio(s) are expected to perform without intervention.\n- 4. Set glidepath : Set long-term ambition to meet the/uni00A0reference scenario at a sector level.\n- 5. Bridge the gap : Identify active measures to meet the/uni00A0glidepath.\n\n## Glidepath concepts\n\nEmissions metric\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The impacts of climate change could disrupt business activities, reduce asset values and affect our customers' ability to repay loans. The Bank's reputation could be impacted by continuing to finance certain industries,/uni00A0activities and customers, or by setting emission reduction targets and strategies deemed by the/uni00A0community to be inadequate.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nThe risk that climate change will/uni00A0reduce the value of the Bank's assets,/uni00A0including those held as collateral or investments. Such risks may arise from permanent damage due to more frequent and severe weather events and long-term shifts in/uni00A0climate patterns.\n\nReduced asset values in some locations or sectors could affect/uni00A0customers' ability to repay loans, leading to increased losses for the Bank and potential reputational risks from more customer hardship cases.\n\n## Transition risk\n\nThe risk that disruptions occurring from the adjustment to a low carbon economy will increase business costs/uni00A0or reduce asset values. Such/uni00A0risks may arise from changing regulatory, market, technological or/uni00A0community expectations.\n\nAssets in certain sectors or locations could become less valuable by being misaligned with low carbon policies or/uni00A0community expectations. Increased regulatory focus could increase the risk of compliance breaches/uni00A0or litigation (including class actions).\n\n## Managing risk\n\nDuring the year, we have continued to evolve our Risk Management Framework, including our approach to managing climate change risks.\n\nWe also conducted a review of our Group E&S Policy and Group E&S Framework. This review identified opportunities to enhance the\n\nidentification, measurement and aggregate reporting of our E&S risk exposures. These enhancements will continue as part of our Group-wide climate work program.\n\n- + See page 43 for more information on our Risk Management Approach.\n\n## Policy and Framework 1\n\nThe Group E&S Policy and Framework require that subject to Australia having a secure energy platform, we will:\n\n- \u00b7  provide no project finance to new or expanded Thermal Coal Mines, nor to new coal fired power plants;\n- \u00b7  reduce our existing project finance exposure to Thermal Coal Mines and coal fired power plants to zero by 2030;\n- \u00b7  only provide project finance for new or expanded oil or gas projects or Metallurgical Coal Mines 2 after an assessment of the environmental, social and economic impacts of such activity, and if in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement;\n- \u00b7  only provide corporate or trade finance to new oil and/or gas producing, metallurgical coal mining or coal-fired power generation Clients 3 who have publicly committed to the goals of the Paris Agreement, and after an assessment of the environmental, social and economic impacts;\n- \u00b7  not provide corporate or trade finance to new Clients who derive 25% or more of their revenue from the sale of thermal coal;\n- \u00b7  reduce our corporate and trade finance exposure to existing Clients who derive 25% or more of their revenue from the sale of thermal coal to zero by 2030 /uni200A4 ;\n- \u00b7  only offer corporate or trade finance to existing oil and/or gas producing, metallurgical coal mining or coal-fired power generation Clients 3 after an assessment of the environmental, social and economic impacts. From 2025, we will expect these Clients to have published Transition Plans.\n\n## Assessing and managing climate/uni00A0risk\n\nThe Bank has a number of key mechanisms in place to assess and manage our climate risk exposures.\n\nWe continue to enhance our climate change stress testing and scenario analysis capabilities. This will enable us to assess how different climate scenarios may impact our tactical and strategic decisions.\n\n- + See page 28 for more information on our scenario analysis.\n\nWe continue to develop our methodology, approach and tools for measurement of emissions intensity of our business lending portfolio, noting that data and methodology approaches continue to evolve, and the approach to deriving this information is subject to change as industry standards develop.\n\n- + See page 32 for more information on our business lending portfolio emissions intensity.\n\nInstitutional Bank loans, as well as large loans (greater than $30 million) in other business units, are evaluated through our ESG risk assessment tool. Additional due diligence may be undertaken depending on the level of risk.\n\nWe are expanding our ESG risk assessment tool and methodology to enable ESG risk to be assessed across a larger portion of business lending for our Business Bank.\n\nWe track our exposures to the Energy Value Chain regularly at the ELT E&S Committee.\n\n- + See page 31 for more information on our Energy Value Chain.\n\nIn Retail Banking Services, we are enhancing our data and analytics capabilities to better understand the current and future impacts of climate change to our customers and mortgage book.\n\n- + See page 35 for further information regarding how we support our customers impacted by natural disasters.\n- 1  Capitalised words and phrases used throughout the Policy and Framework section are defined terms. For more information on definitions used in our E&S Policy and E&S Framework, see commbank.com.au/policies.\n- 2  Applies to project finance to Clients involving (a) a greenfield oil, gas or metallurgical coal extractive activity; or (b) a brownfield expansion of an oil, gas or metallurgical coal extractive activity.\n- 3  Applies to Clients who derive 25% or more of their revenue from the sale of metallurgical coal, oil or gas, or for coal fired power generation, 25% of generation is from coal.\n- 4  We will continue to provide rehabilitation bonds for these existing Clients to ensure their responsibilities with exiting mine sites are fulfilled.\n\n## Monitoring our exposure\n\nThe Energy Value Chain describes our exposure to energy-related assets. We/uni00A0expect the value of these exposures to fluctuate from year-to-year while still delivering on our commitment in our Environmental and Social Framework.\n\nOur exposure to all non-renewable energy assets has reduced this year while our exposure to renewables has increased by 13% to $4.8 billion.\n\n## Energy Value Chain exposures as at 30 June 2021 1,2\n\nKey:   +/- change since FY20\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1  PwC has provided limited assurance on the Energy Value Chain exposure balances as at 30 June 2021. The PwC Limited Assurance Report is provided on pages 65-66.\n- 2  All figures are Total Committed Exposures (TCE) excluding Commitment at Offer and trading securities exposures as at 30 June 2021. Figures represented have been specifically derived based on material client exposures, and have not been netted off against any insurance or guarantees that mitigate the Group's risk exposure to clients. Not included are 'Other energy-related' exposures ($0.05bn) which comprise smaller loans and exposure to energy trading entities.\n\n- 4  Thermal coal exposure within each diversified miner is calculated as the Group's exposure to the miner, excluding exposure to thermal coal subsidiaries, multiplied by the percentage EBITDA contribution of thermal coal in its latest annual financial statements. Excluded from the exposures are exposures to thermal coal subsidiaries of diversified miners, i.e. subsidiaries whose business activities are predominantly related to thermal coal mining. These are allocated to thermal coal.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Assessing the emissions intensity of our business lending portfolio\n\nWe continue to assess the emissions intensity for our business lending across the Group. Our seventh iteration of this annual assessment has resulted in the estimation of the Bank's emissions intensity at 0.22/uni00A0kgCO 2 -e/$AUD of client expenditure.\n\nEmissions intensity is calculated as emissions divided by economic activity. We use client expenditure as a proxy for the client's economic activity.\n\nThe calculation uses client-specific emissions and expenditure data where available, and modelled sector-specific emissions intensity and financial data for the remaining lending exposures.\n\nFor sectors like mining, and electricity, gas and water, which are more likely to include publicly listed companies with detailed sustainability disclosures, our estimates are more reflective of the emissions profile of clients in our portfolio rather than an industry average. However, for sectors with few publicly listed companies (e.g. agriculture and business services), we rely more heavily on assumptions and an emissions intensity metric reflecting the industry average.\n\n## Evolving our methodology for assessing emissions\n\nThe availability of emissions data and the methodology for measuring financed emissions is an evolving topic. This year, we updated our methodology to remove guarantees from the reporting scope. We also updated the sector-specific assumptions in the agriculture and transport divisions to reflect updated and improved data sources.\n\nThis year, we do not report a year-on-year change in the overall portfolio emissions intensity, as the change would be primarily attributable to the change in assumptions in the agriculture and transport divisions.\n\nOur ability to assess the emissions intensity of our lending activities will improve as the availability and robustness of emissions data increases. In future years, we will aim to balance comparability with our historical approach and best practice as improved financed emissions methodologies emerge.\n\n- + Further information on the end-to-end process and calculation methodology, is provided at commbank.com.au/CRreporting\n\n## Group business lending emissions intensity of client expenditure (kgCO 2 -e/$AUD) 1,2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on emissions associated with our business lending activities in key sectors is provided at commbank.com.au/CRreporting\n\n- 1  Client expenditure is based on operational and capital expenditure as reported in the company financial statements.

Feedback from community groups and our complaints management systems inform this process.\n\nThis year, we consulted formally with our community stakeholders and partners. We continued to engage with consumer and community advocacy organisations, Indigenous and multi-cultural groups, and regional and remote areas. These consultations help us to identify issues, seek feedback and design products that better meet our customers' changing needs - particularly those who are underrepresented or in vulnerable circumstances.\n\nWe are focused on giving customers more control with bill management and budgeting tools, spending and payment alerts, and the ability to block some transaction types. We also prioritise helping customers save on everyday spending. CommBank Rewards has saved customers more than $6 million in deals and cashbacks, and our Benefits finder tool has connected customers to over one million unclaimed benefits and rebates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ For more information on how we are reimagining products and services see pages 14-15.\n\n## Listening to customers and responding to complaints\n\nOver the past 12 months, the Bank has focused on enhancing complaint handling and prevention reporting. We recently published new complaint handling principles on our website to ensure customers know they can expect fairness and consistency when making a complaint.\n\nWe are committed to resolving the root cause of complaints and are continuing to invest in data-driven solutions to analyse all complaints and identify issues that may impact other customers.\n\nBased on these insights, we can better respond to current complaints, prevent future problems and inform the design and development of our products.\n\nWe continue to enhance our reporting to the Board, the Executive Leadership Team and senior leaders across the Bank, to increase visibility and facilitate discussion and action on systemic issues impacting customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A new view on financial wellbeing\n\nTo better understand how we can improve financial wellbeing, we continue to work with the Melbourne Institute (MI) of Applied Economic and Social Research on the MI/uni00A0Financial Wellbeing Scale. The scale measures the extent to which Australians have financial freedom, control and security, and can/uni00A0meet their ongoing obligations now/uni00A0and into the future.\n\nThis year we launched the Australian Consumer Financial Wellbeing quarterly report. Informed by more than five million customers' transactional and account data, the report tracks financial wellbeing outcomes experienced by more than one quarter of the Australian adult population. The/uni00A0research shows customers' financial wellbeing is more closely linked to their financial behaviour than their income or financial knowledge. We use the report's insights to ensure the tools and features we/uni00A0provide make a real difference to/uni00A0our customers and communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+ For more information on our financial wellbeing scales and report, visit commbank.com.au/financialwellbeing\n\n## Cybersecurity training\n\nWe are helping protect our customers from cybersecurity risks and fraud.\n\nThis year, we delivered 6,900 'Cyber for Business' training modules, helping small to medium-sized businesses prepare for and respond to cyberattacks. This included an Indigenous Business Banking Cyber Safety and Fraud Prevention Guide specifically designed for Indigenous businesses.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Helping customers when they need us most\n\nWhen a natural disaster or pandemic hits, customers need immediate and personalised support.\n\nAs part of our COVID-19 support measures, we are helping customers navigate the pandemic by offering temporary loan deferrals and financial assistance. We made 240,000 calls to customers to help assess their individual situations and offer appropriate solutions. We also sent 1.7 million personalised reminders to ensure customers had information on the financial support available to them.\n\nWe had a structured, fair and transparent approach for helping those who still required assistance as the deferrals program came to an end. This gave customers more choice and ensured those in similar circumstances were treated equally. To give customers more time to get back on their feet, we were the first bank to commit to a freeze on any foreclosures, which has been extended to February 2022. We remain committed to supporting Australians through the pandemic.\n\nWe also offered same-day personalised support to over 800,000 customers impacted by extreme weather events in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Using data insights, our Customer Engagement Engine allowed us to automatically identify customers who may be affected by a natural disaster and offer immediate support that aligns to their needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## No hidden bank/uni00A0stuff\n\nWe are dedicated to improving access to our information, products and services for all customers.\n\nWe have launched a range of banking factsheets optimised for screen readers and transcribed into Easy English - a style of writing that/uni00A0conveys information for people with low English literacy. These have been accessed over 2,000 times.\n\nBankwest worked with The University of Western Australia's Law Faculty to reinvent terms and conditions (T&Cs), developing a visual format that conveys key product features in a way that is more engaging for customers and easier to understand to improve financial wellbeing outcomes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

More than 1,700 people have completed the program, and a further 13,000 have completed the e-learning module. Our target is for 70% of our workforce to have completed this training by 2022.\n\nIn 2021, we spent $6.1 million with/uni00A0Australian Indigenous suppliers, tracking towards our 2024 target of 3% total annual domestic contestable spend. We also partnered with Supply Nation to fund the DRIVE Program. This training program is focused on building skills to support Indigenous businesses wanting to supply to corporate and government. Twenty businesses have participated in the DRIVE Program this year.\n\nTo create Indigenous employment opportunities, we set ourselves a target of 3% Indigenous representation across our business by 2026. We currently have 0.8% Indigenous representation and we are actively looking for ways to attract and retain Indigenous talent at the Bank.\n\n## Creating sustainable outcomes and supporting Indigenous communities\n\nThe Bank has taken a careful, deliberate and long-term approach to making our operations carbon neutral.\n\nThis year, to offset our residual emissions, we purchased carbon credits from the Aboriginal Carbon Foundation, the only Indigenous company in Australia to provide third-party verified Indigenous carbon credits.\n\nThis partnership supports the employment of the Traditional Owners as rangers at the Kowanyama Carbon Project in Queensland, the continuation of cultural fire management, and the sharing of ecological knowledge across the local community.\n\n## Working with vulnerable customers\n\nWe support our vulnerable customers and those experiencing hardship with dedicated teams, assistance packages, fee waivers, special accounts and appropriate offers. We also have dedicated customer assistance lines to support those with specific needs or different cultural backgrounds.\n\nTo support customers with an eligible health care or pensioner concession card, we offer the Streamline Basic account with zero monthly fees,\n\nunlimited assisted withdrawals and access to key banking features and technology. We are contacting customers who, from our data, may be eligible for a Streamline Basic account. Over the past 12 months, we proactively migrated approximately 39,000 accounts and contacted more than one million customers.\n\n## Addressing financial abuse\n\nWe have increased our support for people impacted by financial abuse with the launch of our Next Chapter program. Through this program, we are taking action in three areas: leading the industry in providing care for vulnerable customers; expanding our support for long-term recovery; and helping raise public awareness and increase action in response to the issue.\n\nOur specialist Community Wellbeing team provide trauma-informed care for customers. This year, the team has had over 22,500 interactions with customers in vulnerable circumstances to provide financial safety and wellbeing support, including addressing banking needs and providing referrals to external experts.\n\nWe continue to address technologyfacilitated abuse through our digital platform and have introduced automatic blocks on offensive and abusive language.\n\n## Elevating women's/uni00A0sport\n\nWe are set to become one of the largest supporters of women's sport in the country.\n\nFrom August 2021, CBA will become the official naming rights partner of the national women's football team, the Matildas, Junior Matildas and Young Matildas. Together with our longstanding support for women's cricket, we are committed to helping players of all ages and abilities to participate in two of the country's favourite sports.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur partnership with Good Shepherd has established Australia's first Financial Independence Hub.

Looking ahead, we will maintain our commitment to ensuring the lived experience throughout the/uni00A0Bank aligns with our purpose and values.\n\n## Energising our people\n\nOur people have shown remarkable resilience, compassion and determination over the past year - coming to work inspired to live our purpose and help customers navigate COVID-19.\n\nTo help support our people in targeted ways during uncertain times, we increased communication and tracked engagement, wellbeing and enablement through our Your Voice and People Pulse surveys.\n\nIn our most recent 2021 survey, employee engagement was 78%. Our people's sense of pride in the organisation remains our strongest area, with 88% saying they feel proud/uni00A0to work at the Bank.\n\nAdvocacy and pride in the organisation/uni00A0remain significantly higher/uni00A0than their pre-2020 scores.\n\n## Strengthening culture\n\nCOVID-19 gave us a unique opportunity to see our culture in action. We saw how our risk management practices were delivering. We also saw how the changes made through the Bank's APRA Remedial Action Plan helped prepare us to deliver for our customers and communities during a crisis. Looking ahead, our focus is on continuing to embed our culture, using good judgement and ensuring the voice of customers remain strong.\n\nWe expect our leaders to uphold the highest standards, share a leadership mindset and energise their teams to achieve sustainable outcomes. We are supporting our leaders to put customers first, continuously learn, and/uni00A0pursue our purpose with care, courage and commitment.\n\n## Embracing new ways of working\n\nThe past year prompted us to reflect on/uni00A0how and where we work best to balance the needs of our customers with those of our people.\n\nWe quickly adapted our work environments to prioritise the health and safety of our people and customers. We listened to our people to understand their needs and we empowered leaders to utilise and support the best working environments to enable wellbeing, collaboration and deliver for/uni00A0our customers.\n\nOur hybrid working model seeks to enable what is best for our people, teams and customers, and reflects trends in the external environment.\n\nWith our people's physical and mental health being a priority, we have appointed a Group Chief Mental Health Officer to continue promoting wellbeing and to enhance the support we offer across the Bank.\n\n## Embedding inclusion and diversity\n\nInclusion and diversity is integral to our culture and how we live our values. Reflecting the diversity of our customers and communities enables us to better understand and serve their needs. Our new inclusion and diversity strategy supports the Bank's commitment to care, equality and respect.\n\nWe listen to our people and our customers' experiences and regularly review metrics and decisions to ensure they are fair and equitable. We also partner with community organisations and academic experts to ensure our approach is evidence-based, and we share what we have learned externally to accelerate positive outcomes. Our six employee-led networks play an important role in promoting inclusion and informing solutions for our people and customers.\n\nWe stand against gendered harassment and violence in all its forms and are taking steps to make the workplace safe for everyone. Our #IStandForRespect pledge with the Diversity Council Australia reflects the Bank's commitment to proactively address these issues.\n\nWe are committed to our diversity in leadership goals. By 2025, we aim to have 47-50% gender equality in Executive Manager and above roles, and for our senior leaders to match the cultural diversity of the Australian population. By December 2026, we aim to achieve 3% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representation in our domestic workforce.\n\nLearn more at commbank.com.au/\n\ninclusion&diversity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## More leave and better/uni00A0benefits\n\nOur new, streamlined CBA Enterprise Agreement will better meet our diverse workforce's needs.\n\nWe have introduced new leave types, including Sorry Business, gender affirmation, pandemic, fostering and surrogacy leave. We have also extended parental leave from 12 to 13 weeks and introduced 'life leave', designed to encourage employees to engage with their communities and life goals. Life leave can be used for a variety of reasons, such as attending cultural days of significance.\n\n## Women in leadership New goal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 47-50% women\n\nin Executive Manager and above roles by 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Manager and above roles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021\n\nactual\n\n2020\n\nactual\n\n41.7% 41.2%\n\n+ Our key workforce metrics are provided on pages 62-63.\n\n## The future of work is family friendly\n\nWe are proud to be recognised as one of Australia's first Family Friendly Workplaces. Our people have a diversity of family and caring responsibilities, which is why we provide a range of leave and other workplace support options. It is important that our people are able to perform their work in ways that work for them, their team and their customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLearn more at commbank.com.au/FFW\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Encouraging our people to speak up\n\nThe Bank places great importance on fostering a culture where our people feel empowered to speak up.\n\nIt is essential that our people and external partners can raise any issue or conduct that concerns them and know that they will be taken seriously. This helps the Bank identify and resolve issues more quickly.\n\nOur SpeakUP Service is available 24/7 via telephone, email or online.

This year, we conducted a review of our Group E&S Policy to ensure it addresses the changing risks and opportunities, and continues to deliver value for all our stakeholders. We recognise that we must continue to manage our own impact, and mature our approach to our supply chain and financing. We have clarified and further developed our approach to climate change, human rights and biodiversity, and have introduced new considerations such as animal welfare.\n\n- + For more information on our E&S Policy and associated E&S Framework, see commbank.com.au/policies\n\n## Addressing modern slavery risks\n\nGiven our position and scale, we have the opportunity to advance human rights. As a financial institution, we are committed to minimising modern slavery risks in our financing and supply chain activities. Accordingly, we seek to understand our impacts and mitigate the risks of modern slavery arising out of our business decisions.\n\nThis year, we undertook a data analytics project to systemically flag customer\n\ntransactions that may denote instances of modern slavery. The project will flag suspect customer transactions and inform future action plans. Its insights have been shared with peers and relevant NGOs for educational purposes.\n\nIn March, we published our first Modern Slavery Statement in compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2018 .\n\n- + Detailed information is available at commbank.com.au/CRreporting\n\n## Managing our supply chain\n\nTo help our suppliers navigate their supply chain and cash flow challenges as a result of COVID-19, we put in place immediate payment terms for our Australian Indigenous and small business suppliers. We have now extended immediate payment terms to all suppliers, regardless of size, in the Australian accounts payable process.\n\nWe recognise the need to continuously improve how we manage environmental and social risks in our supply chain. We continue to engage actively with suppliers to identify and mitigate modern slavery risks and issues. More than 1,000 employees completed training on modern slavery. We also implemented a human rights and modern slavery contract clause and commenced modern slavery risk assessments with our suppliers at highest risk. This will inform whether improvement plans are required to better address these risks.\n\n## Enhancing risk identification in our lending\n\nWe consider environmental and social risks in our business lending decisions. All institutional bank loans, as well as large business bank loans, are evaluated through our ESG risk assessment tool.\n\nOur ESG assessment is part of the lending approval process and considers the ESG risk and mitigations each client has in place. We have invested in expanding our ability to perform ESG risk assessments across a greater portion of our business lending portfolio.\n\nThe assessment covers nine priority areas: climate and energy, climate physical risk, pollution, biodiversity, water, labour rights and modern slavery, human rights, workplace health and safety, and anti-corruption and governance.\n\nInstitutional and business banking staff complete ESG training, which includes priority areas.\n\n- + Refer to pages 22-33 for more information on how we manage our own climate and environmental risks and opportunities.\n\n## Position on political donations and industry associations\n\nThe Bank belongs to a number of/uni00A0industry associations. This year, we worked closely with government and industry bodies to support Australia's economic recovery.\n\nOur engagement policy precludes us from/uni00A0making political donations. However,/uni00A0we may pay to attend political events aimed at the business community.

These payments are disclosed in/uni00A0line with the requirements of Federal and State governments.\n\n## Commitment to tax/uni00A0transparency\n\nThe Bank is one of Australia's largest tax payers, having paid over $3 billion in Australian corporate income tax this financial year.

        "page_content": "## Managing our strategic risks\n\nStrengthening our risk management approach enables us to better support our customers and adapt our strategy to the challenges and opportunities from a changed operating environment.\n\nOur efforts to establish industry leading financial and non-financial risk management practices has enabled the Bank to better manage our changing risk profile while supporting our customers and the community through a challenging period.\n\nDuring this time, we have observed structural changes to our operating environment. These interrelated and complex changes require an enterprisewide response. Our Risk Management Framework provides the mechanisms for the Board and management to consider such matters. The strategic risks and opportunities we are prioritising include:\n\n## Ongoing COVID-19 interventions\n\nThe emergence and rapid spread of new COVID-19 variants, combined with low community vaccination rates, could lead to extended lockdowns and restrictions. These interventions have the potential to slow Australia's economic recovery and require the Bank to extend relief measures to support customers.\n\n## Escalating geopolitical tensions\n\nThe world has been experiencing a rise in geopolitical tensions. This has led to actions such as increased trade tariffs, some of which have impacted\n\nbusinesses in Australia. We remain alert to rising geopolitical tensions that could threaten the Australian economy, destabilise supply chains, and disrupt our operations. The Board monitors conditions and maintains provisions and unquestionably strong capital for a range of potential economic scenarios.\n\n## Digital adoption across the economy\n\nThe need to access online services during COVID-19 has significantly fast-tracked the use of digital channels by customers. Simple and innovative digital services are a key competitive differentiator. We are accelerating our digital strategy to provide customers with one of the best digital experiences globally. This requires safely embracing new technologies and people with differing backgrounds, such as world-class engineers.\n\n## Climate action\n\nMomentum has been building rapidly across the globe for organisations to transition to net zero emissions by 2050. Our strategy will continue to embrace this challenge by adapting our processes, products and services.\n\nWe are investing to ensure we can assess and manage the risks to the Bank from climate change with greater sophistication. We also seek to harness the significant existing and emerging opportunities to support our customers in reducing their emissions.\n\n## Culture in a hybrid-working model\n\nCOVID-19 has accelerated the adoption of remote and flexible working arrangements. The Bank has embraced a hybrid-working model combining working in the workplace and working at home. We are conscious that new strategies are required to engage our people to continue to drive desired culture improvements; protect employees' physical and psychological wellbeing; develop our peoples' skills; and remain compliant with agreements and laws.\n\n## Heightened cyber threat levels\n\nWe have observed a notable increase in high profile cyberattacks on companies in Australia and abroad. Cyberattacks on our systems or those managed by suppliers can result in serious disruption to customer banking services, compromise customer data privacy and cause financial system instability. The Bank continues to invest heavily to protect our systems, minimise disruption and keep our customers' data safe.\n\n## Our risk framework\n\nThe diagram below outlines the Risk Management Framework - including risk governance structures - for managing the Bank's Material Risk types and their sub-risk types. The specific risks we manage within each of these risk types are either existing risks or forward-looking emerging risks that require action now to minimise their impacts in the future.\n\nDuring the year, the Board formalised five strategic sub-risk types in the Bank risk taxonomy. This reflects that the five strategic sub-risk types drive strategic decisions but are managed through their own dedicated governance, policies and procedures, infrastructure and teams. In addition, the Environmental & Social Committee and the Capital Committee were established to elevate governance over these specific strategic sub-risk types.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our current risk priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Macroeconomic environment\n\nOur business performance is closely linked to the performance of the Australian and New Zealand economies, which, in turn, are impacted by events in the global economy.\n\nDuring 2020, policies designed to improve health outcomes, and the uncertainty associated with COVID-19, led to Australia's first recession for almost 30 years. Australia's economic recovery was faster and stronger than anticipated through 2021, with the unemployment rate declining, consumer confidence improving and income growth rising, leading to growth in lending volumes. Although there is cause for optimism over the medium-term, the economic recovery has stalled from late June due to the impact of government imposed restrictions on travel and work to manage the spread of COVID-19 in a number of states.\n\nGeopolitical tensions, trade disputes and supply chain issues also continue to create uncertainty for some sectors, which could negatively impact economic conditions.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank has the backing of a strong balance sheet with strong deposit funding, significant excess liquidity and unquestionably strong capital.\n- \u00b7 We regularly discuss the macroeconomic environment with regulators and government. We also undertake stress tests to understand how our business performs, which enables us to prepare alternative action plans for a range of economic scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Our loan loss provision coverage remains appropriate and continues to reflect a consistent approach to managing risks as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.\n- \u00b7 We remain committed to helping the economy recover by continuing to provide targeted assistance to customers who need it most.\n- \u00b7 Our continued focus on operational excellence will ensure we manage our costs, while enabling us to make faster, better-quality decisions that will lead to market-leading customer and business outcomes.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe Bank recognises that climate change has far-reaching implications for the environment, our economy, our community and the strategy of the Bank.\n\nMore frequent and severe weather events and longer-term shifts in climate patterns could result in the Bank's assets, including those held as collateral, being impaired.\n\nIn addition, as local and global investors and regulators increase their focus on climate change, the risk of the Bank's assets in certain industries or those held in investment portfolios, could lose value from being misaligned with the transition to new technologies, regulations or consumer trends.\n\nThe nature and volume of new regulations and community expectations also heightens the risk of compliance breaches or litigation risk.\n\nThe Bank's reputation could be impacted by continuing to finance certain industries or customers, or by setting financed emission reduction targets and strategies that do not meet community expectations.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank has established an Executive level Environmental and Social (E&S) Committee, chaired by the CEO, to drive a strategic approach to addressing climate change risks and opportunities.\n- \u00b7 We have updated our business lending policies and are directing capital towards transformation of businesses to support the economy's transition to net zero emissions by 2050.\n- \u00b7 We continue to reduce our emissions and have achieved Climate Active carbon neutral certification for our Australian operations.\n- \u00b7 We are progressively performing climate change scenario analyses on priority portfolios, and are currently engaged in conducting the first APRA industry Climate Vulnerability Assessment to assess the Bank's future exposure to physical and transition climate risks.\n- \u00b7 We continue to enhance our approach to measurement and reporting of E&S risk exposures, including expanding our E&S Risk Assessment tool to apply to a greater portion of our business-lending portfolio.\n- \u00b7 Our approach to climate governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets aligns with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosure's recommendations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + For more information on our approach to climate change refer to pages 22-33.\n\nThe Board and management are prioritising their efforts on a combination of existing and emerging risks that could materially impact our ability to serve our customers or deliver our strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## People and capabilities\n\nBeing able to attract and retain the right talent and capabilities is central to achieving our strategy and delivering sustainable long-term performance.\n\nThe adoption of new technologies, rapidly changing customer behaviours and increasing regulatory expectations are changing the way we deliver products and services. In addition to deep banking expertise, we require leaders and employees with new and specialist skillsets in areas such as engineering, cybersecurity and analytics.\n\nAttracting and retaining people with these skills can be difficult due to increased demand from local and global competitors.\n\nEmerging risks include non-traditional technology competitors who aim to compete directly in banking; the decline in immigration due to long-term border closures; and the expected exit of skilled employees retiring from the workforce.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 We continue to invest in our value proposition as an employer through:\n- -Offering competitive benefits and wellbeing programs, fostering an inclusive and diverse workforce and offering a hybrid-working environment.\n- -Enhanced technology, tools and platforms to support team engagement, development and the health and safety of employees in a hybrid-working environment.\n- -Leadership initiatives to develop our leaders' capabilities and equip them with the skills and approaches required to lead cultural and behavioural change.\n- -Strengthening our culture and remuneration frameworks to ensure employees are clear on expectations and accountabilities, and demonstrate risk behaviours that lead to appropriate outcomes for all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 We have targeted training programs to develop our people, including senior management, and our talent development approach seeks to attract and retain high-calibre people.\n- \u00b7 Assessing opportunities to reskill and support our people to be ready for the workforce of the future, and building these into our long-term workforce plan and capability roadmaps.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Trust and reputation\n\nWe recognise that trust takes time to build and can be easily eroded through poor decisions; disruption of services; unfair treatment of customers; failure to meet customer and community expectations, or by not complying with our regulatory obligations.\n\nThe Bank continues to work hard to respond to the Royal Commission and the APRA Prudential Inquiry findings, particularly through our Remedial Action Plan. This has made us a better bank for our customers and the community, however we know there is still more to do.\n\nWe remain alert to heightened risk areas that could undermine the trust placed in us. These risks include cyber criminals disrupting our services or compromising our customers' privacy; increasing expectations of our E&S practices; and the need to identify and support emerging categories of vulnerable customers.\n\nThe continued high volume of new and proposed legislation could also result in severe penalties and loss of trust by regulators and the community if business changes are not effectively implemented.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 Through our leadership development initiatives, we continue to drive a risk culture of accountability, empowerment, constructive challenge, reflection and striving for best-practice risk management.\n- \u00b7 Our Code of Conduct ensures all staff have a clear understanding of what it means to do the right thing by asking 'Should We?' when making decisions.\n- \u00b7 We are updating standards, tools and training for employees to respond effectively to a broader spectrum of vulnerable customers, and are enhancing complaint processes to better identify and prevent key issues impacting our customers.\n- \u00b7 We have programs focused on remediating processes and compensating customers for previous unfair treatment.\n- \u00b7 Leadership of risk culture and issues impacting the Group's reputation are considerations in the Group Executive's short-term variable remuneration.\n- \u00b7 We work with government and regulators to deliver industry-wide improvements and initiatives to support a trustworthy and reliable financial services sector.\n- \u00b7 Our SpeakUP Whistleblowing hotline allows current and former employees, contractors, consultants and suppliers to anonymously raise a conduct issue.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This protects our customers, the community, and the integrity of the financial system. The Bank is required to comply with legislation targeting financial crime activities globally, including: Sanctions, Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF), and Anti-Bribery & Corruption (AB&C) legislation.\n\nThe failure to prevent, disrupt or detect financial crime can have a significant impact on our customers and the community. It can also result in significant fines and penalties for the Bank.\n\nFinancial crime risks have increased over the last year. We continue to see the increasingly sophisticated use of technology by criminals targeting vulnerable people and businesses globally. In addition, the growing volume of financial crime regulation locally and across the globe means that the Bank has much to do to remain compliant and keep protecting the community.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank, including through its Program of Action continues to address the underlying causes of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act (AML/CTF Act) failings that resulted in AUSTRAC commencing enforcement action against the Bank in 2017. Improvements being made focus on:\n- -Enhanced financial crime policies and procedures.\n- -Investment in new technology, including enhanced transaction monitoring systems and processes, aimed at the detection of financial crime.\n- -Establishing mechanisms and processes to improve customer data integrity through core systems.\n- -Development and implementation of a Group AB&C Control Framework and tools.\n- -Enhanced FCC education and training for all staff aimed at deterring and detecting financial crime.\n- -A high level of engagement with the Fintel Alliance.\n- -Constructive engagement with AUSTRAC and international regulators.\n- \u00b7 Given the links between human trafficking and financial crime we continue to strengthen our supply chain due diligence by embedding new modern slavery requirements into procurement policies, processes and capabilities.\n- \u00b7 We also collaborate with not-for-profit organisations that work with the private sector to detect and end modern slavery, including the Mekong Club.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nThe Bank's information technology systems, including those supplied by external service providers, are increasingly subject to information security risks. Cyberattacks can cause serious disruption to customer banking services or compromise customer data privacy, and have the potential to cause financial system instability.\n\nInformation security risks have increased in recent years due to the expanding use of digital channels to conduct financial transactions; the evolution of new technologies; increased sophistication of cyber criminals; and customers' increasing use of personal devices that are beyond our control systems.\n\nAdditionally, there has been a global increase in cybercrime during the COVID-19 pandemic, with cyber criminals seeking to gain financially from people's vulnerability. The increase in digitisation and more people working remotely has also elevated the risk.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank's Cyber Security team is responsible for the oversight and prioritisation of critical cyber-control activities to defend against the evolving threat environment. This includes a focus on enhanced detection and monitoring capabilities, secure configuration and vulnerability management and strengthened authentication methods.\n- \u00b7 We are aligning with the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) Essential Eight Maturity Model, which outlines mitigation strategies that make it harder for adversaries to compromise systems.\n- \u00b7 We have a well-established Crisis Management Team. Regular simulation events are run to maintain and improve the Bank's response capability during significant events.\n- \u00b7 We are providing greater education to our staff to increase their awareness of the dangers of cybercrime activities such as Phishing, and are enhancing our supplier monitoring processes to better understand and mitigate any weaknesses in their cyber defence capabilities.\n- \u00b7 We also collaborate with a range of government, community and industry bodies to provide education and support to strengthen system-level resilience and reduce the possibility of fraud and scams on the community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Privacy and data management\n\nThe Bank manages a large volume of sensitive data and understands that behind every piece of data is a real person. It is therefore our utmost priority to protect the privacy of all individuals whose personal information we collect and handle.\n\nWe seek opportunities to use this data to offer best-in-class digital experiences such as our Benefits finder tool, which has connected our customers to approximately half a billion dollars in unclaimed payments. As we consider opportunities to improve our products and services, we are always mindful of the trust our customers have placed in us to use their data in a manner consistent with our obligations and values.\n\nFailure to appropriately use and secure data can result in material consequences for the Bank, such as reputational damage, leading to loss of customers, operational disruption, and financial losses.\n\nThe regulatory landscape is also increasingly focused on the privacy, integrity and management of data throughout its lifecycle, which increases the risk of regulatory penalties or intervention.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 The Bank has a privacy strategy to enhance our data privacy processes, capabilities and awareness to ensure compliance in all jurisdictions where we have a presence.\n- \u00b7 We have enhanced our data leakage controls and introduced authentication software on end-point devices such as employee laptops.\n- \u00b7 Our data management program of work is focused on strengthening our Data Management Framework across the Bank. This involves enhancing our methodology, architecture, tools, standards and procedures across all business areas to ensure the quality and integrity of data throughout its lifecycle.\n- \u00b7 We have prioritised the data management practices for the most critical data elements across the Bank.\n- \u00b7 Implementing the 'Open Banking' compliance obligations, which apply progressively for different customer, product and data sets across multiple phases from July 2019. We were the first of the major banks in Australia to offer customers the ability to see their accounts from other major banks in one place - the CommBank app.\n\n## Business resilience\n\nThe continuity and resilience of our operations are crucial for serving our customers, upholding community trust and maintaining our reputation.\n\nThe Bank provides many services to customers through a complex technology infrastructure that requires ongoing maintenance and updates to ensure network, software applications and hardware (including those supplied by external service providers) are resilient. A failure or compromise of this technology infrastructure could result in a material disruption of service to our customers.\n\nThe Bank is also exposed to the risk of disruption from events such as natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest and property disruptions.\n\nThe risk of potential disruption to parts of our operations remains elevated due to the possibility of COVID-19 clusters impacting employee safety, uncertainty over the stability of global supply chains and their impact on third-party suppliers.\n\n## Key actions we are taking\n\n- \u00b7 We routinely monitor the health of all systems and perform contingency planning for disruptions to critical systems and processes.\n- \u00b7 A data centre and network modernisation program is improving our technology infrastructure's security and resilience, and our Technology Simplification Program is driving sustained simplification of the technology environment.\n- \u00b7 We are driving greater agility and alignment in our supplier partnerships to ensure we effectively mitigate risks across the supply chain. In particular, during the pandemic, we have increased oversight of key suppliers to assess their ability to operate effectively.\n- \u00b7 Our supplier governance, selection and monitoring mechanisms enable management to identify and manage the risk of third-party disruptions.\n- \u00b7 Our employees' welfare is paramount. To manage COVID-19 risks we have embedded a range of measures for remote workers to maximise their safety and productivity.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Customer deposits are considered the most stable source of funding. The strength of our banking business has allowed us to maintain the highest share of stable household deposits in Australia. Ensuring we are well funded has been critical to our ability to continue supporting our customers and helping the Australian economy recover.\n\nThe Group continued to satisfy a significant portion of its funding requirements from customer deposits, accounting for 73% of total funding, with customers continuing to increase their savings.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the Group had accessed $51.1 billion of funding provided through the RBA's three-year Term Funding Facility.\n\nour customers and manage ongoing uncertainties and commence returning a portion of surplus capital to shareholders.\n\nAdditional outstanding divestments are expected to provide further capital uplifts in/uni00A0F Y22.\n\nThe Bank is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) regulated by APRA.

The Group's average LCR for the quarter ended 30 June 2021 was 129% which was significantly above the minimum regulatory requirement of 100%.\n\n## The net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nshows to what extent our long-term assets are covered by stable sources of funding. The Group's NSFR as at 30 June 2021 was 129%, well above the regulatory minimum of 100%. The increase in the ratio was due to the growth in customer deposits, the benefit of the Term Funding Facility and our strong capital position.\n\n## Delivering for shareholders\n\nOur aim is to deliver sector leading returns and a sustainable dividend.

Including the interim dividend of $1.50 per share, the full year dividend was $3.50 per share, fully franked.\n\nThe Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) continues to be offered to shareholders.

RBS also includes the retail banking activities conducted under the Bankwest brand.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $4,806 million, an increase of $664 million or 16% on FY20. The result was driven by above system home lending growth and lower loan impairment charges reflecting an improvement in economic conditions and outlook. Income from credit cards and international transactions declined as spend volumes were lower due to COVID-19. Costs were flat compared to FY20, driven by benefits from branch and workforce optimisation that were partly offset by increased home loan processing costs to support elevated volumes, increased financial assistance to support loan deferrals, and higher investment spend.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nRBS continued to focus on operational excellence, in particular to support strong home loan volumes in a highly competitive market. A record number of home loan applications and pre-approvals were processed, with $141 billion of new home loans funded. This comprised of home loans to over 49,000 first home buyers, including those using the Government's First Home Loan Deposit Scheme. RBS also saw strong growth in household deposits, with transaction account balances growing by 25% and more than 900,000 new transaction accounts opened by customers.\n\nOver the past year, a key focus for the Bank has been supporting our customers as loan deferral programs and income support measures come to an end. The Bank's temporary loan repayment program played a key role in enabling customers to manage pandemic-related financial challenges. Pleasingly, the majority of the Bank's customers have returned to making their pre-deferral repayments on their loans. RBS will continue to support our customers that require ongoing assistance.\n\nPersonal loan and credit card activity increased in the second half of the year driven by higher domestic card spend and product innovation (Neo card, Advance Pay) in the consumer finance portfolio.\n\nDigitisation and process improvement further evolved to support our core businesses. RBS also continues to scale the Customer Engagement Engine enabling the Bank to make 13 billion insights each year to meet customer needs.\n\n- 1  On 21 June 2021, the Group entered into an agreement to sell its Australian general insurance business to Hollard Insurance Company Pty Ltd, which is expected to complete in mid-calendar year 2022.\n\n## Business Banking\n\n## Cash NPAT\n\n$2,758m\n\nFY20 $2,474m\n\nContribution to/uni00A0Group profit\n\n32%\n\nNet interest margin\n\n2.98%\n\nFY20 3.10%\n\n## Brands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness Banking (BB) serves the banking needs of business, corporate and agribusiness customers across the full range of financial services solutions.

BB includes the financial results of business banking activities conducted under the Bankwest brand.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $2,758 million, an increase of $284 million or 11% on FY20. The result was driven by higher business lending and deposits volumes, higher trading volumes through CommSec, and lower loan impairment expense. Income from the increase in volumes was offset by lower business lending and deposits margins due to a low interest rate environment. Costs increased reflecting investment in dedicated business bankers and technology to improve customer experience. Loan impairment expense decreased due to lower collective provision charges as a result of improved economic outlook.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nBB's focus remains on building Australia's leading business bank, by continuing to support business customers recover and grow from the disruption of the pandemic. Simplifying how we do things, improving customers' banking experiences and tailoring solutions to better meet their needs has also been a key focus.\n\nBB delivered strong volume growth across core business banking products and continued to support businesses impacted by the pandemic with loan growth of $11.1 billion across key sectors including property, agriculture and health. The business bank also funded 12,600 additional loans to Australian businesses through the Government's SME Guarantee Scheme.\n\nDelivering on our commitment to do better for small businesses, 200 new dedicated business bankers and Business Banking Managers were added in key branches. BB also expanded the capabilities of our 24/7 Australia-based contact centres and worked to improve the end-to-end customer experience through investment in technology, digital assets and analytics.\n\nSimplified lending processes and high quality fast decision making lead to increased lending to business customers. Significant improvements were made to BizExpress, our digital lending facility, which can now provide businesses with a loan in under 12 minutes.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Higher income from commodities financing and institutional lending commitment and line fees were partly offset by lower margins on deposits due to a low interest rate environment. Costs decreased driven by productivity initiatives and lower business travel expenses due to COVID-19 restrictions, partly offset by higher investment spend.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nWhile lending volumes are historically low, and are significantly lower than pre-COVID levels, new institutional lending remains stable. The institutional lending business has continued to improve its capital efficiency and has delivered similar levels of revenue without added risk.\n\nDeposit balances remain high, driven by the increase in liquidity in response to economic impacts from the pandemic. Although deposit balance growth has provided additional funding, the low interest rate environment has reduced earnings on deposits, and earnings on free equity held by Treasury.\n\nGlobal Markets has been well positioned to provide ongoing support for both corporate and government bond issuances. As a result, CBA is now ranked #1 in the Combined League table, a ranking of all banks on debt markets, securitisation and syndicated loans.\n\nIB&M continued to build its capabilities to offer insights and customer solutions with the creation of Commbank iQ, a joint venture between the Bank and Quantium. This unique partnership enables businesses and institutions to use Australia's largest aggregated anonymised data set to analyse trends, overcome challenges, and create better, more targeted products and services for Australians.\n\n## New Zealand\n\n## Cash NPAT\n\n$1,159m\n\nFY20 $809m\n\nContribution to/uni00A0Group profit\n\n13%\n\nNet interest margin 1\n\n2.18%\n\nFY20 2.12%\n\nBrands\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNew Zealand includes the banking and funds management businesses operating in New Zealand under the ASB brand. ASB/uni00A0provides a range of banking, wealth and insurance products/uni00A0and services to its personal, business, rural and corporate customers in New Zealand.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nCash net profit after tax was $1,159 million, an increase of $350 million or 43% on FY20. Income from growth in lending and deposit volumes along with an increase in net interest margin was partly offset by a decrease in insurance commissions income. Costs increased due to investment in risk and compliance and customer experience initiatives. Loan impairment expense decreased due to an improvement in economic outlook.\n\n## Operating performance\n\nASB continued to deliver strong balanced growth in core lending markets. Home lending grew by 12% for the year and supported nearly 15,000 first home buyers. Business lending also increased by 9%, while the market contracted for the 12 months to 30 June 2021.\n\nASB continued to advance its digital strategy, delivering more tools to help customers save time and reach their financial goals faster. This included the ASB ID app which allows customers to verify their identity without needing to visit a branch.\n\nThrough the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's Funding for Lending Programme, ASB launched Back my Build to help customers build a new home and help address New Zealand's housing supply challenges. The product offers a low variable rate and cash back contributions to encourage green and sustainable builds or first home buyers. ASB has also committed to providing low-cost funding for businesses investing in sustainability and infrastructure projects to reduce their environmental impact.\n\nASB supported 100 small businesses through the Borrow the All Blacks campaign, a sponsorship programme with New Zealand Rugby. ASB's Business Hub was also launched to provide resources and tools to help jumpstart businesses.\n\nASB continues to play its role in supporting New Zealanders through COVID-19 recovery, supporting customers with lending relief and a freeze on forced sales for owner-occupied family homes.\n\n- 1  Net interest margin is ASB Bank only and is calculated in New Zealand dollars.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The definitions (the Criteria) against which we assessed the Performance metrics are established by management and are presented on pages 293 to 308 of the 2021 Annual Report.\n\n## Management's responsibilities\n\nThe Management of the Group is responsible for the Performance Metrics and for the preparation of the Performance Metrics in accordance with the Criteria.\n\n## Our Independence and Quality control\n\nWe have complied with relevant ethical requirements related to assurance engagements, which include independence and other requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.\n\nIn accordance with Auditing Standard ASQC 1 Quality Control for Firms that Perform Audits and Reviews of Financial Reports and Other Financial Information, Other Assurance Engagements and Related Services Engagements the firm maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to express a limited assurance conclusion based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained.\n\nOur engagement has been conducted in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements (ASAE 3000) Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information . That standard requires that we plan and perform this engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether anything has come to our attention to indicate that the Performance Metrics have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria, for the year ended 30 June 2021. The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included:\n\n- \u00b7  Enquiries of relevant staff responsible for preparing the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Enquiries about the design of the internal controls and systems used to collect and process the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Where applicable, enquiries of third parties responsible for the preparation of data included in the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Enquiries about the design of the systems used by third parties to collect and process the Performance Metrics;\n- \u00b7  Comparing the Performance Metrics to relevant underlying sources on a sample basis; and\n- \u00b7  Reading the Performance Metrics to determine whether they are in line with our overall knowledge of, and experience with, the corporate responsibility performance.\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers, ABN 52 780 433 757\n\nOne International Towers Sydney, Watermans Quay, Barangaroo, GPO BOX 2650, SYDNEY  NSW  2001\n\nT: +61 2 8266 0000, F: +61 2 8266 9999, www.pwc.com.au\n\nLevel 11, 1PSQ, 169 Macquarie Street, Parramatta NSW 2150, PO Box 1155 Parramatta NSW 2124\n\nT: +61 2 9659 2476, F: +61 2 8266 9999, www.pwc.com.au\n\nLiability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion.\n\n## Use of report\n\nThis report was prepared for the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report to any persons or users other than the Board of Directors of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of any assurance engagements due to the selective testing of the information examined, it is possible that fraud, error or non-compliance may occur and not be detected. A limited assurance engagement is not designed to detect all instances of non-compliance of the Performance Metrics with the Criteria, as it is limited primarily to making enquiries, of management, and applying analytical procedures. The limited assurance conclusion expressed in this report has been formed on the above basis.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on our review, which is not an audit, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Performance Metrics have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria for the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMatthew Lunn Partner\n\nSydney 11 August 2021\n\n## Our approach to/uni00A0governance\n\nWe are committed to continuously improving our governance practices and ensuring that they are aligned with our business and/uni00A0stakeholders' needs.\n\nOur governance approach is based on accountability, effective delegation and adequate oversight to support sound decisionmaking.

        "page_content": "## Board priorities during 2021\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of balancing new/uni00A0strategic/uni00A0initiatives with core business performance. Over/uni00A0the/uni00A0past financial year, Board priorities included:\n\n## Culture\n\nTogether with management, the Board has a critical role in setting the cultural tone of the Bank. The Bank remains focused on shaping a culture that supports the Bank's purpose and achievement of business strategies. The Board actively monitors the Bank's culture and cultural change initiatives to ensure the lived experience throughout the Bank aligns with our/uni00A0purpose and values.\n\nFor more information see pages 6-7.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategy\n\nThe Board regularly considers the relevance and effectiveness of the Bank's strategy in the context of current and potential future market conditions. Having made significant progress on our strategy to become a 'simpler, better bank', this year the Board worked closely with management to evolve our strategic priorities, setting a more ambitious agenda: building tomorrow's bank today for customers.\n\nFor more information see pages 10-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board performance\n\nThe Board recognises the importance of continuously monitoring and improving its performance and the performance of its Committees. The Board assesses its performance annually, with an independent external evaluation of the Board and its Committees every three years.\n\nThe results of the 2020 external review were made available to the Board in August 2020. It concluded that while the Board and its Committees were operating at a level consistent with global better practice, some areas of focus for/uni00A0continuous improvement include:\n\n- \u00b7  Continued engagement with stakeholders to hear external perspectives and share knowledge with industry experts.\n- \u00b7  More time allocated for open discussions at Board meetings to facilitate greater focus on the Bank's/uni00A0strategy.\n- \u00b7  Increased informal engagement with management, including the layers below senior management.\n- \u00b7  Reinforcing the Board's expectations of management to provide the Board with qualitative insights in both meetings and Board papers.\n\nThese focus areas have strengthened over the year and were assessed again as part of the 2021 internal evaluation.\n\n## Environment and Social\n\nThe Board regularly considers environmental and social matters given their importance to our stakeholders and the Bank's long-term performance. The Board oversaw a review and update of our Environmental and Social Framework, highlighting the Bank's role in supporting Australia's transition to/uni00A0a/uni00A0net zero future.\n\nFor more information see pages 20-41.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Board continues to oversee the/uni00A0risks facing the Bank. The Board focused on COVID-19 related risks, in/uni00A0particular ensuring fair and equitable treatment of/uni00A0customers transitioning off COVID-19 support measures. Other priorities included completing the Remedial Action Plan (RAP) and designing the post RAP transition plan, the regulatory and political environment, macroeconomic/uni00A0conditions and digital adoption across the economy.\n\nFor more information see pages 42-47.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial oversight\n\nThe Board remains focused on operational excellence driving growth in/uni00A0our core banking businesses. Prudent balance sheet management contributed to our strong surplus capital position which creates flexibility for the Board to consider capital management initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + For more information see pages 48-57.\n\n## Governance\n\nThe Board ensures there is appropriate time set aside on its agenda to focus on critical matters. During the year, the Board empowered its Committees to play an enhanced role in matters such as policy reviews and accountability for key projects appropriate for the Committee level. This provides more time on the Board agenda for strategic discussions and consideration of future opportunities.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nThe Board recognises effective governance requires engagement with/uni00A0a broad range of stakeholders and consideration of their views in decision making. The Board carries out an annual external engagement program to understand external perspectives and share knowledge with stakeholders including shareholders and regulators.\n\n## Evaluation cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Year 1\n\nExternally facilitated\n\n## Year 2\n\nInternal review\n\n## Year 3\n\nInternal review\n\n## APRA Prudential Inquiry Report Board governance recommendations\n\nThe Final Report of the 2018 APRA Prudential Inquiry into CBA set out five recommendations relating to the role of the Board. Under the Bank's Remedial Action Plan, the Board designed and implemented target states for each recommendation. The table below sets out the target state and the action taken to/uni00A0ensure Board governance recommendations are sustainably embedded.\n\n#\n\n1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#\n\n2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n#\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\n## Board visibility\n\nThe Board maintains heightened visibility and continues to have a positive influence on behaviours within the Bank.\n\n## Board better practice\n\nThe Board, Board Audit Committee and Risk & Compliance Committee operate consistently with global better practice.\n\n## Board coordination\n\nThe Board ensures clear accountabilities and timely and effective information flows between its Board Audit, Risk & Compliance and People & Remuneration Committees.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nManagement owners of material issues are held accountable by the Board Audit Committee (BAC) for the resolution and effective closure of issues within their control.\n\n## Board reporting\n\nThe Board receives granular information on the Bank's position against its risk appetite and is able to/uni00A0examine non-financial risk issues.\n\nThe Board has set clearer expectations of management, and has increased its oversight and scrutiny of the risks facing the Bank. It has become more visible and is challenging executives more than ever to understand and manage the risks in their business. Senior management is clear about the behaviours and actions the Board expects of them and is held to account by the Board.\n\nAn external review of performance was undertaken during the year. Board and Board Committee Charters, guidelines and processes have been amended to ensure that the Board, Board Audit Committee and Risk & Compliance Committee are operating at a level consistent with global better practice.\n\nThese three Committees have amended Charters to clearly define and delineate the roles and responsibilities of each. Processes have been enhanced to ensure that information flows between Committees are effective and timely, and provide clear oversight of matters referred between Committees through to resolution.\n\nThe BAC has increased direct engagement with management owners of material issues. Group Audit & Assurance regularly updates the BAC on the management of high-rated issues and reports on follow-up of material issues. Improved monitoring of closure of issues has expedited issue resolution.\n\nThere has been a considerable focus on the non-financial risk reporting to the Board, including/uni00A0new and emerging risks. The Board receives comprehensive and tailored content to help the Board set the Bank's risk appetite and improve the Board's ability to effectively challenge management's actions.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our products and services are provided through our divisions, Retail Banking Services, Business Banking, Institutional Banking and Markets, and ASB New Zealand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + A review of the divisional operations and their results for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 can be found on pages 54-57.\n\n## Building simpler, better foundations\n\nWe have undertaken and completed a number of transactions that are consistent with our strategy to focus on our core banking business and to create a simpler and better bank. Those transactions that were executed or completed in the past two financial years are set out below.\n\nOn 1 November 2019, the Group announced the implementation of a joint cooperation agreement (JCA) which resulted in the full economic interests associated with CommInsure Life being transferred to AIA, and AIA obtaining direct management and control of the business (excluding the Group's 37.5% equity interest in BoCommLife Insurance Company Limited (BoCommLife)). As a result, CommInsure Life (excluding BoCommLife) was deconsolidated and derecognised on 1 November 2019. The sale completed via a statutory asset transfer on 1 April 2021.\n\nOn 28 April 2020, the Group announced the sale of its subsidiary, Australian Investment Exchange Limited (AUSIEX), to Nomura Research Institute (NRI). The sale completed on 3 May 2021.\n\nOn 13 May 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to sell a 55% interest in Colonial First State (CFS) to KKR. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals, and is expected to complete in the second half of calendar year 2021.\n\nOn 4 June 2020, the Group completed the sale of its 80% interest in its Indonesian life insurance business, PT Commonwealth Life (PTCL), to FWD Group (FWD). As part of the sale, CBA's Indonesian banking subsidiary, PT Bank Commonwealth (PTBC), has entered into a 15-year life insurance distribution partnership with FWD.\n\nThe Group ceased providing licensee services through Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited-Pathways (CFP-Pathways) in March 2020 and through Financial Wisdom Limited (Financial Wisdom) in June 2020.\n\nOn 10 December 2020, the Group completed the sale of its 37.5% equity interest in BoCommLife to MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings, Inc., the ultimate parent company of Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co.\n\nOn 16 December 2020, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement to merge Aussie Home Loans with Lendi Pty Ltd (Lendi). The transaction completed on 3 May 2021.\n\nOn 21 June 2021, the Group announced the sale of CommInsure General Insurance to Hollard Insurance Company Pty Ltd (Hollard). The sale is subject to Australian regulatory approvals and other conditions, and is expected to complete in mid-calendar year 2022.\n\nCFS and the Group's interest in BoCommLife have been classified as discontinued operations in the Group's financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021. The assets and liabilities of CFS are classified as held for sale as at 30 June 2021.\n\nThere have been no other significant changes in the nature of the principal activities of the Group during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- + For further details, refer to Note 1.1 and Note 11.3 in the Financial report on pages 121 and 262-264, respectively.\n\n## Operating and financial review\n\n## Group profit\n\nThe Group's statutory net profit after tax for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 was $10,181 million, an increase of $589 million or 6% on the prior year. Statutory net profit after tax from continuing operations for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 was $8,843 million, an increase of $1,455 million or 20% on the prior year. This was driven by a 2% increase in total operating income and a 78% reduction in loan impairment expense, partly o/ffset by a 4% increase in operating expenses.\n\nStatutory net profit after tax from discontinued operations for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 was $1,338 million, a decrease of $866 million or 39% on the prior year. This was predominantly driven by higher gains on disposals of businesses net of transaction and separation costs in the prior financial year.\n\nStatutory net profit after tax complies with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), Australian Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The cash net profit after tax is management's preferred measure of the Group's financial performance. It excludes items that are non-recurring in nature and are not considered representative of the Group's ongoing financial performance (non-cash items). We use the cash net profit after tax to present a clear and consistent view of our financial performance from period to period.\n\nThe Group's cash net profit after tax including discontinued operations for the year ended 30 June 2021 was $8,801 million, an increase of $1,394 million or 19% on the prior year. Excluding discontinued operations, cash net profit after tax for the year ended 30 June 2021 was $8,653 million, an increase of $1,428 million or 20% on the prior year. For further detail on the drivers of cash net profit after tax, refer to the Financial performance section on pages 48-57.\n\n## Cash to statutory profit reconciliation\n\nStatutory net profit after tax includes the following non-cash items:\n\n|                                                                           | Continuing operations   | Continuing operations   | Total including   discontinued operations   | Total including   discontinued operations   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                           | FY21                    | FY20 1                  | FY21                                        | FY20 1                                      |\n| Net profit after tax - cash basis                                         | 8,653                   | 7,225                   | 8,801                                       | 7,407                                       |\n| Gain/(loss) on acquisition, disposal, closure and demerger  of businesses | 183                     | 70                      | 1,373                                       | 2,092                                       |\n| Hedging and IFRS volatility                                               | 7                       | 93                      | 7                                           | 93                                          |\n| Net profit after tax statutory basis                                      | 8,843                   | 7,388                   | 10,181                                      | 9,592                                       |\n\n- 1  Comparative information has been restated.

To qualify as an economic hedge, the terms and/or risk profile must match or be substantially the same as the underlying exposure.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Australian home loan balance growth of 7% was above the market growth.\n\nBusiness and corporate loans increased 1%, primarily driven by domestic business lending growth across property, agriculture and health industries, while continuing to support Australian businesses with 12,600 additional loans funded under the Government's SME Guarantee Scheme. This was partly o/ffset by a decline in institutional lending balances due to continued focus on risk adjusted returns.\n\nDeposits increased $64 billion or 9%, primarily driven by continued growth in transaction and savings deposits, partly o/ffset by lower investment deposits. The increase in transaction and savings deposits was driven by increased domestic money supply, growth in mortgage o/ffset accounts and customer preference for at-call deposits in the low interest rate environment.\n\nDebt issues decreased $40 billion or 28%, reflecting lower wholesale funding requirements due to growth in deposits and funding available under the RBA Term Funding Facility.\n\nTerm funding from central banks increased $50 billion, primarily driven by the drawdown of the RBA Term Funding Facility.\n\n|                                             | As at     | As at       | As at   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|---------|\n| Total Group assets and liabilities ($m)     | 30 Jun 21 | 30 Jun 20 1 | change  |\n| Home loans                                  | 579,756   | 542,881     | 7%      |\n| Consumer finance                            | 16,997    | 18,217      | (7%)    |\n| Business and corporate loans                | 220,703   | 218,126     | 1%      |\n| Total Group lending                         | 817,456   | 779,224     | 5%      |\n| Other assets (including held for sale)      | 274,506   | 236,247     | 16%     |\n| Total assets                                | 1,091,962 | 1,015,471   | 8%      |\n| Deposits                                    | 764,502   | 700,846     | 9%      |\n| Debt issues                                 | 103,003   | 142,503     | (28%)   |\n| Term funding from central banks             | 51,856    | 1,500       | large   |\n| Other liabilities (including held for sale) | 93,883    | 98,684      | (5%)    |\n| Total liabilities                           | 1,013,244 | 943,533     | 7%      |\n\nFurther information and analysis of the financial performance of the Group for the financial year ended 30 June 2021 can be found in the Financial performance section on pages 48-57 of this Annual Report. Details on our risk management framework, material risk types and approach to managing them can be found in the Overview (pages 2-9), How we create value section (pages 10-77), including the Managing our strategic risks section (pages 42-47) of this Annual Report. These sections also include a description of the material trends in our current external operating context and more information on our business strategies and prospects for future financial years.\n\nOther than the information included in the operating and financial review and throughout this Annual Report by cross reference, information on other likely developments, business strategies and prospects for future financial years of the Group's operations has not been included in this report as it would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the Group.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDetails of dividends paid and dividends determined are outlined in Note 8.4 in the Financial report on pages 202-203.\n\n## Litigation and regulatory matters\n\nConsistent with an industry-wide trend, there has been an increase in litigation and regulatory proceedings against the Group. The proceedings include:\n\n- \u00b7  the defence of eleven class actions, two of which were commenced in financial year 2021. These include two separate shareholder class action proceedings, four class action claims in relation to superannuation products, a class action that was commenced by Bankwest customers, a class action in relation to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans, two class actions related to financial advice, as well as a class action commenced in the United States relating to the BBSW benchmark; and\n- \u00b7  five ASIC civil penalty proceedings currently underway against CBA or a Group entity, and one further civil penalty proceeding determined by the Court in October 2020.\n\nThere are also a number of ongoing matters where regulators are investigating whether CBA or a Group entity has breached legal or regulatory obligations. Where a breach has occurred, regulators are likely to impose, or apply to a Court for, fines and/ or other sanctions. These matters include investigations of issues which were considered by the Financial Services Royal Commission, as well as a number of other matters notified to, or identified by, regulators. The Group is also party to four enforceable undertakings with a regulator and continues to receive various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews.\n\nIn addition to possible regulatory actions and reviews, there may also be financial exposure to claims by customers, third parties and shareholders and this could include further class actions, customer remediation or claims for compensation. The outcomes and total costs associated with such regulatory actions and reviews, and possible claims remain uncertain.\n\nThe Board continues to monitor each of these actions, investigations and reviews. CBA also continues to engage with its regulators in relation to the matters under investigation.\n\nFor further information about some of the more significant litigation and regulatory matters referred to above, refer to Note 7.1 in the Financial report on pages 189-193.\n\n## Change in state of a/ffairs\n\nSignificant changes in the state of a/ffairs of the Group during the financial year include:\n\n- \u00b7  Changes in the nature of principal activities outlined in the Building simpler, better foundations section on page 78.\n- \u00b7  Changes to the Board as outlined in the Our approach to governance section on pages 67-77.\n\nOther than the changes outlined above and discussed in this Annual Report, there have been no other significant changes in the state of a/ffairs during the financial year.\n\n## Events subsequent to reporting date\n\nThe Bank expects the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) for the final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2021 will be satisfied in full by an on-market purchase of shares of approximately $557 million.\n\nOn 13 May 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to sell a 55% interest in Colonial First State (CFS) to KKR. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in the second half of calendar year 2021. As a result of changes to the fee structures of certain CFS products and other impacts to the earnings of CFS associated with its separation from the Group, the Group and KKR have agreed to amend certain financial terms of the sale subsequent to 30 June 2021, including to the originally expected proceeds of $1.7 billion. These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the financial outcomes from the transaction.\n\nOn 28 July 2021, the Group entered into an agreement with AIA Australia for a partial transfer of the Commonwealth Financial Planning (CFP) business to AIA Financial Services Limited. The transaction is expected to complete in the second half of calendar year 2021. The Group expects to recognise a post-tax loss of approximately $52 million mainly resulting from the write-down of assets to fair value less cost to sell.\n\nOn 11 August 2021, the Bank announced its intention to undertake an o/ff-market buy-back of up to $6 billion of shares. Shareholder participation in the buy-back is voluntary. The Bank reserves the right to vary, suspend or terminate the buy-back at any time.\n\nThere remains significant uncertainty regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve, including the duration of the pandemic, the severity of the downturn and the speed of economic recovery. In accordance with AASB 110 Events after the Reporting Period , the Group considered whether events after the reporting period confirmed conditions existing before the reporting date. Consideration was given to the macro-economic impact of lockdowns implemented across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, the closure of state borders, and the extension of further government support measures. The Group did not identify any subsequent events precipitated by COVID-19 related developments, which would require adjustment to the amounts or disclosures in the financial statements. Further, no other material non-adjusting subsequent events relating to COVID-19 were identified requiring disclosure in the financial statements. Given the fluid nature of the current situation, the Group will continue to regularly review forward looking assumptions and forecast economic scenarios.\n\nThe Directors are not aware of any other matter or circumstance that has occurred since 30 June 2021, that has significantly a/ffected or may significantly a/ffect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations or the state of a/ffairs of the Group in subsequent financial years.\n\n## Environmental reporting\n\nWe are subject to the Federal Government's National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) scheme. The scheme makes it mandatory for controlling corporations to report annually on greenhouse gas emissions, energy production and energy consumption, if they exceed certain threshold levels. Our NGER submission is independently audited and submitted before the deadline to ensure that the Group meets the NGER requirements.\n\nWe do not believe that we are subject to any other significant environment reporting regulations under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory of Australia. Our environmental policies are updated to manage risks appropriately.\n\n- + For more information on our voluntary environmental reporting, see the Our approach to climate change section on pages 22-33 and our environmental metrics on pages 60-61.\n\n## Modern slavery reporting\n\nWe are subject to Australia's Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth) and we published our first modern slavery statement in compliance with this legislation during the 2021 financial year. This statement details the actions taken in the 2020 financial year to identify, manage and mitigate the risk of exposing people to modern slavery in our supply chain and through our business operations. This disclosure builds upon our annual compliance with the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 since publishing our first modern slavery and human tra/fficking statement in 2016.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Loans and other transactions\n\n110\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nThe performance of the Group in a challenging year has been strong and the Bank's leadership team remain focused on supporting our people, customers and the communities we serve.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the 2021 Remuneration Report.\n\nThroughout the financial year, we faced significant uncertainty both in terms of the health crisis and the economy. Australia continues to navigate the crisis directly impacting our people, customers and communities. In this challenging context, the Group has performed strongly for shareholders, maintained our 'unquestionably strong' capital position, adapted to new ways of working, embedded our cultural and risk transformation and importantly, continues to focus on supporting Australia's recovery.\n\n## Changes to the executive remuneration framework\n\nLast year, the Board reviewed the executive remuneration framework to ensure it attracts and retains exceptional talent, meets the spirit of anticipated regulatory change, aligns with shareholders and is fit for purpose for the years ahead. Highlights of these changes include reducing total remuneration opportunity by 19%, reducing the cash opportunity by 12%, and increasing the maximum vesting period to support sustainable performance and ownership.\n\nPerformance continues to be assessed across core financial and non-financial outcomes, and reflects both individual and collective accountabilities and priorities.\n\nThe redesigned long-term remuneration arrangement better aligns with the shareholder experience and responds to the requirements of the new Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) regulatory standard on remuneration (CPS 511). Our new long-term alignment remuneration (LTAR) component is subject to a pre-grant assessment focused on future financial and non-financial drivers of performance and our long-term variable remuneration (LTVR) component is linked to relative total shareholder return performance. Together, they support a focus on accountability and sustaining superior and positive returns over time.\n\nExtended vesting periods (an additional three years for the CEO) reflect longer risk and performance horizons, which are supported by enhanced malus and new clawback requirements. This ensures executives are held accountable for sustainable outcomes, and that there are consequences in the event of serious risk issues or misconduct. The Group continues to enhance our risk, remuneration and consequence management frameworks.\n\nFurther detail on the remuneration framework (including a comparison to the previous framework) can be found on pages 86 and 87 of the Remuneration Report.\n\n## Performance and remuneration outcomes for the 2021 financial year\n\nThis year's remuneration outcomes are the first under our new executive remuneration framework. The Board believes the 2021 framework and the outcomes achieved under it, support and reflect positive customer outcomes and sustainable, balanced returns for shareholders.\n\nWhile initial targets were set in July 2020 in the midst of economic uncertainty, we have taken a dynamic approach over the year to monitor and review targets as economic conditions evolved. We recalibrated cash net profit after tax (NPAT) targets to normalise for original loan impairment expense (LIE) assumptions, resulting in a 13.6% increase to Group NPAT targets set at the start of the year. Looking back, the Board confirms that the increases set for financial targets were stretching in the context of the operating environment.\n\nThe Group achieved NPAT of $8,801 million. This was above expectations and above both the initial and recalibrated target.\n\nOur performance on customer, reputation and employee outcomes, and execution of strategy has been similarly strong, with our reputation score, measured via RepTrak, at its highest level in four years. A full breakdown of performance outcomes can be found on page 93.\n\nThe CEO's short-term variable remuneration (STVR) outcome for the 2021 financial year reflects the Group's strong financial and non-financial performance, and his final STVR outcome is 87% of maximum.\n\nSTVR outcomes for the Group Executives and CEO ASB ranged between 76% and 90% of maximum, with an average of 85%. These outcomes are inclusive of STVR risk adjustments applied to one of 10 Executives.\n\nThe 2018 financial year LTVR award reached the end of its four-year performance period on 30 June 2021 with 87.5% vesting overall. See page 94 for further details.\n\nThe 2021 financial year saw the introduction of the new LTAR award enabling greater alignment of executive interests with those of shareholders. The LTAR grants will be realised for the CEO in tranches over four and five years and four years for other Executives. The Board conducted a pre-grant assessment for the CEO and Executives to consider individual non-financial performance factors, the operating environment, and future outlook. The Board determined that all factors were satisfactorily met and no reduction was required to any individual LTAR grant allocation. Refer to pages 94 and 97 for more detail on the pre-grant assessment.\n\nRemuneration outcomes reflect the strong performance of the Bank's leadership team against the backdrop of a challenging environment and ongoing support to our customers, our people and the communities we serve.\n\n## Culture, accountability and remuneration\n\nThe Board's focus on enhancing risk management and culture has continued to be a priority. Further enhancements to remuneration governance through clearer application of accountability and remuneration consequence has ensured that the remuneration framework appropriately responds to performance and risk scenarios. Further details on risk and remuneration consequences can be found on page 106.\n\nWe have made significant progress in implementing changes following the APRA Prudential Inquiry, recognised by APRA with the operational risk capital overlay having been reduced by 50% or $500 million. All Remedial Action Plan milestones have been delivered as of 30 June 2021 as we move into a period of transition and sustainability.\n\nThe Board would also like to acknowledge the final Sedgwick Review into product sales commissions and product-based payments in retail banking in Australia and the role these recommendations have played as a catalyst for positive industry change in support of better customer outcomes. As a Group we remain committed to sustaining both the spirit and letter of the recommendations to continue to support and enhance our customer centric culture.\n\n## Future focus\n\nWhile there will continue to be challenges and uncertainty in the year ahead, we are committed to ensuring that our performance and remuneration approach supports positive customer outcomes, fair and equitable outcomes for our people, and delivery of sustainable value creation for our shareholders.\n\nThe new CBA Enterprise Agreement will come into effect during the 2022 financial year, providing our people with a simpler and better agreement.\n\nThe Board will continue to monitor our performance and remuneration policy and frameworks to ensure they remain fit for purpose, support the Group's strategy, deliver on the intended design and meet or exceed evolving regulatory requirements.\n\nI invite you to read the Remuneration Report and welcome your feedback.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPaul O'Malley\n\nPeople & Remuneration Committee/uni00A0Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

The role of the People & Remuneration Committee is to review, challenge, assess and, as appropriate, endorse the recommendations made by management for Board approval. The Board reviews, challenges, applies judgement and, as appropriate, approves the People & Remuneration Committee's recommendations.\n\nThe People & Remuneration Committee met formally six times during the 2021 financial year with the following members (as at 30 June 2021): Paul O'Malley (Chairman), Catherine Livingstone AO, Mary Padbury and Genevieve Bell AO.\n\nThe responsibilities of the People & Remuneration Committee are outlined in its Charter and reviewed annually.\n\n## + The Charter is available at commbank.com.au/peopleandremuneration\n\nAs part of the performance and risk review, and to support the determination of remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Group Executives, the People & Remuneration Committee met concurrently with the Risk & Compliance, Audit, and Nominations Committees in February and June 2021. These concurrent meetings provided an opportunity for the Committees to review and discuss relevant risk and audit matters that may warrant consideration in the People & Remuneration Committee's determination of remuneration outcomes, including any in-year or malus adjustments for the CEO and Group Executives (including former Group Executives) and the determination of the Group-wide STVR pool.\n\nInformation provided to the concurrent meetings supports determinations of collective and/or individual remuneration impacts and includes risk scorecards for the CEO and Group Executives, details of material risk matters, outcomes of internal audit reviews conducted during the year, and consideration of the quality of CBA's financial results.\n\nThe Risk & Remuneration Review Committee, a management Committee that advises the Group CRO, oversees assessment of accountability for material risk matters, including those impacting CBA's reputation, and application of remuneration adjustments as appropriate for Executive General Managers and below levels.\n\n## External advisors\n\nDuring the 2021 financial year, external advisors were engaged by management to provide information to the People & Remuneration Committee to assist with making remuneration decisions. The People & Remuneration Committee did not seek or receive any remuneration recommendations from external advisors in the 2021 financial year.\n\n## Group financial performance\n\n## Remuneration outcomes reflect short and long-term performance\n\nThe graphs and table below illustrate the relationship between Executive remuneration outcomes and the Group's financial performance over the past five financial years (including the 2021 financial year).\n\n## STVR scorecard measure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## LTVR TSR measure\n\n| Remuneration outcomes                | 30 Jun 17   | 30 Jun 18   | 30 Jun 18   | 30 Jun 19   | 30 Jun 20 30 Jun 21   |    |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|----|\n| STVR  outcome (average % of maximum) | 0%  1       | 19%  2      | 44%         | 60%         | 85%  3                |    |\n| LTVR  vesting outcome (% of maximum) | 67%         | 24%         | 24%         | 84%         | 87.5%                 |    |\n\n- 1 The STVR outcomes for the CEO and Group Executives were adjusted downwards to zero, reflecting collective accountability for the overall reputation of the Group and risk and reputation matters.\n- 2 As a consequence of the APRA Prudential Inquiry Report, the Board applied a negative adjustment of 20% to the 2018 financial year performance scorecard outcomes for each current Group Executive and assessed individual risk outcomes as partially met to reflect collective accountability for the APRA Prudential Inquiry Report findings. Further negative risk adjustments to STVR outcomes were also made in respect of certain individual Group Executives to reflect individual accountability for other risk and reputation matters separate from the APRA Prudential Inquiry Report findings.\n- 3 Maximum STVR reduced from 150% to 125% of target for 2021 financial year impacting year-on-year comparisons of STVR outcome as a % of maximum.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes snapshot\n\n## CEO remuneration\n\n## Group Executive and CEO ASB remuneration\n\nFixed Remuneration 1\n\nFR increase\n\nShort-Term Variable Remuneration\n\nSTVR % of maximum\n\nTotal remuneration received\n\n4.5%\n\n87%\n\n$5.2m\n\nLong-Term Alignment Remuneration\n\n100% of LTAR was granted following the pre-grant assessment and will not be realised until 30 June 2024\n\n## Long-Term Variable Remuneration\n\nFY18 LTVR which reached the end of its performance period on 30 June 2021\n\n87.5% of the award vested\n\n- 1 In combination with the reduced total remuneration opportunity and rebalanced pay-mix under the current Executive remuneration framework, an increase of up to 4.5% in fixed remuneration has been applied to the CEO and most Executives.\n- 2 Also reflects market-related adjustments.\n\nFR average increase 2\n\nSTVR % of maximum\n\n5.1%\n\n76% to 90%\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deferred STVR shares/rights represents STVR previously awarded under the Group Executive or Executive General Manager arrangements in prior years. LTVR performance rights are subject to performance hurdles. Deferred shares/ rights, LTAR restricted share units, LTVR performance rights and sign-on equity are unvested as at 30 June 2021. The maximum potential outcome for unvested awards are subject to CBA share price at time of vesting.\n- 2 Represents the maximum number of equity awards that may vest to each Executive in respect of their time as KMP. The values represent the fair value at grant date. The minimum potential outcome for the equity awards is zero. Approval was given for the granting of the CEO's 2021 financial year LTAR and LTVR awards at the 2020 Annual General Meeting.\n- 3 Awards that vested include the 2017 financial year LTVR award (granted 22 February 2017), deferred STVR awards (vested in full) (tranches granted 1 September 2017, 1 September 2018, and 1 September 2019) and sign-on shares/rights (granted 1 October 2018, 5 November 2018 and 31 January 2020) that vested during time in KMP role. The value of the awards vested is calculated using VWACP for the five trading days preceding the vesting date, and includes the value of dividends accrued over the vesting period on rights.

There were three risk-related adjustments to the Executive Leadership Team STVR outcomes in the 2021 financial year. Remuneration adjustments for remaining employees in relation to the 2021 financial year will be finalised in September 2021 in line with the CBA-wide annual remuneration review process and will be outlined in the 2022 Remuneration Report.\n\n|                                                        | 2020 financial year                                         | 2019 financial year                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees rated 'exceptionally  managed' for risk      | 451 employees                                               | 500 employees                                                |\n| Employees rated 'partially met'  or 'not met' for risk | 2,612 employees   (including 34 General Managers and above) | 4,515 employees   (including 121 General Managers and above) |\n\nCBA's consequence management framework was further embedded in the current financial year, with instances of unacceptable conduct resulting in termination. In the 2021 financial year, there were 1,825 of substantiated unacceptable conduct, including 11 senior leaders (General Managers and Executive General Managers), with 105 resulting in termination.\n\nEnhancements to CBA's risk assessment process and remuneration framework through guidance, procedures and governance continue to be a priority for the Board, including reinforcing the Board's expectations for managing risks in support of a positive risk culture.\n\n## Risk assessment in performance\n\nCBA's performance and remuneration frameworks support and promote the mitigation of risks by holding individuals accountable for managing risks relating to their role and not complying with the Group's Code of Conduct, including policies such as Group Mandatory Learning. These frameworks also support collective accountability for managing risks.\n\nGroup-wide risk assessment guidance including examples is continually enhanced to help people leaders consistently assess risk behaviours and outcomes, determine the appropriate level of STVR adjustments for not fully meeting expectations, and document the reasons for their assessment.\n\nExecutive risk assessments continue to be supported by comprehensive reporting, independent assessment by the Chief Risk Officer, and Concurrent meetings as part of the interim and annual performance assessment processes.\n\nSTVR outcomes have been reduced by a minimum of 10% for 'partially met' ratings since the 2019 financial year and ranged up to 100% for 'not met'. In the 2020 financial year, 2,612 employees received a 'partially met' or 'not met' risk assessment rating with a resulting STVR reduction between 10% and 100%.\n\nMalus adjustments have also been made to unvested deferred variable remuneration in relation to poor risk outcomes and/or misconduct. In the 2020 financial year, impacted employees received malus adjustments ranging from 20% to 100% as a result of poor risk outcomes, including to a former Executive's deferred awards.\n\nComprehensive reporting is provided to the Board to support its oversight of risk assessment and STVR outcomes and to assist informing the Board's guidance for the 2021 performance and remuneration review.\n\n## Risk culture\n\n## The variable remuneration and consequences management structures\n\nDesigned to clearly articulate and reinforce behaviours supporting the disciplined management of risks as aligned to our target risk culture. The maturity of our risk culture continues to be assessed via the annual Board Risk Culture Assessment. The process, design and application of variable remuneration and consequences are an important influence on risk.\n\n## The Recognition Award\n\nFirst introduced in 2019, continues to recognise and reward employees rated 'exceptionally managed' for risk, whose risk behaviours and outcomes are considered exemplary. In 2020, 75 employees received CEO recognition and an additional reward to acknowledge their outstanding contribution to the positive risk culture of the Group.\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\n- \u00b7 Guidance and enhanced procedures to support the application of malus (the ability to reduce, postpone and/or lapse granted variable remuneration), have been implemented across CBA during the 2021 financial year.\n- \u00b7 Clawback (the recovery of variable remuneration that has been paid or vested) can be applied to all CEO and Group Executive variable remuneration from the 2021 financial year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-Executive Director arrangements\n\nThe table below outlines the Non-Executive Directors for the financial year ended 30 June 2021. From 1 July 2019, Non-Executive Directors are required to hold CBA shares equivalent to 100% of Board Chairman fees for the Chairman and 100% of Board member fees for Non-Executive Directors.

This is to be accumulated within five years based on base Board member fees or Board Chairman fees as at 1 July 2019 or date of appointment, whichever is later.\n- 3 Peter Harmer was appointed as Non-Executive Director effective 1 March 2021.\n- 4 Simon Moutter was appointed as Non-Executive Director effective 1 September 2020.\n- 5 Wendy Stops retired from the Group effective 13 October 2020.\n\n## Non-Executive Director fees\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive fees as compensation for their work on the Board and the associated Committees on which they serve. Non-Executive Directors do not receive any performance-related remuneration. The total amount of Non-Executive Directors' fees is capped at a maximum fee pool that is approved by shareholders. The current fee pool is $4.75 million, which was approved by shareholders at CBA's 2015 Annual General Meeting on 17 November 2015.\n\nThe following table outlines the Non-Executive Directors' fees for the Board and the Committees as at 30 June 2021. There has been no change to Board fees during the 2021 financial year. Fees are inclusive of base fees and statutory superannuation. The Chairman does not receive separate Committee fees.\n\n| Board/Committee                                          | Chairman  $   | Member  $   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Board                                                    | 870,000       | 242,000     |\n| Audit Committee                                          | 65,000        | 32,500      |\n| Risk & Compliance Committee                              | 65,000        | 32,500      |\n| People & Remuneration Committee                          | 60,000        | 30,000      |\n| Nominations Committee 1                                  | -             | 11,600      |\n| United Kingdom Remuneration Assurance Committee (UK RAC) | 30,000        | 18,000      |\n\n- 1 The Chairman of the Board is also the Chairman of the Nominations Committee, Chairman does not receive an additional Chairman fee for Nominations Committee.\n- 2 Board members who also serve as members of the UK receive fees in relation to that service, and these fees are set appropriately below fees for UK RAC independent members given a small portion of UK RAC matters overlap with People & Remuneration Committee matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The reasons for this are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7  the e/ffective operation of the Group External Auditor Services Policy during the year to restrict the nature of non-audit services engagements, to prohibit certain services and to require Audit Committee pre-approval for all such engagements; and\n- \u00b7  the relative quantum of fees paid for non-audit services compared to the quantum for audit, and audit-related services was appropriate.\n\nThe above Directors' statements are in accordance with the advice received from the Audit Committee.\n\n## Incorporation of additional material\n\nThe following sections of this report form part of the Directors' report and should be read in conjunction:\n\n- \u00b7  Directors' shareholdings, share rights and options can be found on pages 102 and 109; and\n- \u00b7  the Remuneration report can be found on pages 84-110.\n\nThis Directors' report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCatherine Livingstone AO\n\nChairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMatt Comyn\n\nManaging Director and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n11 August 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 1.1 General information, basis of accounting, changes in accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Impact of coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the measures undertaken to contain it continue to impact the global economic outlook. The impact of COVID-19 continues to evolve and remains a source of estimation uncertainty. The Group has carefully  considered  its  impact  in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2021, including the application of critical estimates and judgements. The key impacts on the financial statements are discussed below.\n\n## Provisions for impairment\n\nThe Group's AASB 9 impairment methodology remains unchanged but the Group has incorporated estimates, assumptions and judgements specific to the impact of COVID-19 in the measurement of expected credit losses (ECL). Refer to Note 3.2.\n\n## Assessment of impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe Group assessed Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, and assets held as lessor for indicators of impairment. Due to the prolonged impact of COVID-19 on the global aviation sector and the protraction of international travel restrictions, an impairment loss of $112 million was recognised during the year ended 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: $81 million), and is presented within Other banking income. In determining the value in use of the aircraft, the Group incorporates the cash inflows over the lease term, as well as the expected selling price on expiry of the lease. Continued market disruption across the aviation industry, lower demand for  used aircraft, and a decline in asset prices, resulted in a reduction in the assets' expected recoverable values below their carrying values. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the severity of the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation sector, and the duration of restrictions on international travel.\n\nAs there is a higher than usual degree of uncertainty associated with these assumptions and estimates, actual outcomes may differ to those forecast which may impact the accounting estimates included in these financial statements.\n\n## Changes in comparatives\n\n## Discontinued operations\n\nThe financial results of businesses reclassified as discontinued operations are excluded from the results of the continuing operations and are presented as a single line item Net profit/(loss) after tax from discontinued operations in the Income Statement, and Other comprehensive income/(expense) from discontinued operations in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.\n\nThe Income Statements and the Statements of Comprehensive Income for comparative periods are also restated. Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations subject to disposal have been presented on the Balance Sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. The Balance Sheet is not restated when a business is reclassified as a discontinued operation.\n\n## Re-segmentation\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group made a number of structural changes to its operating segments. This includes the transfer of Commonwealth Private out of the Business Banking division and consolidation into the Retail Banking Services division in order to better serve our customers, and align distribution channels and core product offerings. There were also other re-segmentations, allocations and reclassifications, including refinements to the allocation of support units and other costs. These changes have not impacted the Group's net profit, but have resulted in changes to the presentation of the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet of the affected segments. These changes have been applied retrospectively.\n\n## Prior period restatements\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group implemented the following changes that were applied retrospectively and impacted the prior years' financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group performed a review of the historic accounting treatment of a transaction product arrangement comprised of both loan and deposit balances and concluded that, under AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation , the credit balances cannot be netted against the debit balances drawn under the arrangement;\n- \u00b7 the Group revised its allocation approach for certain centrally incurred costs impacting continuing and discontinued operations; and\n- \u00b7 as part of its broad review of employee entitlements discussed in Note 7.1, the Group finalised remediation amounts required to be paid to impacted employees in relation to a number of historic employee entitlements calculations.\n\nThe impact of these changes on the prior years' financial statements of the Group and the Bank was as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 an increase in loans, bills discounted and other receivables as at 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $1,433 million and $1,380 million, respectively;\n- \u00b7 an increase in deposits and public borrowings as at 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $1,433 million and $1,380 million, respectively;\n- \u00b7 an increase in provisions as at 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $53 million and $46 million, respectively;\n- \u00b7 an increase in deferred tax asset as at 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $15 million and $13 million, respectively;\n- \u00b7 an increase in the Group's operating expenses for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $48 million and $67 million, respectively (Bank: an increase in operating expenses for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $7 million);\n- \u00b7 a decrease in the Group's income tax expense for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $14 million and $20 million, respectively (Bank: a decrease in income tax expense for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $2 million);\n- \u00b7 an increase in the Group's net profit from discontinued operations after tax for the years ended 30 June 2020 and 2019 of $29 million and $42 million, respectively; and\n- \u00b7 a decrease in the Group's and the Bank's retained earnings as at 1 July 2018 of $28 million.\n\nWhere relevant, comparative information has been restated and changes have been footnoted throughout the financial statements.\n\n122\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n- 1.1 General information, basis of accounting, changes in accounting policies (continued)\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\n## Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arrangements\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group revised its accounting policy in relation to configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing software-as-a-service (SaaS) arrangements with cloud providers. The change in accounting policy resulted from the implementation of agenda decisions issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) clarifying its interpretation of how current accounting standards apply to these types of arrangements.\n\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the cloud provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received.\n\nThe change has been applied retrospectively and impacted the prior year financial statements of the Group and the Bank as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a decrease in the Group's intangible assets as at 30 June 2020 of $53 million (Bank: a decrease of $43 million);\n- \u00b7 an increase in the Group's deferred tax assets as at 30 June 2020 of $16 million (Bank: an increase of $13 million);\n- \u00b7 an increase in the Group's operating expenses for the year ended 30 June 2020 of $53 million (Bank: an increase of $43 million); and\n- \u00b7 a decrease in the Group's tax expense for the year ended 30 June 2020 of $16 million (Bank: a decrease of $13 million).\n\nWhere relevant, comparative information has been restated and changes have been footnoted throughout the financial statements.\n\n## Adoption of amendments to existing standards\n\nThe following amendments to existing standards were adopted during the current year but did not have an impact on the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 AASB 3 Business Combinations was amended to clarify the definition of a business to assist entities to determine whether a transaction should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition;\n- \u00b7 AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements and AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors was amended, together with consequential amendments to other standards, in order to clarify and use a consistent definition of materiality;\n- \u00b7 The Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting covers all aspects of standard setting from the objective of financial reporting, to presentation and disclosures. Its purpose is to assist the IASB in developing standards, to help preparers develop consistent accounting policies if there is no applicable standard in place, and to assist all parties to understand and interpret the standards; and\n- \u00b7 In line with early adopting COVID-19-related rent concession amendments to AASB 16 Leases in the prior financial year, the Group elected to early adopt subsequent editorial and transitional relief amendments relating to these arrangements.\n\nOther minor amendments to existing standards were adopted in the current reporting period.\n\n123\n\nA\n\nDD\n\nI\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\nA\n\nL\n\nI\n\nN\n\nF\n\nO\n\nRM\n\nA\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net interest income is derived from the difference between interest earned on lending and investment assets and interest incurred on customer deposits and wholesale debt raised to fund these assets.\n\nThe Group further generates income from lending fees and commissions, general insurance products and trading activities. It also incurs costs associated with running the business such as staff, occupancy and technology related expenses.\n\nOur Performance section provides details of the main contributors to the Group's returns and analysis of its financial performance by business segments and geographic regions.\n\n## 2.1 Net interest income\n\n|                                                    | Group        | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                    | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 19 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Interest income                                    |              |              |              |              |              |\n| Effective interest income:                         |              |              |              |              |              |\n| Loans and bills discounted                         | 23,919       | 28,144       | 31,449       | 21,229       | 24,830       |\n| Other financial institutions                       | 16           | 110          | 181          | 13           | 105          |\n| Cash and liquid assets                             | 59           | 356          | 572          | 49           | 335          |\n| Investment securities:                             |              |              |              |              |              |\n| At amortised cost                                  | 48           | 114          | 199          | 48           | 114          |\n| At fair value through Other Comprehensive Income   | 406          | 1,002        | 1,688        | 353          | 911          |\n| Controlled entities                                | -            | -            | -            | 108          | 356          |\n| Total effective interest income                    | 24,448       | 29,726       | 34,089       | 21,800       | 26,651       |\n| Other:                                             |              |              |              |              |              |\n| Assets at fair value through Income Statement      | 210          | 436          | 620          | 210          | 436          |\n| Controlled entities                                | -            | -            | -            | 31           | 49           |\n| Total other interest income                        | 210          | 436          | 620          | 241          | 485          |\n| Total interest income                              | 24,658       | 30,162       | 34,709       | 22,041       | 27,136       |\n| Interest expense                                   |              |              |              |              |              |\n| Deposits                                           | 3,641        | 7,304        | 9,965        | 2,799        | 5,851        |\n| Other financial institutions                       | 57           | 391          | 464          | 56           | 382          |\n| Liabilities at fair value through Income Statement | 37           | 74           | 172          | 25           | 66           |\n| Term funding from central banks                    | 43           | -            | -            | 43           | -            |\n| Debt issues                                        | 960          | 2,529        | 4,563        | 603          | 1,877        |\n| Loan capital                                       | 661          | 825          | 951          | 650          | 811          |\n| Lease liabilities                                  | 82           | 71           | -            | 72           | 63           |\n| Bank levy                                          | 338          | 358          | 370          | 338          | 358          |\n| Controlled entities                                | -            | -            | -            | 965          | 1,252        |\n| Total interest expense                             | 5,819        | 11,552       | 16,485       | 5,551        | 10,660       |\n| Net interest income                                | 18,839       | 18,610       | 18,224       | 16,490       | 16,476       |\n\n124\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 2.1 Net interest income (continued)\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nInterest income and interest expense on financial assets and liabilities measured at amortised cost, and debt financial assets measured at fair value through OCI, are recognised using the effective interest method. Interest income recognition for these categories of financial assets depends on the expected credit losses (ECL) stage they are allocated to in accordance with the Group's ECL methodology. For financial assets classified within Stage 1 and Stage 2 interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount of the assets. Interest income on financial assets in Stage 3 is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the gross carrying amount net of provisions for impairment. For details on the Group's ECL methodology refer to Note 3.2.\n\nFees, transaction costs and issue costs integral to financial assets and liabilities are capitalised and included in the interest recognised over the expected life of the instrument. This includes fees for providing a loan or a lease arrangement.\n\nInterest income on finance leases is recognised progressively over the life of the lease, consistent with the outstanding investment and unearned income balance.\n\nInterest income and expense on financial assets and liabilities that are classified at fair value through  the Income Statement are accounted for on a contractual rate basis and include amortisation of premium/discounts.\n\nInterest expense also includes payments made under a liquidity facility arrangement with the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Major Bank Levy (Bank Levy) expense and other financing charges.\n\n125\n\n<!-- image -->",

The tables list the major categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities of the Group together with the respective interest earned or paid and the average interest rate for each of the full years ended 30 June 2021, 30 June 2020 and 30 June 2019. Interest is accounted for based on product yield. Where assets or liabilities are hedged, the amounts are  shown net of the hedge, but  individual items not separately hedged may be affected by movements in exchange rates and interest rates. The overseas component comprises overseas branches of the Bank and overseas domiciled controlled entities. Non-accrual loans are included in interest earning assets under Loans, bills discounted and other receivables.

Volume variances reflect the change in interest from the prior year due to movement in the average balance. Rate variances reflect the change in interest from the prior year due to changes in interest rates. Volume and rate variance for total interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have been calculated separately (rather than being the sum of the individual categories).\n\n|                                                          | June 2021 vs June 2020   | June 2021 vs June 2020   | June 2021 vs June 2020   | Rate Total June 2020 vs June 2019   | Rate Total June 2020 vs June 2019   | Rate Total June 2020 vs June 2019   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Changes in net interest income: Volume and rate analysis | Volume $M                | Rate $M                  | Total $M                 | Volume $M                           | $M                                  | $M                                  |\n| Interest earning assets                                  |                          |                          |                          |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Cash and liquid assets                                   |                          |                          |                          |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Australia                                                | 12                       | (218)                    | (206)                    | 53                                  | (176)                               | (123)                               |\n| Overseas                                                 | 1                        | (92)                     | (91)                     | 11                                  | (104)                               | (93)                                |\n| Receivables from financial institutions                  |                          |                          |                          |                                     |                                     |                                     |\n| Australia                                                | -

Annual fees are deferred on the Balance Sheet in Bills payable and other liabilities and recognised on a straight-line  basis over the year. Transaction based fees are charged and recognised at the time of the transaction;\n- \u00b7 commitment fees and fees in relation to guarantee arrangements are deferred and recognised over the life of the contractual arrangements;\n- \u00b7 fee  income  is  earned  for  providing  advisory  or  arrangement  services,  placement  and  underwriting  services.  These  fees  are recognised and charged when the related service is completed which is typically at the time of the transaction; and\n- \u00b7 trail commissions are recognised at the start of a contract when the performance obligation has been met, typically when a customer is introduced to a new product. The Group recognises  the net present value of expected future trail commission income. For investment referral services, the Group is unable to forecast the trail commission revenue in line with the highly probable test in AASB 15. Therefore, trail commission revenue on investment referral balances is recognised when received or paid.\n\nEstablishment fees on financing facilities are deferred and amortised to interest income over the expected life of the loan and are not recognised when the commitment is issued.\n\nTrading income represents both realised and unrealised gains and losses from changes in the fair value of trading assets, liabilities and derivatives, which are recognised in the period in which they arise.\n\nNet gain/(loss) on non-trading financial instruments includes realised gains and losses from non-trading financial assets and liabilities, as well as realised and unrealised gains and losses on non-trading derivatives that are held for risk management purposes.\n\nNet gain/(loss) on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between proceeds received and its carrying value.\n\nNet hedging ineffectiveness is measured on fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges.\n\nDividends received on non-trading equity investments are recognised on the ex-dividend date or when the right to receive payment is established.\n\nFunds management fees are recognised over the service period as the performance obligation is met and when it is probable that the revenue will be received.\n\nGeneral insurance premiums received and receivable are recognised as revenue when they are earned, based on actuarial assessment of the likely pattern in which risk will emerge. The portion not yet earned based on the pattern assessment is recognised as an unearned premium liability. Claims are recognised as an expense when the liability is established.\n\nThe Group equity accounts for its share of the profits or losses of associate or joint venture investments, net of impairment recognised. Dividends received are recognised as a reduction of the investment carrying amount.\n\nOther income includes rental income on operating leases which is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. This is offset by depreciation and impairment expense on the associated operating lease assets held by the Group.\n\nOther income also includes the impact of foreign currency revaluations for foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities. These assets and liabilities are retranslated at the spot rate at the  balance  sheet  date. Exchange differences arising upon settling or translating monetary items at different rates to those at which they were initially recognised or previously reported, are recognised in the Income Statement.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe amount of trail commission revenue is dependent on assumptions about the behavioural life of the underlying transaction generating the commission. Trail commission income is only recognised to the extent it is highly probable it will not reverse in future periods.\n\n132\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 2.4 Operating expenses\n\n|                                                                                        | 30 Jun 20 30 Jun 19 Group 1   | 30 Jun 20 30 Jun 19 Group 1   | 30 Jun 20 30 Jun 19 Group 1   | Bank 1       | Bank 1       |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                        | 30 Jun 21 $M                  | $M                            | $M                            | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Staff expenses                                                                         |                               |                               |                               |              |              |\n| Salaries and related on-costs                                                          | 5,506                         | 5,248                         | 5,231                         | 4,983        | 4,778        |\n| Share-based compensation                                                               | 100                           | 103                           | 96                            | 102          | 107          |\n| Superannuation                                                                         | 442                           | 409                           | 385                           | 433          | 403          |\n| Total staff expenses                                                                   | 6,048                         | 5,760                         | 5,712                         | 5,518        | 5,288        |\n| Occupancy and equipment expenses                                                       |                               |                               |                               |              |              |\n| Lease expenses  2                                                                      | 166                           | 165                           | 644                           | 166          | 153          |\n| Depreciation of property, plant and equipment                                          | 756                           | 726                           | 270                           | 671          | 651          |\n| Other occupancy expenses                                                               | 236                           | 167                           | 173                           | 202          | 139          |\n| Total occupancy and equipment expenses                                                 | 1,158                         | 1,058                         | 1,087                         | 1,039        | 943          |\n| Information technology services                                                        |                               |                               |                               |              |              |\n| Application maintenance and development                                                | 870                           | 662                           | 625                           | 917          | 709          |\n| Data processing                                                                        | 187                           | 182                           | 183                           | 183          | 177          |\n| Desktop                                                                                | 149                           | 118                           | 142                           | 149          | 102          |\n| Communications                                                                         | 174                           | 192                           | 217                           | 159          | 178          |\n| Amortisation of software assets  3                                                     | 530                           | 918                           | 585                           | 462          | 862          |\n| Software write-offs                                                                    | 9                             | 14                            | 13                            | -

Staff expenses are recognised over the period the employee renders the service. Long service leave is discounted to present value using assumptions relating to staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary.\n\nShare-based compensation includes plans  which may be both  cash or equity settled. Cash settled share-based remuneration is recognised as a liability and re-measured to fair value until settled. The changes in fair value are recognised as staff expenses. Equity settled remuneration is fair valued at the grant date and amortised to staff expenses over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in the Employee compensation reserve.\n\nSuperannuation  expense  includes  expenses  relating  to  defined  contribution  and  defined  benefit  superannuation  plans.  Defined contribution expense is recognised in the period the service is provided, whilst the defined benefit expense, which measures current and past service costs, is determined by an actuarial calculation.\n\nOccupancy and equipment expenses include depreciation which is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. The right-of-use assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset, with the depreciation presented within depreciation of Property, plant and equipment.\n\nIT services expenses are recognised as incurred when the related services are delivered, unless they qualify for capitalisation as computer software because they are identifiable and controlled in a way that allows future economic benefits to be obtained and others' access to those benefits can be restricted. Capitalised computer software assets are amortised over their estimated useful life.\n\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the cloud provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances, modifies or creates additional capability to existing on-premise systems and meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset.\n\nThe Group assesses, at each Balance Sheet date, useful lives and residual values and whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. If an asset's carrying value is greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount.\n\nOther expenses are recognised as the relevant service is rendered. Operating expenses related to provisions are recognised for present obligations arising from past events where a payment to settle the obligation is probable and can be reliably estimated.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nActuarial valuations of the Group's defined benefit superannuation plans' obligations are dependent on a series of assumptions set out in Note 10.2, including inflation rates, discount rates and salary growth rates. Changes in these assumptions impact the fair value of the plans' obligations, assets, superannuation expense and actuarial gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nMeasurements of the Group's share-based compensation is dependent on assumptions, including grant date fair values. Information on these is set out in Note 10.1.\n\nRefer to Note 6.2 for more information on the judgements and estimates associated with goodwill.\n\n134\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 2.5 Income tax expense\n\nThe income tax expense for the year is determined from the profit before income tax as follows:\n\n|                                                                                         | Group 1      | Group 1      | Group 1      | Bank 1       | Bank 1       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                                         | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 19 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Profit before income tax                                                                | 12,375       | 10,378       | 11,309       | 10,597       | 12,681       |\n| Prima facie income tax at 30%                                                           | 3,713        | 3,113        | 3,393        | 3,179        | 3,804        |\n| Effect of amounts which are non-deductible/(assessable) in  calculating taxable income: |              |              |              |              |              |\n| Taxation offsets and other dividend adjustments                                         | -            | -            | -            | (375)        | (1,416)      |\n| Offshore tax rate differential                                                          | (43)         | (16)         | (40)         | (10)         | 7            |\n| Offshore banking unit                                                                   | (2)          | (19)         | (32)         | (14)         | (20)         |\n| Effect of changes in tax rates                                                          | 11           | -            | 1            | 10           | -            |\n| Income tax under/(over) provided in previous years                                      | 24           | (53)         | (101)        | 20           | (39)         |\n| Loss on disposals                                                                       | (122)        | (74)         | -            | (191)        | (5)          |\n| Other                                                                                   | (49)         | 39           | 34           | 69           | 216          |\n| Total income tax expense                                                                | 3,532        | 2,990        | 3,255        | 2,688        | 2,547        |\n| Effective tax rate (%)                                                                  | 28. 5        | 28. 8        | 28. 8        | 25. 4        | 20. 1        |\n\n|                                                                    | Group 1      | Group 1      | Group 1      | Bank 1       | Bank 1       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Income tax expense attributable to profit from ordinary activities | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 19 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Australia                                                          |              |              |              |              |              |\n| Current tax expense                                                | 3,122        | 3,005        | 3,092        | 2,713        | 2,963        |\n| Deferred tax benefit                                               | (119)        | (572)        | (382)        | (177)        | (646)        |\n| Total Australia                                                    | 3,003        | 2,433        | 2,710        | 2,536        | 2,317        |\n| Overseas                                                           |              |              |              |              |              |\n| Current tax expense                                                | 568          | 577          | 464          | 185          | 161          |\n| Deferred tax (benefit)/expense                                     | (39)         | (20)         | 81           | (33)         | 69           |\n| Total Overseas                                                     | 529          | 557          | 545          | 152          | 230          |\n| Income tax expense attributable to profit from ordinary activities | 3,532        | 2,990        | 3,255        | 2,688        | 2,547        |\n\n- 1  Comparative information has been restated to reflect the change in accounting policy and the prior period restatements detailed in Note 1.1.\n\n135\n\n<!-- image -->",

Of this, $6 million will expire on 31 December 2021 and the remaining tax losses of $33 million do not expire under the current tax legislation. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these tax losses because it is not considered probable that future taxable profit will be available against which they can be realised.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nThe Bank has recognised a tax consolidation contribution to the wholly-owned tax consolidated entity of $96 million (30 June 2020: $98 million).\n\nThe amount receivable by the Bank under the tax funding agreement was $200 million as at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: $209 million). This balance is included in 'Other assets' in the Bank's separate Balance Sheet.\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nIncome tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated using the Balance Sheet method where temporary differences are identified by comparing the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes to their tax bases.\n\nThe amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities (i.e. through use or through sale), using tax rates which are expected to apply when the Deferred tax asset is realised or the Deferred tax liability is settled.\n\nThe  Group recognised and disclosed separate deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities arising from arrangements where the Group is lessee. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where they relate to income tax levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities within the same taxable group.\n\nThe Bank and its wholly owned Australian subsidiaries elected to be treated as a single entity ('the tax consolidated group') under the tax consolidation regime from 1 July 2002. The members of the tax consolidated group have entered into tax funding and tax sharing agreements, which set out the funding obligations and members.\n\nAny current tax liabilities/assets and deferred tax assets from unused tax losses from subsidiaries in the tax consolidated group are recognised by the Bank legal entity and funded in line with the tax funding arrangement.\n\nThe measurement and disclosure of deferred tax assets and liabilities have been performed on a modified stand-alone basis under UIG 1052 Tax Consolidation Accounting .\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nProvisions for taxation require significant judgement with respect to outcomes that are uncertain. For such uncertainties, the Group has estimated the tax provisions based on the expected outcomes. A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available for it to be used against.\n\n137\n\nA\n\nDD\n\nI\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\nA\n\nL\n\nI\n\nN\n\nF\n\nO\n\nRM\n\nA\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is calculated by dividing net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Bank (after adding back interest on the convertible redeemable loan capital instruments) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year (as calculated under basic earnings per share adjusted for the effects of dilutive convertible non-cumulative redeemable loan capital instruments and shares issuable under executive share plans).\n\n138\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 2.7 Financial reporting by segments\n\nThe principal activities of the Group are carried out in the business segments described  below. These segments are based on the distribution channels through which customer relationships are managed.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group made a number of structural changes to its operating segments. This includes the transfer of Commonwealth Private out of the Business Banking division and consolidation into the Retail Banking Services division in order to better serve our customers, and align distribution channels and core product offerings. There were also other re-segmentations, allocations and reclassifications, including refinements to the allocation of support units and other costs. These changes have not impacted the Group's net profit, but have resulted in changes to the presentation of the Income Statement and the Balance Sheet of the affected segments. These changes have been applied retrospectively.\n\nThe Group's primary sources of revenue are interest and fee income (Retail Banking Services, Business Banking, Institutional Banking and Markets, New Zealand), insurance premiums (Retail Banking Services) and funds management income (Retail Banking Services, New Zealand).\n\nRevenues and expenses occurring between segments are subject to transfer pricing arrangements. All intra-group  transactions  are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nBusiness segments are managed on the basis of net profit after income tax ('cash basis'). Management uses 'cash basis' to assess performance and it provides the basis for the determination of the Bank's dividends. The 'cash basis' presents the Group's underlying operating  results,  excluding  a  number  of  items  that  introduce  volatility  and/or  one-off  distortions  of  the  Group's  current  period performance. These items, such as hedging and IFRS volatility, are calculated consistently year on year and do not discriminate between positive and negative adjustments.\n\n## (i) Retail Banking Services\n\nRetail Banking Services provides banking and general insurance products and  services to personal customers, and banking and advisory services for high net worth individuals. Retail Banking Services also includes the financial results of retail banking activities provided under the Bankwest brand. On 21 June 2021, the Group announced the sale of CommInsure General Insurance to Hollard Insurance Company Pty Ltd (Hollard).\n\n## (ii) Business Banking\n\nBusiness  Banking serves the banking needs of business, corporate and agribusiness customers across the full range of financial services solutions. It also provides equities trading and margin lending services through the CommSec business. Business Banking also includes the financial results of business banking activities conducted under the Bankwest brand.\n\n## (iii) Institutional Banking and Markets\n\nInstitutional Banking and Markets serves the commercial and wholesale banking needs of large corporate, institutional and government clients across a full range of financial services solutions including access to debt capital markets, transaction banking, working capital and risk management through dedicated product and industry specialists.\n\n## (iv) Wealth Management\n\nWealth Management provides superannuation, investment and retirement products. The Group classified Wealth Management as a discontinued operation following the announcement of the sale of a 55% interest in CFS to KKR on 13 May 2020.\n\n## (v) New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand includes the banking and funds management businesses operating in New Zealand under the ASB brand. ASB provides a range of banking and wealth products and services to its personal, business, rural and corporate customers in New Zealand.\n\n## (vi) Corporate Centre and Other\n\nCorporate Centre and Other include the results of the Group's centrally held minority investments and subsidiaries, Group-wide remediation costs, investment spend including enterprise-wide infrastructure and other strategic projects, employee entitlements, and unallocated revenue and expenses relating to the Bank's support functions including Treasury, Investor Relations, Group Strategy, Legal and Corporate Affairs and Bank-wide elimination entries arising on consolidation.\n\nCentrally held minority investments and subsidiaries include the Group's offshore minority investments in China (Bank of Hangzhou and Qilu Bank), Vietnam (Vietnam International Bank), as well as its Indonesian banking subsidiary (PT Bank Commonwealth). They also include domestically held minority investments in Lendi Group as well as the strategic investments in x15ventures.\n\nTreasury is primarily focused on the management of the Bank's interest rate risk, funding and liquidity requirements, and management of the Bank's capital.\n\n139\n\n<!-- image -->",

and other receivables include overdrafts, home loans, credit cards and other personal lending, term loans, and discounted bills. These financial assets are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. The contractual cash flows on these financial assets comprise the payment of principal and interest only. These instruments are accordingly measured at amortised cost.\n\nLoans, bills discounted and other receivables, consistent with the Group's policy for all financial assets measured at amortised cost, are recognised on settlement date, when funding is advanced to the borrowers. They are initially recognised at their fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs such as broker fees.  Subsequent to initial recognition, they  are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and are presented net of provisions for impairment. The accounting policy for provisions for impairment is in Note 3.2. For information on the Group's management of credit risk, refer to Note 9.2.\n\nFinance leases, where the Group acts as lessor, are also included in Loans, bills discounted and other receivables. Finance leases are those where substantially all the risks and rewards of the lease asset have been transferred to the lessee. Lease receivables  are recognised at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Finance lease income reflects a constant periodic return on this net investment and is recognised within interest income in the Income Statement.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWhen applying the effective interest method the Group has estimated the behavioural term of each loan portfolio by reference to historical prepayment rates and the contractual maturity.\n\n145\n\n<!-- image -->",

While the Group's credit and responsible lending policies aim to minimise this risk, there will always be instances where the Group will not receive the full amount owed and hence a provision for impaired loans will be necessary.\n\nA description of the key components of the Group's AASB 9 impairment methodology is provided below.\n\n## Expected credit loss (ECL) model\n\nThe  ECL  model  applies  to  all  financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost,  debt  securities  measured  at  fair  value  through other comprehensive income, finance lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts not measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The model uses a three-stage approach to recognition of expected credit losses. Financial assets migrate through these stages based on changes in credit risk since origination:\n\n## \u00b7 Stage 1 - 12 months ECL - Performing loans\n\nOn origination, an impairment provision equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised. 12 months ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the next 12 months.\n\n## \u00b7 Stage 2 - Lifetime ECL - Performing loans that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nFinancial assets that have experienced a SICR since origination are transferred to Stage 2 and an impairment provision equivalent to lifetime  ECL  is recognised. Lifetime ECL is the credit losses expected to arise from defaults occurring over the remaining life of financial assets. If credit quality improves in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant the exposure is reclassified to Stage 1 and the impairment provision reverts to 12 months ECL.\n\n## \u00b7 Stage 3 - Lifetime ECL - Non-performing loans\n\nFinancial assets in default are transferred to Stage 3 and an impairment provision  equivalent to lifetime ECL  is recognised. This includes assets that are considered impaired as well as assets that are considered to be in default but are not impaired because, for example, no loss is expected based on the security position.\n\nCredit losses for financial assets in Stage 1 and Stage 2 are assessed for impairment collectively, whilst those in Stage 3 are subjected to either collective or individual assessment of ECL.\n\n## Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\nSICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default occurring over the expected life of the financial asset at reporting date to the corresponding risk of default at origination. The Group considers all available qualitative and quantitative information that is relevant to assessing SICR.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, such as the corporate risk rated portfolio and the asset finance portfolio, the risk of default is defined using the existing Risk Rated Probability of Default (PD) Masterscale. The PD Masterscale is used in internal credit risk management and includes 23 risk grades that are assigned at a customer level using rating tools reflecting customer specific financial and non-financial information and management's experienced credit judgement. Internal credit risk ratings are updated regularly on the basis of the most recent financial and non-financial information.\n\nThe Group uses a Retail Masterscale in the ECL measurement on personal loans, credit cards, home loans and SME retail portfolios. The Retail Masterscale has 15 risk grades that are assigned to retail accounts based on their credit quality scores determined through a credit quality scorecard. Risk grades for retail exposures are updated monthly as credit quality scorecards are recalculated based on new behavioural information.\n\nFor significant portfolios, the primary indicator of SICR is a significant deterioration in an exposure's internal credit rating grade between origination and reporting date. Application of the primary SICR indicator uses a sliding threshold such that an exposure with a higher credit quality at origination would need to experience a more significant downgrade compared to a lower credit quality exposure before SICR is triggered. The level of downgrade required to trigger SICR for each origination grade has been defined for each significant portfolio.\n\n151\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 3.2 Loan impairment expense and provisions for impairment (continued)\n\nThe assessment of significant increase in credit risk includes the impact of forward looking multiple economic scenarios in addition to adjustments  for emerging risks at an industry, geographic location or a particular portfolio segment level, which are calculated by stressing an exposure's internal credit rating grade at the reporting date. This accounts for approximately 62% of Stage 2 exposures for the Group and 60% for the Bank as at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: 65% for the Group and 64% for the Bank).\n\nThe Group also uses secondary SICR indicators as backstops in combination with the primary SICR indicator, including:\n\n- \u00b7 arrears status that incorporates the AASB 9 rebuttable presumption of 30 days past due;\n- \u00b7 a retail exposure entering a financial hardship status;\n- \u00b7 a non-retail exposure's referral to Group Credit Structuring.\n\nFor a number of small portfolios, which are not considered significant individually or in combination, the Group applies simplified provisioning approaches that differ from the description above. 30 days past due is used as a primary indicator of SICR on exposures in these portfolios.\n\nThe offer or uptake of an initial COVID-19 related repayment deferral was not itself considered to constitute a SICR event unless the exposure was considered to have experienced a SICR based on other available information. During the current year ended 30 June 2021, the Group completed its reassessment of the internal credit risk ratings for non-retail exposures in segments most impacted by COVID-19, including those on repayment deferrals, to determine if changes in customers' circumstances were sufficient to constitute SICR. Subsequent to an initial deferral some customers were provided with a further deferral extension or other contract modification such as a term extension, or switch from principal and interest repayments to interest only repayments. Where an extension of a deferral was granted or a modification was given outside of commercial terms, those exposures were considered to have experienced a SICR event. Modifications that are routinely offered in the normal course of business, such as interest only switches, were  not considered to constitute a SICR event.\n\n## Definition of default, impaired and write-offs\n\nThe definition of default used in measuring ECL is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to meet contractual credit obligations to the Group in full, or the exposure is 90 days past due. Facilities are classified as impaired where there is doubt as to whether the full amounts due, including interest and other payments, will be received in a timely manner.\n\nLoans are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.  Unsecured retail loans are generally written off when repayments become 180 days past due. Secured loans are generally written off when assets pledged to the Group have been realised and there are no further prospects of additional recovery.\n\nThe offer or uptake of a COVID-19 related repayment deferral was not considered to constitute a default or credit impairment unless the exposure was considered to be in default or impaired based on the criteria outlined above.\n\n## ECL measurement\n\nECL is a probability weighted expected credit loss estimated by evaluating a range of possible outcomes and taking into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nThe Group uses the following AASB 9 collective provisioning models in calculating ECL for significant portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail lending : Personal Loans model, Credit Cards model, Home Loans model\n- \u00b7 Non-retail lending : Corporate Risk Rated model, Asset Finance model, Retail SME model.\n\nFor each significant portfolio ECL is calculated as a product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level:\n\n- \u00b7 Probability of default (PD) : The likelihood that a debtor will be unable to pay its obligations in full without having to take actions such as realising security or that the debtor will become 90 days overdue on an obligation or contractual commitment;\n- \u00b7 Exposure at default (EAD) : The expected Balance Sheet exposure at default. The Group generally calculates EAD as the higher of the drawn balance and total credit limit, except for the credit cards portfolio, for which the EAD calculation also takes into account the probability of unused limits being drawn down; and\n- \u00b7 Loss given default (LGD) : The amount that is not expected to be recovered following default.\n\nSecured retail exposures and defaulted non retail exposures are assessed for impairment through an Individually Assessed Provisions (IAP) process if expected losses are in excess of $20,000. Impairment provisions on these exposures are calculated directly as the difference between the defaulted asset's carrying value and the present value of expected future cash flows including cash flows from realisation of collateral, where applicable.\n\n## Lifetime of an exposure\n\nFor exposures in Stage 2 and Stage 3 impairment provisions are determined as a lifetime expected loss. The Group uses a range of approaches to estimate expected lives of financial instruments subject to ECL requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 Non-revolving products in corporate portfolios : Expected life is determined as a maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to credit risk;\n- \u00b7 Non-revolving retail products : For fixed term products such as personal loans and home loans, expected life is determined using behavioural term analysis and does not exceed the maximum contractual period; and\n- \u00b7 Revolving  products  in  corporate  and  retail  portfolios :  For  revolving  products  that  include  both  a  loan  and  an  undrawn commitment, such as credit cards and corporate lines of credit, the Group's contractual ability to cancel the undrawn limits and demand repayments does not limit the exposure to credit losses to the contractual notice period. For such products, ECL is measured over the behavioural life.\n\n152\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 3.2 Loan impairment expense and provisions for impairment (continued)\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nCredit risk factors of PD and LGD used in the ECL calculation are point-in-time estimates based on current conditions and adjusted to include the impact of multiple probability-weighted future forecast economic scenarios.\n\nForward looking PD and LGD factors are modelled for each significant portfolio based on macroeconomic factors that are most closely correlated with credit losses in the relevant  portfolios.  Each  of  the  four  scenarios  (refer  below)  includes  a  forecast  of  relevant macroeconomic variables which differ by portfolio:\n\n- \u00b7 Retail portfolios: Cash rate, unemployment rate, GDP per capita and House price index.\n- \u00b7 Non-retail lending: Unemployment rate, business investment index, disposable income, ASX 200 and the AUD/USD exchange rate.\n\nNew Zealand equivalents of a subset of the above macroeconomic variables are used for credit exposures originated in New Zealand.\n\nThe Group uses the following four alternative macroeconomic scenarios to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes in estimating ECL for significant portfolios:\n\n- \u00b7 Central scenario: This scenario considers economists' and Central Bank forecasts as well as the Group's base case assumptions used in business planning and forecasting. This scenario assumes that domestic activity restrictions related to COVID-19, when imposed, are either brief, or in line with past experience, economic activity and jobs recover quickly upon lifting of the restrictions.\n- \u00b7 Downside scenario: This scenario contemplates the potential impact of possible, but less likely, adverse macroeconomic conditions, resulting from further nationwide outbreaks of COVID-19 and accompanying sustained periods of hard lockdowns and slow economic recovery.\n- \u00b7 Upside  scenario: This  scenario  is  included  to  account  for  the  potential  impact  of  remote,  more  favourable  macroeconomic conditions. Relative to the Central scenario, the Upside scenario features slightly stronger growth in economic output and a more rapid improvement in labour market conditions. In addition to this, the scenario features a stronger exchange rate, stronger growth in house prices, business investment, disposable income and the share market as well as modest increases in interest rates over the medium term.\n- \u00b7 Severe downside scenario: This scenario contemplates the potentially severe impact of remote, extremely adverse macroeconomic conditions. Relative to the Downside scenario, this scenario features a sharper contraction with a slower recovery in economic output, heightened and prolonged weakness in the labour market, and more severe declines in house prices and the share market. In addition to this, the scenario features a more severe and prolonged contraction in business investment and a weaker exchange rate, while interest rates remain accommodative.\n\nThe table below provides a summary of macroeconomic variables used in the Central and Downside scenarios as at 30 June 2021.\n\n|                                       | Calendar year Central   | Calendar year Central   | Calendar year Central   | Calendar year Downside   | Calendar year Downside   | Calendar year Downside   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                       | 2021                    | 2022                    | 2023                    | 2021                     | 2022                     | 2023                     |\n| GDP (annual % change)                 | 4. 8 1                  | 3. 5 1                  | 2. 5                    | (8. 0)                   | 4. 4                     | 2. 4                     |\n| Unemployment rate (%)  2              | 5. 0 1                  | 4. 5                    | 4. 5                    | 10. 5                    | 10. 0                    | 8. 5                     |\n| Cash rate (%)  2                      | 0. 10                   | 0. 10                   | 0. 10                   | 0. 10                    | 0. 10                    | 0. 10                    |\n| House prices (annual % change)        | 10. 0 1                 | 4. 0                    | 4. 0                    | (1. 0)                   | (11. 3)                  | (4. 8)                   |\n| Business investment (annual % change) | 6. 0                    | 9. 0                    | 6. 0                    | (5. 3)                   | (8. 1)                   | 1. 5                     |\n| AUD/USD exchange rate  2              | 0. 81                   | 0. 77                   | 0. 77                   | 0. 65                    | 0. 65                    | 0. 65                    |\n| Disposable income (annual % change)   | 0. 0                    | 3. 5                    | 3. 5                    | (3. 8)                   | (1. 3)                   | 2. 0                     |\n| ASX 200 (annual % change)             | 9. 3                    | 2. 8                    | 4. 1                    | (0. 3)                   | (7. 0)                   | 1. 7                     |\n| NZ unemployment rate (%)  2           | 4. 7                    | 4. 0                    | 4. 0                    | 8. 0                     | 10. 3                    | 8. 8                     |\n| NZ cash rate (%)  2                   | 0. 25                   | 0. 75                   | 1. 25                   | -                        | (0. 25)                  | (0. 25)                  |\n| NZ house prices (annual % change)     | 9. 3                    | 5. 1                    | 5. 3                    | (9. 8)                   | (12. 7)                  | (5. 3)                   |\n\nThe requirement to probability-weight possible future outcomes captures the uncertainty inherent in the credit outlook, and changes in that uncertainty over time.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 3.2 Loan impairment expense and provisions for impairment (continued)\n\nThe Group's Central scenario in the prior year was broadly in line with the RBA baseline forecast and reflected broad consensus among economists about the negative impact of COVID-19 on the domestic and global economy. During the current year, macroeconomic scenarios were revised for the improved economic conditions including expectations of a strong and rapid recovery and the assumption of no further large COVID-19 outbreaks and accompanying extended hard lockdowns in Australia. These changes led to a significant reduction in the estimates of ECL under the Central and Upside scenarios. In order to reflect the uncertainty about the speed of the economic recovery and the risk posed by extended lockdowns, the Group decreased the combined weighting of the Central and Upside scenarios from 75% to 67.5%. This led to a commensurate increase in the combined weighting of the Downside and Severe Downside scenario from 25% to 32.5%. In addition, the ECL attributable to forward looking adjustments and overlays has increased over the year ended 30 June 2021.\n\nThe Group's assessment of SICR also incorporates the impact of multiple probability-weighted future forecast economic scenarios on exposures' internal risk grades using the same four forecast macroeconomic scenarios as described above.\n\nIn estimating impairment provisions on individually significant defaulted exposures, the Group generally applies prudent assumptions in estimating recovery cash flows. Incorporating multiple forecast economic scenarios in estimates is not expected to significantly affect the level of impairment provisions on these credit exposures.\n\n## Incorporation of experienced credit judgement\n\nManagement exercises credit judgement in assessing if an exposure has experienced SICR and in determining the amount of impairment provisions at each reporting date. Where applicable, credit risk factors (PD and LGD) are adjusted upwards to incorporate reasonable and supportable forward looking information about known or expected risks for specific segments of portfolios that would otherwise not have been considered in the modelling process. Credit judgement is used to determine the degree of adjustment to be applied and considers information such as emerging risks at an industry, geographic and portfolio segment level.\n\nThe Group also applies overlays which are determined based on a range of techniques including stress testing, benchmarking, scenario analysis and expert judgement. Overlays are subject to internal governance and applied as an incremental ECL top-up amount to the impacted portfolio segments. As at 30 June 2021, the Group held $906 million of overlays related to uncertainties associated with the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and other adverse economic conditions. This included overlays for customers impacted by the cessation of liquidity support measures, the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and the impacts of travel restrictions, particularly  on the Aviation sector. The overlays contain $285 million in relation to the Group's non-retail lending portfolio and $621 million in relation to retail portfolios. In addition to this, the Group applies overlays for model risks and other external factors that cannot  be adequately accounted for through the ECL models.\n\n## Sensitivity of provisions for impairment to changes in forward looking assumptions\n\nAs described above, the Group applies four alternative macroeconomic scenarios (Central, Upside, Downside and Severe downside scenarios) to reflect an unbiased probability-weighted range of possible future outcomes in estimating ECL.\n\nThe table below provides approximate levels of provisions for impairment under the Central and Downside scenarios for the Group and the Bank assuming 100% weighting was applied to each scenario and holding all other assumptions constant. As noted above, these scenarios and their associated weights have been selected based on the expected range of potential future loss outcomes.\n\n|                                   | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                   | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Reported probability-weighted ECL | 6,211        | 6,363        | 5,617        | 5,692        |\n| 100% Central scenario             | 4,119        | 5,262        | 3,688        | 4,659        |\n| 100% Downside scenario            | 9,000        | 9,014        | 8,209        | 8,220        |\n\n## Sensitivity of provisions for impairment to SICR assessment criteria\n\nIf 1% of Stage 1 credit exposures as at 30 June 2021 was included in Stage 2, provisions for impairment would increase by approximately $162 million for the Group and $158 million for the Bank (30 June 2020: $108 million for the Group and $96 million for the Bank).\n\nIf  1%  of Stage 2 credit  exposures  as at 30 June 2021  was  included  in  Stage  1,  provisions  for  impairment  would  decrease  by approximately $27 million for the Group and $25 million for the Bank (30 June 2020: $29 million for the Group and $26 million for the Bank).\n\n## Modifications relating to COVID-19\n\nThe Group extended a number of support measures to customers impacted by COVID-19, including loan repayment deferrals, switches from principal and interest repayments to interest only repayments and other modifications including the  extension of loan maturity dates. As at 30 June 2020, the Bank had $310 million and $150 million of accrued interest receivables in relation to retail and non-retail loans in deferral, respectively. The majority of retail and non-retail loans that were previously granted COVID-19 deferrals returned to their regular non-deferral repayment terms during the year ended 30 June 2021. As a result, accrued interest receivables in relation to loans in deferrals as at 30  June 2021 were not significant. Deferral extensions were treated as non-substantial modifications and therefore accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan with no material modification gains or losses having been recognised. Other contract modifications were treated as substantial or non-substantial based on the terms on which they were granted.\n\nThe Group extended new support measures in July 2021 to assist customers further impacted by COVID-19, including loan repayment deferral arrangements, fee waivers and refunds.\n\n154\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 3.2 Loan impairment expense and provisions for impairment (continued)\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021 loans with a gross carrying value of approximately $10,576 million were granted COVID-19 related repayment  deferrals  or  other  contractual  modifications  when  they  were  included  in  either  Stage  2  or  Stage  3  (30  June 2020: $26,886 million). Loans with a gross carrying value of approximately $14,902  million, that were subject to COVID-19 related modifications when in Stage 2 or Stage 3, remained in either Stage 2 or Stage 3 at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: $25,179 million).

The Group takes into account market values of available collateral in calculating provisions for impairment. As at  30 June 2021, the provision for impairment held by the Group in relation to credit exposures subject to COVID-19 related modifications was $193 million (30 June 2020: $817 million). The provision held in relation to these exposures by the Bank was $99 million (30 June 2020: $743 million).\n\n155\n\n<!-- image -->",

Deposits are initially recognised at their fair value less directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost. Interest incurred is recognised within net interest income using the effective interest method.\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements are retained on the Balance Sheet where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group. A liability for the agreed repurchase amount is recognised within Deposits and other public borrowings.\n\n## 4.2 Liabilities at fair value through Income Statement\n\n|                                                          | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                          | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Debt instruments                                         | 5,660        | 661          | -            | 152          |\n| Trading liabilities                                      | 2,721        | 3,639        | 2,721        | 3,639        |\n| Deposits and other borrowings                            | -            | 97           | -            | 97           |\n| Total liabilities at fair value through Income Statement | 8,381        | 4,397        | 2,721        | 3,888        |\n\nThe majority of the amounts are expected to be settled within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.\n\nThe amount that would be contractually required to be paid at maturity to the holders of the financial liabilities designated at fair value through Income Statement for the Group is $8,385 million (30 June 2020: $4,397 million) and for the Bank is $2,721 million (30 June 2020: $3,888 million).\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nThe Group designates certain Liabilities at fair value through the Income Statement on origination when doing so eliminates or reduces an accounting mismatch, or where the liabilities contain embedded derivatives which must otherwise be separated and carried at fair value. Trading liabilities are incurred principally for the purpose of repurchasing or settling in the near term.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, these liabilities are measured at fair value. Changes in fair value (except those due to changes in credit risk) are recognised in Other banking income. Changes in fair value relating to the Group's own credit risk are recognised in other comprehensive income. Interest incurred is recognised within Net interest income on a contractual rate basis, including amortisation of any premium/ discount.\n\n160\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 4.3 Debt issues\n\n|                                         |      | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                         | Note | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Medium-term notes                       |      | 58,260       | 80,877       | 46,760       | 67,602       |\n| Commercial paper                        |      | 2,061        | 12,468       | 2,061        | 12,104       |\n| Securitisation notes                    | 4.5  | 9,721        | 11,677       | -            | -            |\n| Covered bonds                           | 4.5  | 32,961       | 37,456       | 29,019       | 33,592       |\n| Bank acceptances                        |      | -            | 25           | -            | 25           |\n| Total debt issues  1                    |      | 103,003      | 142,503      | 77,840       | 113,323      |\n| Short-term debt issues by currency      |      |              |              |              |              |\n| USD                                     |      | 2,061        | 12,410       | 2,061        | 12,047       |\n| AUD                                     |      | -            | 29           | -            | 29           |\n| GBP                                     |      | 860          | 5,175        | 860          | 5,175        |\n| Other currencies                        |      | 4            | 28           | 4            | 28           |\n| Total short-term debt issues            |      | 2,925        | 17,642       | 2,925        | 17,279       |\n| Long-term debt issues by currency  2    |      |              |              |              |              |\n| USD                                     |      | 26,180       | 39,568       | 21,955       | 34,779       |\n| EUR                                     |      | 29,664       | 33,556       | 22,164       | 25,992       |\n| AUD                                     |      | 30,165       | 34,912       | 20,203       | 23,015       |\n| GBP                                     |      | 4,549        | 4,938        | 4,415        | 4,298        |\n| NZD                                     |      | 2,275        | 3,351        | 92           | 494          |\n| JPY                                     |      | 1,283        | 1,730        | 1,253        | 1,602        |\n| Other currencies                        |      | 5,962        | 6,806        | 4,833        | 5,864        |\n| Total long-term debt issues             |      | 100,078      | 124,861      | 74,915       | 96,044       |\n| Maturity distribution of debt issues  3 |      |              |              |              |              |\n| Less than twelve months                 |      | 29,454       | 36,406       | 24,787       | 31,029       |\n| Greater than twelve months              |      | 73,549       | 106,097      | 53,053       | 82,294       |\n| Total debt issues                       |      | 103,003      | 142,503      | 77,840       | 113,323      |\n\nThe Group's long-term debt issues include notes issued under the: USD70 billion Euro Medium Term Note Program; the USD50 billion US Medium Term Note Program; USD30 billion Covered Bond Program; Unlimited Domestic Debt Program; Unlimited ASB Domestic Medium Term Note Program; USD25 billion CBA New York Branch Medium Term Note Program; EUR7 billion ASB Covered Bond Program; USD10 billion ASB US Medium Term Note Program  and other applicable debt documentation. Notes issued under debt programs are both fixed and variable rate. Interest rate risk associated with the notes is incorporated within the Bank's interest rate risk framework.  The Bank, from time  to time, as part of its Balance Sheet management, may consider opportunities to repurchase outstanding long-term debt pursuant to open-market purchases or other means. Such repurchases help manage  the Bank's debt maturity profile, overall funding costs and assist in meeting regulatory changes and requirements.\n\n161\n\n<!-- image -->",

Any profits or losses arising from redemption prior to maturity are taken to the Income Statement in the period in which they are realised.\n\nThe Group hedges interest rate and foreign currency rate risk on certain debt issues. When fair value hedge accounting is applied to fixed rate debt issues, the carrying values are adjusted for changes in fair value related to the hedged risks.\n\n162\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 4.4 Term funding from central banks\n\n|                                    | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                    | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Term Funding Facility with the RBA | 51,137       | 1,500        | 51,137       | 1,500        |\n| Term funding facilities with RBNZ  | 719          | -            | -            | -            |\n| Term funding from central banks    | 51,856       | 1,500        | 51,137       | 1,500        |\n\nThe Term Funding Facility (TFF) was announced by the RBA in March 2020 as a part of a package of measures to support the Australian economy. Under the TFF, the RBA offered three-year funding to authorised deposit taking institutions through repurchase transactions. Prior to 4 November 2020, TFF funding was provided at a fixed pricing of 0.25% p.a. From 4 November 2020, TFF funding was provided at a fixed rate of 0.1% p.a.\n\nTerm funding facilities with RBNZ include Term Lending Facility (TLF) and Funding for Lending Programme (FLP) introduced to provide liquidity to the banking system in New Zealand. Under these facilities, banks in New Zealand have access to funding at low variable rates of interest and durations between 1 and 3 years.\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nThe term funding liabilities are  initially recognised at its fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## 4.5 Securitisation, covered bonds and transferred assets\n\nThe Group enters into transactions in the normal course of business that transfers  financial assets to counterparties or to Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). Transferred  financial assets that do not qualify for derecognition are typically associated with repurchase agreements and our covered bonds and securitisation programs. The underlying assets remain on the Group's Balance Sheet.\n\nAt the Balance Sheet date, transferred financial assets that did not qualify for derecognition and their associated liabilities are as follows:\n\n|                                                                           | Group                 | Group                 | Group         | Group         | Group            | Group            |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                                           | Repurchase agreements | Repurchase agreements | Covered bonds | Covered bonds | Securitisation 1 | Securitisation 1 |\n|                                                                           | 30 Jun 21             | 30 Jun 20             | 30 Jun 21     | 30 Jun 20     | 30 Jun 21        | 30 Jun 20        |\n|                                                                           | $M                    | $M                    | $M            | $M            | $M               | $M               |\n| Carrying amount of transferred assets                                     | 20,310                | 19,119                | 37,402        | 43,190        | 10,631           | 12,791           |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities                                 | 19,318                | 16,876                | 32,961        | 37,456        | 9,721            | 11,677           |\n| For those liabilities that have recourse only to the transferred  assets: |                       |                       |               |               |                  |                  |\n| Fair value of transferred assets                                          |                       |                       |               |               | 10,634           | 12,813           |\n| Fair value of associated liabilities                                      |                       |                       |               |               | 9,870            | 11,693           |\n| Net position                                                              |                       |                       |               |               | 764              | 1,120            |\n\n|                                                                           | Bank                  | Bank                  | Bank          | Bank          | Bank               | Bank               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                                           | Repurchase agreements | Repurchase agreements | Covered bonds | Covered bonds | Securitisation 2,3 | Securitisation 2,3 |\n|                                                                           | 30 Jun 21             | 30 Jun 20             | 30 Jun 21     | 30 Jun 20     | 30 Jun 21          | 30 Jun 20          |\n|                                                                           | $M                    | $M                    | $M            | $M            | $M                 | $M                 |\n| Carrying amount of transferred assets                                     | 20,360                | 19,326                | 32,383        | 38,359        | 10,631             | 12,791             |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities                                 | 19,368                | 17,084                | 29,019        | 33,592        | 10,104             | 12,514             |\n| For those liabilities that have recourse only to the transferred  assets: |                       |                       |               |               |                    |                    |\n| Fair value of transferred assets                                          |                       |                       |               |               | 10,634             | 12,813             |\n| Fair value of associated liabilities                                      |                       |                       |               |               | 10,104             | 12,514             |\n| Net position                                                              |                       |                       |               |               | 530                | 299                |\n\n163\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the mortgages, it continues to recognise the mortgages on the Balance Sheet. The Group is entitled to any residual income of the securitisation programs after all payments due to investors have been met, where the Group is the income unitholder. The investors have recourse only to the pool of mortgages in the SPV they have invested in.\n\n## Covered bonds programs\n\nTo complement existing wholesale funding sources, the Group has established two global covered bond programs for the Bank and ASB. Certain residential mortgages have been assigned to SPV's associated with covered bond programs to provide security on the payments to investors. The Group is entitled to any residual income after all payments due to covered bond investors have been met. As the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards associated with the mortgages, it continues to recognise the mortgages on the Balance Sheet. The covered investors have dual recourse to the Bank and the covered pool assets.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group exercises judgement to assess whether a structured entity should be consolidated based on the Bank's power over the relevant activities of the entity and the significance of its exposure to variable returns of the structured entity. Such assessments are predominantly required for the Group's securitisation programs, and structured transactions such as covered bond programs.\n\n164\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our investing, trading and other banking activities\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nIn addition to loans, the Group holds other assets to support its activities. Cash and liquid assets, Receivables from financial institutions, trading assets and investment securities are held for liquidity purposes, to generate returns and to meet customer demand. The mix and nature of assets is driven by multiple factors including the Board's risk appetite, regulatory requirements, customer demand and the generation of shareholder returns.\n\nThe Group also transacts derivatives to meet customer demand and to manage its financial risks (interest rate, foreign currency, commodity and credit risks).\n\nRefer to Note 9.1 for additional information relating to the Group's approach to managing financial risks through the use of derivatives.\n\n## 5.1 Cash and liquid assets\n\n|                                                     | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                     | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Notes, coins, cash at banks and money at short call | 87,375       | 27,307       | 84,269       | 24,010       |\n| Securities purchased under agreements to resell     | 12,666       | 16,858       | 12,490       | 16,290       |\n| Total cash and liquid assets                        | 100,041      | 44,165       | 96,759       | 40,300       |\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nCash and liquid assets include cash at branches, cash at banks, nostro balances, money at call with an original maturity of three months or  less  and  securities  purchased  under  agreements to resell.

An asset for the agreed resale amount by the counterparty is recognised within Cash and liquid assets.\n\n## 5.2 Receivables from and payables to financial institutions\n\n1\n\n1\n\n|                                         | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                         | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Collateral placed                       | 4,165        | 7,425        | 4,013        | 7,576        |\n| Other receivables                       | 920          | 1,122        | 540          | 733          |\n| Receivables from financial institutions | 5,085        | 8,547        | 4,553        | 8,309        |\n| Collateral received                     | 4,358        | 4,820        | 4,056        | 4,070        |\n| Other payables                          | 14,701       | 10,109       | 14,412       | 9,780        |\n| Payables to financial institutions      | 19,059       | 14,929       | 18,468       | 13,850       |\n\nAs at 30 June 2021 and 2020, receivables and payables from financial institutions are expected to be settled within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nReceivables from and payables to financial institutions include cash collateral, short-term deposits and other balances.

Trading assets are those acquired principally for sale in the near term. Commodity inventories are measured at fair value less costs to sell in accordance with the broker trader exemption under AASB 102 Inventories . Commodity financing and other lending are mandatorily recognised at fair value through profit or loss, because the contractual cash flows are not solely payments of principal and interest. Other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss, because they are managed with the objective of realising cash flows through sale. Assets at fair value through Income Statement are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in Other banking income.\n\n166\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 5.4 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are classified as 'held for trading' or 'held for hedging'. Held for trading derivatives are contracts entered into in order to meet customers' needs, to undertake market making and positioning activities, or for risk management purposes that are not designated in  hedge accounting relationships. Held for hedging derivatives are instruments held for risk management purposes, which meet the criteria  for hedge accounting.  Derivative financial instruments are contracts whose values are  derived from one or more underlying prices, indexes or other variables.\n\nGroup\n\n|                                       | 30 Jun 21   | 30 Jun 21   | 30 Jun 20   | 30 Jun 20   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                       | Fair value  | Fair value  | Fair value  | Fair value  |\n|                                       | asset       | liability   | asset       | liability   |\n| Derivative assets and liabilities     | $M          | $M          | $M          | $M          |\n| Derivatives held for trading          | 17,584      | (16,248)    | 25,300      | (25,280)    |\n| Hedging derivatives                   | 3,865       | (2,238)     | 4,985       | (6,067)     |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) | 21,449      | (18,486)    | 30,285      | (31,347)    |\n\n|                                       | Bank       | Bank       | Bank       | Bank       |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                       | 30 Jun 21  | 30 Jun 21  | 30 Jun 20  | 30 Jun 20  |\n|                                       | Fair value | Fair value | Fair value | Fair value |\n|                                       | asset      | liability  | asset      | liability  |\n| Derivative assets and liabilities     | $M         | $M         | $M         | $M         |\n| Derivatives held for trading          | 18,184     | (18,464)   | 25,884     | (28,381)   |\n| Hedging derivatives                   | 3,260      | (3,019)    | 3,438      | (7,867)    |\n| Total derivative assets/(liabilities) | 21,444     | (21,483)   | 29,322     | (36,248)   |\n\n## Trading derivatives\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments held for trading are set out in the following tables:\n\n|                                                        | Group 30 Jun 20   | Group 30 Jun 20   | Group 30 Jun 20   | Group 30 Jun 20   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                        | 30 Jun 21         | 30 Jun 21         |                   |                   |\n|                                                        | Fair value        | Fair value        | Fair value        | Fair value        |\n|                                                        | asset             | liability         | asset             | liability         |\n| Derivative assets and liabilities                      | $M                | $M                | $M                | $M                |\n| Held for trading                                       |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Foreign exchange rate related contracts:               |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Forwards                                               | 6,622             | (5,065)           | 6,899             | (6,677)           |\n| Swaps                                                  | 4,100             | (6,598)           | 7,443             | (12,638)          |\n| Options                                                | 274               | (238)             | 441               | (455)             |\n| Total foreign exchange rate related contracts          | 10,996            | (11,901)          | 14,783            | (19,770)          |\n| Interest rate related contracts:                       |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Swaps                                                  | 5,044             | (2,856)           | 8,732             | (4,252)           |\n| Futures                                                | 118               | (1)               | 148               | (69)              |\n| Options                                                | 888               | (773)             | 845               | (572)             |\n| Total interest rate related contracts                  | 6,050             | (3,630)           | 9,725             | (4,893)           |\n| Credit related swaps                                   | 21                | (84)              | 31                | (74)              |\n| Equity related contracts:                              |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Swaps                                                  | 7                 | -

The thresholds for collateral posting vary between two and three notches from the current rating, depending on the ratings agency. The thresholds for novation vary between four and six notches from the current rating, depending on the ratings agency. The fair value of funding these collateral arrangements has been recognised by the Bank as a funding valuation adjustment. The adjustment did not have a material impact on the Bank's Income Statement for the year. As the arrangement is between the Bank and the trusts, the fair value is eliminated on consolidation and will only be recognised by the Group if the trusts are deconsolidated.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the weighted average fixed interest rate of interest rate swaps hedging interest rate risk was 1.11% (30 June 2020: 1.36%).

Subsequent to initial recognition, gains or losses on derivatives are recognised in the Income Statement, unless they are entered into for hedging purposes and designated in a cash flow hedge.\n\n## Hedging strategy and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group risk management strategy (refer to notes 9.1 and 9.3) is to manage market risks within risk limits to minimise profit and capital volatility. The use of derivative and other hedging instruments for hedging purposes gives rise to potential volatility in the Income Statement because of mismatches in the accounting treatment between derivatives and other hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged. The Group's and the Bank's objective is to reduce volatility in the Income Statement by applying hedge accounting.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or unrecognised firm commitment, predominantly associated with investment securities, debt issues and loan capital. Changes in fair values can arise from fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and futures to protect against such fluctuations.\n\nChanges in the value of fair value hedges are recognised in the Income Statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. All gains and losses associated with the ineffective portion of fair value hedge relationships are recognised immediately as Other banking income.\n\nIf the hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, it is discontinued. For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the Income Statement from the date of discontinuation over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship based on a recalculated effective interest rate. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are used by the Group to manage exposure to variability in future cash flows, which could affect profit or loss and may result from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates or in commodity prices on financial assets, financial liabilities  or highly probable forecast transactions, predominantly associated with floating rate domestic loans and deposits. The Group principally uses interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, futures and commodity related swaps to protect against such fluctuations.\n\nChanges in fair value associated with the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are recognised through other comprehensive income in the Cash flow hedge reserve within equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the period in which the hedged forecast transaction takes place.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is recycled immediately to the Income Statement. Where it is appropriate, non-derivative financial assets and liabilities are also designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nThe Group holds investments in foreign operations, where changes in net assets resulting from changes in foreign currency rates are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve and results in volatility in shareholders' equity. To protect against the foreign currency risk, the Group enters into foreign currency forwards that are designated as hedging instruments in net investment hedges. Gains and losses on derivative contracts relating to the effective portion of the net investment hedge are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve in equity. Ineffective portions are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the Income Statement when the foreign subsidiary or branch is disposed of.\n\n## Risk components\n\nIn some hedging relationships, the Group and the Bank designate risk components of hedged items as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 benchmark interest rate risk as a component of interest rate risk, such as the Bank Bill Benchmark Rate component; and\n- \u00b7 spot exchange rate risk as a component of foreign currency risk for foreign currency financial assets and liabilities.\n\nHedging the benchmark interest rate risk or spot exchange rate risk components results in other risks, such as credit risk and liquidity risk, being excluded from the hedge accounting relationship.\n\n## Economic relationships and hedge effectiveness\n\nThe Group performs both prospective and retrospective tests to determine the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, and to assess hedge effectiveness. At inception of the hedge relationship, prospective testing is performed on a matched terms basis. This test checks that the critical terms are matched between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. At the same time a hedging ratio is established by matching the notional of the derivatives with the principal of the portfolio or financial instruments being hedged, in most cases the ratio is 100%. Retrospective testing for each reporting period uses a regression model, which compares the change in the fair value of the hedged item and the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument. For a hedge to be deemed effective, the change in fair values should be within 80% to 125% of each other. Should the result fall outside this range the hedge would be deemed ineffective and recognised immediately through the Income Statement in line with each hedge relationship policy above.\n\n175\n\n<!-- image -->",

Collateralised derivatives are discounted using Overnight Indexed Swaps (OIS) discount curves, which are not applied to the hedged item;\n- \u00b7 change in the credit risk of the hedging instrument; and\n- \u00b7 mismatches between the contractual terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nNo other sources of hedge ineffectiveness have arisen during the year.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nIn certain instances, a derivative may be embedded within a financial liability host contract. It is accounted for separately as a standalone derivative at fair value, where:\n\n- \u00b7 the host contract is not carried at fair value through the Income Statement; and\n- \u00b7 the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the host contract.\n\n## IBOR reform\n\nThe Group has designated hedge relationships where hedged items and/or hedging instruments reference LIBOR. IBOR based benchmark rates are being transitioned to risk-free rates (RFRs), as discussed in note 12.4. The table below provides more information on the hedge accounting relationships that are directly impacted by the IBOR reform. The majority of hedging derivatives are subject to the ISDA Fallbacks Protocol for converting LIBORs to RFRs plus a spread when an index cessation event occurs.\n\nThe  UK  Financial  Conduct  Authority's  (FCA)  announcement  on  the  future  cessation  and  loss  of  representativeness  of  LIBOR benchmarks on 5 March 2021 constituted such an index cessation event. As such, the spread adjustment to be applied to such derivative contracts upon fallback has been fixed. The Group has concluded that uncertainty remains with respect to the timing of transition of the IBOR-based cash flows of these hedging instruments. The assessment of whether uncertainty has ceased, has considered the likelihood of the FCA declaring a rate unrepresentative at an earlier date and the potential for proactive transition of positions from IBORs, rather than reliance on fallback clauses. As a result, the relief afforded to the Group under AASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform , which was early adopted during the financial year ended 30 June 2020 continues to apply.\n\n## Hedging instruments\n\n|                   | Notional designated beyond cessation date   | Notional designated beyond cessation date   | Notional designated beyond cessation date   | Notional designated beyond cessation date   | Notional designated beyond cessation date   |                                                |                                         |                   |\n|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|\n|                   | USD Libor $M                                | GBP Libor $M                                | CHF Libor $M                                | JPY Libor $M                                | Total  1 $M                                 | Notional designated up to cessation date  2 $M | Other not impacted by IBOR reform  3 $M | Total notional $M |\n| Cash flow hedges  | 2,643                                       | -

The contractual cash flows on these financial assets comprise payments of principal and interest only. These securities are initially recognised at their fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nInterest income and foreign exchange gains and losses on these securities are recognised in the Income Statement. The securities are assessed for impairment using the expected credit loss approach described in Note 3.2. Impairment is recognised in the Loan impairment expense line in the Income Statement.\n\nWhen debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the Other banking income line in the Income Statement.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nThis category also includes non-traded equity instruments designated at fair value through other comprehensive income. Fair value gains and losses and foreign exchange gains and losses on these equity instruments are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the Income Statement on derecognition.\n\n## Investment securities at amortised cost\n\nThis category includes debt securities held within the business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows. The contractual cash flows on these financial assets comprise the payment of principal and interest only. These securities are initially recognised at their fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and are presented net of provisions for impairment. For the accounting policy on provisions for impairment, refer to Note 3.2.\n\n178\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other assets\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe Group's other assets comprise of assets not included in its lending, investing, trading and other banking activities.

These fair values fall under the Level 3 category of the fair value hierarchy as defined in Note 9.5. Revaluation adjustments are reflected in the Asset revaluation reserve, except to the extent they reverse a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognised in the Income Statement. Upon disposal, realised amounts in the Asset revaluation reserve are transferred to Retained profits.\n\nOther property, plant and equipment assets are stated at cost, including direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and impairment if required. Subsequent costs are capitalised where it enhances the asset. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful economic life.\n\n## The useful lives of major depreciable asset categories are as follows:\n\n| Right-of-use assets    | Unexpired lease term                            |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n| Land                   | Indefinite, not depreciated                     |\n| Buildings              | Up to 30 years                                  |\n| Equipment              | 3-25 years                                      |\n| Leasehold improvements | Lower of unexpired lease term or lives as above |\n| Assets held as lessor: | Assets held as lessor:                          |\n| Aircraft               | 25 years                                        |\n| Rail                   | 35-40 years                                     |\n| Ships                  | 25-40 years                                     |\n\nLeases are entered into to meet the business needs of entities in the Group. Leases are primarily over commercial and retail premises and plant and equipment. Where the Group is a lessee, all leases will be recognised on the Balance Sheet as a lease liability and rightof-use asset, unless the underlying asset is of low value or the lease has a term of 12 months or less. Rentals of leases with low value underlying assets or where the lease term is 12 months or less are recognised over the lease term as Operating expenses in the Income Statement.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the initial amount of the lease liability measured at the present value of the future lease payments;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 an estimate of the costs to be incurred upon disassembling or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms of the lease.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis within Operating expenses in the Income Statement.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recognised in the Income Statement if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been fully written down.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nJudgement has been applied by the Group in assessing which arrangements contain a lease, the period over which the lease exists and the variability of future cash flows when recognising right-of-use assets. The Group assesses at each Balance Sheet date useful lives and residual values and whether there is any objective evidence of impairment.\n\nIn determining the value in use of assets held as lessor, the Group incorporates the cash inflows over the lease term, as well as the expected selling price on expiry of the lease. Market disruption, lower demand for assets, decline in asset prices as well as credit events specific to individual lessees can result in a reduction of the asset's recoverable values. There remains significant uncertainty regarding the severity of the impact of COVID-19 on the aviation sector, and the duration of restrictions on domestic and international travel.\n\nIf an asset's carrying amount is greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount.\n\n181\n\n<!-- image -->",

The recoverable amount is determined based on fair value less cost to sell, primarily using an earnings multiple applicable to that type of business. The category of this fair value is Level 3 as defined in Note 9.5.\n\nEarnings  multiples relating to the Group's  banking  cash-generating units are sourced from publicly available data associated with Australian businesses displaying similar characteristics to those cash-generating units, and are applied to current earnings. The key assumption is the Price-Earnings (P/E) multiple observed for these businesses, which for the banking businesses were in the range of 13.1x-14.8x (2020: 11.8x-12.7x).\n\n## Goodwill allocation to cash generating units\n\n|                            | Group 1      | Group 1      | Bank 1       | Bank 1       |\n|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                            | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Retail Banking Services    | 3,803        | 3,828        | 2,023        | 2,023        |\n| Business Banking           | 1,220        | 1,183        | 499          | 499          |\n| New Zealand                | 263          | 262          | -            | -            |\n| Corporate Centre and Other | 31           | 11           | -            | -            |\n| Total                      | 5,317        | 5,284        | 2,522        | 2,522        |\n\n- 1  Comparative information has been restated to reflect re-segmentation detailed in Note 1.1.\n\n182\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 6.2 Intangible assets (continued)\n\n## Reconciliation of the carrying amounts of Intangible assets is set out below:\n\n1\n\n1\n\n|                                          | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank         |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                          | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Goodwill                                 |              |              |              |              |\n| Opening balance                          | 5,284        | 5,974        | 2,522        | 2,522        |\n| Additions                                | 54           | -            | -            | -            |\n| Reclassification to assets held for sale | (24)         | (704)        | -            | -            |\n| Transfers/disposals/other adjustments    | 3            | 14           | -            | -            |\n| Closing balance                          | 5,317        | 5,284        | 2,522        | 2,522        |\n| Computer software costs                  |              |              |              |              |\n| Opening balance                          | 1,296        | 1,712        | 1,110        | 1,554        |\n| Additions  2                             | 553          | 347          | 466          | 334          |\n| Amortisation and write-offs  3           | (422)        | (762)        | (345)        | (778)        |\n| Reclassification to assets held for sale | -            | (1)          | -            | -            |\n| Closing balance                          | 1,427        | 1,296        | 1,231        | 1,110        |\n| Brand names                              |              |              |              |              |\n| Opening balance                          | 201          | 201          | 186          | 186          |\n| Reclassification to assets held for sale | (15)         | -            | -            | -            |\n| Closing balance                          | 186          | 201          | 186          | 186          |\n| Other intangibles                        |              |              |              |              |\n| Opening balance                          | 110          | 78           | 90           | 55           |\n| Additions                                | 39           | 210          | 27           | 209          |\n| Amortisation and impairment              | (122)        | (178)        | (117)        | (174)        |\n| Reclassification to assets held for sale | (15)         | -            | -            | -            |\n| Closing balance                          | 12           | 110          | -            | 90           |\n| Total intangible assets                  | 6,942        | 6,891        | 3,939        | 3,908        |\n\n- 2  Primarily relates to internal development costs.\n- 3  Includes amounts associated with discontinued operations.\n\n183\n\n<!-- image -->",

They are recognised only if it is probable the asset will generate future benefits for the Group. Those assets with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment annually. All intangible assets must be tested for impairment when there is an indication that its carrying amount may be greater than its recoverable amount.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of a business and represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually through allocation to a group of Cash Generating Units (CGUs). The CGUs' recoverable amount is then compared to the carrying amount of the CGUs including goodwill and an impairment is recognised for any excess carrying value.\n\n## Computer software costs\n\nCertain internal and external costs directly incurred in acquiring  and developing software, are capitalised and amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight-line  basis. The majority of software projects are amortised over three  to five years.  Software maintenance is expensed as incurred.\n\nSaaS arrangements are service contracts providing the Group with the right to access the cloud provider's application software over the contract period. Costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, are generally recognised as operating expenses when the services are received. Some of these costs incurred are for the development of software code that enhances, modifies or creates additional capability to existing on-premise systems and meets the recognition criteria for an intangible asset. These costs are recognised as intangible software assets and amortised over the useful life of the software on a straight-line basis.\n\nFollowing the change in the amortisation method for the core banking software during the year ended 30 June 2020, it is amortised by applying a diminishing balance methodology, over a useful life of approximately nine years. Prior to this change, the core banking software was amortised on a straight-line basis over ten years.\n\n## Brand names\n\nBrand names include the Bankwest brand name acquired in a business combination and initially recognised at fair value. The Bankwest brand name has an indefinite useful life as there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which it is expected to generate cash flows. The Aussie Home Loans brand name was reclassified to assets held for sale and was subsequently derecognised on the completion of the divestment.\n\n## Other intangibles\n\nOther intangibles predominantly comprise customer relationships  and software licences. Customer relationships acquired as part of a business combination are initially measured at fair value. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated based on the timing of projected cash flows associated with those relationships.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nGoodwill is allocated to CGUs whose recoverable amount is calculated for the purpose of impairment testing. The recoverable amount calculation relies primarily on publicly available earnings multiples, which are disclosed on page 182.\n\n184\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 6.3 Other assets\n\n|                                             |      | Group        | Group        | Bank         | Bank      |\n|---------------------------------------------|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|\n|                                             | Note | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 |\n|                                             |      |              |              |              | $M        |\n| Accrued interest receivable                 |      | 1,689        | 1,901        | 1,727        | 1,980     |\n| Accrued fees and reimbursements receivable  |      | 826          | 1,067        | 204          | 216       |\n| Securities sold not delivered               |      | 2,946        | 3,640        | 2,399        | 3,002     |\n| Intragroup current tax receivable           |      | -            | -            | 200          | 209       |\n| Current tax assets                          |      | 123          | 16           | 108          | 10        |\n| Prepayments                                 |      | 465          | 333          | 355          | 217       |\n| Defined benefit superannuation plan surplus | 10.2 | 521          | 681          | 521          | 681       |\n| Other  2                                    |      | 218          | 1,201        | 170          | 602       |\n| Total other assets                          |      | 6,788        | 8,839        | 5,684        | 6,917     |\n\n- 1  Accrued fees and reimbursements receivable as at 30 June 2021 include trail commission receivable of $149 million for the Group (30 June 2020: $453 million).\n- 2  As at 30 June 2021, other assets include $47 million of proceeds receivable in relation to divestments of businesses (30 June 2020: $654 million).\n\nExcept for the defined benefits superannuation plan surplus, the majority of the above amounts are expected to be recovered within 12 months of the Balance Sheet date.\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nOther assets include interest and fee receivables, current tax assets, prepayments, receivables on unsettled trades and the surplus within defined benefit plans.

Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is measured as the present value of expenditures required to settle the obligation, based on a market observable rate. Where a payment to settle an obligation is not probable or cannot be reliably estimated, no provision is recognised. Such obligations are disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\n187\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 7.1 Provisions (continued)\n\n## Provisions for employee entitlements (such as long service leave, annual leave and other employee benefits)\n\nThis provision is calculated based on expected payments. Where the payments are expected to be more than one year in the future, it factors in the expected period of service by employees, as well as salary increases. These future obligations are discounted using a market observable rate.\n\n## General insurance claims\n\nThis provision is to cover future claims on general insurance contracts that have been incurred but not reported  and reinsurance arrangements. The provision will be realised upon settlement of claims whose maturities were uncertain at the reporting date.\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nThis provision covers customer remediation costs and related program costs.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThis provision relates to dividends for prior periods which have not been settled at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Compliance and regulation\n\nThis provision relates to project and other administrative costs associated with certain compliance and regulatory programs of the Group.\n\n## Restructuring provision\n\nThe provision includes direct expenditures arising from changes in the scope of the Group's business relating primarily to divestment transactions. The provision includes costs, which  are both necessarily entailed by the divestment and are not associated with the ongoing activities of the Group. A provision for restructuring costs is only recognised when the Group has a detailed formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either commenced or has been publicly announced.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions include self-insurance provisions, make-good provisions in relation to property leases, and provisions for certain other costs.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nProvisions are held in respect of a range of future obligations, some of which involve significant judgement about the likely outcome of various events and estimated future cash flows.\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nProvisions for customer remediation require significant levels of estimation and judgement. The amount raised depends on a number of different assumptions, such as the number of years impacted, the forecast refund rate and the average cost per case. The Group is committed to comprehensively and efficiently addressing the full range of remediation issues impacting customers of the Banking and Wealth Management businesses. Significant resources have been committed to a comprehensive program of work, to ensure that all issues are identified and addressed.\n\n## Aligned Advice remediation - ongoing service fees\n\nAligned advisors were not employed by the Group but were representatives authorised to provide financial advice under the licences of the Group's subsidiaries, Financial Wisdom Limited (FWL), Count Financial Limited (Count Financial) and Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited-Pathways (CFP-Pathways).\n\nThe Group completed the sale of Count Financial to CountPlus Limited (CountPlus) on 1 October 2019, and ceased providing licensee services through CFP-Pathways and Financial Wisdom in March and June 2020, respectively. The Bank entered into reimbursement agreements with Financial Wisdom and CFP-Pathways, and an indemnity deed with CountPlus, to cover potential remediation of past issues including ongoing service fees charged where no service was provided. For details on the reimbursement agreements and the indemnity deed refer to Note 11.2.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group recognised an increase in the provision for Aligned Advice remediation issues and program costs of $273 million, including ongoing service fees charged where no service was provided.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the provision held by the Group in relation to Aligned Advice remediation was $1,018 million (30 June 2020: $804 million). The provision includes $468 million for customer fee refunds (30 June 2020: $418 million), $423 million for interest on fees subject to refunds (30 June 2020: $280 million) and $127 million for costs to implement the remediation program (30 June 2020: $106 million).\n\nThe Group's estimate of the proportion of fees to be refunded is based on sample testing and allows for a threshold below which customers will be automatically refunded without detailed assessment. It assumes an average refund rate across licensees of 39% (30 June 2020: 37%). This compares to a refund rate of 22%, which was paid for our salaried advisors. An increase/(decrease) in the failure rate by 1% would result in an increase/(decrease) in the provision of approximately $20 million. The Group is continuing to engage with ASIC in relation to its remediation approach.\n\n188\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 7.1 Provisions (continued)\n\n## Banking and other Wealth customer remediation\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the provision held by the Group in relation to Banking and other Wealth Management customer remediation programs  was  $159  million  (30 June 2020: $227 million). The provision for Banking remediation includes an estimate of customer refunds  (including  interest)  relating  to  business  and  retail  banking  products  (including  bank  guarantees,  cash  deposit  accounts, merchants billing and certain other lending products), and the related program costs. The wealth remediation provision includes an estimate  of  customer  refunds  (including  interest)  relating  to  advice  quality,  the  Consumer  Credit  Insurance  products,  certain superannuation and other products, and the related program costs.\n\n## Litigation, investigations and reviews\n\nThe Group is party to a number of legal proceedings, and the subject of various investigations and reviews. Provisions have been raised in accordance with the principles outlined in the accounting policy section of this note.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe main litigated claims against the Group as at 30 June 2021 are summarised below.\n\n## Shareholder class actions\n\nIn October 2017 and June 2018 two separate shareholder class action proceedings were filed against CBA in the Federal Court of Australia, alleging breaches of CBA's continuous disclosure obligations and misleading and deceptive conduct in relation to the subject matter of the civil penalty proceedings brought against CBA by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). The AUSTRAC proceedings concerned contraventions of the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).\n\nThe resolution of the AUSTRAC civil penalty proceedings was approved by the Federal Court on 20 June 2018 with CBA paying a penalty of $700 million and legal costs.\n\nIt is alleged in the class actions that CBA shareholders who acquired an interest in CBA shares between 16 June 2014 and 3 August 2017 suffered losses as a result of the alleged conduct. The two class actions are being case managed together, with a single harmonised statement of claim. CBA denies the allegations made against it, and it is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims, if any, on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of the claims.\n\n## Superannuation class actions\n\nThe Group is also defending four class action claims in relation to superannuation products.\n\nOn 9 October 2018, a class action was filed against Colonial First State Investments Limited (CFSIL) and CBA in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim initially related to investment in cash and deposit options (which are cash and deposit products provided by CBA) in the Colonial First State First Choice Superannuation Trust (FirstChoice Fund) and Commonwealth Essential Super (CES). A second further amended statement of claim and amended application was filed on 2 June 2020, joining Avanteos Investments Limited (AIL) as a party in respect of claims regarding the FirstWrap Pooled Cash Account and expanding the existing claims made against CFSIL and CBA. The main claims are that members invested in these cash and deposit options received lower interest rates than they could have received had CFSIL/AIL offered similar products made available in the market by another bank with comparable risk and that CFSIL/AIL retained the margin that arises through the internal transfer pricing process in respect of deposits made with CBA, for their own benefit. It is claimed CFSIL/AIL breached their duties as a trustee of the funds, CFSIL breached its duties as a Responsible Entity of  the underlying managed investment schemes and that CBA was involved in CFSIL/AIL's breaches. CBA, CFSIL and AIL deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings.\n\nOn 18 October 2019, a second class action was commenced against CFSIL in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim relates to certain  fees  charged  to  members  of  the  FirstChoice  Fund.  It  is  alleged  that  CFSIL  breached  its  duties  as  trustee  and  acted unconscionably because it failed, between 2013 and 2019, to take steps to avoid the payment of grandfathered commissions to financial advisers, which would have resulted in a reduction of the fees paid by members in respect of whom those commissions were paid. CFSIL denies the allegations and is defending the proceedings. A mediation in this matter is likely in the last quarter of 2021.\n\nOn 24 October 2019, a third class action was filed against CFSIL and a former executive director of CFSIL in the Federal Court of Australia, relating to alleged contraventions of statutory obligations under superannuation law and trustee breaches in the period 2013 to 2017. The class action relates to the transfer of  certain default balances held by members of FirstChoice Employer Super to a MySuper product. The key allegation is that members should have been transferred to a MySuper product earlier than they were, and that the alleged failure to effect the transfer as soon as reasonably practicable caused affected members to pay higher fees and receive lower investment returns during the period of delay. CFSIL and its former director deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings. A mediation in this matter is likely in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nOn 22 January 2020, a fourth class action was filed against CFSIL and The Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Limited (CMLA) in the Federal Court of Australia. The class action alleges that CFSIL did not act in the best interests of members and breached its trustee duties when taking out group insurance policies obtained from CMLA. The key allegation is that CFSIL entered into and maintained insurance policies with CMLA on terms that were less favourable to members than would have reasonably been available in the market. It is alleged that CMLA was knowingly involved in CFSIL's contraventions as trustee and profited from those contraventions. CFSIL and CMLA deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims on the Group. The Group has provided for the legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of the claims.\n\n189\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 7.1 Provisions (continued)\n\n## Advice Class Actions\n\nOn 21 August 2020, a class action was filed in the Federal Court of Australia against Commonwealth Financial Planning Limited (CFP), Financial Wisdom Limited (FWL) and CMLA. The claim relates to certain CommInsure (CMLA) life insurance policies recommended by financial advisers appointed by CFP and FWL during the period 21 August 2014 to 21 August 2020. The key allegations include that CFP and FWL or their financial advisers breached their fiduciary duties to their clients, breached their duty to act in the best interest of their clients, and had prioritised their own interests (and the interests of CFP, FWL and CMLA) over the interest of their clients, in recommending certain CommInsure life insurance policies in preference to substantially equivalent or better policies available at lower premiums from third party insurers. It is also alleged that CMLA is liable to account for excess premiums because it knew the material facts giving rise to the breaches of fiduciary duty. CFP, FWL and CMLA are defending the proceedings.\n\nOn 3 September 2020, CBA was notified of a class action commenced against Count Financial Limited (Count) in the Federal Court of Australia on 24 August 2020. The proceeding relates to commissions paid to Count and its authorised representative financial advisers in respect of financial products (including insurance) and certain obligations of its financial advisers to provide ongoing advice in the period from 21 August 2014 to 21 August 2020. The claim also includes allegations (related to the receipt of commissions) that Count engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct, and that Count and its authorised representatives breached fiduciary duties owed to the applicant and group members. The claim seeks compensation and damages from Count, including any profits resulting from the contraventions.\n\nCount was a wholly owned subsidiary of CBA until 1 October 2019, when it was acquired by CountPlus Limited. CBA has assumed the conduct of the defence in this matter on Count's behalf. Count is defending the proceedings.\n\nIt  is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of these claims on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of these claims.\n\n## US BBSW class action\n\nIn 2016, a class action was commenced in the United States District Court in New York against CBA, other banks and two brokers, claiming a conspiracy among competitors to manipulate the BBSW benchmark for mutual gain. The claims include allegations that United States racketeering and antitrust legislation have been contravened. In November 2018, the Court dismissed the claims against CBA and the other foreign defendants, but in April 2019, an amended complaint was filed that included new allegations and added a new named plaintiff. The defendants applied to the Court to dismiss the amended complaint. In February 2020, the judge determined that the new named plaintiff's claims could proceed against CBA and nine other banks. CBA denies the allegations made against it in the amended complaint.\n\nOn 21 March 2021, CBA reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the action, the terms of which are currently confidential. The parties are in the process of negotiating the terms of a Deed of Settlement, which will be subject to Court approval. The approval hearing is likely to take place in 2022.\n\nThe Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the matter and the agreed settlement sum.\n\n## Consumer credit insurance class action\n\nOn 10 June 2020, a class action was commenced against CBA and CMLA in the Federal Court of Australia. The claim relates to consumer credit insurance for credit cards and personal loans that was sold between 1 January 2010 and 7 March 2018. The class action alleges that CBA and CMLA engaged in unconscionable and misleading or deceptive conduct, failed to act in the best interests of customers and provided them with inappropriate advice. In particular, it is alleged that some customers were excluded from claiming certain benefits under the policies and the insurance was therefore unsuitable or of no value. Allegations are also made in relation to the manner in which the insurance was sold. CBA and CMLA deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim, if any, on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of this claim.\n\n## ASIC regulatory enforcement proceedings\n\n## CFSIL My Super (29WA)\n\nOn 17 March 2020, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against CFSIL in the Federal Court of Australia for alleged breaches of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act) and Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act) arising from communications with members of the FirstChoice Fund. In 2012, the Australian government passed legislation requiring trustees, such as CFSIL, to allocate member contributions to a default MySuper superannuation product in certain circumstances including where a written investment direction had not been provided by the member. ASIC alleges, amongst other things, that CFSIL communicated with members both in template letters and on telephone calls, in a misleading or deceptive manner regarding the provision of investment directions to stay with CFSIL's FirstChoice Fund rather than transitioning to CFSIL's MySuper product.\n\nCFSIL filed its response to the claim on 17 July 2020. ASIC filed an amended statement of claim which, amongst other things, includes additional telephone calls which it alleges were misleading or deceptive. A defence to the amended statement of claim was filed on 11 December 2020. A hearing on the question of liability has been listed for 6 September 2021.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of this claim.\n\n190\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 7.1 Provisions (continued)\n\n## Commonwealth Essential Super\n\nOn 22 June 2020, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against CFSIL and CBA in the Federal Court of Australia for alleged contraventions of the conflicted remuneration provisions in the Corporations Act relating to the arrangements between CFSIL and CBA for the distribution of CES. CES is a MySuper product issued by CFSIL.\n\nCBA filed its defence to the proceedings on 24 August 2020 and CFSIL filed its defence on 25 August 2020. CBA and CFSIL deny the allegations and are defending the proceedings. A hearing on the question of liability has been listed for 26 April 2022.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim, if any, on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of this claim.\n\n## CBA business overdraft proceedings\n\nOn 1 December 2020, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against CBA in this matter in the Federal Court of Australia. CBA did not  defend  the  proceedings.  On  12  February  2021,  consistent  with  CBA's  admissions,  the  Court  made  declarations  that  CBA contravened the general obligations under the Corporations Act and certain misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of the ASIC Act, in relation to overcharging of interest on certain business overdraft accounts for the period 1 December 2014 to 31 March 2018.\n\nThe overcharging affected 2,269 customers. The affected customers have been sent refunds and CBA's remediation program has concluded. At a hearing on 6 April 2021, the judge ordered CBA to pay a penalty of $7 million, which has now been paid. The Court is also considering the appropriate form of a corrective notice to be published by CBA.\n\nThe Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in relation to the Court's consideration of the corrective notice.\n\n## CommSec/AUSIEX\n\nOn 1 March 2021, ASIC commenced proceedings against Commonwealth Securities Limited (CommSec) and Australian Investment Exchange Limited (AUSIEX) in the Federal Court of Australia. The proceedings relate to a number of issues including regulatory data requirements, trade confirmations requirements, client monies and brokerage issues. CommSec and AUSIEX are not defending the proceedings. A hearing has been listed for 3 March 2022 to determine penalties. CommSec and AUSIEX have also agreed to enter into a court-ordered compliance program.\n\nAUSIEX was a subsidiary of the CBA Group until 3 May 2021. CBA has assumed carriage of the proceedings on AUSIEX's behalf.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs and the potential liability in this matter.\n\n## Monthly Account Fees\n\nOn 31 March 2021, ASIC commenced proceedings against CBA in the Federal Court of Australia. The proceedings relate to errors by CBA between 1 June 2010 and 11 September 2019 where monthly account fee waivers were not applied to accounts  for certain customers. ASIC is alleging contraventions of certain misleading and deceptive conduct provisions of the ASIC Act and breaches of the general obligations under the Corporations Act. CBA does not accept the way the alleged contraventions have been formulated in the proceedings and is defending the proceedings.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this claim, if any, on the Group. The Group has provided for legal costs expected to be incurred in the defence of this claim.\n\n## Ongoing regulatory investigations and reviews\n\nThe Group undertakes ongoing compliance activities, including breach reporting, reviews of products, advice, conduct and services provided to customers, as well as interest, fees and premiums charged. Some of these activities have resulted in remediation programs and where required the Group consults with the relevant regulator on the proposed remediation action.\n\nProvisions have been recognised by the Group where the criteria outlined in the accounting policy section of this note are satisfied. Contingent liabilities exist with respect to these matters where it is not possible to determine the extent of any obligation to remediate or the potential liability cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nThere are also a number of ongoing matters where regulators are investigating whether CBA or a Group entity has breached laws or regulatory obligations. Where a breach has occurred, regulators are likely to impose, or apply to a Court for, fines and/or other sanctions. These matters include investigations of issues which were considered by the Financial Services Royal Commission, as well as a number of other matters notified to, or identified by, regulators.\n\nIn addition to possible regulatory actions and reviews, there may also be financial exposure to claims by customers, third parties and shareholders and this could include further class actions, customer remediation or claims for compensation. The outcomes and total costs associated with such regulatory actions and reviews, and possible claims remain uncertain.\n\n## Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) investigation\n\nThe FWO is investigating the Group's employee entitlement review and potential breaches by CBA and its related entities, including CommSec, of the Group's current and previous enterprise agreements and of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth). CBA self-disclosed these matters to the FWO and CBA continues to engage with FWO and respond to notices and requests for information.\n\nIt is currently not possible to determine the ultimate impact of this investigation on the Group.\n\nCBA is continuing with its broad review of employee entitlements and is remediating impacted current and former employees as the review progresses. We continue to update both the FWO and the Finance Sector Union. The Group holds a provision for remediation and program costs related to this matter.\n\n191\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 7.1 Provisions (continued)\n\n## Other regulatory matters\n\nThe following matters were significant regulatory investigations and reviews, which have been completed, but have resulted in ongoing action required by the Group.\n\n## Enforceable undertaking to ASIC (foreign exchange)\n\nIn December 2016, CBA provided an enforceable undertaking (EU) to ASIC arising from an investigation into wholesale spot foreign exchange (FX) trading between 2008 and 2013. ASIC accepted a variation to the EU on 16 October 2020. The EU included the engagement of an independent expert, to review and assess the changes we have made to our trading operating model in recent years, including in training, procedures and oversight.\n\nThe EU also included a voluntary contribution of $2.5 million to support the further development of financial literacy education relating to changes to delivery of care in the aged care sector. CBA continues to implement the terms of the varied EU.\n\n## Prudential inquiry into CBA and enforceable undertaking to APRA\n\nOn 28 August 2017, APRA announced it would establish an independent prudential inquiry (the Inquiry) into the Group focusing on the governance, culture and accountability frameworks and practices within the Group. The final report of the Inquiry was released on 1 May 2018 (the Final Report). The Final Report made a number of findings regarding the complex interplay of organisational and cultural factors within the Group and the need for enhanced management of non-financial risks. In response to the Final Report, the Group acknowledged  that  it  would  implement  all  of  the  recommendations  and  agreed  to  adjust  its  minimum  operational  risk  capital requirements by an additional $1 billion (an impact to risk weighted assets of $12.5 billion) until such time as the recommendations are implemented to APRA's satisfaction.\n\nCBA has entered into an EU under which CBA's remedial action (Remedial Action Plan) in response to the Final Report would be agreed and monitored regularly by APRA. The Remedial Action Plan provides a detailed program of change outlining how CBA will improve  the  way  it  runs  its  business,  manages  risk,  and  works  with  regulators.  The  Remedial  Action  Plan  also  provides  a comprehensive assurance framework, with Promontory Australasia (Sydney) Pty Ltd (Promontory) having been appointed as the independent reviewer, and which is required to report to APRA on the Group's progress against committed milestones every 3 months.\n\nPromontory is continuing to provide APRA with quarterly progress reports, and CBA is committed to report publicly on its progress against the Remedial Action Plan twice a year. Twelve  Promontory reports have been released. Promontory has noted that the Remedial Action Plan program of work remains on track and all 35 recommendations have now been delivered to Promontory as the independent reviewer by the scheduled due date.\n\nIn November 2020, APRA completed a validation review of the Group's progress and found that it had made significant progress in implementing the Remedial Action Plan and reduced the minimum operational risk capital requirements from an additional $1 billion to an additional $500 million.\n\n## Financial crime compliance\n\nAs noted above, in 2018 the Group resolved the AUSTRAC proceedings relating to contraventions of anti-money laundering/counterterrorism financing (AML/CTF) laws.\n\nRecognising the crucial role that the Group plays in fighting financial crime, it continues to invest significantly in its financial crime capabilities, including in its AML/CTF Compliance team and through the Program of Action with coverage across all aspects of financial crime (including AML/CTF, sanctions and anti-bribery and corruption) and all business units.\n\nThe Group provides updates to AUSTRAC on the Program of Action implemented by the Group.\n\nHowever, there is no assurance that AUSTRAC or the Group's other regulators will agree that the Group's Program of Action will be adequate or that the Program of Action will effectively enhance the Group's financial crime compliance programs across its business units and the jurisdictions in which it operates. Although the Group is not currently aware of any other enforcement action by other domestic or foreign regulators in respect of its financial crime compliance, the Group regularly engages with such regulators (including in respect of compliance matters) and there can be no assurance that the Group will not be subject to such enforcement actions in the future.\n\n## Enforceable undertaking to ASIC (BBSW)\n\nOn 21 June 2018, the Federal Court approved an agreement between CBA and ASIC to resolve proceedings concerning alleged market manipulation and unconscionable conduct in respect of the bank bill market. CBA paid a civil penalty of $5 million and a community benefit payment of $15 million to Financial Literacy Australia. It also agreed to pay ASIC's costs of the investigation and legal costs. The Group provided for these costs in an earlier period.\n\nAs part of the settlement CBA also entered into an EU with ASIC under which CBA undertook to engage an independent expert to assess changes it has made (and will make) to its policies, procedures, controls systems, training, guidance and framework for the monitoring and supervision of employees and trading in Prime Bank Bills and CBA's BBSW-referenced product businesses. On 5 October 2018, CBA appointed EY as the independent expert.\n\nCBA has developed an enhanced control framework as part of the Final BBSW program. CBA is implementing the program in accordance with the terms of the enforceable undertaking.\n\n192\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 7.1 Provisions (continued)\n\n## Enforceable undertaking to the Office of Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC)\n\nIn June 2019, the Australian Information and Privacy Commissioner (Commissioner) accepted an EU offered by CBA, which requires further enhancements to the management and retention of customer personal information within CBA and certain subsidiaries.\n\nThe EU follows CBA's work to address two incidents: one relating to the disposal by a third party of magnetic data tapes containing historical customer statements and the other relating to potential unauthorised internal user access to certain systems and applications containing customer personal information. CBA reported the incidents to the Commissioner in 2016 and 2018 respectively and has since addressed these incidents. CBA found no evidence that as a result of these incidents, its customers' personal information was compromised or that there have been any instances of unauthorised access by CBA employees or third parties.\n\nThe Group has provided for certain costs associated with implementation and compliance with the EU provided to the Commissioner.\n\n## Other matters\n\n## Exposures to divested businesses\n\nThe Group has potential exposures to divested businesses, including through the provision of services, warranties and indemnities. These  exposures  may  have  an  adverse  impact  on  the  Group's  financial  performance  and  position.  The  Group  has  recognised provisions where payments in relation to the exposures are probable and reliably measurable.\n\n193\n\n<!-- image -->",

Bills payable and other liabilities are measured at the contractual amount payable. As most payables are shortterm in nature, the contractual amount payable approximates fair value.\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee, all leases are recognised on the Balance Sheet as a lease liability and right-of-use asset, unless the underlying asset is of low value or the lease has a term of 12 months or less. Rentals of leases with low value underlying assets or where the lease term is 12 months or less are recognised over the lease term as Operating expenses in the Income Statement. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the net present value of fixed and variable contractual lease payments as well as expected payments associated with residual value guarantees/purchase option or early lease termination.\n\nLease  liabilities  are  remeasured  when  there  is  a  change  in  future  lease  payments.  When  lease  liabilities  are  remeasured,  a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recognised in the Income Statement if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been fully written down. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n194\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our capital, equity and reserves\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe Group maintains a strong capital position in order to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, provide financial security to its depositors and creditors and adequate return to its shareholders. The Group's shareholders' equity includes issued ordinary shares, retained earnings and reserves.\n\nThis section provides analysis of the Group's shareholders' equity including changes during the period.\n\n## 8.1 Capital adequacy\n\nThe Bank is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) regulated by APRA under the authority of the Banking Act 1959 . APRA has set minimum regulatory capital requirements for banks based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) guidelines.\n\nThe Basel III measurement and monitoring of capital has been effective from 1 January 2013. APRA has adopted a more conservative approach than the minimum standards published by the BCBS and also adopted an accelerated timetable for implementation. The requirements define what is acceptable as capital and provide methods of measuring the risks incurred by the Bank.\n\nThe regulatory capital requirements are measured for the Extended Licenced Entity Group (known as 'Level 1', comprising the Bank and APRA approved subsidiaries) and for the Bank and all of its banking subsidiaries, which includes ASB Bank (known as 'Level 2' or the 'Group').\n\nAll entities which are consolidated for accounting purposes are included within the Group capital adequacy calculations except for:\n\n- \u00b7 the insurance and funds management operating subsidiaries; and\n- \u00b7 certain  entities  through  which  securitisation  of  Group  assets  are  conducted  where  such  entities  meet  APRA's  capital  relief requirements.\n\nRegulatory capital is divided into Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Additional Tier 1 Capital and Tier 2 Capital. CET1 primarily consists of shareholders' equity, less goodwill and other prescribed adjustments.  Additional Tier 1 Capital is comprised of high quality capital providing a permanent and unrestricted commitment of funds, is freely available to absorb losses, ranks behind the claims of depositors and other more senior creditors and provides for fully discretionary capital distributions. Tier 1 capital is the aggregate of CET1 and Additional Tier 1 Capital. Tier 2 Capital is hybrid and debt instruments that fall short of necessary conditions to qualify as Additional Tier 1 to APRA. Total Capital is the aggregate of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital.\n\nThe tangible component of the investment in the insurance and funds management operations are deducted 100% from CET1.\n\nCapital adequacy is measured by means of risk based capital ratios. The capital ratios reflect capital (CET1, Additional Tier 1, Tier 2 and Total Capital) as a percentage of total Risk Weighted Assets (RWA). RWA represents an allocation of risks associated with the Group's assets and other related exposures.\n\nThe Group has a range of instruments and methodologies available to effectively manage capital. These include share issues and buybacks, dividend and DRP policies, hybrid capital raising and dated and undated subordinated  loan capital issuances. All major capital related initiatives require approval of the Board.\n\nThe Group's capital position is monitored on a continuous basis and reported monthly to the Executive Leadership Team, Asset and Liability Committee and at regular intervals throughout the year to the Board.\n\nThe Group's capital ratios throughout the 2019, 2020 and 2021  financial years were in compliance with both APRA minimum capital adequacy requirements and the Board approved minimums. The Group is required to inform APRA immediately of any breach or potential breach of its minimum prudential capital adequacy requirements, including details of remedial action taken or planned to be taken.\n\n195\n\n<!-- image -->",

Policies for each component are set out below:\n\n## Ordinary share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are recognised at the amount paid up per ordinary share, net of directly attributable issue costs. Where the Bank or entities within the Group purchase shares in the Bank, the consideration paid is deducted from total shareholders' equity and the shares are treated as treasury shares until they are subsequently sold, reissued or cancelled. Where such shares are sold or reissued, any consideration received is included in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Retained profits\n\nRetained profits includes the accumulated profits for the Group including certain amounts recognised directly in retained profits less dividends paid.\n\n## Reserves\n\n## General reserve\n\nIn prior periods, the General reserve was derived from profits and was available for dividend payments except for undistributable profits in respect of the Group's life insurance business. Following deconsolidation of CommInsure Life on 1 November 2019, the Group is no longer required to quarantine undistributable profits in the General reserve. As a result the General reserve was reclassified to Retained profits.\n\n## Capital reserve\n\nThe Capital reserve previously held by the Bank was related to historic internal restructuring of the Group's life insurance and funds management businesses. The reserve was eliminated on consolidation. The reserve was reclassified to the Bank's retained earnings following deconsolidation of CFSGAM and CommInsure Life during the year ended 30 June 2020.\n\n## Asset revaluation reserve\n\nThe Asset revaluation reserve is used to record revaluation adjustments on the Group's property assets. Where an asset is sold or disposed of, any balance in the reserve in relation to the asset is transferred directly to Retained profits.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nExchange differences arising on translation of the Group's foreign operations are accumulated in the Foreign currency translation reserve. Specifically assets and liabilities are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at Balance Sheet date; revenue and expenses are translated at the transaction date; and all resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Foreign currency translation reserve.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of, exchange differences are recycled out of the reserve and recognised in the Income Statement.\n\n## Cash flow hedge reserve\n\nThe Cash flow hedge reserve is used to record fair value gains or losses associated with the effective portion of designated cash flow hedging instruments. Amounts are reclassified to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction impacts profit or loss.\n\n## Employee compensation reserve\n\nThe Employee compensation reserve is used to recognise the fair value of shares and other equity instruments issued to employees under the employee share plans and bonus schemes.\n\n## Investment securities revaluation reserve\n\nThe Investment securities revaluation reserve includes changes in the fair value of Investment securities measured at fair value through other  comprehensive  income.  For  debt  securities,  these  changes  are  reclassified  to  the  Income  Statement  when  the  asset  is derecognised. For equity securities, these changes are not reclassified to the Income Statement when derecognised.\n\n201\n\n<!-- image -->",

The final 2019/2020 dividend was satisfied by cash disbursements and $264 million being reinvested by the participants through the DRP. The final 2018/2019 dividend was satisfied by cash disbursement with the DRP satisfied in full through the on-market purchase and transfer of 7,810,285 shares at $78.61.\n\n## Final dividend\n\nThe Directors have determined a fully franked (30%) final dividend of 200 cents per share amounting to $3,548 million. The dividend will be payable on 29  September  2021  to shareholders on the register at 5pm AEST on 18  August  2021. The ex-dividend date is 17 August 2021.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nIn determining the dividend, the Board considers a range of factors in accordance with Bank's dividend policy including:\n\n- \u00b7 paying cash dividends at strong and sustainable levels;\n- \u00b7 targeting a full-year payout ratio of 70-80%; and\n- \u00b7 maximising returns to shareholders by paying fully franked dividends.\n\nIn December 2020, APRA announced that its guidance issued in July 2020 requiring banks to preserve capital through retaining at least half of their earnings during the period of disruption caused by COVID-19, will no longer apply from calendar year 2021. Nevertheless, in determining the appropriate level of dividends, APRA expects banks to moderate dividend payout ratios to ensure they are sustainable, taking into account the outlook for profitability, capital and the broader environment.\n\n## Australian franking credits\n\nThe franking credits available to the Group as at 30 June 2021, after allowing for Australian tax payable in respect of the current and prior reporting period's profit, are estimated to be $3,709 million (2020: $2,751 million).\n\n## New Zealand imputation credits\n\nThe New Zealand imputation credits available to CBA as at 30 June 2021 are estimated to be NZ$874 million (2020: NZ$1,197 million). This is calculated on the same basis as the Australian franking credits but using the New Zealand current tax liability.\n\n202\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 8.4 Dividends (continued)\n\n## Dividend history\n\n| Half year ended   | Cents per share Payment date   | Half year payout ratio  1, 2, 3 %   | Full year payout ratio 1, 2 %   | DRP price $   | DRP participation rate  4 %   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| 31 December 2018  | 200           28/03/2019       | 77. 03                              | -                               | 73. 21        | 16. 7                         |\n| 30 June 2019      | 231           26/09/2019       | 103. 00                             | 89. 07                          | 78. 61        | 15. 0                         |\n| 31 December 2019  | 200           31/03/2020       | 57. 47                              | -                               | 73. 37        | 14. 7                         |\n| 30 June 2020      | 98           30/09/2020        | 50. 56                              | 55. 00                          | 68. 53        | 15. 2                         |\n| 31 December 2020  | 150           30/03/2021       | 54. 65                              | -                               | 85. 25        | 15. 7                         |\n| 30 June 2021      | 200           29/09/2021       | 66. 80                              | 60. 99                          | -             | -                             |\n\n- 1  Comparative information has been restated to reflect the change in accounting policy and the prior period restatement detailed in Note 1.1.\n- 2  Dividend payout ratio: dividends divided by statutory earnings (earnings are net of dividends on other equity instruments).\n- 3  The final 2019/2020 dividend payout ratio at the dividend payment date was 49.95%.\n- 4  DRP participation rate: the percentage of total issued share capital participating in the DRP.\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nDividends represent a distribution of profits that holders of ordinary shares receive from time to time.

The Group manages these risks through its Risk Management Framework (the Framework), which evolves to accommodate changes in the business operating environment, better practice approaches, and regulatory and community expectations. The components of the Framework are illustrated below, including the governance that enables executive and Board oversight of these risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on each of the material risks, and how the Group manages them, are outlined in this note.\n\n204\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.1 Risk management framework\n\nThe Framework enables the appropriate development and implementation of strategies, policies and procedures to manage risk. The Framework incorporates the  requirements of APRA Prudential Standard CPS 220 Risk Management supported by the three key documentary components:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) articulates the type and degree of risk the Board is prepared to accept and the maximum level of risk that the institution must operate within.\n- \u00b7 The Group Risk Management Approach (RMA) describes the Group's approach to ensure comprehensive management of its material risks in support of achieving its strategic goals and objectives.\n- \u00b7 The Group Business Plan (Plan) summarises the Group's approach to the implementation of its strategic objectives. The Plan has a rolling three year duration and reflects material risks arising from its implementation.\n\nThe Framework is underpinned by the following Risk Framework Enablers that allow the Group to effectively identify, record, manage and monitor risks:\n\n## Risk governance and reporting\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  its  risk  management  practices  reflect  a  high  standard  of  governance.  This  enables management to undertake, in an effective manner, prudent risk-taking activities. The Board operates as the highest level of the Group's risk governance. The Board Risk and Compliance Committee is responsible for the oversight and governance of risks impacting the Group.  It oversees the design, implementation and operation of the Framework and helps formulate the Group's risk appetite for consideration by the Board. In particular it:\n\n- \u00b7 monitors the Group's risk profile (including identification of emerging risks); and\n- \u00b7 reviews regular reports from management on the measurement of risk and the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nAt management level, risk governance is undertaken by a structured hierarchy of personal delegations and management committees and forums across the Group and within the Business Units (BUs) and Support Units (SUs).\n\nRegular management information is produced that allows financial and non-financial risk positions to be monitored against approved risk appetite and policy limits. At Board level, the majority of risk reporting is provided to the Board Risk and Compliance Committee, although selected matters are reported directly to the Board as required. Controls reporting is provided to the Board Audit Committee.\n\nThe Group operates a Three Lines of Accountability model that places the accountability for risk ownership with the Line 1 BUs and SUs, while focusing the mandate of Line 2 Risk teams on risk appetite and the Framework, assurance, approval or acceptance of risk decisions of Line 1 and advice. Line 3 Internal Audit provides independent assurance to the Board, regulators and other stakeholders on the effectiveness of risk management, internal controls and governance.\n\n## Risk policies & procedures\n\nRisk policies and procedures provide guidance to the business on the management of each material risk. They support the Framework by:\n\n- \u00b7 summarising the principles and practices to be used by the Group in identifying and assessing its material risks; and\n- \u00b7 quantifying the operating tolerances for material risks.\n\n## Risk management infrastructure\n\nThe Framework is supported by key infrastructure systems and processes for the management of the Group's material risks. The key risk management systems and processes in place include:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk processes to identify, assess, escalate, monitor and manage risks and issues;\n- \u00b7 Management information systems to measure and aggregate risks across the Group; and\n- \u00b7 Risk models and tools.\n\n## Risk accountabilities and skills\n\nThe effective management of our material risks requires appropriate resourcing of skilled employees within each of the Group's Three Lines of Accountability. It is important for all Group employees to have an awareness of their risk accountabilities in relation to their role, the Framework, and the need to adopt the CBA Risk Behaviours to ensure a positive Group risk culture. This awareness is developed through:\n\n- \u00b7 Communication of the Group RAS and the Group RMA : Following approval by the Board, the updated RAS and RMA are made available to all employees;\n- \u00b7 Performance and remuneration frameworks are designed to drive accountability for managing risks and adopting risk behaviours that  lead  to  appropriate  outcomes  for  all  stakeholders.  Each  year  employees  are  assessed  on  how  they  have  met  the  risk management expectations of their role as part of the annual performance review;\n- \u00b7 Group Mandatory Learning modules ;\n- \u00b7 The Operational Risk and Compliance Training program ;\n- \u00b7 Induction and ongoing learning ; and\n- \u00b7 Talent sourcing and acquisition .\n\n205\n\n<!-- image -->",

A positive risk culture drives the right risk decisions and helps the Group make sound judgements in new and unfamiliar circumstances. The risk behaviours that demonstrate a positive risk culture and are expected of employees by the Board, senior management, customers, communities, shareholders and regulators are underpinned by our CBA  values of Care, Courage and Commitment.\n\nThe  Group's RAS in relation to conduct risk requires business practices that are fair to customers, protects  the fair and efficient operation of the market and engenders  confidence in our products and services. Annually, the Board forms a view regarding the effectiveness of the Group's risk culture in keeping risk-taking within appetite. Action plans are initiated and monitored to drive positive risk culture changes in areas of need.\n\n## Ongoing monitoring of COVID-19 risks\n\nAt times, changes in the Group's external and internal operating environments may have an impact on the nature of one or more risks, including strategic risk. An example is the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Board and Management continue to actively monitor the impacts of the pandemic on the Group and adapt the Group's response as required.\n\n206\n\n## Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.1 Risk management framework (continued)\n\n## Material risk types\n\n| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Governing Policies and  Key Management  Committees                                                                                | Key controls and risk mitigation strategies                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Credit risk                                                                                                                       | Credit risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Credit risk is the potential for loss arising  from the failure of a counterparty to meet  their contractual obligations to the Group.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.2 Credit risk\n\n## Credit risk management principles and portfolio s tandards\n\nThe Group has clearly defined credit policies for the approval and management of credit risk. Credit policies apply to all credit risks, with specific portfolio standards applying to all major lending areas. These set the minimum requirements in assessing the integrity and ability of borrowers  to meet their contracted financial obligations for repayment, acceptable forms of collateral and security and the frequency of credit reviews.\n\nThe Group's credit policies and frameworks include concentration limits, which  are designed to achieve portfolio outcomes that are consistent with the Group's risk appetite and risk/return expectations.\n\nThe Credit Portfolio Assurance unit, part of Group Financial Risk, reviews credit portfolios and business unit compliance with credit policies, frameworks, application of credit risk ratings and other key practices on a regular basis.\n\nThe credit risk portfolio has two major segments:\n\n## (i) Retail managed segment\n\nThis segment has sub-segments covering housing loans, credit cards, personal loans, and personal overdrafts. It also covers most non-retail lending where the aggregated credit exposure to a group of related borrowers is less than $1 million.\n\nAuto-decisioning is used to approve credit applications for eligible borrowers  in this segment. Auto-decisioning uses a scorecard approach based on a combination of factors, which may include the Group's historical experience on similar applications, information from a credit reference bureau, the Group's existing knowledge of a  borrower's  behaviour and updated information provided by the borrower.\n\nLoan applications that do not meet scorecard auto-decisioning requirements may be referred to a Personal Credit Approval Authority (PCAA) for manual decisioning.\n\nAfter loan origination, these portfolios are managed using behavioural scoring systems and a delinquency band approach. This includes different actions taken when loan repayments are greater than 30 days past due compared to when they are greater than 60 day past due. Loans past due are reviewed by the relevant Arrears Management or Financial Assistance Team.\n\n## (ii) Risk-rated segment\n\nThis segment comprises non-retail exposures, including bank and sovereign exposures. Each exposure is assigned an internal Credit Risk-Rating (CRR) based on Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD).\n\nEither a PD Rating Tool or expert judgement is used to determine the PD for customers in this segment. Expert judgement is used where the complexity of the transaction and/or the borrower is such that it is inappropriate to rely completely on a statistical model. External ratings may be used for benchmarking in the expert judgement assessment.\n\nThe CRR is designed to:\n\n- \u00b7 aid in assessing changes to borrower credit quality;\n- \u00b7 influence decisions on approval, management and pricing of individual credit facilities; and\n- \u00b7 provide the basis for reporting details of the Group's credit portfolio.\n\nCredit risk-rated exposures are generally reviewed on an individual basis, at least annually, and fall within the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 'Pass' - these credit facilities qualify for approval of new or increased exposure on normal commercial terms; and\n- \u00b7 'Troublesome or Impaired Assets (TIAs)' - these credit facilities are not eligible for new or increased exposure, unless it facilitates rehabilitation to 'pass grade' or protects or improves the Group's position by maximising recovery prospects. Where a borrower is in default but no loss is expected based on an assessment of the security position and other factors, the facility may be classed as troublesome but not impaired. Where a loss is expected, a facility is classified as impaired. Restructured facilities, where the original contractual  arrangements  have  been  modified  outside  commercial  terms  to  provide  concessions  for  the  customer's  financial difficulties, are classified as impaired.\n\nDefault is to be recorded with one or more of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the customer is 90 days or more overdue on a scheduled credit repayment; or\n- \u00b7 the customer is unlikely to repay their credit obligation to the Group in full without taking action, such as realising on available security.\n\n## Credit risk measurement\n\nThe measurement of credit risk uses analytical tools to calculate both: (i) Expected, and (ii) Unexpected Loss probabilities for the credit portfolio. The use of analytical tools is governed by the Model Risk Governance Committee.\n\n## (i) Expected loss\n\nExpected loss (EL) is the product of:\n\n- \u00b7 PD;\n- \u00b7 Exposure at Default (EAD); and\n- \u00b7 LGD.\n\nThe PD, expressed as a percentage, is the estimate of the probability that a client will default within the next 12 months.\n\n212\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.2 Credit risk (continued)\n\n## (i) Expected loss (continued)\n\nEAD is the estimate of the amount of a facility that will be outstanding in the event of default. Estimates are based on a downturn in economic conditions. The estimate is based on the actual amount outstanding, plus the undrawn amount multiplied by a credit conversion factor (CCF). The CCF represents the potential rate of conversion from undrawn 12 months prior to default to drawn at default. For most committed facilities, the Group applies a CCF of 100% to the undrawn amount.\n\nFor uncommitted facilities, the EAD will generally be the drawn balance only. For defaulted facilities, it is the actual amount outstanding at default. For retail exposures, a modelling approach can be used based on factors including limit usage, arrears and loan type to segment accounts into homogeneous pools to calculate EAD.\n\nLGD, expressed as a percentage, is the estimated proportion of a facility likely to be lost in the event of default. LGD is impacted by:\n\n- \u00b7 type and level of any collateral held;\n- \u00b7 liquidity and volatility of collateral;\n- \u00b7 carrying costs (effectively the costs of providing a facility that is not generating an interest return); and\n- \u00b7 realisation costs.\n\nVarious factors are considered when calculating PD, EAD and LGD. Considerations include the potential for default by a borrower due to economic, management, industry, other risks, and the mitigating benefits of any collateral held as security.\n\n## (ii) Unexpected loss\n\nIn addition to EL, a more stressed loss amount is calculated. This Unexpected Loss estimate directly affects the calculation of regulatory and internal economic capital requirements. Refer to Note 8.1 for information relating to regulatory capital.\n\n## Climate related risk\n\nClimate risk is a risk for the Group. The impacts of climate change have the potential to affect our customers' ability to service and repay their loans, and the value of collateral the Group holds to secure loans. These impacts include long-term changes in climatic conditions, extreme weather events, and the action taken by governments, regulators or society more generally to transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nThe Group is a major provider of non-retail loans. A key step in credit risk due diligence for non-retail lending is the assessment of potential transactions for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) risks, including climate risk, through our ESG Risk Assessment Tool. All Institutional Bank loans, as well as large loans in other business units, are evaluated through the Group's ESG risk assessment process.  The risk of climate change is assessed at origination and during the annual review process for Institutional Bank loans. Exposures with medium or high risk profile are subject to additional due diligence. During the year ended 30 June 2021, the Group established provisions for impairment of $50 million reflecting the impact of extreme weather events on the credit quality of the Group's loan  portfolio  (30 June 2020:  $90  million).  This  was  subsequently  released  following  review  of  provision  adequacy  for  impacted customers and limited observed losses.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation, collateral and other credit enhancements\n\nThe Group has policies and procedures in place setting out the circumstances where acceptable and appropriate collateral is to be taken to mitigate credit risk. These include valuation parameters, review frequency and independence of valuation.\n\nThe general nature of collateral that may be taken, and the balances held, are summarised below by financial asset classes.\n\n## Cash and liquid assets\n\nCollateral is not usually sought on the majority of Cash and liquid asset balances as these types of exposures are generally considered low risk. However, securities purchased under agreement to resell are collateralised by highly liquid debt securities. The collateral related to agreements to resell has been legally transferred to the Group subject to an agreement to return them for a fixed price.\n\nThe Group's Cash and liquid asset balance included $84,747  million (2020: $25,562  million) deposited with Central  Banks and is considered to carry less credit risk.\n\n## Receivables from other financial institutions\n\nCollateral is usually not sought on these balances as exposures are generally considered to be of low risk. The exposures are mainly short-term, to investment grade banks and include collateral posted by the Group.\n\n## Trading assets at fair value through Income Statement and investment securities at fair value through OCI\n\nThese assets are carried at fair value, which accounts for the credit risk. Investment securities at amortised cost are measured at amortised cost and presented net of provisions for impairment. Collateral is not generally sought from the issuer or borrower  but collateral may be implicit in the terms of the instrument (such as an asset-backed security).\n\n## Other assets at fair value through Income S tatement\n\nThese assets are carried at fair value, which accounts for the credit risk.\n\n213\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk on derivative contracts. The counterparty credit risk is affected by the nature of the trades, the counterparty, netting, and collateral arrangements. Credit risk from derivatives is mitigated where possible (typically for financial institutions counterparties, but less frequently for corporate or government borrowers) through netting agreements, whereby derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty can be offset and cleared with Central Counterparties (CCPs). The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Master Agreement (or other derivative agreements) are used by the Group as an agreement for documenting Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives.\n\nThe fair value of collateral held and the potential effect of offset obtained by applying master netting agreements are disclosed in Note 9.7.\n\n## Due from controlled entities\n\nCollateral is generally not taken on these intergroup balances.\n\n## Credit commitments and contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group applies fundamentally the same risk management policies for off Balance Sheet risks as it does for its on Balance Sheet risks. Collateral may be sought depending on the strength of the borrower and the nature of the transaction. Of the Group's off Balance Sheet exposures $121,587 million (2020: $103,325 million) are secured.\n\n## Loans, bills discounted and other receivables\n\nThe principal collateral types for loans and receivable balances are:\n\n- \u00b7 mortgages over residential and commercial real estate; and\n- \u00b7 charges over business assets such as cash, shares, inventory, fixed assets and accounts receivables.\n\nCollateral security is generally taken except for government, bank and corporate borrowers that are often externally risk-rated and of strong financial standing. Longer term consumer finance, such as housing loans, are generally secured against real estate, while shortterm revolving consumer credit is generally not secured by formal collateral.\n\nThe collateral mitigating credit risk of the key lending portfolios is addressed in the table 'Collateral held against Loans, bills discounted and other receivables' within this note.\n\n214\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.2 Credit risk (continued)\n\nMaximum  exposure  to  credit  risk  by  industry/sector  and asset c lass  before  collateral  held  or  other  credit enhancements\n\n|                                                             | 30 Jun 21 Group   | 30 Jun 21 Group   | 30 Jun 21 Group            | 30 Jun 21 Group   | 30 Jun 21 Group   | 30 Jun 21 Group         | 30 Jun 21 Group   | 30 Jun 21 Group   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                             | Sovereign         | Agricul- ture     | Bank and  other  financial | Con- struction    | Consumer          | Other comm  and indust. | Other             | Total             |\n|                                                             | $M                | $M                | $M                         | $M                | $M                | $M                      | $M                | $M                |\n| Australia                                                   |                   |                   |                            |                   |                   |                         |                   |                   |\n| Credit risk exposures relating to on Balance Sheet assets:  |                   |                   |                            |                   |                   |                         |                   |                   |\n| Cash and liquid assets                                      | 66,416            | -

All exposures outside the policy limits require approval by the Executive Credit Authority.\n\nThe following table shows the number of the Group's non-retail (excluding banks and sovereign) aggregated borrower exposures (including direct and contingent exposures), which individually were greater than 5% of the Group's capital resources (Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital):\n\n|                                                       | Group            | Group            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                       | 30 Jun 21 Number | 30 Jun 20 Number |\n| 5% to less than 10% of the Group's capital resources  | -                | -                |\n| 10% to less than 15% of the Group's capital resources | -                | -                |\n\nThe Group has a high quality, well diversified credit portfolio, with 63% of the gross loans and other receivables in domestic mortgage loans and a further 8% in overseas mortgage loans, primarily in New Zealand. Overseas loans account for 14% of loans, bills discounted and other receivables.\n\n## Distribution of financial assets by credit classification\n\nWhen doubt arises as to the collectability of a credit facility, the financial instrument is classified and reported as impaired. Provisions for impairment are raised where there is objective evidence of impairment and for an amount adequate to cover assessed credit related losses. The Group regularly reviews its financial assets and monitors adherence to contractual terms. Credit risk-rated exposures are assessed, at least at each Balance Sheet date, to determine whether the financial asset is impaired.\n\n## Distribution of financial instruments by credit quality\n\nThe  tables  on pages 218  to  225  provide  information about  the gross carrying amount of the Group's and the Bank's loans, bills discounted and other receivables by credit rating grade and ECL stage.\n\nThis segmentation of loans in retail and risk-rated portfolios is based on the mapping of a borrower's internally assessed PD to S&P Global ratings, reflecting a borrower's  ability to meet their credit obligations. In particular, retail PD pools have been aligned to the Group's PD grades which are consistent with rating agency views of credit quality segmentation.\n\n| Credit grade   | S&P rating equivalent     |\n|----------------|---------------------------|\n| Investment     | AAA to BBB-               |\n| Pass           | BB+ to B-                 |\n| Weak           | CCC and below, in default |\n\n217\n\nA\n\nDD\n\nI\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\nA\n\nL\n\nI\n\nN\n\nF\n\nO\n\nRM\n\nA\n\nTIO\n\nN\n\n<!-- image -->",

This accounts for approximately 65% of Stage 2 credit exposures for the Group as at 30 June 2020.\n\n220\n\n## Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.2 Credit risk (continued)\n\n1\n\n|                                  | Stage 3 Stage 3 30 Jun 20 Group   | Stage 3 Stage 3 30 Jun 20 Group   | Stage 3 Stage 3 30 Jun 20 Group   | Stage 3 Stage 3 30 Jun 20 Group   | Stage 3 Stage 3 30 Jun 20 Group   |\n|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                  | Stage 1 collectively assessed     | Stage 2  2 collectively assessed  | collectively assessed             | individually assessed             | Total                             |\n|                                  | $M                                | $M                                | $M                                | $M                                | $M                                |\n| Retail secured                   |                                   |                                   |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Credit grade                     |                                   |                                   |                                   |                                   |                                   |\n| Investment                       | 347,698                           | 28,790                            | -

This accounts for approximately 65% of Stage 2 credit exposures for the Group as at 30 June 2020.\n\n221\n\n<!-- image -->",

Impaired assets are split into the following categories:\n\n- \u00b7 non-performing facilities;\n- \u00b7 restructured facilities; and\n- \u00b7 unsecured retail managed facilities 90 days or more past due.\n\nNon-performing facilities are facilities against which an individually assessed provision for impairment has been raised and facilities where loss of principal or interest is anticipated. Interest income on these facilities is reserved and taken to the Income Statement only if paid in cash or if a recovery is made.\n\nRestructured facilities are facilities where the original contractual terms have been modified to non-commercial terms due to financial difficulties of the borrower. Interest on these facilities is taken to the Income Statement. Failure to comply fully with the modified terms will result in immediate reclassification to non-performing.\n\nUnsecured retail products 90 days or more past due are credit cards, personal loans and other unsecured retail products which are 90 days or more past due. These loans are collectively provided for.\n\nThe Group does not manage credit risk based solely on arrears categorisation, but also uses credit risk rating principles as described earlier in this note.\n\n|                                                        | 30 Jun 19 30 Jun 18 30 Jun 17 Group   | 30 Jun 19 30 Jun 18 30 Jun 17 Group   | 30 Jun 19 30 Jun 18 30 Jun 17 Group   | 30 Jun 19 30 Jun 18 30 Jun 17 Group   | 30 Jun 19 30 Jun 18 30 Jun 17 Group   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|                                                        | 30 Jun 21 $M                          | 30 Jun 20 $M                          | $M                                    | $M                                    | $M                                    |\n| Australia                                              |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| Non-performing assets:                                 |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| Gross balances                                         | 1,637                                 | 1,845                                 | 2,217                                 | 1,711                                 | 1,962                                 |\n| Less provisions for impairment                         | (737)                                 | (695)                                 | (826)                                 | (694)                                 | (817)                                 |\n| Net non-performing assets                              | 900                                   | 1,150                                 | 1,391                                 | 1,017                                 | 1,145                                 |\n| Restructured assets:                                   |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |                                       |\n| Gross balances                                         | 418                                   | 363                                   | 428                                   | 264                                   | 174                                   |\n| Less provisions for impairment                         | (33)                                  | (4)                                   | (13)                                  | (4)                                   | -

For other types of credit exposures, a facility is determined to be secured where its ratio of exposure to the estimated value of collateral (adjusted for lending margins) is less than or equal to 100%. A facility is deemed to be partly secured when this ratio exceeds 100% but not more than 250%, and unsecured when either no security is held (e.g. can include credit cards, personal loans, small business loans, and exposures to highly rated corporate entities), or where the secured loan to estimated value of collateral exceeds 250%.\n\n230\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.2 Credit risk (continued)\n\n## Collateral held against loans, bills discounted and other receivable s (continued)\n\n## Home loans\n\nHome loans are generally secured by fixed charges over borrowers' residential properties. In limited circumstances, collateral in the form of cash or commercial property may be provided in addition to residential property. With the exception of some relatively small portfolios, for loans with a Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) of higher than 80% either a Low Deposit Premium or margin is levied, or Lenders Mortgage Insurance (LMI) is taken out to cover the difference between the principal plus interest owing and the net amount received from selling the collateral post default.\n\n## Other consumer\n\nOther consumer category includes credit card and personal loans which are predominantly unsecured, whilst margin lending is secured.\n\n## Other lending\n\nThe Group's main collateral types for other lending consists of secured rights over specified assets of the borrower in the form of: commercial property; land rights; cash (usually in the form of a charge over a deposit); guarantees by company Directors; a charge over a company's assets (including debtors, inventory and work in progress); or a charge over shares. In other instances, a client's facilities may be secured by collateral with value less than the carrying amount of the credit exposure. These facilities are deemed partly secured or unsecured.\n\n231\n\n<!-- image -->",

VaR measures potential loss using historically observed market movements and correlation between different markets.\n\nVaR is modelled at a 99.0% confidence level. This means that there is a 99.0% probability that the loss will not exceed the  VaR estimate on any given day.\n\nThe VaR measured for traded market risk uses two years of daily movement in market rates. The VaR measure for non-traded banking book market risk uses six years of daily movement in market rates.\n\nA 10-day holding period is used for trading book positions. A 20-day holding period is used for interest rate risk in the banking book.\n\nVaR is driven by historical observations and is not an estimate of the maximum loss that the Group could experience from an extreme market event. As a result of this limitation, management also uses stress testing to measure the potential for economic loss at confidence levels significantly higher than 99.0%. Management then uses these results in decisions to manage the economic impact of market risk positions.\n\n| Total market risk VaR (10-day 99.0% confidence)   | Average June 2021 1 $M   | As at June 2021 $M   | Average June 2020 1 $M   | As at June 2020 $M   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| Traded market risk                                | 75. 7                    | 72. 7                | 48. 9                    | 39. 3                |\n| Non-traded interest rate risk  2                  | 410. 5                   | 243. 0               | 258. 4                   | 479. 7               |\n\n## Traded market risk\n\nTraded market risk is generated through the Group's participation in financial markets to service its customers.

The maturity transformation activities of the Group create mismatches in the repricing terms of asset and liability positions. These mismatches may have undesired earnings and value outcomes depending on the interest rate movements. The Group's objective is to manage interest rate risk to achieve stable and sustainable net interest income in the long-term.\n\nThe Group measures and manages the impact of interest rate risk in two ways:\n\n## (a) Next 12 months' earnings\n\nInterest rate risk from an earnings perspective is the impact based on changes to the Net interest income over the next 12 months.\n\nThe risk to Net interest income over the next 12 months from changes in interest rates is measured on a monthly basis.\n\nEarnings risk is measured through sensitivity analysis, which applies an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel shock in interest rates across the yield curve.\n\nThe prospective change to the Net interest income is measured by using an Asset and Liability Management simulation model which incorporates both existing and anticipated new business in its assessment. The change in the Balance Sheet product mix, growth, funding and pricing strategies is incorporated.\n\nAssets and liabilities that reprice directly from observable market rates are measured based on the full extent of the rate shock that is applied.\n\nProducts that are priced based on Group administered or discretionary interest rates and that are impacted by customer behaviour are measured by taking into consideration the historic repricing strategy of the Group and repricing behaviours of customers. In addition to considering how the products have been repriced in the past the expected change in price based on both the current and anticipated competitive market forces are also considered in the sensitivity analysis.\n\nThe amounts in the following table represent the potential unfavourable change to the Group's net interest earnings during the year based on a 100 basis point parallel rate shock. As the official cash rate was 0.1% in Australia and 0.25% in New Zealand as at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: 0.25% in Australia and New Zealand), a downward rate shock of 100 basis points implies a 0.90% negative interest rate for Australia and a 0.75% negative interest rate for New Zealand (30 June 2020: 0.75% negative interest rate for Australia and New Zealand). The analysis for AUD as at 30 June 2021 reflects updates to management asset pricing strategies for a 100 basis point reduction in interest rates.\n\n| Net interest earnings at risk  1   |     | June 2021 $M   | June 2 2020 $M   |\n|------------------------------------|-----|----------------|------------------|\n| Average monthly exposure           | AUD | 1,793. 3       | 1,008. 7         |\n|                                    | NZD | 288. 0         | 106. 3           |\n| High monthly exposure              | AUD | 2,346. 5       | 1,682. 0         |\n| Low monthly exposure               | NZD | 331. 4         | 215. 9           |\n|                                    | AUD | 765. 0         | 506. 7           |\n|                                    | NZD | 212. 4         | 47. 3            |\n| As at balance date                 | AUD | 1,036. 0       | 1,682. 0         |\n|                                    | NZD | 310. 3         | 166. 2           |\n\n## (b) Economic value\n\nInterest rate risk from the economic value perspective is based on a 20-day 99.0% VaR measure.\n\nMeasuring the change in the economic value of equity is an assessment of the long-term impact to the earnings potential of the Group present valued to the current date. The Group assesses the potential change in its economic value of equity through the application of the VaR methodology.\n\nA 20-day 99.0% VaR measure is used to capture the net economic value impact over the long-term or total life of all Balance Sheet assets and liabilities to adverse changes in interest rates.\n\nThe impact of customer prepayments on the contractual cash flows for fixed rate products is included in the calculation. Cash flows for discretionary priced products are behaviourally adjusted and repriced at the resultant profile.\n\nThe figures in the following table represent the net present value of the expected change in the Group's future earnings in all future periods for the remaining term of all existing assets and liabilities.\n\n233\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group's only material exposure to this risk arises from its operations in New Zealand, Asia, USA and the Netherlands.\n\n## Lease residual value risk\n\nThe Group takes lease residual value risk on assets such as industrial, mining, rail, aircraft, marine, and other equipment. A lease residual value guarantee exposes the Group to a potential fall in prices of these assets below the guarantee level at lease expiry.\n\n## Commonwealth Bank Group Super Fund\n\nThe Commonwealth Bank Group Super Fund (the Fund) has a defined benefit portion that creates market risk for the Group.\n\nRisk management provides oversight of the market risks associated with the assets invested on behalf of the CBA employees receiving defined benefits including pensioners (refer to Note 10.2). Monthly updates are provided to the Fund Trustee and a committee chaired by Human Resources.\n\n234\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.4 Liquidity and funding risk\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe Group's liquidity and funding policies are designed to ensure it will meet its obligations as and when they fall due by ensuring it is able to issue debt on an unsecured or secured basis, has sufficient liquid assets to borrow against under repurchase agreements or sell to raise immediate funds without adversely affecting the Group's net asset value.\n\nThe Group's liquidity policies are designed  to ensure it maintains sufficient cash balances and liquid asset holdings to meet its obligations to customers, in both ordinary market conditions and during periods of extreme stress. These policies are intended to protect the value of the Group's operations during periods of unfavourable market conditions.\n\nThe Group's funding policies are designed to achieve diversified sources of funding by product, term, maturity date, investor  type, investor location, currency and concentration, on a cost effective basis. This objective applies to the Group's wholesale and retail funding activities.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk management f ramework\n\nThe CBA Board is ultimately responsible for the sound and prudent management of liquidity risk across the Group. The Group's liquidity and funding policies, structured under a formal Group Liquidity and Funding Risk Management Framework, are approved by the Board and agreed with APRA. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) charter includes reviewing the management of assets and liabilities, reviewing liquidity and funding policies and strategies, as well as regularly monitoring compliance with those policies across the Group. Group Treasury manages the Group's liquidity and funding positions in accordance with the Group's Liquidity Policy and supporting standards, and has ultimate authority to execute liquidity and funding decisions should the Group Contingency Funding Plan be activated. Risk Management provides oversight of the Group's liquidity and funding risks, compliance with Group policies and manages the Group's relationship with prudential regulators.\n\nSubsidiaries within the Group apply their own liquidity and funding strategies to address their specific needs. The Group's New Zealand banking subsidiary, ASB, manages its own domestic liquidity and funding needs in accordance with its own liquidity policy and the policies of the Group. ASB's liquidity policy is also overseen by the RBNZ.\n\n## Liquidity and funding policies and m anagement\n\nThe Group's liquidity and funding policies provide that:\n\n- \u00b7 an excess of liquid assets over the minimum prescribed under APRA's LCR requirement is maintained. Australian ADIs are required to meet a 100% LCR, calculated as the ratio of high quality liquid assets to 30 day net cash outflows projected under a prescribed stress scenario;\n- \u00b7 a  surplus of stable funding from various sources, as measured by APRA's Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), is maintained. The NSFR is calculated by applying factors prescribed by APRA to assets and liabilities to determine a ratio of required stable funding to available stable funding which must be greater than 100%;\n- \u00b7 additional internal funding and liquidity metrics are calculated and stress tests additional to the LCR are run;\n- \u00b7 short and long-term wholesale funding limits are established, monitored and reviewed regularly;\n- \u00b7 the Group's wholesale funding market capacity is regularly assessed and used as a factor in funding strategies;\n- \u00b7 liquid assets are held in Australian dollar and foreign currency denominated securities in accordance with expected requirements;\n- \u00b7 the Group has three categories of liquid assets within its domestic liquid assets portfolio. The first includes cash, government and Australian semi-government securities. The second includes Negotiable Certificates of Deposit, bank term securities, supranational bonds, Australian Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and other securities that meet RBA criteria for purchases under repurchase agreements. The final category is internal RMBS, being mortgages that have been securitised but retained by the Bank, that are repo-eligible with the RBA using the Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) and Term Funding Facility (TFF); and\n- \u00b7 offshore branches and subsidiaries adhere to liquidity policies and hold appropriate foreign currency liquid assets to meet required regulations.\n\nThe Group's key funding tools include:\n\n- \u00b7 consumer retail funding base, which includes a wide range of retail transaction accounts, savings accounts and term deposits for individual consumers;\n- \u00b7 small business customer and institutional deposit base;\n- \u00b7 wholesale domestic and international funding programmes, which include Australian dollar Negotiable Certificates of Deposit, US and Euro Commercial Paper programmes, Australian dollar Domestic  Debt Programme, US Medium-Term Note Programmes, Euro Medium-Term Note Programme, multi jurisdiction Covered Bond programme and Medallion securitisation programmes; and\n- \u00b7 access to the RBA Term Funding Facility (TFF) and RBNZ term lending facilities.\n\n235\n\n<!-- image -->",

On initial recognition, the transaction price generally represents the fair value of the financial instrument, unless there is observable information from an active market that provides a more appropriate fair value.\n\nThe fair value for financial instruments traded in active markets at the reporting date is based on their quoted market price or dealer price quotations, without any deduction for transaction costs. Assets and long positions are measured at a quoted bid price, liabilities and short positions are measured at a quoted asking price. Where the Group has positions with offsetting market risks, mid-market prices are used to measure the offsetting risk positions and a quoted bid or asking price adjustment is applied only to the net open position as appropriate.\n\nNon-market quoted financial instruments are mostly valued using valuation techniques based on observable inputs except where observable market data is unavailable. Where market data is unavailable the financial instrument is initially recognised at the transaction price, which is generally the best indicator of fair value. This may differ from the value obtained from the valuation model. The timing of the recognition in the Income Statement of this initial difference in fair value depends on the individual facts and circumstances of each transaction, but is never later than when the market data becomes observable. The difference may be either amortised over the life of the transaction, recognised when the inputs become observable or on derecognition of the instrument, as appropriate.\n\nThe fair value of Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives includes credit valuation adjustments (CVA) for derivative assets to reflect the credit worthiness of the counterparty. Fair value of uncollateralised derivative assets and uncollateralised derivative liabilities incorporate funding valuation adjustments (FVA) to reflect funding costs and benefits to the Group. These adjustments are applied after considering any relevant collateral or master netting arrangements.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe Group utilises various valuation techniques and applies a hierarchy for valuation inputs that maximise the use of observable market data, if available.\n\nUnder AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement all financial and non-financial assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value are categorised into one of the following three fair value hierarchy levels:\n\n## Quoted prices in active markets - Level 1\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities for which the valuation is determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis. An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\nFinancial instruments included in this category are liquid government bonds, listed equities and exchange traded derivatives.\n\n## Valuation technique using observable inputs - Level 2\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities that have been valued using inputs other than quoted prices as described for Level 1, but which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The valuation techniques include the use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models and other market accepted valuation models.\n\nFinancial instruments included in this category are financial institution and corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, bank bills, commercial papers, mortgage-backed securities and OTC derivatives including interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and FX options.\n\n## Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs - Level 3\n\nThis category includes assets and liabilities where the valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). Unobservable inputs are those not readily available in an active market due to market illiquidity or complexity of the product. These inputs are generally derived and extrapolated from observable inputs to match the risk profile of the financial instrument, and are calibrated against current market assumptions, historic transactions and economic models, where available. These inputs may include the timing and amount of future cash flows, rates of estimated credit losses, discount rates and volatility. Financial instruments included in this category for the Group and Bank are certain exotic OTC derivatives and unlisted equity instruments.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the Group held an unlisted equity investment in Klarna Bank AB (Klarna) measured on a recurring basis at fair value through other comprehensive income of $2,701 million (30 June 2020: $506 million). The valuation of the investment as at 30 June 2021 was based on a methodology leveraging revenue multiples of market listed comparable companies, as well as inputs relating to a recent private equity capital raise executed by Klarna. Comparable listed companies were included based on industry, size, developmental stage and/or strategy. A revenue multiple was derived for each comparable company identified and then discounted for considerations such as illiquidity and differences between the comparable companies and Klarna based on company-specific facts and circumstances. The range of implied revenue multiples applied by the Group in assessing the fair value was 29-36x. The Group adopted a revenue multiple of 32x in its valuation as at 30 June 2021. The effect of adjusting the revenue multiples by +/-25% representing a range of reasonably possible alternatives would be to increase the fair value by up to $225 million or to decrease the fair value by up to $225 million with all of the potential effect impacting the Investment securities revaluation reserve.\n\nThe valuation as at 30 June 2020 was based on a different methodology on the basis that there were no private equity capital raises executed by the entity close to the balance sheet date. The methodology leveraged revenue multiples of market listed comparable companies and significant unobservable inputs including adjustments for market volatility and liquidity. The range of revenue multiples applied by the Group was 9x-10x. The effect of adjusting these inputs by +/- 15% would be to increase the fair value by up to $75 million or to decrease the fair value by up to $75 million with all of the potential effect impacting Investment securities revaluation reserve.\n\n244\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 9.5 Disclosures about fair values (continued)\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of the announced acquisition by Square, Inc. of Afterpay Limited on 2 August 2021 on the valuation of its holding in Klarna. Given consideration to the control premium inherent in this transaction there is no material difference in the Group's valuation of Klarna.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimates\n\nValuation techniques are used to estimate the fair value of securities. When using valuation techniques the Group makes maximum use of market inputs and relies as little as possible on entity specific inputs. It incorporates all factors that the Group believes market participants would consider in setting a price and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments. Data inputs that the Group relies upon when valuing financial instruments relate to counterparty credit risk, volatility, correlation and extrapolation.\n\nPeriodically, the Group calibrates its valuation techniques and tests them for validity using prices from any observable current market transaction in the same instruments (i.e. without modification or repackaging) and any other available observable market data.\n\n## 9.6 Collateral arrangements\n\n## Collateral accepted as security for assets\n\nThe Group takes collateral where it is considered necessary to support both on and off Balance Sheet financial instruments. The Group evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral taken, if deemed necessary, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.

other Balance Sheet lines.\n- 2  For the purpose of this disclosure, the related amounts of financial instruments and financial collateral not set off on the Balance Sheet have been capped by relevant netting agreements so as not to exceed the net amounts of financial assets/(liabilities) reported on the Balance Sheet, i.e. over collateralisation, where it exists, is not reflected in the tables. As a result the above collateral balances will not correspond to the tables in Note 9.6.\n- 3  Includes $105 million of receivables and $172 million of payables of AUSIEX presented within assets and

All outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied if an event of default or other predetermined events occur. Financial collateral refers to cash and non-cash collateral obtained to cover the net exposure between counterparties by enabling the collateral to be realised in an event of default or if other predetermined events occur.\n\n## Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and security lending agreements\n\nThe 'Financial Instruments' column identifies financial assets and liabilities that are subject to set off under netting agreements, such as global master repurchase agreements and global master securities lending agreements. Under these netting agreements, all outstanding transactions with the same counterparty can be offset and close-out netting applied if an event of default or other predetermined events occur. Financial collateral typically comprises highly liquid securities which are legally transferred and can be liquidated in the event of counterparty default.\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the Balance Sheet if, and only if, there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts, and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n248\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee benefits\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe Group employs over 50,000 people across multiple jurisdictions and remunerates its employees through both fixed and variable arrangements. This section outlines details of the share-based payment and superannuation components of employee remuneration and provides an overview of key management personnel arrangements.\n\n## 10.1 Share-based payments\n\nThe Group operates a number of cash and equity settled share plans as detailed below.\n\n## Long Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR)\n\nThe Group's LTVR awards to the CEO, Group Executives and CEO of ASB have been made under the Employee Equity Plan (EEP) since the 2019 financial year award (2020 financial year for CEO ASB). The 2018 financial year LTVR award was made under the Group Leadership  Reward Plan (GLRP). LTVR focuses efforts on longer-term performance achievement,  including  with a focus on relative shareholder returns to support creation of sustainable long-term shareholder value.\n\nParticipants are awarded a maximum number of performance rights, which may convert into CBA shares on a one-for-one basis. The Board has discretion to apply a cash equivalent.\n\nThe rights granted up to the 2020 financial year award may vest at the end of a performance period of four years subject to the satisfaction of performance measures as described below.\n\nFor awards made from the 2018 to 2020 financial year to the CEO and Group Executives:\n\n- \u00b7 75% of the award is assessed against Total Shareholder Return (TSR) compared to the 20 largest companies listed on the ASX (by market capitalisation) at the beginning of each respective performance period, excluding resource companies and CBA.\n- \u00b7 12.5% of the award is assessed against a Relative Trust and Reputation measure; and\n- \u00b7 12.5% of the award is assessed against an Absolute Employee Engagement measure.\n\nFor the 2020 financial year award made to the CEO of ASB:\n\n- \u00b7 50% of the award is assessed against TSR compared to the 20 largest companies listed on the ASX (by market capitalisation) at the beginning of each respective performance period, excluding resource companies and CBA.\n- \u00b7 25% of the award is assessed against an ASB Relative Trust and Reputation measure; and\n- \u00b7 25% of the award is assessed against an ASB Absolute Employee Engagement measure.\n\nFor the 2018, 2019 and 2020 financial year awards (including the CEO ASB 2020 financial year award), a positive TSR gateway applies to the Trust and Reputation and Employee Engagement measures.\n\nFor awards made in the 2021 financial year to the CEO, Group Executives and CEO of ASB, the performance rights will be tested against the following performance measures at the end of four years and the number of performance rights will be adjusted accordingly:\n\n- \u00b7 50% of the award is assessed against TSR compared to the 20 largest companies listed on the ASX (by market capitalisation) at the beginning of the performance period, excluding resource companies and CBA (ASX General).\n- \u00b7 50% of the award is assessed against TSR compared to a peer group of 8 financial services companies determined by the Board (Financial Services).\n\nAny performance rights that remain on foot after the performance test will be subject to a further holding period in two equal tranches of two and three years for the CEO, and one and two years for other participants. Refer to the Remuneration Report for further details on LTVR.\n\nThe following table provides details of outstanding awards of Rights granted under LTVR awards.\n\n|   Period | Outstanding 1 July   | Granted   | Vested    | Forfeited   | Outstanding 30 June   | Expense ($'000)   |\n|----------|----------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n|     2021 | 951,413              | 161,458   | (129,727) | (83,852)    | 899,292               | 6,807             |\n|     2020 | 808,519              | 322,283   | (33,009)  | (146,380)   | 951,413               | 7,566             |\n\nThe fair value at the grant date for the ASX general TSR measure was $38.43 and $39.08 for the Financial Services measure (2020: $34.07 for TSR and $57.86 for both Trust and Reputation and Employee Engagement). The fair value of the performance rights granted during the period has been independently calculated at grant date using a Monte Carlo pricing model based on market information and excluding the  impact of non-market performance conditions. The assumptions included in the valuations of the 2021 financial year awards include a share price of $74.50, a risk-free interest rate of 0.17%, a 3.92% dividend yield on the Bank's ordinary shares and a volatility in the Bank's share price of 25%.\n\n249\n\n<!-- image -->",

Shares granted are restricted from sale until the earlier of three years or until such time as the participant ceases employment with the Group. Participants receive full dividend entitlements and voting rights attached to those shares.\n\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2021 the Board approved an award of $1,000 to each eligible employee to recognise their contribution through-out the year.\n\nThe following table provides details of shares granted under the ESAP.\n\n|   Period | Allocation date   | Participants   |   Number of shares allocated per participant | Total number of shares allocated   |   Issue price $ | Total fair value ($'000)   |\n|----------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|\n|     2021 | 20 Nov 2020       | 32,017         |                                           13 | 416,221                            |           75.82 | 31,558                     |\n|     2020 | 4 Nov 2019        | 30,653         |                                           12 | 367,836                            |           80.29 | 29,534                     |\n\nIt is estimated that approximately $32 million of CBA shares will be awarded under the 2021 grant.\n\n## Other employee awards\n\nA number of other plans are operated by the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 The Employee Share (Performance Unit) Plan and EEP Cash Settled Rights are cash-based equity awards;\n- \u00b7 EEP rights for certain employees based overseas; and\n- \u00b7 The International Employee Share Acquisition Plan which is the cash-based version of the ESAP.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the movement in awards during the year.\n\n|   Period | Outstanding 1 July   | Granted   | Vested/exercised   | Forfeited   | Outstanding 30 June   | Expense ($'000)   |\n|----------|----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n|     2021 | 342,304              | 142,985   | (186,231)          | (57,359)    | 241,699               | 1,246             |\n|     2020 | 381,424              | 192,643   | (203,833)          | (27,930)    | 342,304               | 9,449             |\n\nThe weighted average fair value at grant date of the awards issued during the year was $65.38 (2020: $79.62).\n\n250\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 10.1 Share-based payments (continued)\n\n## Salary sacrifice arrangements\n\nThe Group facilitates the purchase of CBA shares via salary sacrifice as follows:\n\n| Type                     | Arrangements                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Salary sacrifice         | \u00b7   Australian  based  employees  and  Non-Executive  Directors  can  elect  to  sacrifice  between  $2,000  and  $5,000 p.a. of their fixed remuneration and/or annual STVR or fees (in the case of Non-Executive Directors). |\n|                          | \u00b7   Restricted from sale for a minimum of two years and a maximum of seven years or earlier, if the employee  ceases employment with the Group (or retires from the Group in the case of Non-Executive Directors).             |\n| Non-Executive  Directors | \u00b7   Non-Executive Directors can elect to apply a percentage of after-tax fees towards the acquisition of CBA shares.                                                                                                           |\n\nShares are purchased on market at the prevailing market price at that time and receive full dividend entitlements and voting rights.

The plans are managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of each trust deed and relevant legislation. The funding of the plans complies with regulations in Australia and the UK respectively.\n\n## Funding and contributions\n\n## Commonwealth Bank Group Super\n\nAn actuarial assessment as at 30 June 2018 showed Commonwealth Bank Group Super remained in funding surplus. The Bank agreed to continue contributions of $20 million per month to the plan. This was increased to $25 million in December 2020. In the second half of the financial year ended 30 June 2020, the Bank made an additional lump sum contribution of $60 million to ensure the Fund remained in funding surplus amid financial market volatility caused by COVID-19. Employer contributions paid to the plan are subject to tax at the rate of 15% in the plan.\n\nThe Group's expected contributions to Commonwealth Bank Group Super for the year ended 30 June 2022 are $300 million.\n\n## CBA (UK) SBS\n\nOn 17 June 2021, the trustees of CBA (UK) SBS executed a GBP426.6 million bulk annuity insurance policy. The insurance policy was purchased using the existing assets of the Scheme. The transaction secured an insurance asset that fully matches the remaining pension liabilities of the Scheme, and is therefore measured at an amount that matches the scheme liabilities. The Group has no further obligation to make payments in to the Scheme  but retains responsibility for the benefits provided to the Scheme members. In accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits , the impact of this transaction was to record a remeasurement loss of GBP62 million in other comprehensive income.\n\n251\n\n<!-- image -->",

Holding more than 50% of an entity's voting rights typically indicates that the Group has control over the entity. Significant judgement is involved where either the Group is deemed to control an entity despite holding less than 50% of the voting rights, or where the Group does not control an entity despite holding more than 50% of the voting rights.\n\n## Agent or principal\n\nThe Group is deemed to have power over an investment fund when it holds either the responsible entity (RE) and/or the manager function  of  that  fund.  Whether  that  power  translates  to  control  depends  on  whether  the  Group  is  deemed  to  act  as  an  agent  or  a principal of that fund. Management have determined that the Group acts as a principal and controls a fund when it cannot be easily removed as a manager or RE by investors and when its economic interest in that fund is substantial compared to the economic interest of other investors. In all other cases the Group acts as agent and does not control the fund.\n\n## Significant restrictions\n\nOn 2 April 2020, RBNZ announced a freeze on the distribution of dividends by banks in New Zealand due to COVID-19. On 31 March 2021, RBNZ removed the freeze and allowed the banks to distribute up to 50% of their earnings as dividends. As a result there is currently a restriction on payment of dividends by ASB Bank Limited, the Group's New Zealand subsidiary.\n\nThere were no other significant restrictions on the ability to transfer cash or other assets, pay dividends or other capital distributions, provide or repay loans and advances between the entities within the Group. There were also no significant restrictions on the Group's ability to access or use the assets and settle the liabilities of the Group resulting from protective rights of non-controlling interests.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nThere  were  no  individually  significant  investments  in  associates  or  joint  ventures  held  by  the  Group  as  at  30 June 2021  and 30 June 2020. In addition, there were no significant restrictions on the ability of associates or joint ventures to transfer funds to the Bank or its subsidiaries in the form of cash dividends or to repay loans or advances made.\n\nThe Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are shown in the table below.\n\n|                                                                  | Group        | Group        | Group                          | Group                                    | Group                  | Group                    | Group        |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------|\n|                                                                  | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M | 30 Jun 21 Ownership interest % | 30 Jun 20 Ownership Principal interest % | activities             | Country of incorporation | Balance date |\n| Bank of Hangzhou Co., Ltd                                        | 2,171        | 1,812        | 16                             |                                          | 16 Commercial  banking | China                    | 31-Dec       |\n| Qilu Bank Co., Ltd                                               | 817          | 760          | 16                             |                                          | 18 Commercial  banking | China                    | 31-Dec       |\n| Lendi Group Pty Ltd  1                                           | 393          | -            | 42                             | -                                        | Mortgage  broking      | Australia                | 30-Jun       |\n| Vietnam International Commercial  Joint Stock Bank (VIB)         | 333          | 294          | 20                             |                                          | 20 Commercial  banking | Vietnam                  | 31-Dec       |\n| Other                                                            | 227          | 168          | Various                        | Various                                  | Various                | Various                  | Various      |\n| Carrying amount of investments  in associates and joint ventures | 3,941        | 3,034        |                                |                                          |                        |                          |              |\n\n|                                                 | Group        | Group        |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Share of associates' and joint ventures profits | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Operating profits before income tax             | 436          | 437          |\n| Income tax expense                              | (60)         | (55)         |\n| Operating profits after income tax  2           | 376          | 382          |\n\n- 1  On 16 December 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to merge Aussie Home Loans with Lendi, an online home loan platform. Upon completion, the Group retained a 44% shareholding in the combined business. Subsequently, on 7 May 2021, the Group sold a portion of its investment, at no gain or loss, reducing its shareholding to 42%.\n- 2  This amount is recognised net of impairment in the share of profits of associates and joint ventures within Other banking income.\n\n257\n\n<!-- image -->",

Structured entities are generally  created  to  achieve  a  narrow  and  well  defined  objective  with  restrictions  around  their  ongoing  activities.  Depending  on  the Group's power over the activities of the entity and its exposure to and ability to influence its own returns, it may consolidate the entity. In other cases, it may sponsor or have exposure to such an entity but not consolidate it.\n\n## Consolidated structured entities\n\nThe Group has the following contractual arrangements which require it to provide financial support to its structured entities.\n\n## Securitisation structured entities\n\nThe Group provides liquidity facilities to Medallion and Medallion NZ structured entities. The liquidity facilities can only be drawn to cover cash flow shortages relating to mismatches in timing of cash inflows due from securitised asset pools and cash outflows due to note holders. These 'timing mismatch' facilities rank pari passu with other senior secured creditors. The facilities limit is $1,494  million (2020: $1,647 million). This includes $1,255 million (30 June 2020: $1,350 million) in relation to the structured entity where the Bank holds all of the issued instruments.\n\nThe Group has no contractual obligations to purchase assets from its securitisation structured entities.\n\n## Covered bonds trust\n\nThe Group provides funding and support facilities to CBA Covered Bond Trust and ASB Covered Bond Trust (the 'Trusts'). The Trusts are bankruptcy remote SPVs that guarantee any debt obligations owing under the US$30 billion CBA Covered Bond Programme and the  EUR7 billion  ASB  Covered  Bond  Programme,  respectively.  The  funding  facilities  allow  the  Trusts  to  hold  sufficient  residential mortgage loans to support the guarantees provided to the Covered Bonds. The Group also provides various swaps to the Trusts to hedge  any  interest  rate  and  currency  mismatches.  The  Group,  either  directly  or  via  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries,  Securitisation Advisory  Services  Pty  Limited  and  Securitisation  Management  Services  Limited,  provides  various  services  to  the  Trusts  including servicing and monitoring of the residential mortgages.\n\n## Structured asset finance structured entities\n\nThe Group has no contractual obligation to provide financial support to any of its structured asset finance structured entities.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2021, the Bank entered into a debt forgiveness arrangement with two wholly owned structured entities for a total of $85 million (2020: $4 million). The financial impact of the debt forgiveness was fully eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nThe  Group  has  exposure  to  various  securitisation  vehicles  via  Residential  Mortgage-backed  Securities  (RMBS)  and  Asset-backed Securities (ABS). The Group may also provide derivatives and other commitments to these vehicles. The Group also has exposure to investment funds and other financing vehicles.\n\n## Securitisations\n\nSecuritisations involve transferring assets into an entity that sells beneficial interests to investors through the issue of debt and equity notes with varying levels of subordination. The notes are collateralised by the assets transferred to these vehicles and pay a return based on the returns of those assets, with residual returns paid to the most subordinated investor.\n\nThe Group may trade or invest in RMBS and ABS, which are backed by Commercial Properties, Consumer Receivables, Equipment and Auto Finance. The Group may also provide lending, derivatives, liquidity and commitments to these securitisation entities.\n\n## Other financing\n\nAsset-backed entities are used to provide tailored lending for the purchase or lease of assets transferred by the Group or its clients. The assets  are  normally  pledged  as  collateral  to  the  lenders.  The  Group  engages  in  raising  finance  for  assets  such  as  aircraft,  trains, vessels and other infrastructure. The Group may also provide lending, derivatives, liquidity and commitments to these entities.\n\n## Investment funds\n\nThe Group conducts investment management and other fiduciary activities as responsible entity, trustee, custodian, advisor or manager for  investment  funds  and  trusts,  including  superannuation  and  approved  deposit  funds,  wholesale  and  retail  trusts.  The  Group's exposure  to  investment funds  includes  holding  units  in  the  investment  funds  and  trusts,  providing  lending  facilities,  derivatives  and receiving fees for services.\n\nThe nature and extent of the Group's interests in these entities are summarised below. Interests do not include derivatives and other positions where the Group creates rather than absorbs variability of the structured entity, for example deposits the funds place with the Group. These have been excluded from the tables on pages 259-260.\n\n258\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 11.1 Investments in subsidiaries and other entities (continued)\n\n|                                                          | 30 Jun 21   | 30 Jun 21   | 30 Jun 21          | 30 Jun 21           | 30 Jun 21   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Exposures to unconsolidated structured entities          | RMBS $M     | ABS $M      | Other financing $M | Investment funds $M | Total $M    |\n| Investment securities                                    | 4,918       | 121         | -                  | -                   | 5,039       |\n| Loans, bills discounted and other receivables            | 4,375       | 2,350       | 3,322              | 7,998               | 18,045      |\n| Assets held for sale                                     | -           | -           | -                  | 414                 | 414         |\n| Total on Balance Sheet exposures                         | 9,293       | 2,471       | 3,322              | 8,412               | 23,498      |\n| Total notional amounts of off Balance Sheet exposures  1 | 4,027       | 946         | 422                | 4,621               | 10,016      |\n| Total maximum exposure to loss                           | 13,320      | 3,417       | 3,744              | 13,033              | 33,514      |\n| Total assets of the entities  2                          | 50,581      | 11,846      | 12,046             | 184,859             | 259,332     |\n\n|                                                          | 30 Jun 20   | 30 Jun 20   | 30 Jun 20          | 30 Jun 20           | 30 Jun 20   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------|\n| Exposures to unconsolidated structured entities          | RMBS $M     | ABS $M      | Other financing $M | Investment funds $M | Total $M    |\n| Investment securities                                    | 5,752       | 287         | -                  | -                   | 6,039       |\n| Loans, bills discounted and other receivables            | 5,346       | 1,494       | 4,857              | 6,082               | 17,779      |\n| Assets held for sale                                     | -           | -           | -                  | 354                 | 354         |\n| Total on Balance Sheet exposures                         | 11,098      | 1,781       | 4,857              | 6,436               | 24,172      |\n| Total notional amounts of off Balance Sheet exposures  1 | 1,721       | 1,331       | 490                | 6,191               | 9,733       |\n| Total maximum exposure to loss                           | 12,819      | 3,112       | 5,347              | 12,627              | 33,905      |\n| Total assets of the entities  2                          | 56,406      | 8,585       | 15,660             | 161,658             | 242,309     |\n\nThe Group's exposure to loss depends on the level of subordination of the interest, which indicates the extent to which other parties are obliged to absorb credit losses before the Group.

Subsidiaries  are  entities  (including structured entities) over which the Bank has control. The Bank controls an entity when it has:\n\n- \u00b7 power over the relevant activities of the entity, for example through voting or other rights;\n- \u00b7 exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from the Bank's involvement with the entity; and\n- \u00b7 the ability to use its power over the entity to affect the Bank's returns from the entity.\n\n## Consolidation of structured entities\n\nThe Group exercises judgement at inception and periodically thereafter, to assess whether that structured entity should be consolidated based  on  the  Bank's  power  over  the  relevant  activities  of  the  entity  and  the  significance  of  its  exposure  to  variable  returns  of  the structured  entity.  Such  assessments  are  predominately  required  for  the  Group's  securitisation  program,  structured  transactions  and involvement with investment funds.\n\nTransactions between subsidiaries in the Group are eliminated. Non-controlling interests and the related share of profits in subsidiaries are  shown  separately  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement,  Statement  of  Comprehensive  Income,  Statement  of  Cash  Flows,  and Balance Sheet. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and de-consolidated when control ceases. Subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairments at the Bank level.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. At the acquisition date, the cost of the business is the fair value of  the  purchase  consideration,  measured  as  the  aggregate  of  the  fair  values  of  assets  transferred,  equity  instruments  issued,  or liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.\n\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at fair value on the acquisition date. Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Group's share of assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of acquisition. If there is a deficit instead, this discount on acquisition  is  recognised  directly  in  the  consolidated  Income  Statement,  but  only  after  a  reassessment  of  the  identification  and measurement of the net assets acquired.\n\n## Investments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates  and  joint  ventures  are  entities  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence  or  joint  control,  but  not  control.  In  the consolidated financial report, they are equity accounted. They are initially recorded at cost and adjusted for the Group's share of the associates' and joint ventures' post-acquisition profits or losses and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI), less any dividends received. At the Bank level, they are accounted for at cost less accumulated impairments.\n\nThe Group assesses, at each Balance Sheet date, whether there is any objective evidence of impairment. If there is an indication that an investment may be impaired, then the entire carrying amount of the investment in associate or joint venture is tested for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair value less disposal costs) with the carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement are subsequently reversed through the Income Statement if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.\n\n260\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 11.2 Related party disclosures\n\nBanking transactions are entered into with related parties in the normal course of business on an arm's length basis. These include loans, deposits and foreign currency transactions, upon which some fees and commissions may be earned. Details of amounts paid or received from related parties, in the form of interest or dividends, are set out in Notes 2.1 and 2.3.\n\nThe  Bank's  aggregate  investments  in,  and  loans  to  controlled  entities  are  disclosed  in  the  table  below.  Amounts  due  to  controlled entities are disclosed in the Balance Sheet of the Bank.\n\n|                                                                     | Bank         | Bank         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                                                     | 30 Jun 21 $M | 30 Jun 20 $M |\n| Shares in controlled entities                                       | 7,697        | 9,212        |\n| Loans to controlled entities at amortised cost                      | 49,523       | 56,485       |\n| Loans to controlled entities at fair value through Income Statement | 882          | 1,095        |\n| Total shares in and loans to controlled entities                    | 58,102       | 66,792       |\n\nAs at  30  June  2021,  loans  to  controlled  entities  at amortised cost  in  the  table  above  are  presented  net  of  $1  million  provisions for impairment (30 June 2020: $1 million).\n\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2020, the Group received fees on an arm's length basis of $5 million from funds that were included in assets held for sale.\n\nAs at 30 June 2020, the Bank provided a guarantee of $175 million to the Group's controlled entities that held an Australian Financial Services or Australian Credit licence in respect of certain compensation claims. During the year ended 30 June 2021, this guarantee was terminated and replaced with a professional indemnity insurance policy issued by one of the Bank's subsidiaries to the Group's controlled entities holding an Australian Financial Services or Australian Credit licence. The total amount insured under this policy as at 30 June 2021 was up to $174 million.\n\nAs at 30 June 2021, the Bank had reimbursement arrangements in place totalling $621 million (30 June 2020: $488 million), with its subsidiaries,  Avanteos  Investments  Limited, Financial  Wisdom  Limited  and  Commonwealth  Financial  Planning  Limited  (for  the Pathways business (CFP-Pathways)), to cover potential remediation of ongoing service failures to customers, deceased estates, and inappropriate advice and other matters. This amount includes $597 million for Aligned Advice remediation and $24 million for other wealth remediation programs (30 June 2020: $464 million for Aligned Advice remediation and $24 million for other wealth remediation programs). The Group and the Bank have provided for these costs. As at 30 June 2021, the Bank also had an Indemnity Deed with Count Financial  and CountPlus with a $300 million limit, to cover potential remediation of ongoing service failures to customers, deceased estates, inappropriate advice and other matters.\n\nThe Bank is the head entity of the tax consolidated group and has entered into tax funding and tax sharing agreements with its eligible Australian resident subsidiaries. The details of these agreements are set out in Note 2.5. The amount receivable by the Bank under the tax funding agreement with the tax consolidated entities is $200 million as at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: $209 million receivable). This balance is included in 'Other assets' in the Bank's separate Balance Sheet.\n\nAll transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial or operational decisions, or a separate party controls both. The definition includes subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures, pension plans as well as other persons.\n\n261\n\n<!-- image -->",

A summary of divestments completed during the years ended 30 June 2021, 30 June 2020, and 30 June 2019, as well as ongoing divestments is provided below.\n\n## Completed transactions\n\n## TymeDigital SA\n\nOn 1 November 2018, the Group completed the sale of Commonwealth Bank of South Africa (Holding Company) Limited (TymeDigital SA) to the minority shareholder, African Rainbow Capital, resulting in a total post-tax loss of $113 million.\n\n## Colonial First State Global Asset Management\n\nOn 31 October 2018, the Group announced the sale of Colonial First State Global Asset Management (CFSGAM) to Mitsubishi UFJ Trust and Banking Corporation (MUTB). The sale of CFSGAM completed on 2 August 2019, resulting in a total post tax gain of $1,617 million (net of transaction and separation costs). This includes a $1,688 million post-tax gain net of transaction and separation costs recognised during the half year ended 31 December 2019, and $71 million post-tax transaction and separation costs recognised during the year ended 30 June 2019.\n\n## Count Financial\n\nOn 13 June 2019, the Group announced the sale of its 100% interest in Count Financial Limited (Count Financial) to CountPlus Limited (CountPlus) for $2.5 million. The sale completed on 1 October 2019, resulting in a post-tax gain of $19 million (net of transaction and separation costs).

It includes customer related commitments and contingencies that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, it covers the impact of adopting new accounting standards, notes to the Statement of Cash Flows, remuneration of auditors, and details of events that have taken place subsequent to the Balance Sheet date.\n\n## 12.1 Contingent liabilities, contingent assets and commitments arising from the banking business\n\nDetails  of  contingent  liabilities  and  off  Balance  Sheet  instruments  are  presented  below  and in Note 7.1, in relation to litigation, investigations and reviews.  The  face  value  represents  the  maximum  amount  that  could  be  lost  if  the  counterparty  fails  to  meet  its financial obligations. The credit equivalent amounts are a measure of potential loss to the Group in the event of non-performance by the counterparty.  The  credit  commitments  shown  in  the  table  below  also  constitute  contingent  assets.  These  commitments  would  be classified as loans and other assets in the Balance Sheet should they be drawn upon by the customer.\n\n1\n\n|                                       | Group      | Group      | Group             | Group             |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                       | Face value | Face value | Credit equivalent | Credit equivalent |\n|                                       | 30 Jun 21  | 30 Jun 20  | 30 Jun 21         | 30 Jun 20         |\n| Credit risk related instruments       | $M         | $M         | $M                | $M                |\n| Financial guarantees                  | 5,909      | 6,720      | 3,982             | 5,244             |\n| Performance related contingencies     | 5,401      | 5,071      | 2,700             | 2,535             |\n| Commitments to provide credit         | 187,572    | 168,537    | 176,397           | 159,761           |\n| Other commitments                     | 1,639      | 2,015      | 1,631             | 2,005             |\n| Total credit risk related instruments | 200,521    | 182,343    | 184,710           | 169,545           |\n\n|                                       | Bank  1    | Bank  1    | Bank  1           | Bank  1           |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                       | Face value | Face value | Credit equivalent | Credit equivalent |\n|                                       | 30 Jun 21  | 30 Jun 20  | 30 Jun 21         | 30 Jun 20         |\n| Credit risk related instruments       | $M         | $M         | $M                | $M                |\n| Financial guarantees                  | 5,343      | 6,188      | 3,420             | 4,714             |\n| Performance related contingencies     | 5,401      | 5,071      | 2,700             | 2,535             |\n| Commitments to provide credit         | 170,014    | 152,725    | 160,519           | 145,247           |\n| Other commitments                     | 1,555      | 1,940      | 1,546             | 1,929             |\n| Total credit risk related instruments | 182,313    | 165,924    | 168,185           | 154,425           |\n\n## A ACCCCOOUUNNTTIINNGG  PPOOLLIICCIIEESS\n\nThe types of instruments included in this category are:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial guarantees are  unconditional undertakings given to support the obligations of a customer to third parties. They include documentary letters  of credit  which  are  undertakings  by  the  Group  to  pay  or  accept  drafts  drawn  by  a  supplier  of  goods  against presentation of documents in the event of payment default by a customer. Financial guarantees are recognised within other liabilities and are initially measured at their fair value, equal to the premium received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group's liability under each guarantee is measured at the higher of the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation recognised in the Income Statement  and the  expected  credit  losses.  Any  increase  in  the  liability  relating  to  financial  guarantees  is  recorded  in  the Income Statement. The premium received is recognised in the Income Statement in other operating income on a straight-line basis over the life of the guarantee.\n- \u00b7 Performance related contingencies are  undertakings  that  oblige  the  Group  to  pay  third  parties should  a  customer fail to  fulfil  a contractual non-monetary obligation. Performance related contingencies are performance guarantees and do not meet the definition of a financial guarantee. Performance guarantees are recognised when it is probable that an obligation has arisen. The amount of any provision is the best estimate of the amount required to fulfil the obligation.\n- \u00b7 Commitments to provide credit include  obligations  on  the  part  of  the  Group to  provide credit  facilities  against  which clients can borrow money under defined terms and conditions. Such loan commitments are made either for a fixed period, or are cancellable by the Group subject to notice conditions. As facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect  future  cash  requirements.  Loan  commitments  must  be  measured  with  reference  to  expected  credit  losses  required  to  be recognised. In the case of undrawn loan commitments, the inherent credit risk is managed and monitored by the Group together with the drawn component as a single credit exposure. The exposure at default on the entire facility is used to calculate the cumulative expected credit losses.\n- \u00b7 Other commitments to provide credit include commitments with certain drawdowns, standby letters of credit and bill endorsements. The details of the Group's accounting policies and critical judgements and estimates involved in calculating impairment provisions are provided in Note 3.2.\n\n265\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Financial Stability Board's (FSB) Official Sector Steering Group (OSSG) coordinates international efforts on benchmark reform and the transition from LIBOR. In March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the date on which LIBOR will cease, after which representative LIBOR rates will no longer be available. The cessation date for all tenors of GBP, CHF, EUR and JPY LIBOR and the one week and two-month tenors for USD LIBOR is 31 December 2021. The cessation date for the remaining USD LIBOR tenors is 30 June 2023. Market-led working groups in respective jurisdictions have recommended alternative risk-free reference rates (RFRs), which are gradually being adopted.\n\nThe Group is exposed to LIBORs through various financial instruments including loans, investment and trading securities, derivatives, debt issues, deposits and other public borrowings. Existing LIBOR-referencing contracts that mature beyond their respective LIBOR cessation dates are generally expected to be amended to reference an alternative RFR. Industry working groups have worked with authorities and consulted with market participants to develop market practices that may facilitate the transition of LIBOR-referencing contracts to RFRs. In addition, contractual clauses have been developed that 'trigger' a transition from LIBOR to the respective RFR when LIBOR ceases or becomes unrepresentative.  Amongst the issues considered in contractual transition  are  the  fundamental differences between LIBORs and RFRs. RFRs are overnight rates, while LIBORs are available in multiple tenors. Additionally, LIBORs incorporate a bank credit risk premium while RFRs do not. As a result of these differences, both term and spread adjustments to the applicable fall-back RFRs are required to ensure that contracts referencing LIBOR will transition on an economically equivalent basis.\n\n## Accounting amendments and the impact on financial reporting\n\nIn response to the uncertainty with regards to the long-term viability of interest rate benchmark rates, and LIBOR in particular, the IASB announced in 2018 that it would establish a project to consider the financial reporting implications of the reform. The transition from LIBOR is expected to have an impact on various elements of financial instrument accounting, including hedge accounting, loan modifications, and fair value methodologies and disclosures.\n\nAASB 2019-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform , which amended hedge accounting requirements to provide relief from potential effects of the uncertainty caused by the interest rate benchmark reform. The amendments addressed the accounting effects of uncertainty in the period leading up to the reform. The Group early adopted the amendments for the year ended 30 June 2020.\n\nAASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2 was issued by the AASB in September 2020. The amendments apply only to those changes to financial instruments and hedging relationships, that are a direct consequence of IBOR reform and where cash flows are amended on an economically equivalent basis. The key amendments include the following:\n\n- \u00b7 A practical expedient for changes in contractual cash flows required by the reform - an entity will not have to derecognise or adjust the carrying amount of financial instruments for changes, but will instead update the effective interest rate to reflect the change to the alternative benchmark rate;\n- \u00b7 Hedge accounting -  an entity will not have to discontinue its hedge accounting solely because it makes changes required by the reform, if the hedge meets all the other hedge accounting criteria; and\n- \u00b7 Additional disclosures - an entity will be required to disclose information about new risks arising from the reform and how it manages the transition to alternative benchmark rates.\n\nThe amendments apply to the Group with effect from 1 July 2021. Note 5.4 provides further information about hedging relationships that are impacted by IBOR reform.\n\n## IBOR reform program\n\nIn October 2018, the Group formed the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Program (the Program). The Program includes a formal governance structure to  ensure clear accountability for all decisions, and incorporates the requisite risk, treasury, finance, legal, business, and support functions. The Program will ensure that customer outcomes are appropriate and will seek to minimise any disruption to business, and mitigate operational and conduct risks. The Group expects that transition will require the implementation of changes to systems, processes, and valuation models, as well as the management of tax and accounting outcomes. The Group will continue to monitor the impact on its capital position but expects the impact to be limited.\n\n## Future accounting developments\n\nAASB 112 Income Taxes has been  amended to clarify the accounting for deferred tax on transactions that, at the time of the transaction,  give  rise  to  equal  taxable  and  deductible  temporary  differences.  The  amendments  clarify  that  the  exemption  from recognising deferred tax when recognising assets or liabilities for the first time does not apply to transactions for which an entity recognises both an asset and a liability and that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. An entity is required to recognise deferred tax on such transactions. The amendments are effective for the Group from 1 July 2023 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.\n\nAASB 101 Presentation of financial statements has been amended to clarify that a liability is classified as non-current if an entity has the right at the end of the reporting period to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period, and such right has substance. The amendments also clarify that settlement of a liability refers to a transfer to the counterparty that results in the extinguishment of the liability. The amendments are effective for the Group from 1 July 2023 and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group.\n\n268\n\n\u0bd7\n\n\u0bd7\n\n\u0bd7\n\n## Notes to the financial statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2021\n\n## 12.4 Future accounting developments (continued)\n\nNarrow  scope  amendments  have  been  made  to  AASB  101 Presentation  of  financial  statements ,  Practice  Statement  2 Making Materiality  Judgements and  AASB  108 Accounting  Policies,  Changes  in  Accounting  Estimates  and  Errors that  aim  to  improve accounting policy disclosures and to help users of the financial statements to distinguish between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies. The disclosure amendments are effective for the Group from 1 July 2023.\n\nAASB 17 Insurance Contracts , amends the accounting for insurance contracts and will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts , AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts . AASB 17 will apply to the Group from 1 July 2023. The impact of AASB 17 is dependent on the Group's composition at the time of adoption. The Group is still assessing the impact of AASB 17.\n\nOther amendments that are not yet effective are not expected to result in significant changes to the Group's accounting policies.\n\n## 12.5 Subsequent events\n\n## Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP)\n\nThe Bank expects the DRP for the final dividend for the year ended 30 June 2021 will be satisfied in full by an on-market purchase of shares of approximately $557 million.\n\n## Divestment of Colonial First State\n\nOn 13 May 2020, the Group entered into an agreement to sell a 55% interest in Colonial First State (CFS) to KKR. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to complete in the second half of calendar year 2021. As a result of changes to the fee structures of certain CFS products and other impacts to the earnings of CFS associated with its separation from the Group, the Group and KKR have agreed to amend certain financial terms of the sale subsequent to 30 June 2021, including to the originally expected proceeds of $1.7 billion. These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the financial outcomes from the transaction.\n\n## Transfer of Commonwealth Financial Planning business\n\nOn 28 July 2021, the Group entered into an agreement with AIA Australia for a partial transfer of the Commonwealth Financial Planning (CFP) business to AIA Financial Services Limited.  The transaction is expected to complete in the second half of calendar year 2021. The Group expects to recognise a post-tax loss of approximately $52 million mainly resulting from the write-down of assets to fair value less cost to sell.\n\n## Share buy-back\n\nOn 11 August 2021, the Bank announced its intention to undertake an off-market buy-back of up to $6 billion of shares. Shareholder participation in the buy-back is voluntary. The Bank reserves the right to vary, suspend or terminate the buy-back at any time.\n\n## Impact of coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nThere remains significant uncertainty regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic will evolve, including the duration of the pandemic, the severity of the downturn and the speed of economic recovery. In accordance with AASB 110 Events after the Reporting Period , the Group considered whether events after the reporting period confirmed conditions existing before the reporting date. Consideration was given to the macro-economic impact of lockdowns implemented across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia; the closure of state  borders,  and  the  extension  of  further  government  support  measures.  The  Group  did  not  identify  any subsequent  events precipitated by COVID-19 related developments, which would require adjustment to the amounts or disclosures in the financial statements. Further, no other material non-adjusting subsequent events relating to COVID-19 were identified requiring disclosure in the financial  statements. Given  the  fluid  nature  of  the  current  situation,  the  Group  will  continue  to  regularly  review  forward  looking assumptions and forecast economic scenarios.\n\n269\n\n<!-- image -->",

This involved either:\n\n- \u00b7  an audit of the complete financial information of a component (full scope);\n- \u00b7  an audit of one or more of the component's account balances, classes of transactions or disclosures (specified scope); or\n- \u00b7  analytical procedures performed at the Group level and/or audit procedures at a Group level, including over the consolidation of the Group's components and the preparation of the financial report (other procedures).\n\n## Number of components by scope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSet out in the following diagram is a high-level overview of how our audit scope aligns to the identified components and our audit report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Scoping and performance of procedures   | Scoping and performance of procedures   | Reporting                                                                             | Reporting                                    |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Component                               | Audit Scope                             | Key Audit Matters                                                                     | Audit opinion                                |\n| RBS                                     | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| BB                                      | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| IB&M                                    | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| Group Treasury                          | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| NZ - ASB  1                             | Full scope                              | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n| Corporate Centre  and Other             | Other procedures                        | Areas in our  professional  judgement which  were of most  significance  in our audit | Opinion on the  financial report  as a whole |\n\n- 1  Full scope audit procedures were also performed for the purposes of the standalone legal entity statutory financial report for this entity.\n\n## Bank and Group materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the financial report is free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial report.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall Bank and Group materiality for the financial report, which we have set out in the table below:\n\n| Overall Bank and Group  materiality               | $500 million (2020: $490 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                              | Approximately 5% of 2021 financial year profit before tax (PBT) for the Bank (2020:  approximately 5% of 2020 financial year PBT for the Group). As the Bank has a lower PBT  in the year ended 30 June 2021, we calculated materiality based on the Bank PBT and applied  this during the audit of both the Bank and the Group. |\n| Rationale for the  materiality benchmark  applied | We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope  of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the  e/ffect of misstatements on the financial report as a whole.                                                                            |\n|                                                   | We chose net profit before income tax because, in our view, it is the metric against which  the performance of the Bank and the Group is most commonly measured and is a generally  accepted benchmark.                                                                                                                          |\n|                                                   | We performed our audit over both the Bank and the Group financial information concurrently.  We apply the lower materiality calculated based on the Bank or the Group PBT in order to avoid  duplication of work.                                                                                                                |\n|                                                   | We utilised a 5% threshold based on our professional judgement, noting that it is within the  range of commonly acceptable thresholds.                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report for the current year. We describe each key audit matter and include a summary of the principal audit procedures we performed to address those matters in the table below.\n\nThe key audit matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Further, any commentary on the outcomes of a particular audit procedure is made in that context. The key audit matters identified below relate to both the Bank and the Group audit, unless otherwise stated below. We communicated the key audit matters to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nTo the members of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia\n\n<!-- image -->",

These provisions are established based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the realisation of the value of the collateral held by the Bank and the Group in respect of those loans under multiple weighted scenario outcomes.\n\nWe considered this a key audit matter due to the inherent estimation uncertainty in this area, namely due to the subjectivity in judgements made by the Bank and the Group in recognising impairment provisions including:\n\n- \u00b7  Models used to calculate ECL (ECL models) are inherently complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of each model;\n- \u00b7  A number of assumptions are made by the Bank and the Group concerning the values of inputs to the ECL models and how inputs correlate with one another; and\n- \u00b7  An increased level of estimation uncertainty and subjective judgements associated with determining the valuation of the individually assessed provisions for impaired non-retail borrowers.\n\nFurther, the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional subjectivity and judgement into the measurement of ECL due to the heightened uncertainty regarding economic outlook and the consequential impact of the pandemic on the Bank and the Group's customers.\n\nSpecifically, this includes judgements regarding the impact of COVID-19 on forward looking information, including macroeconomic scenarios and their associated weightings and the use of model adjustments and overlays in the calculation of the ECL.\n\nRelevant references in the financial report Refer to notes 1.1 and 3.2 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding of the controls relevant to our audit over the following areas and assessed whether they were appropriately designed and were operating e/ffectively throughout the year on a sample basis:\n\n- \u00b7  Review and approval of forward looking information used in ECL models;\n- \u00b7  Reliability and accuracy of critical data elements used in ECL models;\n- \u00b7  Model monitoring performed to support the e/ffectiveness of the models used in estimating ECL; and\n- \u00b7  Review and approval of ECL model adjustments and the ECL loan impairment provisions by the Bank's and the Group's Loan Loss Provisioning Committee (LLPC).\n\nIn addition to controls testing we, along with PwC credit risk modelling experts and PwC economics experts, performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, on a sample basis:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessed the ECL model methodology applied against accepted theory and the results of model monitoring performed, including back-testing of actual losses against predicted losses. This included inspection of significant model components and reperformance of certain tests within the Bank's and the Group's model monitoring;\n- \u00b7  Considered the Bank's and the Group's significant judgements including the appropriateness of forward looking information incorporated into the ECL models by assessing the forecasts, assumptions and probability weightings with a particular focus on the impact of COVID-19;\n- \u00b7  Agreed a sample of certain critical data elements used as inputs to the ECL models to relevant source documentation;\n- \u00b7  Recalculated ECL to assess the accuracy of the modelled outputs;\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of certain model adjustments and overlays identified by the Bank and the Group against internal and external supporting information where available; and\n- \u00b7  Considered the impact of events occurring subsequent to balance date on the provision for ECL.\n\nFor a selection of individually assessed provisions for specific lending assets, we performed the following audit procedures, amongst others:\n\n- \u00b7  Evaluated cashflow forecasts supporting the ECL provision by assessing significant judgements made by the Bank and the Group in the context of the borrowers' circumstances based on the detailed loan and counterparty information known by the Bank and the Group;\n- \u00b7  Compared data and assumptions in the Bank's and the Group's estimates (such as valuation of collateral held) to external information where available; and\n- \u00b7  Where applicable, considered the competency, capabilities, objectivity and nature of the work of certain experts of the Bank and the Group who assisted in the development of significant assumptions used in determining the provision.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of the disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nTo the members of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nJudgemental valuation of financial instruments (Relevant components: RBS, IB&M, NZ - ASB)\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the value of 'Level 2' fair value financial instruments (i.e. where key inputs to the valuation are based on observable market data) held by the Group is $57,581m assets and $24,190m liabilities. The value of Level 2 fair value financial instruments held by the Bank is $55,530m assets and $21,527m liabilities.\n\nThe Level 2 financial instruments held at fair value include:\n\n- \u00b7  Derivative assets and liabilities;\n- \u00b7  Investment securities at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income;\n- \u00b7  Trading assets and liabilities at fair value through the Income Statement; and\n- \u00b7  Other assets at fair value through the Income Statement.\n\nWe considered Level 2 financial instruments to be a key audit matter due to their financial significance to the Bank and the Group. Additionally, the valuation of these instruments requires judgement by the Bank and the Group in relation to the application of appropriate models and assumptions including fair value adjustments.\n\nAt 30 June 2021, the value of 'Level 3' fair value financial instruments (i.e. where the valuation is based on unobservable inputs) held by the Group is $3,047m assets and $23m liabilities. The value of Level 3 fair value financial instruments held by the Bank is $3,020m assets and $23m liabilities. In relation to the financial assets, the Bank and the Group have an investment in Klarna Bank AB which is measured at fair value through Other Comprehensive Income. At 30 June 2021, the fair value of this investment is $2,701m. We considered this investment to be a key audit matter due to its financial significance and the additional judgement required by the Bank and the Group over its valuation given it is based on unobservable inputs.\n\nRelevant references in the financial report Refer to notes 4.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5 and 9.5 for further information.\n\nWe developed an understanding of the controls relevant to our audit over the following areas and assessed whether they were appropriately designed and were operating e/ffectively throughout the year on a sample basis:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessment of valuation models at inception and periodically;\n- \u00b7  Reliability and accuracy of key market data used in the Bank's and the Group's valuation models;\n- \u00b7  Trade confirmations; and\n- \u00b7  Financial instrument position and settlement reconciliation.\n\nAdditionally, together with PwC valuation experts, we compared the Bank's and the Group's calculations of fair value to our own calculations across a sample of financial instruments. This involved sourcing inputs from market data providers and using our own valuation models. We considered the results to assess whether there was evidence of systemic bias or error in the Bank's and the Group's valuation of financial instruments by investigating the root cause for material variances.\n\nWith the assistance of PwC valuation experts, we performed the following audit procedures, amongst others, over the investment in Klarna Bank AB:\n\n- \u00b7  Assessed the design e/ffectiveness of certain controls over the approval of the calculation model, accuracy of the data inputs to the calculation model, and governance and review;\n- \u00b7  Assessed the appropriateness of the methodology and significant assumptions adopted by the Bank and the Group to derive the fair value estimate;\n- \u00b7  Tested the key data in the calculation model to external information where available; and\n- \u00b7  Recalculated the fair value to assess the accuracy of the model output.\n\nWe also assessed the reasonableness of related disclosures in the financial report against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We obtained written representations from the Group Chief Executive O/fficer, Chief Financial O/fficer and Group General Counsel and obtained access to relevant documents in order to develop our understanding of the matters.\n\nFor those matters that resulted in a material provision at year end, we performed the following procedures, amongst others:\n\n- \u00b7  Developed an understanding of the relevant control activities associated with developing the provision;\n- \u00b7  Performed tests over the design e/ffectiveness and operating e/ffectiveness of relevant controls over the provision;\n- \u00b7  Evaluated the appropriateness of the methodology applied and the appropriateness of the assumptions and data used to develop the provision in the context of Australian Accounting Standards. This included consideration of results from sample testing performed and subsequent adjustments made to the output of the sample test results;\n- \u00b7  Considered whether changes from the prior year to the method, assumptions, and/or the data for developing the provision were appropriate. This included identifying whether the changes were based on new circumstances or new information;\n- \u00b7  For provisions related to customer remediation, discussed with management the remediation plans and considered the feasibility and intent to carry out such courses of action;\n- \u00b7  Where applicable, considered the competency, capabilities, objectivity, and nature of the work of certain experts of the Bank and the Group who assisted in the development of assumptions used in determining the provision;\n- \u00b7  Evaluated relevant events occurring up to the date of the auditor's report; and\n- \u00b7  Evaluated the reasonableness of the disclosures made in note 7.1, including those related to estimation uncertainty, against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nWhere the Bank and the Group determined that they were unable to reliably estimate the possible financial impact of a remediation activity, investigation or ongoing legal matter, we considered relevant information available in relation to the activities and investigations to assess the appropriateness of this conclusion. We also assessed the adequacy and reasonableness of related disclosures against the requirements of Australian Accounting Standards.\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nTo the members of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKey audit matter\n\nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nOperation of financial reporting Information Technology (IT) systems and controls (Relevant components: All)\n\nWe considered this a key audit matter because the Bank's and the Group's operations and financial reporting processes are heavily dependent on IT systems for the processing and recording of a significant volume of transactions.\n\nIn particular, in common with all banks, access rights to technology are important because they are intended to ensure that changes to applications and data are appropriately authorised. Ensuring that only appropriate sta/ff have access to IT systems, that the level of access itself is appropriate, and that access is periodically monitored, are key controls in mitigating the potential for fraud or error as a result of a change to an application or underlying data.\n\nThe Bank's and the Group's controls over IT systems are intended to ensure that:\n\n- \u00b7  New systems or changes to existing systems operate as intended and are authorised;\n- \u00b7  Access to process transactions or change data is appropriate and maintains an intended segregation of duties;\n- \u00b7  The use of privileged access to systems and data is restricted and monitored; and\n- \u00b7  IT processing is approved and where issues arise they are resolved.\n\nFor material financial statement balances we developed an understanding of the business processes, IT systems used to generate and support those balances and associated IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls. Our procedures included evaluating and testing the design and operating e/ffectiveness of certain controls over the continued integrity of the IT systems that are relevant to financial reporting. This involved assessing, where relevant to the audit:\n\n- \u00b7  Change management: the processes and controls used to develop, test and authorise changes to the functionality and configurations within systems;\n- \u00b7  System development: the project disciplines which ensure that significant developments or implementation are appropriately tested before implementation and that data is converted and transferred completely and accurately;\n- \u00b7  Security: the access controls designed to enforce segregation of duties, govern the use of generic and privileged accounts or ensure that data is only changed through authorised means; and\n- \u00b7  IT operations: the controls over operations are used to ensure that any issues that arise are managed appropriately.\n\nWithin the scope of our audit where technology services are provided by a third party, we considered:\n\n- \u00b7  Assurance reports from the third party's auditor on the design and operating e/ffectiveness of controls; and\n- \u00b7  Managements monitoring control over the third party.\n\nWe also carried out tests, on a sample basis, of IT application controls and IT dependencies in manual controls that were key to our audit testing in order to assess the accuracy of certain system calculations, the generation of certain reports and the operation of certain system enforced access controls.\n\nWhere we noted design or operating e/ffectiveness matters relating to IT systems and applications controls relevant to our audit, we performed alternative or additional audit procedures.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net Promoter Score (NPS) is now the primary metric by which we assess  customer satisfaction. Advocacy is measured on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being 'Very  Unlikely' and 10 being 'Very likely' to recommend. (Measuring our customers' satisfaction  is important as satisfied customers usually return, they tell other people about their  experiences, and they may well pay a premium for the privilege of doing business with  an institution they trust.)

Where a counterparty has business activities that fit in multiple categories (mainly in Oil & Gas and Diversified Mining), the exposure is allocated to the categories based on percentage contribution of each category to the client's EBITDA (where available) or revenue.\n\nThe following table provides more detail of the assets that are included in the scope of this report.\n\n| Metric category                                    | Metric                                                                  | Included assets                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Exclusions                                                                                                                                                                                         | Exposure type                             |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Oil                                                | Oil extraction                                                          | Entities whose principal operations include  the exploration and development of oil  fields for the purposes of extracting and  producing crude oil.                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                    | TCE with  adjustments as  described above |\n| Gas                                                | Gas extraction                                                          | Entities whose principal operations include  exploration, ownership, development and  management of gas fields, that are utilised  for the purposes of natural gas production.                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                    | TCE with  adjustments as  described above |\n| Thermal Coal                                       | Thermal Coal  Mining                                                    | Entities that own or operate mines  to develop and produce predominantly  thermal coal.
