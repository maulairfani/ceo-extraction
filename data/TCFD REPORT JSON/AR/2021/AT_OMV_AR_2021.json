As we speak, war is being waged in Ukraine.\n\nThis saddens me and our employees as well. The war in Ukraine is a tragic and threatening situation that means great suffering for many people. Our deepest sympathy goes out to all who are directly or indirectly victims of this war. We reject all forms of violence and war and are deeply convinced that freedom and wellbeing for people can only exist in peace.\n\n## OMV has had business relations with Russia for a long-standing period. How are you dealing with it now?\n\nWe have carefully considered our involvement in Russia and then made a clear decision that from now on Russia is no longer a core region for OMV. This means that we will no longer pursue any future investments in Russia. For this reason, we have also immediately ended all negotiations regarding a potential participation in blocks 4A/5A of the Achimov-Formation in the Urengoy gas and condensate field. Furthermore, we have initiated a strategic review of our existing stake in the Yuzhno Russkoye gas field in Western Siberia. Here we will consider all options, including a divestment or exit. In addition we recognize for this asset, as well as for our receivables from Nord Stream 2 AG, a value adjustment.\n\n## Mr. Stern, if we turn to the topic of further development and take a look into the future. The mission of companies like OMV has always been to supply energy. What is OMV's future mission?\n\nOMV will continue to develop and grow, and in doing so, pursue the clear goal of becoming a leader in sustainable fuels and chemicals as well as high-quality materials. That means that the OMV of tomorrow will be an innovative company that provides people with the circular resources needed for a better life in these modern times. And even further in the future, OMV will be a company with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, a goal we aim to achieve by 2050 at the latest.\n\n## To restate the question, how long can OMV afford to keep pursuing the same business model?\n\nNot a single day, if you look at it rationally. Even though we cannot radically change our business model immediately, we must act today and push it in the right direction. The new OMV Strategy 2030 is our first step toward more sustainability. We will implement this strategy quickly so that we can benefit optimally from the opportunities offered by the energy and sustainability transition. I am certain that this transformation of our Company will meet with positive feedback from shareholders, the capital market, customers, and, last but not least, our employees.\n\n## If you first look back and then into the future - what kind of OMV do you see?\n\nLooking back, I see a successful company that has performed very well over many decades in the market and has also prepared very well for the future recently. Looking forward, I see an innovative company that is actively driving the shift toward more sustainability. I see a company that provides circular resources and products essential for our prosperity and a better life for all of us.",

In 2021, we generated record earnings. This was thanks to first-rate performance by the Exploration & Production business, to stable earnings in Refining & Marketing, and especially to robust growth in Chemicals & Materials. The figures speak for themselves: We are taking the right approach. In addition, we consistently carried out the divestment program we announced in connection with the Borealis acquisition. We have successfully sold our shares in Gas Connect Austria, the E&P business in Kazakhstan, oil fields in Malaysia, and our 25-percent interest in the Wisting oil field in Norway. With this move and the support of our strong results, we were able to reduce our leverage to 22 percent in the past year.\n\n## And OMV's technological strength?\n\nAt its core, it is our employees' extensive knowledge of working with hydrocarbons as well as renewable raw materials and recyclates. We are able to find the best solutions along the entire value chain, a major asset for the future. And, to name just one innovation, OMV and Borealis were early adopters with the foresight to begin gaining experience in the mechanical and chemical recycling of plastics. This enabled us to establish a very strong jumping-off point for a future leadership position in the circular economy, which will play a key role going forward. The circular economy makes it possible to protect the environment and continue to enjoy the advantages of high-quality plastics at the same time. And that is precisely what will be needed. After all, plastics are essential, particularly during the energy transition. Think about heavy-duty cables, solar panels and wind turbines, and capacitors and semiconductors - none of these would be possible without high-quality plastics. It is exactly for this purpose that we offer tailored solutions as a global technological leader in this field.\n\n## How would you describe OMV in 2030 in one sentence? OMV is ...\n\n... a leader in innovative sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials, heading toward net zero and leveraging the energy transition as a business opportunity for sustained growth. In the area of sustainable fuels and chemicals as well as high-quality materials and the circular economy in particular, we will be entering a new successful phase of our company history and acting as a role model for transformation in the industry.\n\n## OMV must also have a vision for 2040.\n\nYes, that is correct. By 2040, we hope to have established a sustainable, circular business model in the Group. And we are thinking beyond that as well. By 2050, we want to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. That also means that we are pursuing the goal of no longer producing oil and gas as an energy source by 2050.",

        "page_content": "## How do you envision the road to OMV 2030?\n\nOf course, this will mean changes in all of our businesses. In Exploration & Production, we have to incrementally move toward lower-carbon business activities. That means we will increase the share of natural gas in our portfolio as a transition fuel, but at the same time pursue sustainable energy solutions in which we can leverage our expertise and assets. These include geothermal energy as well as technologies for storing and utilizing CO2 and other gases.\n\n## OMV already has refineries that count among the most advanced and efficient in Europe. What direction will they take?\n\nOur motto is 'sustainable fuels.' In the Refining & Marketing business, we will first focus more intensely on using biogenic components in fuels and for chemical feedstock. We will also work on synthetic fuels and raw materials in the longer term. As of 2023, a pilot plant at our Schwechat refinery in Austria will use a catalyst we developed inhouse to produce propanol from formerly unused glycerin, a waste product. We already supply wholesale customers with EcoMotion diesel, which reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 20 to 25 percent thanks to its renewable content. Along with Austrian Airlines, we will cut carbon emissions by more than 80 percent with sustainable jet fuel. These are all key steps on our path toward a more sustainable business model.\n\n## And in Chemicals & Materials?\n\nAfter expanding the crackers at our Burghausen site in Germany, we will produce additional ethylene and propylene for the Bavarian Chemical Triangle starting in the third quarter of 2022. We are already successfully operating a new ISO C4 plant in Burghausen, in which we manufacture high-purity isobutene for the production of adhesives and vitamin C. Our propane dehydration plant in Kallo, Belgium, in which Borealis is investing around EUR 1 billion, will go online next year with a capacity of 750,000 tons.\n\nWe also see strong growth in Chemicals & Materials internationally in the future. This year, Borealis plans to work with TotalEnergies to increase the polyethylene capacity of our US joint venture Baystar to 1 million tons. In the United Arab Emirates, we were able to announce the successful commissioning of our fifth polypropylene plant recently. Borouge 4, a further project of our subsidiary Borealis and our partner ADNOC, involves investments of USD 6.2 billion in a polyolefin production complex. The facility has an annual capacity of 1.4 million tons. This plant aims to meet the growing demand for energy, infrastructure, and advanced packaging in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia by the end of 2025.\n\n## OMV's future in many parts of the world will depend on chemicals. Is that realistic?\n\nWe have given this a lot of thought and taken this road intentionally. Everything we have seen so far confirms the correctness of this decision. This approach is a logical expansion of our value chain to include the opportunity to use our entire range of expertise to help shape a sustainable circular economy. We will expand geographically and add new, appealing products to our portfolio. The extent to which OMV is profiting from developments in the chemical market is demonstrated not least by our recent results.\n\nThe factory of the future will look different than a chemical factory does today. It will close the raw material loop and will therefore require a combination of various process technologies. Many of these will be a combination of what we are already doing today - in our refineries on the one hand and in our chemical production facilities on the other. For this reason, I am confident that we are well prepared for the future and will be able to utilize our expertise optimally to our advantage.",

        "page_content": "## In technological terms, plastics recycling is in its infancy. However, the fight against plastic waste is likely to be increasingly fierce. How will you approach this?\n\nAs for the technology, we are at the forefront in mechanical as well as chemical recycling, including fields such as Design for Recycling. The early interest shown by OMV and Borealis in this topic gives us a clear advantage out of the blocks in various ways, such as access to plastic waste. It is also clear that we cannot let up. For this reason, we are making every effort to work with partners to develop these technologies and processes and making substantial investments to do so.\n\nIn terms of chemical recycling, OMV will convert 16,000 tons of plastic waste per year into valuable synthetic feedstock for the chemical industry at a ReOil \u00ae demo plant at the Schwechat refinery starting in 2023. The next step will kick off in 2026 with a commercially viable, full-scale industrial plant with a processing capacity of 200,000 tons. We already produce some 100,000 tons of circular materials and chemicals.\n\n## According to research, the circular plastics business will have a market potential of USD 40 to 60 billion by the middle of this decade. Will OMV capture a healthy portion of this market?\n\nThe circular economy is one of the main pillars of our future business model. At the start, it will only represent a small fraction of our total production volume. However, the actual success of innovations cannot be seen until the future, of course. I am optimistic that OMV can and will play a key role in the supply of raw materials if the market and general economic conditions develop as expected and we diligently pursue our goals.\n\n## What you are describing might well be the most far-reaching change in OMV's history. How will you make this shift happen? And what does it mean for OMV's employees?\n\nNaturally, this will result in some changes and challenges for our employees but will also provide many opportunities for development. We cannot forget that OMV has always continued to develop in recent decades and has always been open to progress. We will create the framework necessary and implement the measures required so that everyone who wants to can also take advantage of these opportunities.\n\nLet me again come back to our results from the past fiscal year. Our employees generated these absolute recordhigh earnings under never-before-seen conditions. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have put enormous strain on each and every one of us, but we nonetheless delivered this impressive performance. We can continue to achieve great things with this team in the future. I have already expressed my thanks for this on many occasions - let me do it here once again.\n\n## What factors will decide OMV's success going forward?\n\nSuccess always comes down to several factors. This certainly includes the Company's financial strength. But the key factor is innovation. And for this, we need our employees, their creativity, and their openness to looking at change and seeing opportunities for new businesses.\n\nVienna, March 9, 2021\n\nAlfred Stern m.p.",

        "page_content": "## Dear Shareholders,\n\nThe past year was marked by numerous uncertainties despite economic growth. The societal effects of new coronavirus variants as well as supply bottlenecks and higher raw material costs put somewhat of a damper on the global economic upswing, particularly in the second half of the year. In addition we faced increasing geopolitical tensions which unfortunately culminated in the invasion of Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIn this challenging environment, the strength and robustness of OMV's diversified portfolio and the advantages of the expanded value chain including chemical products once again proved their value, and we were able to generate record earnings. This is only partially due to the rise in oil and gas prices. Well over half of this result stems from the Refining & Marketing and especially the Chemicals & Materials businesses, which do not profit from high oil and gas prices. At its core, this success is attributable to the commitment and expertise of our employees, who optimally leveraged the many and varied market conditions - for oil and gas as well as our refinery and chemical products.\n\nThis remarkable success and OMV's still extremely stable financial position are also reflected in the proposed progressive dividend of EUR 2.30 per share, by means of which you, dear shareholders, partake in OMV's successes.\n\nIn the following, I would like to inform you about the Supervisory Board's work during the 2021 financial year:\n\n## Composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nOn April 1, 2021, the reorganization of OMV Group approved by the Supervisory Board in February 2021 took effect. This entailed the former Refining & Petrochemical Operations business being divided into Refining on the one hand and Chemicals & Materials on the other hand. The Executive Board team welcomed a new member on April 1, 2021: Alfred Stern, responsible for Chemicals & Materials, including our circular economy activities. He joins OMV as a manager with extensive international experience in the chemical industry who not only ensured the excellent market positioning of Borealis' polyolefin business but also furthered the company's circular economy efforts in recent years. Thomas Gangl, OMV's Executive Board member responsible for Refining & Petrochemical Operations, took the position of CEO of Borealis AG as of April 1, 2021.\n\nThe Refining business had been under the interim leadership of Elena Skvortsova, Executive Officer Marketing & Trading, up to June 30, 2021. On July 1, 2021, Martijn van Koten took over this position as Executive Board member. Van Koten possesses extraordinarily broad international management expertise in the refinery and chemical business and, along with the Executive Board team, will pursue the transformation of OMV's refinery activities.\n\nOn April 26, 2021, former Executive Board Chairman and CEO, Rainer Seele, announced that he would not extend his Executive Board contract past June 30, 2022.\n\nIn its meeting on June 1, 2021, the Supervisory Board appointed Alfred Stern as his successor in the position of Executive Board Chairman and CEO effective September 1, 2021. Rainer Seele stepped down on August 31, 2021, by mutual agreement. On behalf of the entire Supervisory Board, I would like to thank Rainer Seele for his service to OMV and the further development of the Company. Rainer Seele and his Executive Board team were instrumental in reorganizing OMV's portfolio, significantly increasing the Company's profitability, and therefore putting in place good conditions for the transformation of OMV. At the same time, he spearheaded the Borealis deal, taking the first major, strategic step in this transformation process. In recruiting Alfred Stern, we succeeded in bringing on board as our new Executive Board Chairman and CEO an international chemical industry executive with substantial experience and knowledge in circular economy innovation.\n\nIn 2021, some changes were also made to the Supervisory Board. Mansour Mohamed Al Mulla stepped down effective at the end of the Annual General Meeting on June 2, 2021, and Saeed Al Mazrouei was elected his successor serving as Second Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board. Following Thomas Schmid's resignation, Christine Catasta was elected to the Supervisory Board at the extraordinary General Meeting on September 10, 2021. She holds the position of First Deputy Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThere were changes on the part of the employee representatives in 2021 as well. Effective January 18, 2021, Nicole Schachenhofer and Hubert Bunderla were nominated as new members of the Supervisory Board. Herbert Lindner stepped down as of August 31, 2021, and Alexander Auer was appointed to the Supervisory Board as his successor as of September 1, 2021.",

It oversaw the Executive Board's governance of OMV and advised it in decision-making processes on the basis of detailed written and verbal reports as well as constructive discussions between the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board.\n\nThe EUR 2 billion divestment program begun by OMV in 2021 continued successfully in this year: The program involves the sale of our shares in Gas Connect Austria GmbH, our retail and commercial business in Slovenia, and our filling stations in Germany, as well as the sale of our E&P business in Kazakhstan, oil fields in Malaysia, and our 25-percent interest in the offshore Wisting oil field in Norway. The divestment of the Wisting oil field underscores OMV Exploration & Production GmbH's strategy of increasing the share of gas over oil to reduce the carbon intensity of the product portfolio. Moreover, the final investment decision was made in 2021 to build a chemical recycling demo plant based on OMV's patented ReOil \u00ae technology. This was another step in the development of a full-scale commercial plant and an important milestone toward a circular economy and reducing CO2 emissions.\n\nIn December, the Supervisory Board and Executive Board of OMV agreed the basic points of the Strategy 2030. The details are being worked out and will be presented in the first quarter of 2022. The strategy's aim is for OMV to continue to grow as an integrated energy, fuel, and chemical company while becoming more sustainable and focusing on the circular economy, ultimately achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nOn November 1, 2021, the Supervisory Board established a new Sustainability and Transformation Committee. The Sustainability and Transformation Committee will hold its first formal meeting in 2022 and address all issues relevant to ESG considerations, particularly the challenges of climate change. The Committee serves to support and monitor OMV's transformation process and transition to a more sustainable business model.\n\nThe Supervisory Board, and especially I as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, attach great importance to an intensive exchange with investors. In November and December, I therefore worked with Investor Relations to hold a number of discussions with our major institutional investors and a proxy advisor as part of our governance roadshow, which took place virtually this time due to COVID-19.\n\nAs in the past, trainings specifically designed for the Supervisory Board took place in 2021. The Supervisory Board's annual self-assessment, based on surveys, was supported by an external consultant. The results are used to help decide which issues and activities to prioritize in 2022.",

Furthermore, it focused on the issue of long-term Executive Board succession planning.\n\nIn 2021, the Remuneration Committee handled issues concerning the appropriateness of the amount and structure of Executive Board remuneration in line with regulatory requirements and market practice. In particular, the contract terms for the new Executive Board members and separation agreements with the Executive Board members stepping down were discussed and agreed.\n\nShareholders were for the first time presented the Remuneration Report revised to reflect the new provisions of stock corporation law for approval at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. Since 2020, non-financial/ESG components have been included in the variable remuneration system; their weighting was increased further in 2021. The Remuneration Report presents an even more transparent overview of Executive Board and Supervisory Board remuneration than before, and includes a comparison with the relative development of the Company's income and employee salaries.\n\nIn 2021, the Audit Committee looked at important topics related to accounting processes, the internal audit program, risk management, and the Group's internal control system. The current auditor of OMV Group, Ernst & Young Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft m.b.H., participated in each of the Audit Committee's meetings.\n\nMeetings of the Portfolio and Project Committee are held regularly prior to the meetings of the Supervisory Board.

        "page_content": "## OMV on the Capital Markets\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic and new virus variants heightened price volatility on stock markets in 2021, the year was also characterized by strong investor optimism about the resilience of the economy, which fueled a recovery movement throughout the year. In line with the Brent oil price benchmark, OMV's stock price strongly outperformed both the sector and the wider European market and ended the year at EUR 49.95.\n\n## Financial markets\n\nWith the MSCI World Index and STOXX 600 up by 21% and 22% in 2021 respectively, it was a good year for global and European equities. Growth was mainly driven by recovering economic activity and improving company earnings. With rising inflation failing to incite central banks to raise interest rates, investors were compelled to raise their risk appetite in search of higher returns: away from fixed income, and into equities.\n\nWhile the introduction of anti-COVID-19 vaccines in the industrialized world early in 2021 eased some of the pandemic-induced concerns about global economic development, repeated infection surges during the year kept influencing markets. Particularly the emergence of the Omicron variant of the virus in November renewed demand uncertainty, causing a price slump. However, as with every dip during 2021, ample excess liquidity and a 'there-is-no-alternative' mindset among investors quickly put equities back on a growth trajectory towards the end of the year.\n\nAs a consequence of the sharply rising underlying energy prices, the energy sector was among the top performing sectors during 2021, in Europe as well as in the United States.\n\nEnergy prices increased not only on the crude oil side, but quite remarkably also on the natural gas side. Benchmark spot prices at European natural gas trading hubs hit record highs several times during the year's second half. The reason for this increase was a combination of factors, including: low local storage levels after a longer-than-usual previous heating season, declining domestic European natural gas production, limited supplies via pipeline from Russia, and intensifying competition for LNG deliveries between European and Asian consumers. The time lag between natural gas benchmark prices in some European markets and hubbased spot prices is the reason why the spot price surge at the hubs did not fully ripple through to all local European markets until early 2022.\n\n## At a glance\n\n|                                            |           |   2021 | 2020   |   2019 | 2018   |   2017 |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of outstanding shares 1             | in mn     | 327    | 327.0  | 326.9  | 326.7  | 326.5  |\n| Market capitalization 1                    | in EUR bn |  16.3  | 10.8   |  16.4  | 12.5   |  17.3  |\n| Volume traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange | in EUR bn |  10.4  | 9.3    |   8.2  | 9.1    |   8.8  |\n| Year's high                                | in EUR    |  55    | 50.76  |  54.54 | 56.24  |  54.14 |\n| Year's low                                 | in EUR    |  32.74 | 16.33  |  39.32 | 37.65  |  32.37 |\n| Year end                                   | in EUR    |  49.95 | 33.00  |  50.08 | 38.25  |  52.83 |\n| Earnings Per Share (EPS)                   | in EUR    |   6.4  | 3.85   |   5.14 | 4.40   |   1.33 |\n| Book value per share 1                     | in EUR    |  47.41 | 42.02  |  39.8  | 36.44  |  34.35 |\n| Cash flow per share 2                      | in EUR    |  21.47 | 9.60   |  12.42 | 13.46  |  10.56 |\n| Dividend Per Share (DPS) 3                 | in EUR    |   2.3  | 1.85   |   1.75 | 1.75   |   1.5  |\n| Payout ratio                               | in %      |  36    | 48     |  34    | 40     | 113    |\n| Dividend yield 1                           | in %      |   4.6  | 5.6    |   3.5  | 4.6    |   2.8  |\n| Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 4           | in %      |  57    | (29)   |  36    | (25)   |  61    |\n\n- 2 Cash flow from operating activities\n- 3 2021: as proposed by the Executive Board and confirmed by the Supervisory Board; subject to confirmation by the Annual General Meeting 2022\n- 4 Assuming reinvestment of the dividend",

However, early 2021 saw the start of a wide-spread anti-COVID-19 vaccination effort in Europe. It sparked the optimism in the market that helped share prices embark on a recovery trajectory lasting throughout the year. OMV's share price thus never returned to the level seen in the first week of the year, making the January 4, 2021 close of EUR 32.74 the year's low. Repeated lockdowns in response to surging COVID-19 cases slowed the recovery several times during the year, but none of the prescribed measures exerted a similarly negative effect on\n\nOMV's share price as the first lockdown of March 2020. The share reached its high for the year of EUR 55.00 at the end of October 2021, almost in time for the first anniversary of the Borealis takeover. News about the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus in November caused the most severe price drop of the year -13% in a span of 9 trading days. However, just as with the other declines of 2021, this slump was soon made good within a few weeks, in the latter case by early January 2022. OMV closed the year at EUR 49.95, up 51%, broadly in line with the benchmark price development of OMV's main underlying commodity, that of crude oil. The average daily trading volume of OMV shares in 2021 was 451,538 shares (2020: 621,393). At year-end, OMV's total market capitalization stood at EUR 16.3 bn, compared to EUR 10.8 bn at the end of 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOMV's share price outperformed the sector as well as the wider market. The FTSEurofirst E300 Oil & Gas index and the FTSE Eurotop 100 global industry benchmark gained 21% and 23%, respectively, and the Austrian ATX improved by 39%. Measured over a five-year period, the return generated by OMV shares strongly\n\noutperformed index returns. A EUR 100 investment in OMV stock at year-end 2016 with continuous dividend reinvestment in further OMV stock would have grown by an average annual return rate of 13% to EUR 183 at year-end 2021.",

        "page_content": "## Strategy\n\nOMV will transform from an integrated oil, gas, and chemicals company into a leader in innovative sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials, leveraging opportunities in the circular economy. The Group aims to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050 for all three scopes of greenhouse gas emissions. By taking this path, OMV expects to deliver an operating cash flow excluding net working capital effects of around EUR 6 bn by 2025 and at least EUR 7 bn by 2030, a ROACE of at least 12%, and will continue its progressive dividend policy.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nToward the end of the last decade, global warming and climate change took center stage as some of the most pressing global challenges of our times. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the energy markets in 2020. The disruption of supply and demand dynamics has led to the current energy price escalation. It has also accelerated the emergence of sustainability as a mega trend to tackle the challenges of climate change and, consequently, the energy transition. The ultimate objective of the energy transition is to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint of the global energy system to achieve net-zero emissions and limit the global temperature rise to no more than 1.5\u00b0C by 2050.\n\nThe goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 has emerged as a global consensus and is poised to become the new norm and license to operate for corporations. A total of 136 countries representing more than 77% of global carbon emissions and 80% of GDP have made some form of net-zero commitment as of November 2021. Businesses around the world have reacted and pledged to achieve net-zero by 2050. These include leading oil and gas, and chemical companies. The European Union is committed to transforming its net-zero objective into the EU's Climate Law.\n\nThe demand for fossil-based commodities will change dramatically due to the restructuring of the global economy and the adaptation of consumer behavior to the net-zero path. While fossil-based energy products will face decline,\n\nnew business and growth opportunities will open up in adjacent areas, as demand will increase for solutions that can reduce GHG emissions. These are, for example, natural gas as a transition energy source, renewable energy, biofuels, hydrogen, carbon capture, utilization & storage, or CCU/S, geothermal, value chain extension toward more valuable products such as chemicals and polymer solutions, and growing developments toward a circular economy. This expected shift to novel solutions demands investment in low-GHG-emissions technologies, and circular economy solutions, where great potential is assumed even though the business models are still uncertain.\n\nDespite all the efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions and generating strong growth in renewables, the oil and gas sector is anticipated to remain the main source of primary energy in the next decade. Based on the International Energy Agency World Energy Outlook (IEA WEO) 2021, total energy supply grows by 1.3% per year from 2020 to 2030 in the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), reaching 670 exajouls (EJ) by 2030, whereas oil and gas demand growth compared to renewables is roughly split equally. The IEA STEPS assumes a fossil fuels share of 75% in the global energy mix in 2030, and 66% in 2050. This expected growth trajectory might change, if current announcements regarding emissions targets materialize, leading to a decline of fossil fuel demand and supply. This trend is in accordance with the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) of the WEO 2021, showing a potential path toward fulfillment of the UN climate goals, factoring in high political ambitions.\n\nNote: The financial targets for 2025 are based on the following market assumptions: Brent oil price of USD 65/bbl, THE (Trading Hub Europe) gas price of EUR 22/MWh, refining indicator margin Europe of USD 4.3/bbl, ethylene/propylene indicator margin Europe of EUR 430/t, polyethylene/polypropylene indicator margin Europe of EUR 420/t. The financial targets for 2030 are based on the following market assumptions: Brent oil price of USD 70/bbl, THE (Trading Hub Europe) gas price of EUR 24/MWh, refining indicator margin Europe of USD 4.3/bbl, ethylene/propylene indicator margin Europe of EUR 500/t, polyethylene/polypropylene indicator margin Europe of EUR 480/t.",

        "page_content": "## World total primary energy supply\n\nSource: IEA World Energy Outlook 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhile oil consumption is expected to decline in mature markets such as North America and Europe, global growth beyond 2030 will stem from Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Peak oil demand is anticipated in the coming decade. Natural gas, on the other hand, which leads to 10-30% lower GHG emissions compared to oil products, will provide a reliable and resilient fuel choice for the energy transition. This will lead to an increase in its demand, with strong momentum from industry and, in particular, the construction sector.\n\nGiven the above-mentioned trends, the refining business model in Europe will face declining fossil fuel demand, triggered by the decarbonization of road transportation. Consequently, this sector will have to respond strategically to this circumstance. The retail segment will be resilient but will shift increasingly from fuel to EV charging, hydrogen, and convenience. The share of biofuels, and especially advanced biofuels, an additional enabler for meeting net-zero targets, is expected to increase sharply until 2030. This will be triggered by regulations and end-users, especially in hard-to-electrify segments, such as marine, aviation, and heavyduty transport.\n\nOil demand for chemical production is expected to increase, primarily originating from rising demand in emerging markets and closely linked to GDP development. Approximately 80% of chemical and plastic demand growth will be concentrated in emerging markets, mainly Asia, until 2030 and beyond. This region represents most of the global population growth and the corresponding potential for improving living standards. Average oil demand for chemical products in emerging markets is expected to expand at the rate of above 1% above global GDP growth until 2030.\n\nFor mature markets such as Europe, North America, and Japan, demand growth is anticipated to remain healthy in the long term, in line with economic development, but growth rates are expected to slow.\n\nPolyolefins are the largest market segment in producing plastic goods. Demand for virgin polyolefins continues to grow at a rate above global GDP until 2030, driven by the Asian market. Polyolefins remain essential for various industries, including packaging, construction, transportation, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and electronics.\n\nThe key success factor for medium- to long-term sustainable business models is growth in renewable feedstocks, bioplastics, and the development of circular solutions. Recycled polyolefin demand is expected to grow at a rate significantly above global GDP until 2030, with Asia having the largest share.\n\nOver the next decade, key focus areas for the plastics industry will be continued improvement in waste collection, the redesign of plastics and their applications for increased recyclability, and improvements in recycling technologies . Global recycling rates are projected to increase from 17% today to 20% by 2030, while Europe is expected to see even higher recycling rates.\n\nBased on the market development outlook, as described above, OMV developed two forward-looking energy market frameworks. OMV's base case scenario is built on the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) taken from the World Economic Outlook and adjusted based on an assumption that the EU, the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea (with a twoyear delay for political alignment and measuring effectiveness) follow the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and meet the Paris Agreement targets. OMV's stress case is built on the IEA SDS Scenario, where the entire world reaches the Paris Agreement commitment of net-zero by 2070. The SDS is used for downside sensitivity analysis to generally understand how the existing and future portfolio will perform in this business scenario. In this scenario, global oil markets will start a continuous downward production trend, with a significant gradient toward 2040, and natural gas markets will peak in 2030 with a strong decline thereafter. European gas demand is expected to decline by 25% by 2030, with a strong phaseout until 2050.",

An integral part of the Group's strategy is its ambition to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050 for Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. In view of the ongoing transformation in the energy industry and a global goal of net-zero emissions, OMV builds on its strengths and seizes opportunities to position itself competitively.\n\n## 2030 strategic priorities\n\n- \u25b8 Become a net-zero emissions company by 2050; reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% and Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2030\n- \u25b8 Establish a global leadership position in circular economy solutions\n- \u25b8 Develop into a global leader in specialty polyolefin solutions\n- \u25b8 Become a leading European producer of sustainable fuels and chemical feedstocks\n- \u25b8 Enhance OMV's shareholder value: deliver growth with strong financials and continue the progressive dividend policy\n- \u25b8 Reduce fossil production and shift to gas\n\nThe Chemicals & Materials business will be the core growth engine of the Group. OMV aims to become a global leader in specialty polyolefin solutions, with a significantly stronger position in the Middle East, Asia, and North America. The Group will strengthen its existing polyolefins business, while also building a strong and diversified chemicals and materials portfolio, by expanding into adjacent businesses and new product groups. To achieve this, OMV will target investments and initiatives that improve its returns and carbon footprint. Moreover, OMV will expand its geographical reach, pursuing high-growth markets, such as Asia and North America. This will be achieved through in-market investments and partnerships based on differentiated technologies and application portfolios. Furthermore, the Company will diversify its presence beyond polyolefins by entering into specialty chemicals and materials to build leadership positions.\n\nAn important pillar of OMV's strategy is the ambition to become a leader in renewable and circular chemicals and materials. The Group will capture the potential of emerging renewable and circular markets by leveraging its integrated technology platform and end-to-end\n\nposition to develop innovative products and new business models. The circular economy is crucial for a longterm sustainable chemical business. Thus, a transformation toward an economically viable commercial scale is needed. In this context, the Group's target is to deliver around 2 mn t of sustainable C&M products by 2030.\n\nOMV also aims to become a leading, innovative producer of sustainable fuels and chemical feedstocks. As a result, the Western European refineries will reduce their crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t and shift to an increased chemical feedstock share of 24% by 2030. The plan is to increase production of renewable fuels and sustainable feedstocks to approximately 1.5 mn t instead. In Marketing, OMV aims to become the first choice of our customers for energy, mobility and convenience, focusing on the sale of sustainable aviation fuels, building an EV recharging network, and growing its non-fuel retail business.\n\nIn the Exploration & Production business, OMV is focusing on maximizing the value and harvesting cash. E&P will reduce gradually its fossil production to below 400 kboe/d by 2030, with an overweight on gas. In the same time, OMV will make significant investments into the low-carbon solutions, namely in around 10 TWh renewable energy (e.g., geothermal) and around 5 m t p.a. of CCS capacity by 2030 to reduce its GHG footprint. The E&P business will act as a cash engine for the Group and will support the transformation.\n\nThe gas sales and logistics business excluding OMV Petrom will be consolidated in the E&P business starting 2022. Toward the end of the decade, equity gas contribution to the Gas Sales business portfolio will decrease due to natural fields decline, and will be predominantly replaced by primarily traded green gas products in order to reduce the carbon intensity of the product portfolio.\n\nOMV is committed to becoming a net-zero emissions company by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) and has set interim targets for 2030 and 2040, with well-defined actions to meet the targets by 2030. By 2030, OMV aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% and its Scope 3 emissions by 20%. The Group also aims to reduce its intensity in energy supply by 20% by 2030. This will be achieved by decreasing fossil fuel sales, increasing zero-carbon energy sales, increasing polyolefins recycling and sustainable feedstocks and products, as well as using neutralization measures such as CCS.",

These are supported by sound capital allocation priorities and a strong balance sheet, with a mid/long-term leverage ratio of below 30%.\n\nBuilding on its current strengths and a vision of leadership in technology and innovation, OMV will be well positioned to thrive sustainably in a world with low GHG emissions. This strategy enhances OMV's shareholder value, as its transformation path allows for a sustainable growth business model, showing the Group's commitment to cutting GHG emissions, delivering strong financials, and maintaining its progressive dividend policy.\n\n## Chemicals & Materials\n\n## 2030 strategic priorities\n\n- \u25b8 Develop into a global leader in specialty polyolefin solutions\n- \u25b8 Grow in attractive markets with a particular focus on North America and Asia\n- \u25b8 Grow sustainable polyolefin production to up to ~40% of total polyolefin production in Europe\n- \u25b8 Establish a leading position in renewable and circular economy solutions\n- \u25b8 Diversify portfolio by entering adjacent products and new product groups\n\nDemand for chemical products will continue to grow ahead of global GDP, even in a low GHG emission world. Virgin polyolefin demand is expected to grow slightly above GDP with a CAGR (2021-2030) of 3.6%. The majority of this demand growth stems from highgrowth markets in Asia and is associated with a variety of different end-user markets and applications, providing a natural hedge against the volatility of individual industries. Recycled polyolefins are projected to grow with a CAGR (2021-2030) of 11.7%, significantly above GDP, thanks to strong end-market commitments especially in the consumer goods sector, increasing regulatory pressure, and the need for end-of-life solutions for plastic waste.\n\nPolyolefins play a critical role as eco-efficient enablers for a sustainable future, e.g., making lighter weight automotive solutions and packaging that reduces food waste and increases shelf life possible. The current linear value chain in polyolefins faces significant challenges: mismanaged and unmanaged waste, environ-\n\nmental pollution, unnecessary emissions, and microplastic accumulation. Turning the value chain from a linear to a circular model will be one of the priorities for a sustainable chemicals business going forward. However, this requires a profound transformation to enable scale at attractive profitability. Current feedstock accessible directly from recycling is limited. For this reason, tapping into up- and downstream feedstocks, primarily through partnerships, is critical to ensuring sufficient access to plastic waste. Partnerships with brand owners and retailers ensure attractive long-term offtake agreements with green product premiums. In addition, the future operating model needs to be set up to rapidly respond to changing customer and regulatory demands, with a primary focus on the advanced European landscape but also on the ability to quickly roll out successful blueprints globally.\n\nOMV aims to strengthen its polyolefins business by building on existing strengths and capabilities and fully exploiting competitive advantages to grow into adjacent markets, targeting investments and initiatives that improve returns and decreases the Group's carbon footprint.\n\nChemicals & Materials has a strong pipeline of organic growth projects in Europe, Middle East and North America.\n\n## Key growth initiatives include:\n\n- \u25b8 Expansion of propylene capacities in Europe (Kallo plant, 2023)\n- \u25b8 Expansion of the Burghausen naphtha-based steam cracker (2022)\n- \u25b8 Expansion of Borouge JV through Borouge 4 building an ethane-based steam cracker of 1.5 mn t and polyolefin plants with a capacity of 1.4 mn t.

A continued focus on innovation will be essential to maintaining technology leadership.\n\nOMV aims to become a leader in renewable and circular chemicals and materials. To reach this goal, the Group plans to capture emerging renewable and circular market potential by leveraging its integrated technology platform and end-to-end position to establish new products and novel business models.\n\nThe aim is to deliver approximately 2 mn t p.a. of sustainable products by 2030 to reduce product carbon footprint and meet OMV's emission targets. This will be accomplished by accelerating ongoing (advanced) mechanical and chemical recycling initiatives in Europe as well as by using bio feedstocks. The sustainable products will be the result of the increasing use of bio-feedstocks for polyolefins and the broader chemicals portfolio, and leveraging the close integration with OMV's Refining & Marketing business. Building on its European sustainability leadership, Chemicals & Materials will utilize its global footprint to expand circular economy solutions globally with existing joint ventures, new growth platforms, and additional partnerships across Asian and North American assets.\n\nOMV's C&M business will be the major growth engine of the group. With a portfolio of various growth initiatives, it will balance sustainability, risk, and returns and strengthen resilience against market dynamics. The C&M strategy has significant growth and value creation potential.\n\nTotal organic investments in Chemicals & Materials will average EUR 0.9 bn p.a., EUR 0.3 bn p.a. of which will be allocated to sustainable and CO2 emissions reduction projects.\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\n## 2030 strategic priorities\n\n- \u25b8 Reduce crude distillation throughput by 2.6 mn t while growing the production of renewable mobility fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks to approximately 1.5 mn t\n- \u25b8 Produce and market at least 700,000 t of sustainable aviation fuels\n- \u25b8 Invest in a EV charging network and significantly increase margin contribution from Retail non-fuel business\n- \u25b8 Significantly reduce absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions\n\nGoing forward, R&M is reshaping its product portfolio, building on renewable mobility fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks. The company is focusing on safe, innovative, and ecologically and economically sustainable operations. As a result, R&M will enable transformation to low-carbon operations and sales while maintaining strong profitability.\n\nEuropean fossil refining market potential will decrease significantly up to 2030, as both volumes and refining margins are expected to be under pressure driven by the pace of the energy transition in Europe. In the same time horizon, strong growth will materialize for renewable mobility fuels as well as sustainable chemical feedstocks. Refining will proactively decrease crude oil distillation throughput in the Schwechat and Burghausen refineries, from 12.9 mn t in 2019 to approximately 10.3 mn t in 2030, in line with changing demand patterns. This adaptation will significantly reduce heating oil and diesel product output by 2030, while increasing the chemical yield to around 24% for the Western refineries. To leverage the opportunities of the ongoing energy transition, the refining division is developing a sustainable production portfolio for renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks, such as the co-processing of biogenic feedstocks in Schwechat, reaching approximately 1.5 mn t in total by 2030. In this context, the sourcing of bio-feedstocks will be a critical success factor.\n\nOMV will optimize the interface between oil and chemicals with a focus on the integrated Schwechat and Burghausen sites by reconfiguring plants and sites to maximize high-value fossil resources and a growing share of sustainable feedstocks for chemicals production. OMV will continue to operate its three European refineries in Austria, Germany, and Romania as one integrated system, optimizing asset utilization and maximizing margins. Furthermore, the company is implementing energy and operational efficiency measures within the existing refinery assets to maintain a leading cost position in Europe.\n\nOMV's goal with its international, non-operated refining positions in UAE (ADNOC Refining) and Pakistan (PARCO) is to improve their commercial performance. The focus in the short to mid-term will be on operational",

In the mid- to long-term, OMV will evaluate commercial options for the production of sustainable mobility fuels and assess strategic options for capital reallocation.\n\nThe Marketing & Trading activities in Europe secure OMV's customer and market access. In line with changing demand patterns, as well as regulatory obligations, OMV will gradually transform its product portfolio to include more sustainable fuels and services by 2030, thereby increasing the resilience of its product mix. OMV will build a growing business for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) in central Europe by establishing new market positions in the vicinity of planned production sites, such as in Belgium and in Romania. OMV Marketing & Trading will market at least 700,000 tons of SAF by 2030. OMV will aim to grow SAF sales volumes significantly beyond the planned regulatory framework and will target the growing voluntary compliance market. Simultaneously, Marketing & Trading will sustain its position of bitumen and marine fuel oil to safeguard refinery utilization, while continuing to evolve these products to lower GHG emissions.\n\nIn Retail Mobility & Convenience, OMV intends to further develop existing market potential by significantly growing the non-fuel business sector. New gastronomy and service concepts, as well as cooperation in the food logistics sector, are expected to significantly increase the volume and margin of the non-fuel business by 2030. In parallel, the company will further increase its premium fuel share to more than 30% as a differentiator and significant margin generator by 2030. OMV Retail Mobility & Convenience will expand into e-mobility, building a leading position in out-of-home Electric Vehicle (EV) charging locations such as highway and transit refilling stations, as well as convenience hubs. With a total investment in this segment of more than EUR 400 mn by 2030, OMV will grow the profitability of the retail business as well as monetize the value of its assets.\n\nTotal organic investments in the R&M business will average at EUR 1 bn p.a. in 2022-2030, EUR 0.5 bn p.a. of which will be allocated to sustainable and carbon emissions reduction projects.\n\nWith this new strategy, OMV will accelerate attainment of its goal of lowering GHG emissions by reducing fossil fuels, stepping up the production and marketing of\n\nrenewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks, as well as implementing energy efficiency measures.\n\n## Exploration & Production\n\n## 2030 strategic priorities\n\n- \u25b8 Portfolio managed as a robust cash generator to support the Group's transformation\n- \u25b8 Production of at least 450 kboe/d is expected by 2025 and below 400 kboe/d by 2030, with an overweight on gas 1\n- \u25b8 Low-carbon business solutions developed, with around 10 TWh in renewable energy (e.g., geothermal) and 5 mn t p.a. CCS, to significantly reduce absolute and relative GHG emissions\n- \u25b8 Production cost below USD 7/boe\n- \u25b8 Portfolio optimization measures will be evaluated\n\nIn the context of the ongoing energy transition and to support OMV Group's transformation, E&P will be managed as a robust cash generator and will focus on further upgrading its competitive asset portfolio, concentrating on the four core regions: Central and Eastern Europe, the North Sea, Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific. The shift of the hydrocarbon portfolio to gas will continue, with further divestment of non-core positions to improve efficiency, while the low-carbon business will be ramped up to achieve a material contribution by the end of the decade.\n\nBoosting value delivery and cash generation are the main goals and criteria for managing and developing the portfolio of oil and gas assets, with a strong emphasis on gas. The delivery over the mid-term of key projects in the portfolio such as the Neptun Development in Romania, Jerun in Malaysia, and Umm Lulu SARB Phase 2 plateau extension in the UAE will support strong cash generation by and beyond 2025. With the current portfolio, OMV expects to maintain production levels of at least 450 kboe/d, with around 60% gas by 2025. 1 Thereafter, OMV expects to reduce its oil and gas production levels to below 400 kboe/d by 2030, keeping the overweight on gas. 1 The production decline will occur primarily in the second part of the decade, as no new large-scale projects (re-)developments are being pursued. In order to sustain the above-mentioned production levels, ramp up the low-carbon business, and deliver strong cash generation, E&P anticipates a total annual average CAPEX over the decade of around EUR 1.6 bn, EUR 0.6 bn of which is earmarked",

OMV's exploration and appraisal activities are being streamlined further, and the total annual average budget is expected to be around EUR 0.2 bn over the decade. Toward the end of the decade, oil and gas CAPEX and E&A expenditures will be reduced, thereby allowing for more capital to be allocated toward ramping up the low-carbon business and the broader OMV transformation.\n\nE&P plans to reinforce the competitiveness of its portfolio and resilience against market volatility amid the rapidly changing demands of the oil and gas industry. The strong focus on operational excellence, fostered by digitalization and agile ways of working, in addition to portfolio optimization, will ensure that production cost remains below USD 7/boe beyond 2025.\n\nThe Gas sales business and logistics excluding OMV Petrom will be consolidated in the E&P business starting 2022. Over the next decade, European production will decline, while demand is expected to remain resilient. To close the supply-demand gap, OMV will continue to complement its own natural gas production in Norway, Austria, and Romania with long-term gas supply contracts from Russia and is working to identify and develop additional sources of supply. The equity gas contribution to the Gas sales business will decrease significantly toward the end of the decade in Northwestern region due to natural fields decline, and will largely be replaced with green gases, such as biogas and hydrogen, primarily obtained through trading, to reduce the carbon intensity of its product portfolio. New equity gas volumes from the Romanian Neptun project will keep volumes high in the Southeastern region. OMV will also aim to direct an increasing share of its natural gas sales to customers from non-energy sectors, such as the chemicals industry, to further reduce its Scope 3 portfolio emissions.\n\nThe Group will explore a range of opportunities and portfolio choices that enhance cash flow generated by the current Exploration and Production business and support a potential accelerated transition to sustainable fuels, chemicals, and materials. These opportunities may include capturing the full value potential of the asset base, e.g., low carbon business potential, maintaining reservoir production excellence and optimizing costs as well as assessing and developing joint venture opportunities for selected assets without excluding inorganic options.\n\nTo reduce its operations carbon footprint, E&P will pursue the phase out of routine gas flaring and venting, reduce fugitive methane emissions, and introduce portfolio optimization measures. In addition, renewable energy projects will also be pursued for the purpose of\n\npowering OMV's own operations, such as the photovoltaic plant developed with VERBUND in Sch\u00f6nkirchen, Austria. To achieve overall reduction of both absolute and relative GHG emissions from its product portfolio, E&P will leverage its existing asset base and core skills to deliver financially strong low-carbon business projects. Available opportunities will be captured to build up geothermal heat capacity that generates up to 9 TWh p.a. by 2030. In addition to geothermal, a minimum of 1 TWh from renewable power will be developed in OMV core regions with favorable sun and wind conditions to serve captive demand, thereby reducing Scope 2 emissions by OMV's own operations. E&P will further tap its existing reservoirs and (sub-)surface capabilities to implement opportunities that lead to a CCS storage capacity of approximately 5 mn t p.a. of CO2 net to OMV by 2030. In addition, further opportunities where E&P can leverage its strengths and capabilities are being explored, e.g., hydrogen and energy storage, and will potentially be pursued in consideration of OMV strategic priorities.\n\n## Decarbonization strategy\n\n## 2030 strategic priorities\n\n- \u25b8 Reduce OMV Group Scope 3 emissions by 20%\n- \u25b8 Reduce OMV Group Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30%\n- \u25b8 Reduce OMV Group's carbon intensity of energy supply by 20%\n\nOMV is committed to achieving net-zero emissions (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) by 2050, with interim targets for 2030 and 2040. OMV is awaiting the publication of the science based targets (SBT) methodology for the oil & gas sector to evaluate its new targets against the SBT requirements with the ultimate ambition to get them approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). OMV targets are set at an absolute and intensity level with the ultimate goal of achieving net-zero emissions in Scopes 1, 2, and 3 by 2050. For Scope 1 and 2, OMV aims for an absolute reduction of 30% by 2030 and of 60% by 2040. For the defined categories in Scope 3, OMV aims at the reduction by 20% by 2030 and by 50% by 2040. In terms of reducing the carbon intensity of energy supply, OMV intends to achieve a decrease of 20% by 2030 and 50% by 2040.\n\nThese emission reductions can only be achieved with considerable effort and capital allocated: The Group has earmarked organic investments of more than EUR 13 bn for this purpose. All business units will build on their existing strengths and know-how on this transformation journey. Three key initiatives will be undertaken to achieve the targeted reductions by 2030:",

The value-driven finance strategy operates on a clear framework for enabling long-term profitable and resilient growth and aims to achieve a ROACE of at least 12%, positive free cash flow after dividends, a strong balance sheet, with a mid/long-term leverage ratio of below 30%, a Clean CCS Operating Result of at least EUR 5 bn by 2025 and EUR 6 bn by 2030, increasing\n\nclean CCS net income attributable to shareholders, operating cash flow excluding net working capital of around EUR 6 bn by 2025 and at least EUR 7 bn by 2030, as well as a progressive dividend policy.\n\nWhen building its financial plan, OMV set a sound capital allocation policy: first, investing in its organic portfolio; second, paying attractive dividends; third, pursuing inorganic spending for an accelerated transformation; and fourth, deleveraging 1 . In its capital allocation, the Group focuses on selecting the most competitive and resilient projects. The defined investment criteria include hurdle rates and payback periods by business reflecting respective risk and return profiles, as well as testing projects for their resilience and break-even versus relevant market KPIs.\n\nTo achieve its strategic goal, OMV plans a yearly organic CAPEX around EUR 3.5 bn for the period from 2022 to 2030. Overall, the Group is allocating more than EUR 13 bn, in total, for 2022-2030 to achieve its ambitious decarbonization targets. In addition, OMV will consider inorganic growth in areas of strategic importance. However, this will depend on the Group's indebtedness headroom. Moreover, the Group's portfolio of assets can provide options through divestments to accelerate strategy execution when attractive acquisition targets in targeted growth areas become available.\n\nThe Group's strategy, supported by disciplined capital allocation, will enable OMV to generate increasing and resilient cash flows and higher earnings. These solid financials ensure a strong balance sheet for the Group. In its financial framework, OMV has made a significant commitment to ensuring a robust balance sheet and a investment-grade credit rating. The Company aims to achieve a leverage ratio of below 30% for mid- and long term. Depending on portfolio measures, the leverage ratio can exceed 30%, however this will then be followed by a deleveraging program to ensure the balance sheet is strengthened.\n\nDuring the strategy period, OMV will continue to deliver on its progressive dividend policy. The Group therefore aims to increase the dividends every year, or to at least maintain dividends at the respective previous year's level. This underlines the Group's commitment to its progressive dividend policy.",

OMV integrates risks and opportunities related to climate change impacts into the development of the Company's business strategy and the planning of operational activities. In this regard, OMV continuously improves the carbon efficiency of its operations and product portfolio, and is fully committed to supporting and accelerating the energy transition. We aim to become a net-zero business by 2050 or sooner.\n\nOMV implements measures aimed at optimizing its operational processes, increasing energy efficiency, reducing flaring and venting, and reducing methane emissions through leakage detection and improvement of asset integrity. We will continue phasing out routine flaring and venting as soon as possible, but no later than 2030, as part of OMV's commitment to the World Bank's 'Zero routine flaring by 2030' initiative. For instance, in Yemen, one of our most flaring-intense operations, we commissioned two gas engines for power generation at the central processing facilities in December 2021. The gas engines will support the reduction of flaring as they will consume gas which was previously flared. They will also replace diesel generators, which further reduces GHG emissions. We are also increasingly turning to renewable sources of electricity to power our operations. In 2021, Borealis installed its first solar photovoltaic rooftop array for generating electricity for production purposes at the Borealis plant in Monza (Italy). The company has also signed long-term renewable energy supply deals for its assets in Sweden and Belgium.\n\nA cornerstone of our climate strategy is increasing the share of zero-carbon products in our product portfolio as well as decreasing fossil fuel sales. Oil and gas production will be decreased to below 400 kboe/d by 2030.\n\nOMV focuses on high-quality refinery products such as low-emission premium fuels and feedstocks for the chemical industry. We aim to increase polyolefins recycling and gradually replace fossil polyolefins production with production from biogenic feedstock. In addition, we also plan to significantly increase sustainable and biobased fuels and green gas sales, as well as build up renewable electricity production to around 10.0 TWh (including geothermal, solar/wind). We aim to step up the production of renewable fuels and sustainable chemical feedstocks to approximately 1.5 m t per year, including producing and marketing at least 700,000 t of sustainable aviation fuels per year.\n\nFor instance, OMV and Austrian Airlines (AUA) are producing and using regional Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Austria. The two companies agreed on the production and fueling of 1,500 t of SAF in the coming year 2022. The use of 1,500 t of SAF by Austrian Airlines will reduce carbon emissions by around 3,750 t. This is equal to the CO2 emissions of 333 Vienna-London flights with a typical short to medium-haul AUA aircraft (Airbus A320).\n\nOur climate targets can only be achieved with considerable effort and capital allocation. OMV Group has earmarked investments of more than EUR 13 bn for this purpose. All business units will build on existing strengths and expertise in this transformation journey.\n\nIn 2021, OMV achieved an outstanding CDP Climate Change score of A- (Leadership) for the sixth time in a row. With its CDP Climate Change score, OMV is among 20 companies in the global oil and gas sector that achieved a leadership score and among the top 7 companies across all sectors in Austria.\n\n## Business principles and social responsibility performance\n\n## Business ethics and compliance\n\nOMV is a signatory to the UN Global Compact and has a Code of Business Ethics in place that applies to all employees. Although we are headquartered in Austria - a country with high business ethics standards - we operate in several countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Central and Eastern Europe that are defined as high risk by the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index. We strive to avoid the risks of bribery and corruption that are specific to our sector. We also highly value our reputation. Therefore, our highest priority is ensuring uniform compliance with our business ethics standards wherever we operate. Compliance with ethical standards is a non-negotiable value that supersedes any business interest. Absolute commitment to this objective is embedded at all levels at OMV from top management to every employee. Our business partners are also expected to share the same understanding of and commitment to ethical standards. Every Company activity, from planning business strategy to daily operations, is assessed for compliance with ethical standards, such as the Code of Conduct and Code of Business Ethics.\n\nA dedicated cross-regional compliance organization ensures that OMV standards are consistently met across the Group. In 2021, 16,020 OMV Group employees were trained in business ethics. This number is com-",

The Integrity Platform provides an anonymous whistleblower mechanism for OMV employees and external stakeholders, such as suppliers. They can use this platform to report issues relating to corruption, bribes, conflicts of interest, antitrust law, or capital market law. In 2021, the scope of the Integrity Platform was expanded, and the platform can now also be used to make reports of perceived violations in the following legal areas: public procurement, environmental protection, product and food safety and consumer protection, corporate tax regulations, and data protection.\n\n## Supplier Compliance\n\nImplementing sustainable procurement means caring about the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the goods and services the Company intends to purchase. OMV has a Code of Conduct in place that ensures that suppliers support OMV's principles. It is of paramount importance to our organization to be fully compliant with all applicable legal requirements, as well as with our internal safety, environmental protection, and human rights standards while managing our supply chain. OMV has a process in place to ensure that parties sanctioned by the EU or international organizations, such as the United Nations, are not accepted as procurement partners.\n\nTo mitigate supply chain risks including forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and corruption, OMV imposes the legal requirements and internal rules and standards applicable to OMV on its suppliers. Our suppliers and supply chain partners are obligated to sign and fully comply with the content of the Code of Conduct. In addition, our suppliers must accept the General Conditions of Purchase, which further detail our business standards (e.g., labor rights), as an integral part of our contractual agreements. OMV reserves the right to terminate relationships with suppliers if non-compliance is discovered or not addressed in a timely manner.\n\nSupplier prequalification is a part of pre-contractual activities during which OMV collects information from a potential supplier for the purpose of evaluating compliance with our HSSE and other sustainability requirements. The goal of the prequalification process is to screen potential suppliers before bringing them on board or during the tender stage to ensure that only those suppliers who meet our HSSE and sustainability standards can be considered for future collaboration. Following prequalification, Procurement together with\n\nbusiness representatives select the best suppliers based on a predefined set of commercial, legal, HSSE, and technical criteria during a tender process. In 2021, we started embedding sustainability elements into the evaluation matrix (e.g., technologically innovative elements, carbon emissions, energy efficiency KPIs) in several pilot projects.\n\nOMV conducts supplier audits as part of the prequalification process and/or during contract execution. The aim of the audits is to measure the performance of our suppliers and define actions that will enable them to optimize their performance and meet OMV requirements. Among the focus areas of the audits are the financial stability of our suppliers, their strategy and organization, and the supply chain sustainability (e.g., human rights, carbon management, environmental management, certifications, and social responsibility). In 2021, we added a new cybersecurity dimension to our supplier audits. We also perform yearly subject-specific audits on topics such as process safety, quality, and efficiency.\n\nIn 2021, OMV joined Together for Sustainability (TfS) and expanded the membership held by Borealis since 2017 to Group level. Together for Sustainability, a joint initiative and global network of 34 chemical companies, sets the de facto global standard for environmental, social, and governance performance of chemical supply chains. The TfS program is based on the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care\u00ae principles.\n\nOMV aims to build on Borealis' expertise and cover a broader range of ESG assessments of our suppliers in the coming years. Becoming a TfS member will help OMV to further embed sustainability in day-to-day business operations and cascade sustainability requirements in our supply chain.\n\nWe aim to continuously manage and decrease the carbon emissions of our purchased goods and services. For this reason, OMV became a CDP Supply Chain member in 2021. As part of CDP Supply Chain, OMV invited around 140 suppliers to answer the CDP Climate Change questionnaire in 2021. In addition to reporting their emissions, we asked the suppliers whether they have carbon reduction targets in place and invited them to share with us any initiatives or projects to reduce carbon emissions in which they would like us to participate. A total of 63% of suppliers assessed by CDP Supply Chain have declared that they have climate targets in place.",

        "page_content": "## Human Rights\n\nHuman rights are universal values that guide our conduct in every aspect of our activities. Our responsibilities in the area of human rights include, but are not limited to, equality and non-discrimination, decent wages, working hours, employee representation, security, primary healthcare, labor rights in the supply chain, education, poverty reduction, land rights, and free, prior, and informed consultation. OMV respects and supports human rights as described in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in internationally recognized treaties, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO). We have been a signatory to the UN Global Compact since 2003 and are fully committed to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We fully support the aims of the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 and are committed to operating our business and supply chain free of forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. OMV considers human rights to be an important aspect of our risk management approach, which is integrated into our decision-making processes. OMV recognizes its responsibility to respect, fulfill, and support human rights in all business activities and to ensure that OMV does not become complicit in any human rights abuses as defined under current international law.\n\nWe conduct human rights risk assessments at country level to identify and assess ongoing and emerging human rights impacts and the resulting potential risks relevant to OMV business activities in the country in order to prevent and mitigate human rights risks and impacts. A total of 980 employees received training on human rights topics through the e-learning tool and in-person training sessions (2020: 2,304). As professional training is essential to ensure compliance with our human rights commitment, we have set ourselves the goal of training all employees in human rights topics by 2025. In addition, internal awareness campaigns on human rights were implemented. In 2021, seven incidents of human rights grievances were reported (2020: 0), related to aspects such as working hours and rest times and alleged cases of bullying, harassment, defamation, unfair treatment and disrespectful behavior.\n\n## Community Relations and Development\n\nOMV maintains an active partnership with local communities in all countries in which the Company does business and is committed to adding value to these societies. As part of OMV's stakeholder dialogue, we have implemented community grievance mechanisms at all operating sites. In 2021, OMV registered 884 grievances (2020: 812) from the community grievance mechanisms. All of the grievances were handled in accordance with OMV's localized Community Grievance Management (CGM) procedures, which stipulate a stringent approach to systematically receiving, documenting, addressing, and resolving grievances in all of the countries where we operate.\n\nOMV has set the goal of aligning the CGM system at all sites with the effectiveness criteria of the United Nations Guiding Principles. We are striving to achieve this target by conducting assessments that include reviews of management processes and consultations with internal and external stakeholders. The assessments result in recommendations and tailored action plans to improve grievance management at site level. The action plans are implemented by local management and monitored by headquarters. The sites already assessed represent 99% of all registered grievances at OMV in 2021.\n\n- \uf026 For more information about OMV's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) ratings and the indices in which OMV is included, see the chapter OMV on the Capital Markets.\n- \uf026 For management approaches and performance details for all material topics, see the stand-alone OMV Sustainability Report.

The integrity of OMV's operating facilities, loss prevention, proactive risk management, and climate change mitigation are essential for attaining OMV's HSSE vision of 'ZERO harm - NO losses.'\n\n## HSSE Strategy\n\nTo achieve this vision, OMV Group's HSSE Strategy was established as an integral part of the OMV Sustainability Strategy. The HSSE Strategy focuses on the cross-functional goals of strong HSSE commitment and leadership, increased efficiency and effectiveness of HSSE processes, management of HSSE risks, and skilled people, as well as subject matter goals in the areas of\n\n- \u25b8 Health: improve the ability to work through integrated health management\n- \u25b8 Security: protect people, assets, and reputation from emerging malicious intentional threats\n- \u25b8 Safety: build on sustainable safety for people and plants\n- \u25b8 Environment: minimize the environmental footprint throughout the entire lifecycle of activities\n\n## Health, safety, and security\n\nIn 2021, the combined Lost-Time Injury Rate (LTIR) for OMV employees and contractors was 0.57 (2020: 0.32), and our combined Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) was 0.96 (2020: 0.60). We are deeply concerned about three work-related fatalities, all three related to road transportation activities of contractor companies in Austria and Romania. Managing the COVID19 pandemic remained a high priority in 2021 on top of routine HSSE management. We focused primarily on learning from incidents throughout the whole Company: Videos, alerts, and communication campaigns were used to reach out to all employees.\n\nIn Exploration & Production, the TRIR was 0.92 (2020: 0.58). Tragically, two contractor employees died in two fatal work accidents in 2021. We also encountered 19 High Potential Incidents (HiPos) that could have resulted in serious or even fatal injuries under slightly different circumstances. All fatalities and HiPos have been thoroughly investigated, and measures were put in place to prevent reoccurrence. Contractor management was and continues to be a focus area in our HSSE efforts. We continued to focus on process safety management, and various initiatives ensured the reliability of production.\n\nThe HSSE performance of Refining & Marketing in 2021 was overshadowed by a road accident resulting in a fatality of a contractor employee. Efforts therefore went into a broad awareness campaign about road transportation safety and the development of an enhanced framework of safety requirements for future logistics contractors. Another focus area was the implementation of the process safety roadmap including two external process safety management assessments in the refineries. We encountered 23 HiPos. The TRIR in 2021 was 0.56 (2020: 0.59). Special emphasis during the year was placed on leadership engagement, safety culture, contractor management, and training on various emergency and crisis management scenarios.\n\nIn Chemicals & Materials, OMV Group's definitions and incident reporting criteria were fully rolled out to Borealis. These are more stringent than those used previously. The business division achieved a TRIR of 2.24 (2020, Borealis only: 3.89). Occupational safety initiatives focused on further rolling out a virtual Life Saving Rules training, preventing employees from becoming infected with COVID-19, and achieving ISO 45001 certification for Borealis. Regarding process safety, the focus was on introducing the Process Safety Rules, starting a Quantitative Risk Assessment Study for hydrocarbon processing activities at Porvoo and developing a concept to improve quality of process hazard assessments. Borealis continued the positive downward trend of process safety events from 19 in 2020 to 16 in 2021.\n\n## OMV Group safety performance\n\nIn mn hours worked\n\n|                                 | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Company                         |        |        |\n| Lost-Time Injury Rate           | 0.70   | 0.43   |\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate    | 1.18   | 0.83   |\n| Contractors                     |        |        |\n| Lost-Time Injury Rate           | 0.51   | 0.27   |\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate    | 0.85   | 0.48   |\n| Total (Company and contractors) |        |        |\n| Lost-Time Injury Rate           | 0.57   | 0.32   |\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate    | 0.96   | 0.60   |",

        "page_content": "Employee wellbeing and health are the foundation for successful company performance as they are core elements of ensuring the ability to work. The year 2021 was dominated by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Our medical teams and service providers were challenged to support the emergency management teams in updating and implementing pandemic preparedness plans, guidelines, and health information while also supporting COVID-19-infected employees at home and in hospitals. In addition, OMV continued its long tradition of offering healthcare and preventive health programs, such as cardiovascular disease prevention programs, voluntary health checks, vaccinations (mainly flu and in some countries COVID-19), and virtual health hours, which far exceed local statutory requirements.\n\nDuring 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic also brought significant challenges to safety management. At operational level, we implemented preventive and businesscontinuity-related measures such as strictly separated teams in key areas, hygiene measures, and constant awareness building. Despite travel limitations and thanks to digital communication and collaboration tools, we conducted several key safety-related activities:\n\n- \u25b8 We continued broad communication about the Life Saving Rules by means of videos with senior management statements to remind our employees about simple rules to prevent the hazards that have the greatest potential to cause serious injuries.\n- \u25b8 All incidents at level 3 and above and HiPos were investigated, and lessons-learned reports were communicated throughout the organization. Improvement initiatives were developed and closely monitored with our HSSE reporting tool Synergi.\n- \u25b8 As part of our Safety Culture program, we conducted several workshops on 'making HSSE personal' at different levels of the organization. The half-yearly meetings with the program owner were conducted online.\n- \u25b8 Contractor HSSE management is key to OMV Group's safety performance. We updated our group-wide regulation and continued training of beneficiaries and procurement staff on the internal regulations framework. We conducted strategic supplier meetings with the main contractors to share information, experience, and expectations.\n- \u25b8 We further developed a harmonized set of KPIs and a dashboard for process safety. We supported and followed up on the implementation of process safety road maps in our ventures, assets, and refineries. In our new Integrated Risk Register, we implemented a novel approach for analyzing and prioritizing process safety risks in order to ensure that\n- investments effectively lead to a significant reduction of risks. The OMV Group process safety network, a large online collaboration platform, grew further (>200 participants), and gathered quarterly to exchange information and experiences in virtual meetings. Senior management also attended.\n- \u25b8 We undertook a deep analysis and review of 15 group-wide effective HSSE regulations and our cloud-based HSSE reporting tool in order to prepare and achieve progress on a systematic alignment between OMV Group and Borealis.\n\nAn unstable geopolitical environment combined with complex and enduring regional conflicts remained a consistent security focus throughout 2021. Corporate Security continued to monitor these geopolitical situations, accelerating OMV's understanding of strategic events, to proactively identify any emergent threat that might intersect with business planning. This included incidents of armed conflict, civil unrest, targeted activism, and criminality at local, national, regional, and international levels.\n\nOur crisis management and resilience procedures assisted in the effective management of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021. Local Emergency Management Teams worked closely with their corporate counterparts to ensure local responses aligned with the Company's pandemic strategy.\n\nWe updated our proven security management system in 2021, enabling us to anticipate or respond to a broad spectrum of geopolitical, regional, or isolated security incidents. The security risk assessment platform continued to provide real-time oversight of asset risk exposure levels as influenced by geopolitical or security events. Despite various geopolitical and pandemic challenges, Corporate Security continued to deliver global operational support, governance, and oversight, and will maintain a comparable and effective security strategy allowing OMV to operate despite converging asymmetric threats.\n\nOMV is committed to upholding human rights in all activities. To this end, OMV aims to join the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights (VPSHR), an initiative focused on human rights, public safety and security, and the interaction between companies and private and public security. Corporate Security will undertake a VPSHR pre-qualification review to determine the feasibility of attaining full accreditation in the coming years.",

The Group strives to minimize that impact at all times, particularly in terms of spills, energy efficiency, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as water and waste management. OMV aims to optimize processes to use natural resources as efficiently as possible and to reduce emissions and discharges.\n\nIn 2021, there were 3 major hydrocarbon spills (level 3 out of five levels; 2020: 2). The total volume of hydrocarbon spilled increased compared to the previous year. OMV continues to improve its oil spill response preparedness and capabilities.\n\nKey environmental actions and achievements in 2021:\n\n- \u25b8 Our operations in Yemen implemented new water management plans. The wastewater treatment plants were upgraded, now allowing the treated water to be used for irrigation in a very arid environment.\n- \u25b8 At the Petrobrazi refinery, the tank modernization program continued with the installation of internal floating membranes or double sealing of six product tanks and the commissioning of one new tank, contributing to the reduction of volatile oganic compounds (VOC).\n- \u25b8 At the Schwechat refinery, more than 800,000 m 3 /year of water, which is equivalent to more than 5% of average annual water consumption, are being conserved, most of it from a new control concept for the cooling water in a heat exchanger group in the ethylene plant.\n\n- \u25b8 OMV Petrom completed the surface abandonment of 718 wells and 30 facilities in the E&P division. A total of 184,000 t of contaminated soil were treated in our bioremediation plants, and 14,500 t of metallic scrap were recycled by authorized companies.\n- \u25b8 Borealis became a member of the UN Global Compact and signed the UN Sustainable Ocean Principles. These commit companies to restoring and maintaining a healthy and productive ocean. Moreover, Borealis has initiated Project STOP, a pioneering program to support cities in developing and emerging countries to establish cost efficient, effective, and more circular waste collection systems. Read more on the Project STOP website.\n- \u25b8 The modernization of the Gherce\u0219ti tank farm at Asset Oltenia was completed, including the installation of two new tanks with a vapor recovery system. In addition to the optimization of the oil treatment process, environmental impacts were reduced considerably (VOC emissions). The improved water system will save up to 5,000 m\u00b3 water per year.\n- \u25b8 We continued to implement biodiversity initiatives, such as our green areas project in arid locations in Tunisia. Starting by planting 512 trees in Waha in 2020, we continued expanding to Nawara with 1,200 trees in 2021. The project includes an irrigation system. The goal is to provide recreation areas to improve the wellbeing of personnel and visitors, and to promote forestation.",

We are proud of the results we have achieved together. Trust and pride in the organization fuel our employees' energy and determination to tackle challenges and to focus on innovative solutions to make us even stronger.\n\n## OMV's People Strategy\n\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 situation again required considerable additional focus from our organization's HR function. We continue to build on our strategic priorities to unlock our organization's full potential and to strengthen the foundation for growth and success:\n\n- \u25b8 Increase engagement with employees\n- \u25b8 Increase focus on diversity and inclusion\n- \u25b8 Increase organizational agility\n- \u25b8 Ensure OMV remains a great place to work\n\n## Highlights of 2021\n\nOur employees once again showed outstanding flexibility and commitment to the Company in this challenging year marked by COVID-19. During the coronavirus pandemic, many new employment-related measures were implemented to protect the health, well-being, and economic situation of our employees. By closely monitoring the constant legislative output, we succeeded in maintaining full labor law compliance while also offering our staff new options to help with their pandemic-induced personal situations and needs. Employees were offered various new solutions (depending on the local jurisdiction) to combine work duties and care obligations more flexibly. All employees were provided the option to work from home where practically and technically feasible.\n\nWe developed virtual collaboration programs and remote leadership capabilities to ensure organizational agility and excellence and to make OMV a great place to work during these challenging times. Our new manager training was delivered completely virtually, and a new program called Remote Leadership supported our executives and managers in managing remote teams of employees either working from home or in a different country. OMV's culture and performance were safeguarded by growing our leaders' virtual and remote collaboration skills. We developed the Working from Home Guide, which is an online guide containing tips and\n\ntricks for improving virtual teams through the use of technology. Learning Collections were provided to assist employees with leadership during times of crisis as well as managing stress and virtual work. Information and advice are regularly provided on all employee-relevant questions. Free psychological support was offered to all employees, enabling them to talk to a professional about coping with the pandemic. Based on the wish expressed by our staff to keep working from home as the 'new normal,' a flexible home office policy was introduced in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, we introduced an employee engagement strategy whereby we check in with our employees on how they are doing and how they are dealing with the pandemic situation. With the second OMV quick poll launched at the end of 2021, we wanted to further strengthen the culture of listening in our company and gather feedback on diversity, equal opportunities, and an inclusive environment at OMV. The poll's findings will play an important part in developing our new Group-wide Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategy for 2030.\n\nIn 2021, there was a focus on mandatory, legally binding, business-critical, and low-cost learning consisting of e-learning, online learning through our partnership with LinkedIn Learning, and virtual courses/webinars. Leadership training focused on first-time leaders, women in leadership, and managing remote and hybrid teams. Another priority was supporting staff in developing their virtual skills, for example by offering virtual facilitation courses. In terms of business skills, the focus was on sales training and, as before, on graduating new cohorts from our Integrated Graduate Development (IGD) Program.",

The program's target group includes male as well as female employees to encourage more equal distribution of childcare responsibilities.\n\nWe are working on new HR strategies and a new HR purpose in line with the Company's new strategy. Over the past year, the HR teams from OMV Petrom, OMV, and Borealis have collaborated increasingly to share best practices and find a common way forward. Great synergies have been unlocked in recruitment, provider sharing (e.g., LinkedIn digital learning), and training programs on the oil, gas, and chemical industries.\n\n## Diversity\n\nDuring 2021, OMV continued to be strongly committed to delivering its Diversity Strategy. Dedicated diversity targets were established in 2018 as part of our Sustainability Strategy 2025. This enabled us to set clear commitments in this area and measure improvement in the two main focus areas defined: Gender Equality and Internationality. Our focus on diversity is also being actively nurtured throughout the organization today, supported by a range of trainings, activities, and awareness campaigns, including a Diversity & Inclusion Week held in March and built around International Women's Day. We also continued our series of online events with external guest speakers on relevant diversity topics such as remote leadership, working across cultures, and the intersection of inclusion and technology.\n\nWe designed and implemented targeted training programs, such as SHEnergy, a blended-learning program for women at OMV, to support women's leadership skills. The program focuses on active inclusion skills and also emphasizes the power of mentoring and networking in developing female leaders.\n\nAs a result, the percentage of women in the Group is about 27% (2020: 25%). A total of 20.9% (2020: 20.7%; excluding Borealis) of employees in management and executive positions are female.",

        "page_content": "## OMV Group Business Year\n\nIn 2021, OMV recorded a clean CCS Operating Result of EUR 6.0 bn, representing the highest clean CCS Operating Result in OMV's history. Furthermore, an all-time record cash flow from operating activities excluding net working capital effects of EUR 8.9 bn was achieved, leading OMV to a whole new level of cash generation. As a consequence organic free cash flow before dividends came in at EUR 4.5 bn, stemming from a strong operational performance coupled with a positive market environment.\n\n## Business environment\n\nAfter the exceptional situation in 2020 marked by COVID-19, the world developed along a solid economic recovery path. Nevertheless, the year was shaped by unequal vaccination access and differing vaccination rates, new and more infectious COVID-19 mutations (Delta and Omicron), recurring regional lockdown periods, and strong economic policy support.\n\nMany raw materials and commodities were impacted by global supply and demand disruptions, leading to exceptionally tight markets and significantly elevated prices. After more than seven years, inflation reached new highs and raised concerns about loose monetary policy and interest rates. In 2022, significant uncertainty remains, and the global pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on the economy. Climate change and global decarbonization policies gained more political momentum, showing the need for a smooth energy transition in the mid to long run.\n\nGlobal economic output increased by 5.9% in 2021 (- 3.1% in 2020), surpassing pre-crisis levels based on a strong economic recovery in Asia. All sectors reliant on contact-intensive interactions (tourism, travel, hospitality, culture, and entertainment) recovered partly but remained adversely affected. Employment in advanced economies was strongly impacted by shortto medium-term containment measures but recovered nearly fully to 2019 levels thanks to strong economic policy support.\n\nGlobal trade rebounded by more than 9% in 2021 (after -8.2% in 2020). Developments were influenced by substantial distortions along global supply chains with extraordinary implications on industrial production and trade in various sectors.\n\nThe varying regional speed of pandemic waves has led to huge disparities in economic performance on different continents. In Europe, the economic recovery path was significantly impacted by containment effects with Eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP) increasing by 5.2% in 2021 (after -6.4% in 2020) but still lagging behind pre-crisis levels. In the emerging and developing Asian countries, this figure grew by 7.2% (after - 0.9% in 2020), especially due to rigorous vaccination,\n\nquarantine, and contact tracing measures and enabled a return to pre-crisis growth levels.\n\nThe economic environment in Central and Eastern European countries kept pace with the EU average, with GDP increasing between 2.7% (Germany) and 7.2% (Croatia), mostly above 2019 levels. The difference in GDP growth rates can also be attributed to the differing regional duration and scale of lockdowns and sector composition in country's GDP. Massive government spending in all countries supported the economic recovery, however this increased national debt to record levels.\n\nGermany's GDP increased by 2.7% in 2021. This was the result of domestic COVID-19 restrictions as well as disruptions in raw material imports impacting the industry sector (especially the automotive industry). In Austria, GDP grew by 4.1% in 2021 amid stronger lockdown restrictions and the affected tourism and service sectors accounting for a larger share of the economy. Romania's economy expanded by 6.8% based on the recovery of the industrial sector and the continued strengthening of the service sector (especially retail, transportation, and information and telecommunications).\n\nInflation rates have increased rapidly worldwide. Eurozone inflation stood at an average of 2.2% in 2021 and showed monthly peaks in the fourth quarter of 2021, while US inflation rose to levels around 7% at the end of 2021. In most cases, rising inflation reflects pandemic-related supply/demand mismatches and higher commodity prices compared to their low baseline from a year ago.\n\nIn 2021, global oil demand recovered by 5.6 mn bbl/d. However, it is still 3% below 2019 levels. As a result of the continental divergence of COVID-19 pandemic waves, the Asian continent has already surpassed precrisis level in 2021, in contrast to many other countries, which remain below 2019 levels. European oil demand grew by 0.7 mn bbl/d in 2021.All major oil products saw growth in 2021 as soon as COVID-19 containment restrictions were eased. Road transportation fuels, including gasoline and gasoil/diesel increased by around 3.1 mn bbl/d globally and jet fuel/kerosene recovered slowly by 0.5 mn bbl/d with air travel and mobility restrictions still in effect. It will take at least until 2022 for",

        "page_content": "jet demand to return to 2019 levels when global tourism fully recovers.\n\nIncreasing oil output kept pace with the global demand recovery, helped by a clear steer of the OPEC+ alliance. OPEC+ member states agreed to a stepwise normalization of oil production throughout 2021, which was implemented with a high production compliance rate and supported by geopolitical constraints in some countries. Most of OPEC supply growth came from Saudi Arabia and Libya, which rapidly increased production after domestic constraints. US crude oil production was up slightly in 2021, however, a production time lag following an increasing rig count is expected to materialize in 2022 (still limited by shareholder expectations and financial limitations). Whereas Iran and Venezuela remained affected by US sanctions and infrastructure constraints, Iran nevertheless was able to increase its production by a sizeable measure relative to the 2020 average.\n\nThe price of Brent crude increased from around USD 55/bbl at the beginning of 2021 to some USD 74/bbl by the end of the year, driven by the global recovery of economic activity, particularly in Asia, and effective OPEC+ supply management. This was also fueled by the positive sentiment around vaccination rollout programs and economic stimulus measures in many countries. New infection waves and mutations of COVID-19 confirmed the uncertainty about the recovery path and led to short-term market volatility. Overall, the average Brent crude price was nearly USD 71/bbl in 2021.\n\nOil product demand in the Central and Southeast European countries relevant to OMV followed the European recovery trend. Transportation fuel demand grew by around 3.6% for gasoline and diesel and by more than 27% for jet fuel in the relevant markets in 2021. Austria's market volume reached more than 10 mn t\n\n(+ 3.2% compared to 2020), with demand for fuels up and demand for heating oil decreasing due to the rebounding price levels and declining stocks. The Romanian oil product market grew faster than the EU average by 7.4% compared to 2020.\n\nLow commodity prices and an unstable financial and liquidity environment continued to trigger reduced oil and gas investments in 2021 (approximately -30% compared to 2019). This trend will most likely have to be compensated for in the coming years to ensure the required oil and gas production for covering future global oil demand.\n\nGlobal demand for natural gas recovered above pre-crisis levels in 2021. However, the global natural gas supply (mainly LNG exports) continued to rise significantly, stimulated by an investment cycle in recent years. In the first half of 2021, Asian demand exceeded expectations due to a cold winter and a strong economy, and led to tight markets globally. In Europe, gas prices soared to new levels of around EUR 40/MWh during the summer period. The combination of low storage volumes and tight supply conditions to Europe escalated during autumn and led to record natural gas prices of EUR >180/MWh before year-end. Moreover, Nord Stream 2, a new supply corridor to Europe, has not been put into operation. Overall, the average CEGH gas price was roughly EUR 46/MWh 2021.\n\nIn Austria, natural gas demand grew by 7.3% in 2021, while natural gas imports and domestic production dropped by -8.5% and -11.5%, respectively. This was compensated for by higher storage withdrawal rates (+50%), in particular due to a temporary cold spell in late spring.\n\nCrude price (Brent) - monthly average\n\n<!-- image -->",

Exceptionally strong market effects of EUR 2,282 mn as a consequence of substantially better oil and gas prices were reinforced by very positive operational effects of EUR 507 mn. They could be achieved thanks to the return to full operations in Libya, revised OPEC quota restrictions in the United Arab Emirates, and the commissioning of a new natural gas field in Tunisia. Sales volumes followed the production development. Depreciation increased by EUR 97 mn in line with production increases.\n\nNet special items amounted to EUR (398) mn in 2021 (2020: EUR (1,282) mn), which were mainly related to temporary hedging effects. While net special items in 2020 were mainly related to the impairments triggered by OMV's revision of its long-term Brent crude oil price planning assumptions, the 2021 amount was impacted by the EUR (383) mn value adjustment of receivables connected to certain E&P assets. The Operating Result reached EUR 2,439 mn (2020: EUR (1,137) mn).\n\nProduction cost excluding royalties was flat at USD 6.7/boe in 2021 (2020: USD 6.6/boe).\n\nThe total hydrocarbon production volume increased by 23 kboe/d to 486 kboe/d. Libyan production was at full capacity during almost the entire period, while it had been severely affected by a force majeure situation for most of the previous year. Output in the United Arab Emirates grew on the back of revised OPEC quota restrictions and in Tunisia after the commissioning of a new natural gas field. Natural decline in Romania and Austria, the full divestment of operations in Kazakhstan in May 2021, and lower natural gas extraction in New Zealand stifled production growth to some extent. Total hydrocarbon sales volumes rose to 462 kboe/d (2020: 439 kboe/d), following the production development.\n\nIn 2021, the average Brent price reached USD 70.9/bbl, a substantial growth of 69%.

In Romania, the following factor was used: 1 boe = 5,400 cf.\n- 2 The figures above include 100% of all fully consolidated companies.\n\n## Portfolio developments\n\nIn 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to affect the global economy and energy demand. Although the pandemic continued to pose operational challenges in all production assets, OMV made significant progress with implementing its E&P strategy. It aims to increase the share of natural gas over that of crude oil and reduce carbon intensity across the portfolio. SapuraOMV completed the sale of all mature oil assets in Peninsular Malaysia in August, and in December, OMV divested its 25% share in the Wisting oil discovery in Norway. Further portfolio optimization milestones were the divestment of all E&P assets in Kazakhstan in May and of 40 marginal fields in Romania in December. In New Zealand, OMV continues to work toward completing the sale of its 69% stake in the Maari oil field.\n\n## Central and Eastern Europe\n\nOMV Petrom continued its portfolio optimization efforts in 2021 with the sale of 40 onshore oil and gas fields in Southeastern Romania. OMV Petrom also sold all of its holdings in E&P assets in Kazakhstan.\n\nNegotiations for a production-sharing contract for Block II off the shore of the Republic of Georgia were successfully concluded. A seismic campaign is in preparation there for 2022.\n\nIn Romania, we drilled 36 new wells and sidetracks (2020: 63), and 695 workover jobs were performed. The first total shutdown of the Petromar asset was successfully and safely finalized in October. In September and October, modernization and upgrades as well as necessary maintenance work were performed at the offshore platforms and the Midia terminal.\n\nIn Austria, phase 1 of the country's largest groundmounted photovoltaic plant commenced operations in January. It generated 12.1 GWh of carbon-neutral electricity for in-house use from January to December. The second and final construction phase started in Q4/21. This phase will raise generation capacity to a total of 15.32MWp and is expected to go online in Q3/22. Once fully operational, the plant will generate around 14.25 GWh of electricity. A three-week turnaround at the Aderklaa sour gas plant was finalized in May. Thanks to a new inspection method, the turnaround interval was extended to six years.",

        "page_content": "Phase 1 of the Smart Oil Recovery (SOR) drilling workover campaign was finalized. Eight new wells started production at the end of January 2022.\n\n## Middle East and Africa\n\nIn 2021, the Middle East and Africa region delivered strong results. Operations were safe and remained undisrupted, and all key projects continued as planned, despite the impact of COVID-19 and the tense geopolitical situations in Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen.\n\nIn Libya, production remained stable for almost the entire year. In mid-January 2022, we were able to lift the force majeure that had to be declared on crude oil exports from two Libyan ports following a political dispute in December 2021.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, drilling continued at the SARB and Umm Lulu fields. This allowed the production ramp-up to continue despite OPEC quota restrictions.\n\nWhile Yemen's security situation continuously poses significant challenges, OMV was able to complete the workover campaign in Block S2 and commission two power generation units for the central processing facility in Q4/21.\n\nIn Tunisia, the production rate at the Nawara natural gas field was stabilized in 2021, owing to the building of operational capabilities and the implementation of digital technologies.\n\n## North Sea\n\nIn line with the strategy of reducing the product portfolio's carbon intensity, OMV sold its entire 25% stake in the Wisting oil discovery. The economic effective date of the transaction is January 1, 2021.\n\nThe Hywind Tampen project is on track to deliver initial power to Gullfaks in 2022. Upon completion, it will be the world's first wind farm to power offshore platforms and reduce CO2 emissions by 200,000 t per year.\n\nThe concept selection for the Iris/Hades development was confirmed in November 2021.\n\nA number of developments were completed in 2021 that will extend plateau production for the Gudrun and the Edvard Grieg fields. These include two tie-ins to the Gudrun field, a new extended well test at the Rolvsnes field, a tie-back to the Solveig field, and three new infill wells to the Edvard Grieg platform that were put into production.\n\n## Russia\n\nIn October 2021, the Yuzhno-Russkoye field reached the important milestone of full Turonian reservoir development with the commissioning of the last of a total of 88 wells. Together with the 12 wells in the first start-up complex commissioned in 2019, 100 wells are now in operation and produce the hard-to-recover natural gas of the field's Turonian reservoir.\n\nA further step to maintain the production level of the field was the successful launch of a new booster compressor station.\n\n## Asia-Pacific\n\nIn line with its strategy, SapuraOMV sold all of its interests in various mature oil-producing assets located offshore Peninsular Malaysia. The effective date of the transaction is January 1, 2021.\n\nThe Jerun natural gas project is progressing according to plan. Detailed engineering is well on track, and the first deliveries of structural steel have arrived at the fabrication yard.\n\nIn New Zealand, OMV continued the redevelopment and optimization of the M\u0101ui and Pohokura natural gas assets.\n\nThe Pohokura onshore well intervention was successfully completed. The M\u0101ui natural gas field re-development in New Zealand is on track, with the M\u0101ui A Crestal Infill completed and the M\u0101ui B IRF Phase 3 progressing well.\n\nOMV's divestment of its 69% share in the Maari oil field is expected to close in 2022.\n\n## Key projects\n\n## Neptun (Romania, OMV 50%)\n\nIn 2021, Romanian state-controlled natural gas company Romgaz made a binding offer to acquire ExxonMobil's 50% stake in the Neptun Deep license offshore Romania. OMV Petrom will become operator of the project once Romgaz completes the takeover, expected for 2022. Preparations for the ownership take over are underway. OMV Petrom maintains a keen interest in seeing the Black Sea resources developed. However, the final investment decision depends on a range of factors including a stable and competitive fiscal framework. Changes to the Romanian offshore law are expected to be effected during 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Other major projects (Romania, OMV 100%)\n\nAt the Petromar asset, a new offshore well was put into production in March and set a record for the longest section drilled offshore by OMV Petrom measuring 2,902 m.\n\nA number of installations were added to Petromar as part of a rejuvenation program, including new cranes, a new helideck, and new gas-to-power installations.\n\nThe Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) pilot project that was initiated at the Moldova asset was extended and the initial results, water cut decrease in certain production wells, were observed. Encouraged by the results of this pilot, a full field application in another field in the Muntenia Vest asset has been launched. These projects aim to increase recovery from these mature assets by injecting a viscous water mixture into the reservoir.\n\n## Nawara (Tunisia, OMV 50%)\n\nWe were able to stabilize production at the Nawara natural gas field in 2021. The building of operational capabilities and the implementation of digital technologies were the key success factors. A new gas discovery that had been made late in 2019 was connected to Nawara's Central Processing Facility (CPF).\n\n## Umm Lulu and SARB (United Arab Emirates, OMV 20%)\n\nUninterrupted operations were maintained at the Umm Lulu and Satah Al Razboot (SARB) fields. Drilling activities also continued in both fields. This allowed production to continue to ramp up despite the OPEC quota restrictions.\n\n## Ghasha concession (United Arab Emirates, OMV 5%)\n\nThe Ghasha concession is being developed as three projects in parallel, namely Hail & Ghasha, the Dalma project (containing several fields in the Dalma area), and the Deep Gas Development (also containing several fields). Dalma is expected to deliver first gas in 2025, with the field eventually producing around 54 kboe/d of natural gas. The award of the Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts in November was a major milestone for the Ghasha concession. The construction of ten artificial islands is progressing as planned.\n\n## Khor Mor (KRI, OMV 10%)\n\nThe Khor Mor field achieved steady production exceeding expectations. The capacity expansion project is progressing as per plan with early civil engineering works completed. The project is on track for first gas in 2023.\n\n## Gullfaks (Norway, OMV 19%)\n\nIn 2021, the Equinor-operated Gullfaks field delivered strong production volumes, mainly due to reduced natural gas injection. Phase 1 of the Hywind Tampen construction (consisting of 11 floating wind turbines) was finalized in Q2/21. The generation output of 5 out of the 11 turbines will be used to reduce natural gas-fired power generation at Gullfaks. The project is on track to deliver first power in 2022. Once the construction of the substructures is complete in spring 2022, the windmills will be assembled and towed to the field.\n\n## Gudrun (Norway, OMV 24%)\n\nPhase 2 of the Gudrun field redevelopment is delayed due to COVID-19-induced personnel restrictions offshore. First water injection from the new wells is scheduled to start in mid-2022.\n\n## Edvard Grieg (Norway, OMV 20%)\n\nThe Edvard Grieg field produced above expectations in 2021 due to higher export capacity availability. Three infill wells were completed during the year to support production capacity.\n\nIn Q3/21, production from the nearby Solveig field commenced. The Solveig field is developed with seabed installations tied to the Edvard Grieg platform for further processing. In addition, the extended well test from the Rolvsnes field commenced in early August. These two near-field tiebacks to Edvard Grieg will extend its plateau production phase. Edvard Grieg is the first field in the world to be awarded the CarbonClear certification, Intertek's new independent upstream carbon intensity certification for oil and gas producers.\n\n## Hades/Iris (Norway, OMV 30%)\n\nHades/Iris is the first OMV-operated development project in Norway. The concept selection was approved by all license partners in November and will allow the project to progress toward front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies. OMV is planning to make the final investment decision (FID) in late 2022 and submit the plan for development and operations (PDO) to the authorities by year-end 2022 to take part in temporary Norwegian tax incentives. Production start-up is expected in 2026.",

        "page_content": "## SK408 (Malaysia, OMV 40%)\n\nIn Malaysia, the phase 1 development of the SK408 license (the Gorek, Larak, and Bakong fields) continued to produce at a high level.\n\nPhase 2 of the license, the Jerun project, received the JV's final investment decision in March 2021. The main engineering, procurement, construction installation, and commissioning (EPCIC) contract could thus be awarded shortly after. Construction started in September, and the main construction milestones for 2021 were met.\n\n## M\u0101ui A Crestal Infill (New Zealand, OMV 100%)\n\nThe M\u0101ui A Crestal Infill (MACI) project is part of a NZD 500 mn investment in the M\u0101ui and Pohokura fields and is critical for ensuring the security of New Zealand's domestic energy supply. All six wells were completed as planned.\n\n## M\u0101ui B IRF Phase 3 (New Zealand, OMV 100%)\n\nThe project scope of the M\u0101ui B IRF Phase 3 infill drilling comprises drilling, completion, tie-in and commissioning of five sidetrack wells on the M\u0101ui B platform. The commissioned rig arrived in New Zealand and is expected to commence the drilling campaign in Q1/22.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal highlights\n\nIn 2021, OMV drilled eight exploration and appraisal wells in six different countries, six of which were completed and four were classified as discoveries.\n\nOMV Petrom drilled one exploration well in Romania resulting with an oil discovery, evaluation is ongoing.\n\nOMV finalized three exploration wells in Norway in 2021. While Eidsvoll in the southern North Sea proved dry, Solveig Seg D and Ommadawn were oil discoveries. The commercial options for these discoveries are under evaluation, and results are expected in 2022.\n\nIn New Zealand, OMV drilled the MA-14B (M\u0101ui East) exploration well and discovered natural gas.\n\nThe SapuraOMV-operated Eagle-1 drilling in Australia was completed in June 2021. The well did not discover any producible hydrocarbons.\n\nThe drilling of one well in Tunisia and one in the United Arab Emirates was still ongoing at year-end. These are expected to be finalized in 2022.\n\nA 3D seismic survey was started in Romania in Q4/21 and completed in Q1/22. As a result of the Sch\u00f6nkirchen 3D seismic survey, a drilling opportunity was identified in Austria and will be developed further in 2022.\n\nExploration and appraisal expenditure decreased to EUR 210 mn in 2021 (2020: EUR 227 mn). New exploration license applications were submitted in Norway and Malaysia, focused on infrastructure-led natural gas opportunities. License award announcements are expected in Q1/22.\n\n## Reserves development\n\nProved reserves (1P) as of December 31, 2021, decreased to 1,295 mn boe (thereof OMV Petrom: 419 mn boe), with a one-year Reserve Replacement Rate (RRR) of 77% in 2021 (2020: 102%). The three-year rolling average RRR is 105% (2020: 138%). Proved reserves were added through successful drilling and development activities in Malaysia, New Zealand, and Norway, and improvement in reservoir performance in Norway, Romania, and the United Arab Emirates. These additions were offset to some extent by divestments in Kazakhstan, Romania, and Malaysia. The improvement in global oil prices also had a positive impact on the proved reserves position as of the end of 2021. Proved and probable reserves (2P) decreased to 2,197 mn boe (thereof OMV Petrom: 680 mn boe), impacted by the divestments in Kazakhstan, Romania, and Malaysia.\n\n## Innovation and new technologies\n\nOMV's E&P strategy is to apply state-of-the art technologies developed in-house to well-maintained assets to pilot these technologies and to promote rapid global implementation. The current focus of research and development is on improving recovery rates and extending the lifetimes of mature fields. Technologies that OMV successfully implements are made available to the public at the OMV Innovation&Technology Center (ITC) in Austria.\n\nSmart Oil Recovery (SOR) is an innovative method to optimize Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in mature reservoirs like the Austrian Matzen field from 40% up to 60%. The life of the field is extended by injecting viscous salt water into the reservoir. The drilling workover campaign of SOR Project Phase 1 covering eight wells was finalized successfully and production commenced in Q1/22.",

        "page_content": "The Tech Center & Lab Teams in Austria and OMV Petrom Upstream Laboratories (ICPT) in Romania support all OMV assets globally as a center of excellence for analysis, testing, technology research, and consulting. In 2021, a new product line -geochemical modelling - was developed, and the first alkali viscous saltwater pilot was set up.\n\n## Digitalization\n\nIn 2018, the E&P Business Segment announced a vision to become a digital frontrunner in the industry and launched its digitalization initiative - DigitUP. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the importance of digitalization within the operational processes and has been a catalyst for accelerating the digital transformation around the world. As part of the DigitUP program, E&P continued digitalizing its operations. These activities ranged from AI-driven data analytics in subsurface applications to increasing value-driven decisions and reducing project development time. In addition the use of robotics and remote real-time operation supported systems to increase production and drilling efficiency, while reducing HSSE risks at the same time.\n\nIn 2021, the DigitUP program portfolio began transitioning from conceptualizing and piloting projects to deploying the technology in our fields, with some 40% of a total of 100+ projects slated for deployment. A dedicated program was established at our largest operated venture, OMV Petrom Romania, to facilitate the arrival of technology at the assets in the field. The digitalization journey is supported by change management activities and continuous cultural and diversity programs throughout the entire OMV Group.\n\nTo fully seize the potential of these initiatives, E&P set up a public cloud infrastructure to increase flexibility, security, and performance globally, and equipped our employees with a 'future-proofed' skill set to enable a completely new way of working.\n\nIn Austria, OMV implemented an AI-driven application that systematically and automatically detects production system underperformance at all levels. It helps with\n\nreaching maximum production capacity by making use of data-driven AI modelling. The resulting production gain for OMV's first asset is estimated at 0.5% per year above the current production level.\n\nA new integrated planning, economics, portfolio, and reserves management system was rolled out to 400 employees in all E&P countries. The solution improves collaboration across functions by way of integrated workflows and consistent data, and supports major E&P business processes for diverse disciplines. Full integration of the application and the seamless flow of data across business functions enables faster, higher-quality calculations.\n\nA cloud-based document record and management system was commissioned at all OMV E&P locations. Over 5 mn business critical documents were secured, allowing the business to collaborate globally across the organization. This has significantly reduced the search time for retrieving information that is required for dayto-day operations.\n\nThe strategic partnership between OMV and Schlumberger started in 2020. A new solution integrates the results from drilling projects into a single, shared database, allowing teams in all areas -operations, geology, petrophysics, or completions - to work across the same platform, with the most up-to-date data and insights at their fingertips. In 2021, well-planning teams in Romania and Austria were able to access and visualize offset-well data more easily, without having to research past reports. As a result, eight wells were mapped out in the time it would normally take to plan one.\n\nImproving the safety of personnel in areas of higher risk exposure is a key objective for the use of robots. They can complete repetitive tasks more precisely and quickly than their human counterparts. In addition, they offer operational benefits since they can perform tasks where personnel have limited opportunity to intervene, particularly in hard-to-reach areas. In 2021, an autonomous inspection robot was tested in Austria, and there are plans to deploy it at other OMV E&P assets, too.",

Stronger refining margins, improved performance by ADNOC Refining & Trading, and higher demand were offset almost entirely by a lower contribution from margin hedges and a weaker result from the gas business and oil trading. The OMV refining indicator margin Europe increased by 50% to USD 3.7/bbl (2020: USD 2.4/bbl), mainly as a consequence of a stronger macro environment. Substantially higher gasoline, naphtha, and jet cracks were only partly offset by weaker diesel cracks, which only rebounded toward the end of the year. In 2021, the utilization rate of the European refineries reached a resilient level of 88% (2020: 86%). At 16.3 mn t, fuels and other sales volumes in Europe increased by 6%, mainly on account of robust demand recovery. In the commercial business, demand for jet fuel and diesel grew thanks to the easing of travel restrictions, while margins remained fairly constant, pushing up sales volumes. The result from the retail business improved despite lower margins, following an increase of 9% in retail sales quantities, as well as due to a higher contribution from the non-fuel business.\n\nIn 2021, the contribution of ADNOC Refining & Trading came in at EUR (11) mn (2020: EUR (107) mn), mainly due to better operational performance and a higher refining margin environment. The result was further improved by ADNOC Global Trading following its successful launch at the end of 2020.\n\nThe result of the gas business declined by 25% to EUR 252 mn (2020: EUR 337 mn), mainly following the divestment of Gas Connect Austria to VERBUND at the end of May 2021. In addition, higher storage, CO2, gas, and energy expenses, as well as a negative impact from power forward contracts lowered the result. The ability to benefit from high market volatility through supply and sales contracts, higher revenues from the electricity balancing market, and the one-off revenues following the reversal of certain provisions partly compensated for this development. Natural gas sales volumes rose significantly from 164.0 TWh to 196.4 TWh, thanks to primarily higher sales quantities in Germany and the Netherlands. This was partially offset by lower sales in Romania.",

        "page_content": "Net special items amounted to EUR (509) mn (2020: EUR 22 mn) and were primarily related to an impairment in ADNOC Refining amounting to EUR (669) mn, which was due to lower assumed refining margins and production volumes. This was partially offset by the effect of commodity derivatives. CCS effects of EUR 430 mn were recorded in 2021 as a consequence of a substantially higher crude oil price level, while CCS effects in 2020 amounted to EUR (425) mn following the sharp drop in crude oil prices. The Operating Result of Refining & Marketing increased significantly to EUR 922 mn (2020: EUR 592 mn).\n\nCapital expenditure in Refining & Marketing amounted to EUR 654 mn (2020: EUR 570 mn). Organic capital expenditure in 2021 was predominantly related to investments in the European refineries and retail stations.\n\n## Business overview\n\nR&M refines and markets fuel products in Central and Eastern Europe as well as in the Middle East through OMV's 15% interest in ADNOC Refining and ADNOC Global Trading. OMV's European downstream business model is characterized by a high degree of physical integration along the value chain from crude supply to refining, retail, and commercial sales. Total fuels and other sales volumes Europe amounted to 16.34 mn t in 2021. Commercial fuel customers are mainly from industrial transportation and construction sectors and account for more than 60% of the sales volume, while the strongly branded retail network comprising 2,088 filling stations accounts for the remaining sales volumes. OMV owns gas storage facilities with a capacity of 30 TWh, holds a 65% share in the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH), and operates a gas-fired power plant in Romania. Natural gas sales volumes amounted to 196.4 TWh.\n\n## Refining including product supply and sales\n\nThe year 2021 has been a story of two halves with regards to refining margins. The first half of the year was characterized by depressed margins and low product cracks across the board as demand was still under significant pressure. The second half of 2021 is a story of recovering margins and a strong upside, with various factors contributing to the improvement in refining economics.\n\nIn terms of the different products, naphtha prices in a way defied the trend of the two different halves and were strong throughout 2021 as petrochemical demand remained resilient. Naphtha cracks rose to unprece-\n\ndented levels in the autumn months. This can be attributed to the demand for naphtha in gasoline blending and to LPG use growing significantly because of rising prices for competing petrochemical feedstock. This led to certain levels of switching away from LPG towards naphtha as feedstock for petrochemicals, which supported naphtha demand. The gasoline market started recovering in summer as demand especially in Europe and the US was approaching pre-pandemic levels and continued receiving a boost from Hurricane Ida-related supply disruptions in the United States in autumn.\n\nOn the middle distillate side, the start of the year was characterized by a supply overhang and high global inventories, which kept both diesel and jet cracks depressed. An upside was only seen toward the autumn months when diesel demand picked up from the transportation, industrial, and agricultural sector and jet demand grew as a result of a slight improvement in global travel, although it remained far from typical levels. Toward the end of the year, the jet market came under renewed pressure with the emergence of the new COVID-19 variant, Omicron. In fact, jet demand in 2021 was only around 65% of the pre-COVID-19 level, while other road transportation fuels were very close to 2019 levels (approximately 95%+). Nevertheless, refining margins at the end of 2021 remained solid as Brent prices fell.\n\nHigh gas prices in the second half of 2021 also put pressure on operating costs at some refineries. Natural gas is needed for hydrogen production, which is used in the hydrocracking and desulphurization processes.\n\nIn the markets served by OMV's Schwechat and Burghausen refineries, we saw higher demand in fuels versus 2020 and sustained very high demand in petrochemicals. Fuels demand in Romania also showed an increase versus 2020 following higher diesel demand. OMV's European refineries therefore achieved a high utilization rate of 88%.\n\nDespite the challenging environment and unstable demand during the year, commercial sales were ahead of expectations in many areas. Well-executed price management, in both futures and spot markets, enabled delivering margins above the previous year. In some product segments, volumes and margins even exceeded pre-COVID-19 levels, thanks to a strong boost from OMV rapidly capitalizing on local market opportunities. Throughout the year, a strong focus was set on understanding customer needs and increasing customer satisfaction. To closely reflect the market devel-",

In 2021, ADNOC Refining operated its major refinery in Ruwais, which is the world's fourth largest refining complex with integrated petrochemicals, and its Abu Dhabi refinery, which closed at the end of 2021 as part of ongoing efficiency and competitiveness improvement initiatives.\n\nIn comparison to 2020, ADNOC Refining's business performance in 2021 benefitted from better operational performance and a higher margin environment, particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nWith the same ownership structure as ADNOC Refining, ADNOC Global Trading (AGT) has the mission to trade the majority of ADNOC Refining's export volumes of products as well as to supply non-domestic crudes, condensates, and other liquids for processing.\n\nAGT extends the successful Refining & Marketing business model into key geographies and to strategic partners. By continuously optimizing trade flows, it allows ADNOC Refining to access attractive non-domestic feedstock sources, maximize netback for products on global markets (e.g., Asia-Pacific), and implement best practices such as risk management.\n\nIn 2021, AGT continued on a solid ramp-up trend, closing the first year of operations overall according to plan.\n\n## Refining capacities 2021\n\n| In kbbl/d                               |     |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----|\n| Schwechat (Austria)                     | 204 |\n| Burghausen (Germany)                    |  79 |\n| Petrobrazi (Romania)                    |  86 |\n| ADNOC Refining (United Arab Emirates) 1 | 138 |\n| Total                                   | 507 |\n\n- 1 Equivalent to OMV's 15% share in ADNOC Refining\n\n## Retail\n\nDespite an ongoing challenging environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail business set a new record Operating Result in 2021. The retail business again proved to be a stable outlet for refinery products and a strong cash generator. Total sales partially recovered to 6.4 mn t, equivalent to approximately 7.9 bn l, strongly supported by a growing cards business. At the\n\nend of the year, the network comprised 2,088 filling stations (2020: 2,085). OMV continues to focus on its proven multi-brand strategy. The OMV brand is positioned as a premium brand, with VIVA representing a strong shop, gastronomy, and service offering. This is rounded out by the unmanned and value-for-money concepts of the Avanti and Petrom brands. This strategy has continued to deliver solid results, and profitability per site has increased. Sales of OMV's premium MaxxMotion-brand fuels continued to be strong, thus contributing to record margins and proving the premium-quality advantage, even during the COVID-19 crisis. The non-fuel business, including VIVA convenience stores and car washes, continued to perform well (especially the former), growing about 10% compared to 2020 (excluding the Petrom branded network in Romania where a third-party store partnership with Auchan was introduced). The focus on high-quality products and services in the premium filling station network remains one of OMV's key differentiators.\n\nIn June 2021, a divestment agreement was signed with MOL Group for OMV Slovenia comprising the sale of 119 filling stations. This follows the OMV Group strategy of focusing the retail business on countries where OMV has a strong market position and refinery integration. The closing of the divestment of the OMV network in Germany is expected in 2022; OMV has agreed to sell 285 filling stations to EG Group.\n\nIn July 2021, OMV and VERBUND reached an agreement on the sale of OMV's 40% stake in Smatrics, a joint venture in electromobility, to VERBUND.\n\n## Gas supply, marketing, and trading\n\nOMV markets and trades natural gas in nine European countries and in Turkey. In 2021, natural gas sales volumes amounted to 196.4 TWh (2020: 164.0 TWh), an increase of 20%. The foundation for natural gas sales growth is a diverse supply portfolio, which consists of equity gas and a variety of international suppliers. In addition to mid- and long-term activities, short-term activities at the main international hubs (VTP, THE, TTF, PSV) complement OMV's dynamic supply portfolio.\n\nOMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH's (OMV Gas) sales activities are focused on a diverse and resilient customer portfolio in the large-scale industry and municipality segments. OMV Gas conducts sales activities in Austria, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Belgium, where 2021 sales amounted to 156.2 TWh, up 36% over 2020. Italy, Slovenia, and France are covered by opportunistic origination activities. Increased sales were achieved despite the very challenging and",

        "page_content": "competitive market environment as margins remained under pressure.\n\nIn 2021, the European gas market was characterized by unprecedented high gas prices and significant volatility. This situation is expected to continue.\n\nIn Romania, OMV Petrom's gas and power activities delivered a record Operating Result, reflecting strong power business performance and the optimization of both product and customer portfolios. Natural gas sales volumes to third parties reached 38.4 TWh in 2021, a decrease compared to 47.8 TWh in 2020. In 2020, ANRE initiated a gas release program in Romania, whereby natural gas producers are obligated to offer 40% of their production volume to the centralized markets.\n\nIn Romania, net electrical output increased to 4.8 TWh in 2021 (2020: 4.2 TWh), with the Brazi power plant contributing approximately 8% of Romania's electricity production. The plant is also an important player on the power balancing market.\n\nIn 2021, OMV Gas again improved the capacity utilization of the Gate regasification terminal. Furthermore, the LNG business provides an additional natural gas source to meet OMV's ambitious sales growth targets in Northwest Europe, while enhancing supply security for OMV's geographically diverse supply portfolio. The LNG business also supports portfolio integration of the supply, marketing, and trading businesses.\n\n## Gas logistics\n\nOMV operates gas storage facilities in Austria and Germany with a storage capacity of 30 TWh. Additionally, OMV holds a 65% stake in the Central European Gas Hub (CEGH), the leading gas trading hub in Central and Eastern Europe. On May 31, 2021 OMV closed its divestment of its entire 51% stake in Gas Connect Austria to VERBUND.\n\nIn 2021, a long cold season that lasted until April reduced the storage levels all over Europe to historically low levels. High global demand, based on recovery from the pandemic and shortage of supply, led to an inverse summer/winter spread, with summer prices exceeding winter prices. Unprecedented volatility of prices across the entire energy complex dominated the market. European storages reached their highest filling levels at the end of October (77%) and decreased to 55% at year-end.\n\nAt the Central European Gas Hub, 749 TWh of natural gas was nominated at the Virtual Trading Point (VTP)\n\nin 2021. This volume corresponds to approximately nine times Austria's annual gas consumption. The EEX CEGH Gas Market traded total volumes of 231 TWh in Austria, an increase of 35%, and 28 TWh in the Czech Republic, an increase of 117%.\n\nOMV is a financing partner of the Nord Stream 2 project. OMV's total payments under the financing agreements for Nord Stream 2 amounted to around EUR 729 mn. Nord Stream 2 AG announced mechanical completion of the offshore part of the first line on June 10, 2021, and of the second line on September 10, 2021. The first fill of technical gas was completed for the first line on October 18, 2021, and for the second line on December 29, 2021. Following the announced US sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG on February 22, 2022, OMV will recognize a value adjustment charge of EUR 987 mn (loan plus accrued interest as of December 31, 2021) due to the fact that receivables from Nord Stream 2 AG may be unrecoverable. Please refer to Note 37 'Subsequent Events' of the Financial Statements for the most recent developments of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the expected impact on OMV Group's financials.\n\n## Innovation and new technologies\n\nOMV actively explores alternative feedstock, technologies, and fuels with the aim of developing a well-diversified, competitive future portfolio. Efforts and resources focus on chemical recycling for post-consumer plastic waste. Additional attention is given to the production of conventional and advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels, and green hydrogen as future fuels for the hard-to-electrify transportation segment, and as precursors for sustainable chemicals.\n\nOMV has taken important steps in 2021 for reducing the carbon footprint of the fuels product portfolio by launching the new innovative fuels OMV EcoMotion Diesel and OMV EcoPerform Diesel for business customers. OMV EcoMotion Diesel contains up to 33% renewable components. Thanks to this high share of biocomponents and carbon offsetting of the remaining share, this 100% carbon-neutral diesel is the first of its kind in Austria.\n\nOMV has also taken steps to implement the Co-Processing technology in the Schwechat refinery. This technology enables OMV to process biogenic feedstocks (e.g., domestic rapeseed oil) together with fossilbased materials in an existing refinery hydrotreating plant during the fuel refining process. The final investment decision amounting to around EUR 200 mn for",

        "page_content": "converting a refinery plant to produce 160,000 t of biofuels per year was made in 2020. This will reduce OMV's carbon footprint by up to 360,000 t by substituting fossil diesel. Operations are scheduled to begin by 2023.\n\nOMV signed a supply contract with AustroCel Hallein to supply OMV with advanced bioethanol totaling up to 1.5 mn l per month starting in January 2021. This will reduce emissions by around 45,000 t of CO2 per year.\n\nUnlike conventional biofuels, advanced fuels do not compete with food production. The amount that can be blended into the fuel pool is not capped, as is the case with waste-based fuels. The principal sources of advanced fuels include biomass fraction from mixed municipal or industrial waste, straw, animal manure, or residues from forestry and wood processing as well as waste streams. OMV is developing its own proprietary technology to convert one of these biomasses into advanced fuel. The next step is a pilot plant at the Schwechat refinery. OMV also collaborates with technology providers, industry partners, and academic institutions to produce advanced biofuels at scale.\n\nWhile the above bio- and synthetic products will predominantly be sold as fuels initially due to a mandated market, they can also be used as chemical feedstock.\n\nOMV and its partners working on the UpHy project intend to produce green hydrogen for use in both the mobility sector and the refining process. OMV is developing an electrolysis plant at the Schwechat refinery for this purpose, to be powered with renewable electricity, to produce zero-carbon hydrogen. The green hydrogen will initially be used for fuel hydrogenation. However, the ultimate goal is to develop commercial hydrogen fuel cells for transportation applications such as commercial buses and trucks. As a pioneer in hydrogen mobility, OMV operates five hydrogen filling stations in Austria. In 2020, OMV together with Daimler Trucks AG, IVECO, Shell, and the Volvo Group launched the H2Accelerate program. These partners are committed to creating the conditions necessary for a mass-market roll-out of hydrogen trucks in Europe. Fleets are expected to operate first in regional clusters and along European high-capacity corridors. Over time, the clusters are going to be interconnected into a pan-European network.\n\nOMV opened its first LNG filling station for heavy-duty trucks in Himberg in September 2021. This is another step toward the future of alternative fuels and sustainable mobility underpinned by the freedom provided by technological solutions.\n\nDuring 2021, OMV continued installing photovoltaic panels on filling stations in multiple countries. They have now been installed on 170 filling stations with the aim of continuing this expansion in 2022. The panels reduce the carbon footprint of filling stations and improve the economic efficiency of operations.\n\n## Digitalization\n\nIn 2021, OMV continued its digitization journey. Several digital projects have been implemented, creating immediate value and accelerating our business strategy implementation.\n\nPredictive analytics is an integral part of our refineries and enables OMV to achieve its goals faster. As an example of this, the first phase of predicting the cleaning schedule of heat exchangers went live. This project will generate annual savings of EUR 1.7 mn thanks to datadriven optimization and contribute significantly to our sustainability strategy by preventing carbon emissions totaling 25,000 t per year.\n\nAdditional projects improved the performance of OMV's Refining business. These included the digitalization of the shift book to optimize the efficiency of maintenance planning and the visualization of steam cracker assets in a 3D digital twin, which will speed up turnaround activities.\n\nThe expected overall benefit of up to EUR 11 mn over the next five years clearly shows that digitalization is already generating tangible value in OMV's Refining business.\n\nIn Marketing, the team kicked off a digital customer journey, which will grow sales and service activities as well as further improve customer experience using the latest Salesforce platform. Combined with a new customer portal as a one-stop shop for all requests, invoices, and orders, we deliver a single platform covering end-to-end customer interactions.\n\nPersonalized offers and experiences for our retail customers developed using data-driven insights boosted loyalty growth significantly. In 2021, personalized offers resulted in a 18% spend increase and 75% reduction in the churn rate of OMV's loyalty program participants.\n\nThe new mobile payment concept in retail aims to virtualize the B2B card and move towards a fully digital endto-end experience to meet the emerging needs of a fast, simple, and secure fuel supply. The integration of this service into the new B2C mobile app will take customer experience to the next level.",

For comparison only, 2020 figures are presented in the new structure. Following the closing of the acquisition of the additional 39% stake on October 29, 2020, Borealis is fully consolidated in OMV's figures and the at-equity contributions stemming from Borealis JVs are reported separately.\n\n- 1 Capital expenditure including acquisitions, notably the acquisition of an additional 39% stake in Borealis in Q4/20 for USD 4.68 bn\n- 2 Pro-rata volumes of at-equity consolidated companies\n\n## Financial performance\n\nThe clean Operating Result more than quadrupled to EUR 2,224 mn (2020: EUR 519 mn), mainly attributable to substantially higher European polyolefin margins, positive inventory valuation effects, and the full consolidation of Borealis.\n\nThe contribution of OMV base chemicals increased, mainly fueled by higher ethylene and propylene indicator margins. The ethylene indicator margin Europe grew by 8% to EUR 468/t (2020: EUR 435/t), while the propylene indicator margin Europe increased by 25% to EUR 453/t (2020: EUR 364/t). Both saw strong demand throughout the year, in particular in the second half. Propylene indicator margin was able to benefit from a demand recovery in the automotive sector.\n\nThe utilization rate of the European steam crackers operated by OMV and Borealis improved significantly\n\nby 17 percentage points to 90% in 2021 (2020: 73%). 2020 was impacted by the unplanned outage of the Stenungsund steam cracker that began in Q2/20.\n\nThe contribution of Borealis excluding JVs soared by EUR 1,219 mn to EUR 1,437 mn (2020: EUR 219 mn), primarily due to the outstanding performance of the polyolefin business and increased contributions from the base chemicals and nitrogen businesses. The Borealis base chemicals business improved largely on account of positive inventory valuation effects and higher capacity utilization at the Stenungsund steam cracker. The polyolefin business saw an unprecedented rise in results, which was driven by a steep increase in margins and positive inventory valuation effects, but also benefited from higher volumes. The polyethylene indicator margin Europe increased by 67% to EUR 582/t (2020: EUR 350/t) while the polypropylene indicator margin Europe saw a stronger increase, by 78%, to EUR 735/t",

        "page_content": "(2020: EUR 413/t). Both indicator margins were supported by strong demand in the European markets coupled with a tightening supply-demand balance. In particular at the beginning of 2021, a heavy maintenance season limited regional supply while logistic constraints throughout the year inhibited additional supply from outside of Europe. Polyethylene sales volumes improved by 3%, while polypropylene sales volumes grew by 1% compared to 2020. The energy and healthcare industries in particular drove demand, while volumes in the consumer industry softened. The contribution from the nitrogen business grew compared to 2020, mainly due to positive inventory effects and a positive effect from the reclassification as an asset held for sale.\n\nThe contribution of Borealis' JVs grew substantially to EUR 534 mn in 2021 (2020: EUR 81 mn). The full consolidation of Borealis and the subsequent separate reporting of the JVs were the main factors in this increase, while much higher polyolefin prices in the Asian markets and in the United States fueled the result. Polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes generated by the JVs decreased by 4% compared to 2020, mainly on account of lower Borouge sales volumes due to logistics constraints in Asia. Baystar sales volumes remained stable in 2021 despite being impacted by the Texas freeze in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nNet special items amounted to EUR (396) mn (2020: EUR 1,049 mn) and were mainly related to the impairment of the nitrogen business of Borealis. In 2020, net special items were mainly related to a step-up in the valuation of the previously owned 36% share in Borealis. The Operating Result of Chemicals & Materials grew to EUR 1,828 mn compared to EUR 1,568 mn in 2020.\n\nCapital expenditure in Chemicals & Materials amounted to EUR 835 mn (2020: EUR 4,360 mn). Capital expenditure in 2020 was mainly related to the acquisition of an additional 39% stake in Borealis for USD 4.68 bn. In 2021, besides ordinary running business investments, organic capital expenditure predominantly related to investments for the construction of the new propane dehydrogenation plant in Belgium by Borealis.\n\n## Business overview\n\nThe Chemicals & Materials segment was established at the beginning of 2021, following the acquisition of the majority stake in Borealis at the end of 2020. OMV substantially grew its chemical business and extended the value chain into polymers with this acquisition. Through its subsidiary Borealis, OMV is now one of the world's leading providers of advanced and circular polyolefin solutions and a European market leader in base chemicals, fertilizers, and plastics recycling.\n\nThe segment comprises base chemicals production integrated with the refineries in Austria and Germany operated by OMV; the Borealis business of base chemicals, polyolefins, and fertilizers; and the joint ventures Borouge and Baystar. With a strong European footprint and activities through Borealis and its two joint ventures, Borouge (with ADNOC, based in the UAE and Singapore) and Baystar (with TotalEnergies, based in the United States), the Group is active in over 120 countries.\n\n## Base chemicals\n\nBase chemicals are building blocks for the chemical industry and are transformed into plastics, packaging, clothing, and many other consumer products.\n\nWhile the OMV-operated steam crackers in Schwechat and Burghausen mainly use naphtha as a feedstock, the steam crackers operated by Borealis in Stenungsund and Porvoo feature high feedstock flexibility and are able to use naphtha, butane, ethane, propane, or LPG mix as feedstock. In Kallo, Borealis runs a propane dehydrogenation unit based on 100% propane feedstock.\n\nOMV Group produces base chemicals such as olefins (ethylene and propylene), aromatics, butadiene, highpurity isobutene, benzene, phenol, and acetone.\n\n- \u25b8 Olefins (ethylene and propylene) are important chemical building blocks to produce, among other things, polyolefins (polyethylene and polypropylene), which are in turn used to manufacture a wide variety of consumer and industrial products.\n- \u25b8 Aromatics such as benzene are used as starting materials for consumer products, including clothing, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, computers, and sports equipment.",

        "page_content": "- \u25b8 C4s (e.g., butadiene, butenes) are used in a variety of applications, with butadiene primarily used in manufacturing synthetic rubber, making it a fundamental material for the tire and automotive industries. Butenes are used in specialty chemicals, such as oxo-alcohols for plasticizers and as polyols for coatings and synthetic lubricants.\n- \u25b8 High-purity isobutene is a feedstock for key chemical products like adhesives, lubricants, and vitamins.\n- \u25b8 Phenol and acetone are sold mainly to the polycarbonate and epoxy resin industries. Phenol is also used in phenolic resins and in caprolactam. Acetone is also an ingredient in solvents and MMA for PMMA (plexiglass).\n\nIn general, the 2021 market environment for base chemicals was characterized by a recovery from COVID-19, bad weather conditions in the US Gulf Coast region, and logistics constraints throughout the whole year.\n\nIn comparison to 2020, high feedstock prices drove prices for base chemicals upwards in 2021 and did not negatively impact indicator margins. In Q1/21, margins remained at 2020 levels, but strongly recovered for all products from Q2/21 onward. This development was attributable to overall robust base chemicals demand in all derivates and received particular support from continued strong global demand in polyolefins. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) margins remained at a satisfactory level, despite increasing propane prices, as the demand for propylene remained elevated. In the second half of 2021, ethylene and propylene indicator margins remained at high levels. Toward the end of the year, contract prices reached all-time highs due to strong demand and a tight supply amid high power and natural gas prices.\n\nButadiene indicator margins also improved again in Q2/21, reflecting a recovery in the automotive sector. However, recovery was limited due to supply chain constraints, in particular regarding the availability of semiconductor chips. It was mainly the weak Asian demand that negatively impacted butadiene margins in the last quarter of 2021.\n\nDemand for benzene was healthy throughout the year. Prices, and consequently margins, showed high volatility, mainly on account of supply/demand balances. Due to weather events in the United States and unplanned plant outages, peak margins were reached in Q2/21. Despite a weak fourth quarter, the average indicator margin for benzene in 2021 by far outpaced levels seen in 2020.\n\n## Polyolefins\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the majority stake in Borealis, OMV Group extended its value chain to polymers and became one of the world's leading providers of advanced and circular polyolefin solutions. Through Borealis, the Company is the second largest polyolefin producer in Europe and among the top ten producers globally.\n\nBorealis operates seven polyolefin plants located in Schwechat, Stenungsund, Porvoo, and Burghausen, where they are integrated with steam crackers, as well as in Beringen and Kallo, where they are integrated with the existing PDH facility, and in Antwerp. In addition, Borealis operates several compounding plants in Europe, the United States, South Korea, and Brazil.\n\nThe value-add polyolefin products manufactured by Borealis are the foundation of many valuable plastics applications that are an intrinsic part of modern life. Advanced Borealis polyolefins have a role to play in saving energy along the value chain and promoting more efficient use of natural resources. Borealis works closely with its customers and industry partners to provide innovative plastics solutions that create value in a variety of industries and segments. These solutions make end products safer, lighter, more affordable, and easier to recycle. In short: They enable more sustainable living. Borealis offers advanced polyolefins for virgin and circular economy solutions, servicing the following key industries: consumer products, energy, healthcare, infrastructure and mobility.\n\nIn 2021, margin development in the polyolefins industry was affected by high demand and limited supply. Toward the end of 2020, demand had started to improve, following government economic policies meant to stimulate the economy after COVID-19 containment measures. This trend continued in 2021, where margin development in the polyolefins industry was affected by high demand paired with limited supply. These supply/demand imbalances were caused by a combination of multiple factors. At the end of 2020, force majeure caused multiple EU producers to halt operations at a time when stock levels are normally kept low for the year-end, resulting in pressure on customers. Furthermore, the situation worsened at the beginning of 2021 due to three key factors. Firstly, a number of plants paused their operations to perform routine maintenance, which in many cases was rescheduled from 2020. Secondly, an unprecedented winter storm impacted polyolefin production capacity in the US state of Texas. Thirdly, logistics constraints restricted the ability to redirect volumes toward imbalanced markets.",

        "page_content": "The above-mentioned capacity constraints, combined with disruption in the shipping industry, exacerbated supply scarcity throughout Q2/21, until eventually imports - mainly from the Middle East - started increasing, offering some relief to the market.\n\nFrom Q3/21 onwards, new dynamics continued to impact the market. A sudden feedstock, material, and utilities cost increase, as well as the spread of new COVID-19 variants, followed by subsequent containment measures, led to high levels of market uncertainty.\n\nThe Borealis polyolefins segment was able to continue serving its customers successfully throughout this period, offering high-quality products and a highly secure supply.\n\n## Renewables and circular chemicals\n\nPlastics continue to play a vital role in the economy and in our business, making our life more efficient, convenient, and safe. Yet, when insufficient effort is made to recover and reuse plastics, most of them end up in landfills. The vision of a circular economy - where we optimize resource efficiency and reuse, recycle and repurpose endlessly - is both a business imperative and an opportunity. Demand for recycled plastics is growing due to increasing public awareness of the importance of using resources sustainably for a climate-neutral future.\n\nThe circular economy opens up new ways to reinvent the economy in the interest of preserving natural capital and minimizing waste. OMV and Borealis are pursuing various initiatives in mechanical and chemical recycling, design for recycling (DfR), and circular polyolefins, manufactured with second generation renewable feedstock. While mechanical recycling has proven to be effective and will likely remain the eco-efficient method of choice in the foreseeable future, chemical recycling will play an increasing role to complement mechanical recycling.\n\nEarly 2021, Borealis and TOMRA announced the operational start of their advanced mechanical recycling demo plant in Lahnstein, Germany. This is a state-ofthe-art plant that processes both rigid and flexible plastic waste from households. The purpose of this demo plant is to generate high-quality material fit for use in highly demanding applications. Technical success will set the groundwork for a commercial-scale advanced mechanical recycling plant.\n\nTo expand and accelerate its chemical recycling activities, Borealis took a minority stake in Renasci N.V., a provider of innovative recycling solutions and creator of the novel Smart Chain Processing (SCP) concept. The SCP concept is a proprietary method (EP patent application approved) of maximizing material recovery to achieve zero waste. As part of the agreement, Borealis will source a projected 20 kt of circular pyrolysis oil annually from Renasci's Oostende facility to produce chemicals and polyolefins based on chemically recycled feedstock. The Group also plans to purchase mechanically recycled material. Borealis will collaborate closely with Renasci to advance and scale-up the SCP technology. This includes developing facilities which operate entirely on household waste as feedstock.\n\nIn December 2021, OMV took a major step in scaling up its chemical recycling capacities by making the final investment decision to build a chemical recycling demo plant based on its proprietary ReOil\u00ae technology. The plant has a capacity of 16,000 t p.a. The feedstock will consist mainly of polyolefins and will be sourced in Austria in close cooperation with local waste management companies. Examples of such plastic waste include food packaging, plastic cups, lids from takeout coffee, and confectionery packaging. This is OMV's next step toward an industrial-scale plant with a processing capacity of up to 200,000 t/year planned for 2026.\n\n## Fertilizers, melamine, and technical nitrogen products\n\nOMV, through its subsidiary Borealis, is a leading European manufacturer and distributor of fertilizers, technical nitrogen products, and melamine: The Company is Europe's third largest nitrogen fertilizer manufacturer and the world's third largest melamine producer by production capacity utilized. Borealis produces and then distributes and supplies fertilizers and technical nitrogen products each year via its commercial organization, Borealis L.A.T. This comprises more than 60 warehouses across Europe and has an inventory capacity of over 700,000 t.\n\nIn 2020, OMV Group announced that it had started the divestment process for the nitrogen business unit, which includes fertilizers, technical nitrogen, and melamine. The Company's share (77.5%) in Rosier, which operates the production sites in the Netherlands and Belgium, is not being considered in this sales process. In February 2022, Borealis received a binding offer from EuroChem for the acquisition of its nitrogen business.",

        "page_content": "## Joint ventures\n\n## Borouge\n\nEstablished in 1998, Borouge is a true success story of the long-term partnership with ADNOC. The joint venture has successfully combined the leading-edge Borstar\u00ae technology with competitive feedstock and access to growing Asian markets.\n\nThrough Borouge, the Group's footprint reaches all the way to the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific region, the Indian subcontinent, and Africa. Production company Borouge ADP (Borealis 40%, ADNOC 60%) is based in the United Arab Emirates, while Borouge PTE, which handles sales and marketing (Borealis 50%, ADNOC 50%), is headquartered in Singapore. The company employs over 3,000 people, serving customers in 50 countries.\n\nIn 2021, Borouge recorded another successful year of production, optimizing operations with the available feedstock. Continued focus on innovation and commercial excellence, supported by an elevated market price environment, enabled Borouge to achieve higher prices compared to 2020.\n\n## Baystar (Borealis 50%, TotalEnergies 50%)\n\nBaystar is a joint venture between TotalEnergies Petrochemicals and Refining USA, Inc. (TEPRI), a wholly owned subsidiary of TotalEnergies SE and Novealis Holdings LLC (Novealis), a wholly owned subsidiary of Borealis AG.\n\nTotalEnergies contributed its award-winning Bayport facilities to the JV and will be the operator of the cracker in Port Arthur. Borealis brings its proprietary Borstar\u00ae technology to North America for the first time along with the Bayport site for unique polyethylene grades for the most demanding applications.\n\nBaystar achieved a record net profit in 2021 supported by favorable market conditions. The record result was achieved despite the negative impact from winter storm Uri, which hit Texas in February 2021, resulting in overall lower sales and production volumes compared to previous years. Baystar's readiness efforts have progressed through the year as the Baystar organization prepares to become a fully integrated 1 mn t polyethylene company with the start-up of the ethane cracker and Borstar Bay 3 plant.\n\n## Growth projects\n\nDespite the ongoing adverse effects of the pandemic, Borealis has been able to make meaningful progress on its important global growth projects in the Middle East, North America, and Europe in 2021.\n\nBorouge's fifth Borstar polypropylene plant (PP5) was started up successfully in February 2022. It increases Borouge's current production capacity to around 5 mn t/year. Despite COVID-19-related disruptions, the project was completed on time and without cost overruns.\n\nIn November 2021, Borealis and ADNOC signed a USD 6.2 bn final investment agreement to build the fourth facility at the Borouge polyolefin manufacturing complex in Ruwais (UAE). Borouge's expansion is vital for serving growing customer demand for differentiated polyolefins solutions in energy, infrastructure, and advanced packaging in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. After completion of the Borouge 4 expansion, Borouge will be the world's largest single-site polyolefin complex. Cutting-edge technologies will be employed to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions. The plan is to eliminate continuous flaring altogether. The new facility will draw on renewable energy sources to power some of its operations. An exploratory study currently underway will determine whether the installation of a carbon capture unit could lower Borouge 4 emissions by up to 80%.\n\nIn the state of Texas in the United States, the Baystar\u2122 growth project will add more than 1 mn t of annual polyolefin production capacity and, most crucially, enable Borealis to supply locally manufactured Borstar products to its North American customers for the first time. The unusually hard winter freeze that hit the region in 2021 had adverse effects on nearly all petrochemical operations on the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Baystar project was no exception. While start-up of the new ethane-based steam cracker has been delayed, on-site construction of the polyethylene unit is continuing apace.\n\nThe new world-scale PDH plant under construction in Kallo (Belgium) adjacent to the existing PDH facility, it is planned to begin operations in 2023. With an investment of around EUR 1 bn, this is among the largest projects in the petrochemical industry in Europe today, and the largest ever for Borealis on the continent. A stellar safety record has been achieved despite the enormity of the project, which includes delivery of one of the largest single pieces of equipment ever shipped in one piece to the Port of Antwerp.",

        "page_content": "In July, Borealis announced it had acquired a 10% minority stake in Renasci N.V., a Belgium-based provider of innovative recycling solutions and creator of the novel Smart Chain Processing concept. This purchase was subsequent to an earlier offtake agreement with Renasci to source around 20 kt per year of circular pyrolysis oil, a product of chemical recycling which can be used as feedstock. Taken together, the agreements help accelerate the shift to plastics circularity in an ecoefficient way.\n\n## Innovation and new technologies\n\nOMV's ReOil \u00ae proprietary thermal cracking technology was developed to meet the European Commission's targets for the circular economy and to fulfill future packaging recycling quotas. The ReOil \u00ae plant at the Schwechat refinery, which has a capacity of 100 kg/h, has been recycling post-consumer and post-industrial plastics into synthetic crude oil in a pyrolysis process since 2018. This synthetic crude is then processed mainly into monomers and other hydrocarbons in the Schwechat refinery. The pilot plant has been running for a total of 13,000 hours since its commissioning and thus enabled an improvement in the thermal cracking process and supported the further scale-up of the ReOil\u00ae technology. OMV and Borealis are pursuing the clear ambition of becoming a leading player in chemical and mechanical recycling technologies.\n\nAt Borealis, innovation is fundamental for contributing to the circularity of polyolefins and creating a more sustainable way of life. It also helps the Group improve its competitiveness and enhance its efficiency and sustainability - and therefore has a direct impact on people, the planet, and profit. The change in Borealis' ownership structure and subsequent partnership with OMV has further increased the Group's focus on the circularity of polyolefins and the availability of renewable hydrocarbons.\n\nIn the polyolefins business, our innovation activities concentrate on providing solutions to societal challenges as defined in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Examples include best-in-class materials for producing water and gas pipes, insulation for cables, and capacitor film used for transporting goods.\n\nIn the Polyolefins business unit, key achievements in 2021 included:\n\n- \u25b8 Infrastructure: The PE100 RC Pipe product family was completed with the introduction of colored and low-sagging grades, offering performance that is among the best in the market and enabling the even wider application of PE pipes in the construction industry.\n- \u25b8 Consumer products: The stiff/tough film product FX1003 was launched. The product performs at least as well as the best available materials on the market and has a superior ability to blend with postconsumer recyclates.\n- \u25b8 Circular economy solutions: Borealis launched the white, 100% post-consumer recyclate grade AH1040MO-90, which has been developed for injection molding for houseware products and large thin-wall packaging items.\n\nThe polyolefins business commercially launched 47 new products, beating its '21 in 2021' target. Achieving these launches in such a challenging year demonstrates that Borealis is a market leader in innovation and remains true to its purpose of reinventing for more sustainable living.\n\nSimilarly, in the base chemicals business, Borealis looks to find innovative approaches for using new feedstock sources, improving resource efficiency, and reducing energy consumption and flaring, which in turn reduces emissions of greenhouse gases and other substances such as dust. These activities also include CO2 avoidance and CO2 utilization opportunities, as well as chemical recycling.\n\nDuring 2021, Borealis launched six new grades produced with renewable feedstock material as part of the Bornewables\u2122 portfolio. Bornewables offer product properties equal to fossil-based products. This allows our partners to have a quick and easy transition from fossil-based polypropylene to a renewable feedstockbased polypropylene.",

        "page_content": "Borealis entered into collaborations with various organizations with complementary competencies in 2021. The aim here is to accelerate Borealis' progress towards achieving circularity in manufacturing and using polyolefins, and reducing its carbon footprint. The following are the main partnerships:\n\n- \u25b8 Borealis reached an agreement with Renasci Oostende Recycling NV to acquire the entire output of its chemical recycling plant. The first quantities of the raw material obtained through chemical recycling were successfully processed at the Porvoo cracker during a test run in September 2021. Borealis expects to establish regular supply of the recycled material, which will be used as an important source of raw materials for polyolefins production.\n- \u25b8 Together with TOMRA and Zimmerman, the Group has started a state-of-the art recycling plant to produce recyclates that perform very close to a virgin material.\n- \u25b8 Borealis has an extensive patent portfolio, comprising around 8,300 granted patents and around 3,000 pending patent applications. In 2021, Borealis filed 133 new priority patent applications, which further contribute to safeguarding Borealis' proprietary technologies and protecting its licensees. Many patents also protect products and applications.\n\n## Digitalization\n\nStepping up digitalization in Chemicals & Materials is one of the key drivers for transformation. Not only will it increase the Group's productivity and improve customer experience, it will also support achieving sustainability goals. In particular, digital solutions for the circular economy of plastics will become more important in achieving the Group's carbon neutrality journey.\n\nFor that reason, in 2017 Borealis decided to implement a Digital Program, which led to the creation of the Borealis Digital Studio in 2018. The Digital Studio is Borealis' creative and agile enabler for developing smart solutions for customers and employees. It works closely with the IT department and consists of a diverse, crossfunctional team of digital professionals, including designers, usability experts, business analysts, software developers, and engineers. Its mission is supporting the Group's businesses to adapt to a rapidly changing environment and keeping Borealis sustainably profitable by creating digital, innovative solutions that have a positive impact on the Group's people and business, and the environment. Adding value is key when creating digital solutions, and end-users are always at the heart of the process, as the solutions are built both with and for them, following the agile methodology.\n\nThe online portal for polyolefins customers (MyBorealis) supports customer service representatives and sales managers in their daily interactions with customers. It puts easy order management at the customer's fingertips, along with a complete library of order, product, and complaint documentation. The application works around the clock, providing instant access to upto-date information, with ordering fully integrated with supply chain and IT processes. A single global portal supports eight languages, allowing organizations in Europe, North America, and South America to use it. By the end of 2021, 18% of the order volume was via the portal, up from 14% at the start of the year.\n\nIn 2021, a project to explore the possibilities of using autonomous robots was kicked off. The activities suited to such robots, such as carrying out inspections, are being researched in a proof of concept to assess the feasibility of this kind of solution. Technologies such as virtual reality (for safety training and technical instructions/training), smart glasses (for remote assistance in the field), and 3D technology (for printing machinery parts) are also in the prototype-building or set-up phase.\n\nInteractive Safety Training for the Five Life Saving and Process Safety Rules is an innovative gamified interactive learning solution that helps employees and contractors learn the rules through remote training and tests. The training combines a 3D-modelled plant environment, an engaging story, and motivating gamification elements to simulate scenarios, enabling better knowledge retention and faster learning than traditional methods. Employees learn the Life Saving Rules and Process Safety Rules in a very immersive way and can apply theory to practice without stopping production or risking actual injury. Around 14,000 training modules have already been completed across the entire Borealis workforce.\n\nProjects relating to circular economy solutions (CES) are ongoing to explore collaboration opportunities with start-up companies, to create product and digital solutions for scalable and traceable closed-loop material flows, and to reuse systems (e.g., coffee cups and food trays). These systems use a digital platform built by the Borealis Digital Studio and give the necessary data insights to maximize reuse, accommodate closing the loop, and recycle plastic waste once it can no longer be reused and reaches the end of its life. The systems thereby create new and profitable business solutions.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Management\n\nLike the oil, natural gas, and chemical industry as a whole, OMV is exposed to a variety of risks including market and financial risks, operational risks, and strategic risks. The Group's risk management processes focus on identification, assessment, and evaluation of such risks and their impact on the Group's financial stability and profitability. The objective of these activities is to actively manage risks in the context of the Group's risk appetite and defined risk tolerance levels in order to achieve OMV's longterm strategic goals.\n\nIt is OMV's view that the Group's overall risk is significantly lower than the sum of the individual risks due to its integrated nature and the fact that various risks partially offset each other. The balancing effects of industry risks, however, can often lag or weaken. OMV's risk management activities therefore focus on the net risk exposure of the Group's existing and future portfolio. The interdependencies and correlations between different risks are also reflected in the Company's consolidated risk profile. Risk management and insurance activities are centrally coordinated at the corporate level by the Treasury and Risk Management department. This department ensures that well-defined and consistent risk management processes, tools, and techniques are applied across the entire organization. Risk ownership is assigned to the managers who are best suited to oversee and manage the respective risk.\n\nThe overall objective of the risk policy is to safeguard the cash flows required by the Group and to maintain a strong investment-grade credit rating in line with the Group's risk appetite.\n\nOMV is closely monitoring the development of the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and regularly evaluating the impact on the Group's cash flow and liquidity position.\n\nOMV monitors the increasing geopolitical tensions and deepening crisis between Russia and Ukraine on a continuous basis and regularly reviews the potential impact on our business activities and assets. In particular, OMV assessed and continues to assess the risks related to international sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG and the impact on repayment of the loan provided to Nord Stream 2 AG by OMV. From today's point of view no direct impact on OMV's Russian equity gas production is expected. However, OMV continues to monitor potential restrictions to related dividend flows. The credit risk portfolio associated with counterparties and banks located in Russia and / or potentially targeted by international sanctions (or restrictions on international money transfers) is under close review. International trade restrictions and sanctions could also lead to a further devaluation of the Russian Ruble against the Euro and the US Dollar. Disruptions in Russian commodity flows to Europe could result in further increases in Eu-\n\nropean energy prices and accelerate the risk of cost inflation. From today's point of view, OMV does not expect natural gas exports from Russia to stop. In the event of short-term gas supply disruptions from Russia, OMV can use the remaining gas in storage to supply customers and has access to other liquid gas market hubs in Europe. In such an event, an emergency team will be set up based on pre-defined internal processes. This emergency team will continuously analyze and evaluate the situation so that appropriate measures can be taken if necessary. It is also responsible to communicate and coordinate all activities with the Austrian regulator e-control. Please refer to Note 37 'Subsequent Events' of the Financial Statements for the most recent developments of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and the expected impact on OMV Group's financials.\n\n## Enterprise-Wide Risk Management\n\nFinancial and non-financial risks are regularly identified, assessed, and reported through the Group-wide Enterprise Wide Risk Management (EWRM) process.\n\nThe main purpose of OMV Group's EWRM process is to deliver value through risk-based management and decision-making which is ensured by applying a 'three lines of defense model' (1. business management, 2. risk management and oversight functions, 3. internal audit). The assessment of financial, operational, and strategic risks helps the Group leverage business opportunities in a systematic manner. This ensures that OMV's value grows sustainably. Since 2003, the EWRM system has helped enhance risk awareness and improve risk management skills across the entire organization, including at subsidiaries in more than 20 countries. OMV Group is constantly enhancing the EWRM process based on internal and external requirements such as, for example, newly developing ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting standards and frameworks.\n\nA cross-functional committee chaired by OMV Group CFO with senior management members of the OMV Group - the Risk Committee - ensures that the EWRM process effectively captures and manages material risks across OMV Group.",

        "page_content": "The process is facilitated by a Group-wide IT system supporting the established individual process steps: risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation, risk treatment, reporting, and risk review through continuous monitoring of changes to the risk profile. The overall risk resulting from the bottom-up risk management process is computed using Monte Carlo simulations and compared against planning data. This is further combined with a top-down approach from the senior management view to capture risks associated with the Group's strategy. The process also includes companies that are not fully consolidated. The EWRM process uses common risk terminology and language across OMV Group to facilitate effective risk communication, whereby ESG risks play a key role in the OMV risk taxonomy. Twice a year, the results from this process are consolidated and presented to the Executive Board and the Audit Committee. In compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance, the effectiveness of the EWRM system is evaluated by the external auditor on an annual basis. The key financial and non-financial risks identified with respect to OMV's medium-term plan are:\n\n- \u25b8 Financial risks including market price risks and foreign exchange risks\n- \u25b8 Operational risks, including all risks related to physical assets, production risks, project risks, personnel risks, IT risks, HSSE, and regulatory/compliance risks\n- \u25b8 Strategic risks arising, for example, from climate change, changes in technology, risks to reputation, or political uncertainties, including sanctions\n\n## Financial Risk Management\n\nMarket price and financial risks arise from volatility in the prices of commodities including the market price risks from European Emission Allowances, foreign exchange (FX) rates, and interest rates. Also of importance are credit risks, which arise from the inability of a counterparty to meet a payment or delivery commitment. As an oil, gas, and chemical company, OMV has a significant exposure to oil, natural gas, and chemical prices. Substantial FX exposures include the USD, RON, NOK, NZD, SEK, and RUB. The Group has a net USD long position, mainly resulting from oil production sales. The comparatively less significant short positions in RON, NOK, NZD, SEK, and RUB originate from expenses in local currencies in the respective countries.\n\n## Management of commodity price risk, FX risk, European Emission Allowances\n\nThe analysis and management of financial risks arising from foreign currencies, interest rates, commodity prices, European Emission Allowances, counterparties, liquidity, and insurable risks are consolidated at the corporate level. Market price risk is monitored and analyzed centrally in respect of its potential cash flow impact using a specific risk analysis model that considers portfolio effects. The impact of financial risks (e.g., commodity prices, currencies) on OMV Group's cash flow and liquidity are reviewed quarterly by the Risk Committee, which is chaired by the CFO and comprises the senior management of the business segments and corporate functions.\n\nIn the context of commodity price risk and FX risk, the OMV Executive Board decides on hedging strategies to mitigate such risks whenever deemed necessary. OMV uses financial instruments for hedging purposes to protect the Group's cash flow from the potential negative impact of falling oil and natural gas prices in the E&P segment.\n\nIn the downstream business (including Refining & Marketing as well as Chemicals & Materials segments), OMV is especially exposed to volatile refining and chemical margins and natural gas prices, as well as inventory risks. Corresponding optimization and hedging activities are undertaken in order to mitigate those risks. Those include margin hedges as well as stock hedges. An optimization, trading, and hedging risk control governance system defines clear mandates including risk thresholds for such activities. In addition, Emission Compliance Management ensures a balanced position of emission allowances by selling the surplus or covering the gap.\n\n## Management of interest rate risk\n\nTo balance the Group's interest rate portfolio, loans can be converted from fixed to floating rates and vice versa according to predefined rules. OMV regularly analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on interest income and expense from floating rate deposits and borrowings. Currently the effects of changes in interest rates are not considered to be a material risk.\n\n## Management of credit risk\n\nSignificant counterparty credit risks are assessed, monitored, and controlled at the Group and segment level using predetermined credit limits for all counterparties, banks, and security providers. The procedures are governed by guidelines at OMV Group level. Based on the high economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19",

Such risks include the potential impact of natural disasters as well as process safety and personal security events. Other operational risks comprise risks related to the delivery of capital projects or legal/regulatory non-compliance. All operational risks are identified, analyzed, monitored, and mitigated following the Group's defined risk management process.\n\nControl and mitigation of assessed risks take place at all organizational levels using clearly defined risk policies and responsibilities. The key Group risks are governed centrally to ensure the Group's ability to meet planning objectives through corporate directives, including those relating to health, safety, security, environment, legal matters, compliance, human resources, and sustainability.\n\n## Pandemic risk\n\nThe global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a major impact on global economic development. Increases in COVID-19 cases around the world following the emergence of new virus variants combined with disruptions in supply chains and high price inflation could lead to delays in expected demand recovery. The consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and other disruptions currently being observed, as well as the extent and duration of the economic impact, cannot be reliably estimated at this time. OMV is responding to the situation with targeted measures to safeguard the Company's economic stability and the secure supply of energy. The health and wellbeing of every employee is the top priority.\n\n## ESG risk\n\nOMV puts a special emphasis on five Sustainability Strategy areas: HSSE, Carbon Efficiency, Innovation, Employees, Business Principles, and Social Responsibility. OMV Executive Board members regularly (at least quarterly) discuss current and upcoming environmental, climate, and energy-related policies and regulations; related developments in the fuels and natural gas markets; the financial implications of carbon emissions trading obligations; the status of innovation project implementation; and progress on achieving sustainabilityrelated targets. OMV focuses on assessing the potential vulnerabilities of the Company to climate change (e.g., water deficiency, droughts, floods, landslides), the impact of the Company on the environment, and\n\nthe mitigation actions that will ensure a successful transition to a low-carbon environment (e.g., carbon emission reductions, compliance with new regulatory requirements).\n\n## IT risks\n\nAs OMV's activities rely on information technology systems, the Group may experience disruption due to major cyber events. Security controls are therefore implemented across the Group to protect information and IT assets that store and process information. IT-related risks are assessed, monitored regularly, and managed actively with dedicated information and security programs across the organization. OT (Operational Technology) related risks are reflected in the assessment of process safety risks.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\nIn order to identify strategic risks which might have potential long-term effects on the Company's objectives, OMV continuously monitors its internal and external environment.\n\n## Personnel risks\n\nThrough systematic employee succession and development planning, Corporate Human Resources targets suitable managerial employees to meet future growth requirements in order to mitigate personnel risks.\n\n## Political and regulatory risks\n\nIn certain countries in its portfolio, OMV's operations are exposed to geopolitical risks, including expropriation and nationalization of property; restrictions on foreign ownership; civil strife and acts of war or terrorism; and political uncertainties in particular related to Libya, Yemen, Russia, and Tunisia, as well as other countries where OMV operates and has financial investments. However, OMV has extensive experience in dealing with the political environment in emerging economies. Also, possible regulatory changes may lead to disruptions or limitations in production or an increased tax burden. OMV continuously observes political and regulatory developments in all markets that affect OMV's operations. Country-specific risks are assessed before entering new countries.",

OMV will ensure to stay in full compliance with all applicable sanction laws. In particular, risks due to political and regulatory developments both inside and outside Europe with potential unfavorable effects on the Nord Stream 2 project and on OMV's activities in Russia and the Black Sea region are regularly assessed and monitored.\n\n## Climate change-related risks\n\nOMV consistently evaluates the Group's exposure to risks related to climate change in addition to the market price risk from European Emission Allowances. Such risks comprise the potential impact of acute or chronic events like more frequent extreme weather events, or systemic changes to our business model due to a changing legal framework, or substitution of OMV's products due to changing consumer behavior. OMV recognizes climate change as a key global challenge. We thus integrate the related risks and opportunities into the development of the Company's business strategy.

in particular supervising the Executive Board and advising it on strategy - by discussing the Company's situation and objectives during board meetings. Decisions are also taken at these meetings, except in urgent cases where resolutions can be taken by circular vote. Five committees ensure that the best possible use is made of the Supervisory Board members' expertise. Brief descrip\n\ntions of these committees are given below (see also the Report of the Supervisory Board for an overview of the individual committees' main activities in 2021). In 2021, 9 meetings of the Supervisory Board and 21 committee meetings were held. In particular, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board discussed OMV's strategy 1 . No member of the Supervisory Board attended fewer than half of the meetings of the Supervisory Board. Mr. Al Mazrouei attended fewer than half of the meetings of the committees he has been elected to.",

The Supervisory Board may transfer other duties and powers of approval to the Presidential and Nomination Committee on an ad hoc or permanent basis. In its capacity as the Nomination Committee, this body makes proposals to the Supervisory Board for the appointment or replacement of Executive Board members and deals with succession planning. It also makes recommendations to the General Meeting for appointments to the Supervisory Board. There were six meetings of the Presidential and Nomination Committee in 2021, in which discussions focused on Executive and Supervisory Board matters.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThis committee performs the duties established by section 92 (4a) Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The committee held six meetings during the year. It predominantly dealt with preparations for the audit of the annual financial statements, a review of the auditors' activities, internal audit, the internal control and risk management systems, as well as the presentation of the annual financial statements. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell is the financial expert on the Audit Committee within the meaning of section 92 (4a) (1) Austrian Stock Corporation Act.\n\n## Auditors\n\nThe Supervisory Board monitors the auditors' independence and reviews a breakdown of the audit fees and fees for additional services besides auditing activities. In 2021, the auditors Ernst & Young Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft m.b.H. (including their network within the meaning of section 271b Austrian Commercial Code) received EUR 3.55 mn for the annual audit, EUR 0.53 mn for other assurance services, EUR 0.56 mn for tax advisory services, and EUR 0.07 mn for other engagements.\n\n## Portfolio and Project Committee\n\nThis committee supports the Executive Board in preparing complex decisions on key issues where necessary and reports on these decisions and any recommendations to the Supervisory Board. In 2021, three meetings of the Portfolio and Project Committee were held.\n\n## Sustainability and Transformation Committee\n\nThe purpose of the Sustainability and Transformation Committee is to support the Supervisory Board in reviewing and monitoring OMV's strategy with regard to sustainability, and ESG-related standards and performance. It also focuses on processes and performance specifically in HSSE (Health, Safety, Security, and Environment) and in particular regarding climate change. Furthermore, the committee serves to support and oversee the transformation process toward a more sustainable business model, including the cultural integration of strategically significant acquisitions. This committee was established by resolution of the Supervisory Board on October 28, 2021, and met for the first time on March 9, 2022.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThis committee deals with all aspects of the remuneration of Executive Board members and with their employment contracts. The committee's membership does not include employee representatives. The committee",

The Remuneration Committee met six times during 2021. Executive Board members were invited to attend parts of some of the meetings of the Remuneration Committee.\n\nhkp/// group was hired by the Remuneration Committee to provide remuneration advice to the committee on the appropriate structure and level of Executive Board compensation in line with regulatory requirements and market practice.\n\nIn 2021, hkp/// group was also commissioned by OMV and OMV Petrom to provide advice to OMV on governance processes between OMV and OMV Petrom, and to OMV Petrom on the development and drafting of the Remuneration Policy for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of OMV Petrom. hkp/// group provided advice on the development of OMV's Remuneration Report. This consulting company did not advise the OMV Executive Board in matters relating to Executive Board remuneration, ensuring independence with respect to the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance.\n\n## Conflicts of interest and dealings by members of the Supervisory Board requiring approval\n\nThere were no transactions requiring approval in accordance with section 95 (5) (12) Austrian Stock Corporation Act. Attention is drawn to the fact that the Supervisory Board members Mark Garrett, Stefan Doboczky, and Elisabeth Stadler are or were in the reporting year chairpersons of the executive boards of companies with which supply contracts and insurance and related contracts, respectively, were concluded under normal market and industry terms and conditions (including consideration). Although these contracts do not raise concerns in relation to a potential conflict of interest, related Supervisory Board approvals have been obtained. The Internal Rules of the Supervisory Board contain detailed procedures for handling conflicts of interest on the part of Supervisory Board members.\n\n## Employee participation 1\n\nThe Group's Works Council holds regular meetings with the Executive Board in order to exchange information on developments affecting employees. Furthermore, the Group's Works Council has made use of its right to delegate members to the Supervisory Board\n\n(one employee representative for every two members elected by the General Meeting). Therefore, out of the 15 Supervisory Board members, 5 members are employee representatives.\n\n## Rights of minority shareholders\n\n- \u25b8 General Meeting: An Extraordinary General Meeting must be convened at the request of shareholders holding not less than 5% of the shares.\n- \u25b8 Agenda items must be included at the request of shareholders holding not less than 5% of the shares.\n- \u25b8 Shareholders holding not less than 1% of the shares may submit resolution proposals on all agenda items. Such resolution proposals must be posted on the website upon request of the respective shareholders.\n- \u25b8 Shareholders holding not less than 10% of the shares may require an extraordinary audit in the event of grounds for suspicion of irregularities, or gross violations of the law or the Articles of Association.\n- \u25b8 All shareholders, having duly provided evidence of their shareholding, are entitled to attend General Meetings, ask questions, and vote.\n- \u25b8 Election of the Supervisory Board: If elections for two or more positions to the Supervisory Board are held at the same General Meeting, separate votes must be held for each position. If elections for three or more seats on the Supervisory Board are held at the same General Meeting, and if prior to the vote on the last position to be assigned it is found that at least one-third of all the votes have been cast in favor of the same person but he or she has not been elected, then this person must be declared as Supervisory Board member.\n\n## Women's Advancement and Diversity Concept\n\nDiversity is an enormous strength that OMV actively builds on now, and in the future. Consequently, OMV strives to continuously develop new initiatives and measures that promote diversity and equal opportunities. OMV is committed to its Group diversity strategy focusing on gender and internationality. As a company active in an industry with a strong technical focus, it is particularly challenging for OMV to achieve a satisfactory gender balance in all fields of business activity. OMV is committed to supporting women's advancement to managerial positions. The strategic objective is",

The aim is to increase the proportion of women in management roles, from 20.9% 1 currently to 25% by 2025, through a number of initiatives such as mentoring, succession planning, specific trainings, as well as initiatives to promote a healthy work/life balance.\n\nThe proportion of women in the Group as a whole is 27% (2020: 25%), 20.9% 1 of whom are in management and executive positions. In OMV's leadership development programs, the proportion of women was 49% in 2021 (2020: 42%). In OMV's Upstream integrated graduate development program for technical skill pools, the proportion of women was 31% in 2021 (2020: 31%). The topic of diversity has been incorporated into all Leadership Development programs and embedded into the OMV People Strategy.\n\nWe designed and implemented targeted training programs, such as SHEnergy, a blended-learning program for women at OMV, to support women's leadership skills. The program focuses on active inclusion skills and also emphasizes the power of mentoring and networking in developing female leaders.\n\nWe also held Career Aspiration Talks to make women at OMV more visible and in doing so to also strengthen our pipeline of future female leaders.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the 'New Parent Program' in Austria focused on equipping future new parents with information on parental leave and part-time models, the related long-term financial aspects, and things to consider when returning to work. The program's target group includes male as well as female employees to encourage more equal distribution of childcare responsibilities.\n\nIn March 2021, we hosted a Diversity & Inclusion Week built around International Women's Day to create awareness and support the topic.\n\nOMV promotes talents from different backgrounds, thus ensuring the best mix in diverse teams. OMV especially supports the recruitment and development of women in technical positions.\n\nBy using gender-neutral language in OMV's job advertisements and publishing all job advertisements internally, together with the constant monitoring of equality\n\nwith regard to gender, age, employee background, seniority as well as salaries, OMV is ensuring fair treatment and contributing to equal opportunities among men and women at all career stages.\n\nFemale employees initiated a Diversity Network to raise awareness of diversity topics and to boost the careers of women in technical fields through a collaboration site and joint activities.\n\nOMV's Head Office in Vienna has two company kindergartens attended by children of OMV employees.\n\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board consider the described measures and programs to foster the diversity of the workforce as a key factor in strengthening the diversity of the internal pool of Executive Board succession candidates. The Presidential and Nomination Committee concerns itself at least once a year with the identification and development of high-potential employees. In addition to internal succession planning, the Supervisory Board also makes use of external recruitments in order to best fill open Executive Board positions. When selecting Executive Board members - be it internally or externally - special attention is given to balance gender, age, and international experience in addition to professional skills.\n\nSince Elena Skvortsova joined on June 15, 2020, there is one woman on the Executive Board of OMV. The Executive Board members of OMV Aktiengesellschaft are between 51 and 59 years old, are from three different nationalities, and have acquired extensive international management experience.\n\nSince 2019, \u00d6BAG has had a legal mandate to propose candidates for the Supervisory Boards of its shareholdings. The \u00d6BAG management proposal is subject to approval by the \u00d6BAG presidium, after submission of the proposal by the Supervisory Board of OMV Aktiengesellschaft and before the election by the Annual General Meeting of OMV AG takes place. The selection of candidates is based on various criteria, particularly the candidates' professional skills, personal integrity, independence, and impartiality. In addition, diversity aspects such as the representation of both genders, a balanced age distribution, and internationality of members is taken into consideration.",

With members aged between 41 and 69 years, the Supervisory Board's age structure is balanced.\n\n## External evaluation of Corporate Governance\n\nAn external evaluation of OMV's compliance with the provisions of the ACCG is performed biennially. For the 2020 financial year, OMV had engaged Deloitte Legal (Jank Weiler Operenyi Rechtsanw\u00e4lte GmbH, attorney Johannes Lutterotti). The official questionnaire of the Austrian Working Group for Corporate Governance was used for the evaluation, and the result was that OMV is in full compliance with the Austrian Code of Corporate Governance including all non-compulsory recommen- dations.

Those standards require that we comply with International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those regulations and standards are further described in the \"Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\" section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Austrian General Accepted Accounting Principles and professional requirements and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained until the date of this auditor's report is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion by this date.\n\n- 1 This report is a translation of the original report in German, which is solely valid. Publication or sharing with third parties of the consolidated financial statements together with our auditor's opinion is only allowed if the consolidated financial statements and the directors' report for the Group are identical with the German audited version. This audit opinion is only applicable to the German and complete consolidated financial statements with the directors' report for the Group. Section 281 paragraph 2 UGB (Austrian Company Code) applies to alternated versions.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the fiscal year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nWe considered the following matters as key audit matters for our audit:\n\n- 1. The impact of climate change and the energy transition on the financial statements\n- 2. Recoverability of equity-accounted investments\n- 3. Recoverability of intangible exploration and evaluation (E&E) assets\n- 4. Estimation of oil and gas reserves\n- 5. Valuation of provision for decommissioning and restoration obligations",

The base case scenario is aligned with IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) taken from the World Economic Outlook and adjusted such that the EU, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea (with a two-year delay for political alignment and measuring effectiveness) are following the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and meeting the Paris Agreement targets.\n\nIn addition, OMV performed a stress test analysis, using a decarbonization scenario which is built on the IEA SDS Scenario, where the entire world reaches the Paris Agreement commitment to be net-zero by 2070, in order to assess the impact of this scenario on the recoverability of assets and valuation of liabilities.\n\nOMV Group's disclosures about the impact of climate change and energy transition on the financial statements, including sensitivities due to the stress test analysis, are included in Note 2 (Accounting policies, judgements and estimates).\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nWe evaluated management's key assumptions related to climate change and energy transition risks and how it impacted the critical accounting estimates and judgements on different areas of the financial statements.\n\nSpecifically, our work included, but was not limited to, the following procedures:\n\n- \u25b8 Assess the design and implementation of controls in the estimation processes, with a focus on how the impact of climate change and energy transition was considered for the key assumptions;\n- \u25b8 Analyse with those responsible for group strategy and group reporting OMV's view on the impact of climate change and energy transition on key assumptions used in the base case scenario and stress test analysis;\n- \u25b8 Reading of information in the director's report (strategy and sustainability) and consider its consistency with the assumptions used by management when preparing its energy transition base case scenario and stress test analysis;\n- \u25b8 Assessing OMV's mapping of the impact of climate change and energy transition risks into accounting estimates and judgements included in the financial statements;\n- \u25b8 Evaluate OMV's assessment of key assumptions (oil and gas price, CO2 price, refining and petrochemical margins and cracks, power prices and spreads, volume develop-ment) used in the base case comparing it to external market data and other resources where available; and\n- \u25b8 Assess the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements regarding the impact of climate change and energy transition, including the sensitivities due to the stress test analysis in Note 2 (Accounting policies, judgements and estimates).",

We received the \"Consolidated Corporate Governance Report\" and the \"Consolidated Report on the Payments Made to Government\" until the date of this audit opinion, the rest of the annual report and the annual financial report is estimated to be provided to us after the date of the auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and of the Audit Committee for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and the additional requirements under Section 245a Austrian Company Code (UGB) for them to present a true and fair view of the assets, the financial position and the financial performance of the Group and for such internal controls as management determines are necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the EU regulation and in accordance with Austrian Standards on Auditing, which require the application of ISA, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit.\n\nWe also:\n\n- \u25b8 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25b8 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;\n- \u25b8 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management;\n- \u25b8 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the\n\nGroup's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n\n- \u25b8 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u25b8 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

Accordingly, there may be rounding differences.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of OMV Aktiengesellschaft and the entities it controls (its subsidiaries) as at December 31, 2021. The financial statements of all consolidated companies are prepared in accordance with uniform groupwide accounting policies. A list of subsidiaries, equityaccounted investments and other investments is included under Note 38 - Direct and indirect investments of OMV Aktiengesellschaft - including consolidation method, business segment, place of business and interest held by OMV.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for 2021 were approved and released for publication by the Supervisory Board on March 9, 2022.\n\n## 2 Accounting policies, judgements and estimates\n\n## 1) Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year, except for the changes as described below.\n\nThe Group has adopted the following amendments to standards from January 1, 2021:\n\n- \u25b8 Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions\n- \u25b8 Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n- \u25b8 Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021\n\nThe amendments did not have any material impact on OMV's group financial statements.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n\nThe Group adopted the phase 2 amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 in which the IASB addressed the issues that arise during the reform of an interest rate benchmark rate, including the replacement of one benchmark rate with an alternative one.\n\nThese amendments are relevant for the following types of hedging relationships and financial instruments of the Group, all of which extend beyond 2021:\n\n- \u25b8 Interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments and indexed to USD LIBOR\n- \u25b8 Other financial instruments like loan receivables, loans and borrowings, derivative financial instruments for which hedge accounting is not applied, and commitments, indexed to LIBOR (mainly USD LIBOR, JPY LIBOR)\n\nThe application of the amendments affects the Group as follows:\n\n- \u25b8 Changes to contractual cash flows: The basis for determining the contractual cash flows of financial assets or financial liabilities to which the amortised cost measurement applies can change as a result of IBOR reform, for example, if the contract is amended to replace the benchmark rate with an alternative one. The Phase 2 amendments provide a practical expedient to account for these changes in the basis for determining contractual cash flows as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. Under the practical expedient, entities will account for",

For the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group applied the practical expedient to the JPY loan.\n\n- \u25b8 Hedge accounting: When the phase 1 amendments cease to apply, the Group will amend its hedge designation to reflect changes which are required by IBOR reform and will update its hedge documentation by the end of the reporting period in which the changes are made. It is not required to discontinue its hedge relationships. The Group has not made any amendments to its hedge documentation in the reporting period relating to IBOR reform.\n- When the Group amends its hedge designation, the accumulated amount outstanding in the cash flow hedge reserve is deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate.\n- \u25b8 Additional disclosures related to interest rate benchmark reform are required.

These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are deemed reasonable at the date of preparation of these financial statements. Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions having the most significant impact on OMV Group results are highlighted below and should be read together with the relevant notes mentioned. Significant estimates and assumptions have been made particularly with respect to\n\n- -oil and gas reserves (see 2.3h),\n- -provisions for decommissioning and restoration obligations (see 2.3s and 23),\n- -provisions for onerous contracts (see 2.3s and 23),\n\n- -the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and equity-accounted investments (see 2.3j and 7) as well as\n- -the recoverability of other financial assets, which mainly refer to the contractual position towards Gazprom with regard to the reserves redetermination of Yuzhno Russkoye field and the expenditure recoverable from the Romanian State related to decommissioning, restoration and environmental obligations (see 2.3m and 18).\n\n## Effect of climate-related matters and energy transition\n\nOMV has considered the short- and long-term effects of climate change and energy transition in preparing the consolidated financial statements. The significant accounting estimates performed by management incorporate the future effects of OMV's own strategic decisions and commitments on having its portfolio adhered to the energy transition targets, short and long-term impacts of climate-related matters and energy transition to lower carbon energy",

        "page_content": "sources together with management's best estimate on global supply and demand, including forecasted commodities prices.\n\nOMV is aware of its responsibility and will live up to its commitment to the Paris Agreement and the EU climate targets. OMV is committed to becoming a net-zero emissions company by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2, and 3) and has set interim targets for 2030 and 2040, with well-defined actions aiming to meet the targets by 2030. Notably, by 2030, OMV aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30% and its Scope 3 emissions by 20%.\n\nNevertheless, there is significant uncertainty around the changes in the mix of energy sources over the next 30 years and the extent to which such changes will meet the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. While companies can commit to such ambitions, financial reporting under IFRS requires the use of assumptions that represent management's current best estimate of the range of expected future economic conditions, which may differ from such ambitions.\n\nOMV operates on a global market with global products and expects to see energy transition at different pace in different parts of the world. Hence, OMV's mid term plan (MTP) assumptions, which are used for estimates in different areas of the group financial statements, including impairment of assets, useful lives and decommissioning provisions, are based on a scenario which is based on the IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS) taken from the World Economic Outlook and adjusted such that the EU, the United States, China, Japan, and South Korea (with a twoyear delay for political alignment and measuring effectiveness) are following the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) and meeting the Paris Agreement targets.\n\nTo recognize the uncertainty in the pace of the energy transition, OMV performed a stress test analysis, using a decarbonization scenario which is built on the IEA SDS Scenario, where the entire world reaches the Paris Agreement commitment to be netzero by 2070. The goal of this analysis is to assess the impact of this scenario on the recoverability of assets and valuation of liabilities.\n\nThe entire world following the Paris agreement targets has an impact on the global demand which impacts the oil and gas price assumptions, CO2 price assumptions, refining and petrochemical margins and cracks, power prices and spreads as well as\n\nvolume development expectations which have been used in the stress test analysis.\n\n## Recoverability of assets\n\nCommodity price assumptions may have a significant impact on the recoverable amounts of E&A assets, PPE and goodwill.\n\nOil and gas price assumptions have already been revised in 2020 to reflect the potential impact of energy transition and led to a pre-tax impairment of E&P oil and gas assets of EUR 1.2 bn. In 2021, the oil and gas price assumptions in the MTP scenario did not materially change in comparison to 2020. Consequently, no impairment losses or reversals of impairments due to changes in price assumptions were recorded.\n\nManagement continues to monitor the relevant commodity price assumptions in the future. This might lead to additional impairment losses or reversals of impairments.\n\nIn the stress test, OMV assumes for the E&P segment a USD 15-20 lower long term oil price than in the MTP scenario and the long term gas price to be lower by EUR/MWh 5. According to this stress case, the carrying amounts of the oil and gas assets with proved reserves would have to be decreased by EUR 4.2 bn.  In addition, goodwill would decrease by EUR 0.3 bn and some oil and gas assets with unproved reserves would be abandoned (pre-tax P&L impact of EUR 0.3 bn). The remaining carrying amount of PPE of oil and gas fields with a share of oil production higher than 55% would be EUR 2.2 bn in this stress case scenario.\n\nIn the R&M segment, the stress case reflects globally declining volume developments for almost all products resulting in negative growth rates and further decline in margins and cracks compared to the MTP scenario. This would lead to a further decrease in the carrying amounts in total of EUR 1.0 bn related to the Romanian refinery and the investment in ADNOC refining. The refineries Schwechat and Burghausen are resilient to such a scenario due to the strong focus of these refineries on petrochemical production.\n\nOMV doesn't see the C&M segment materially impacted by the energy transition, hence there haven't been stress test assumptions different from the MTP scenario.",

        "page_content": "The stress case was calculated using a simplified method. The calculation is based on a DCF model similar to a value in use calculation where no future investments for enhancements, improvements and restructuring have been considered. In the E&P segment, the cash flows are based on an adjusted midterm planning for five years and a life of field planning for the remaining years until abandonment. In the R&M segment, the cash flows of the 5-year midterm planning and a terminal value are included. The (negative) growth rates used for calculating the terminal value are estimated in line with the expected changes in the demand of the various products over the next 20 years. The stress case does not include any other changes to input factors than prices and volumes. It does not consider consequential changes that management could implement such as cost reductions, reserve reviews, divestments, and changes in business plans. The amounts presented above should therefore not be seen as a best estimate of an expected impairment impact following such a scenario.\n\n## Useful lives\n\nThe tangible assets in R&M will in average be fully depreciated over the next 7 years. Demand for petroleum products is expected to stay robust over this period of time. It is therefore not expected that energy transition has a material impact on the expected useful lives of property, plant, and equipment in the R&M segment. In the E&P segment, the remaining average life of field based on 2P reserves is 12 years and depreciation is calculated based on the 'unit-of-production' method, therefore OMV does not expect that energy transition has a material impact on the useful lives of property, plant and equipment in the E&P segment. As OMV doesn't see the C&M segment materially impacted by the energy transition, there is also no material impact on useful lives in this segment expected.\n\n## Decommissioning provisions\n\nThe economic cut-off date of E&P oil and gas assets does not shift significantly under the stress case scenario. The impact on the carrying amount of the decommissioning provisions is therefore expected to be immaterial.\n\nFor refineries, no decommissioning provisions are recognized. The refinery sites of OMV are expected to continue to be used for production even under a Paris-aligned energy transition scenario. Whereas the refineries in Europe have a strong focus on the production of chemicals and further measures for transformation of these refineries will\n\nbe taken, also ADNOC Refining is expected to continue to operate under such a scenario.\n\n## a) Business combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries acquired are included at their fair value at the time of acquisition. For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\nAny contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration classified as financial asset or liability is subsequently measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for non-controlling interest and the fair value of the equity previously held by OMV in the acquired entity over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is recorded as an asset and tested for impairment at least yearly. Impairments are recorded immediately through profit or loss, subsequent writeups are not possible. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognized in profit or loss immediately.\n\n## b) Sales revenue\n\nRevenue is generally recognized when control over a product or a service is transferred to a customer. It is measured based on the consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties.\n\nWhen goods such as crude oil, LNG, oil and petrochemical products and similar goods are sold, the delivery of each quantity unit normally represents a single performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the customer, which is the point in time when legal ownership as well as the risk of loss has passed to the customer and is determined on the basis of the Incoterm agreed in the contract with the customer. These sales are done with normal credit terms according to the industry standard.\n\nRevenue from the production of crude oil, in which OMV has an interest with other producers, is recognized according to the sales method. This means that revenue is recognized based on the actual sales to third parties, regardless of the Group's percentage interest or entitlement. An adjustment of production costs",

        "page_content": "is recognized at average cost for the difference between the costs associated with the output sold and the costs incurred based on entitlement to output, with a counter entry in the other assets or liabilities.\n\nIn the R&M retail business, revenues from the sale of fuels are recognized when products are supplied to the customers. Depending on whether OMV is principal or agent in the sale of shop merchandise, revenue and costs related to such sales are presented gross or net in the income statement. OMV is principal if it controls the goods before they are transferred to the customer, which is mainly indicated by OMV having the inventory risk. At filling stations, payments are due immediately at the time of purchase.\n\nOMV's gas and power supply contracts include a single performance obligation which is satisfied over the agreed delivery period. Revenue is recognized according to the consumption by the customer and in line with the amount to which OMV has a right to invoice. Only in exceptional cases long-term gas supply contracts contain stepped prices in different periods where the rates do not reflect the value of the goods at the time of delivery. In these cases revenue is recognized based on the average contractual price.\n\nIn some customer contracts for the delivery of natural gas, the fees charged to the customer comprise a fixed charge as well as a variable fee depending on the volumes delivered. These contracts contain only one performance obligation which is to stand-ready for the delivery of gas over a certain period. The revenue from the fixed charges and the variable fees is recognized in line with the amount chargeable to the customer. Gas and power deliveries are billed and paid on a monthly basis.\n\nGas storage and gas transportation contracts contain a stand-ready obligation for providing storage or transportation services over an agreed period of time. Revenue is recognized according to the amount to which OMV has a right to invoice. These services are billed and paid on a monthly basis.\n\nThere are some customer contracts in OMV for the delivery of oil and gas as well as for the provision of gas storage and transportation services which have a term of more than one year. In principle, IFRS 15 requires the disclosure of the total amount of transaction prices allocated to unperformed performance obligations for such contracts. Contracts for the delivery of oil contain variable prices based on market prices as at delivery date, as it is common in the oil industry. For these contracts it is, therefore, not possible to allocate\n\nthe transaction price to unsatisfied performance obligations. For gas delivery and gas storage and transportation contracts OMV applies the practical expedient according to IFRS 15.121 (b) according to which this information need not be disclosed for contracts where revenue is recognized in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. OMV, therefore, does not disclose this information.\n\n## c) Other revenues\n\nOther revenues include revenues from commodity contracts which are in the scope of IFRS 9. Sales and purchases of commodities are reported net within other revenues when the forward sales and purchase contracts are determined to be for trading purposes and not for the final physical delivery.\n\nIn addition, other revenues include an adjustment of revenues from considering the national oil company's profit share as income tax in certain production sharing agreements in the E&P segment (see 2.3f), realized and unrealized results from hedging of sales transactions as well as lease and rental income.\n\n## d) Exploration expenses\n\nExploration expenses relate exclusively to the business segment E&P and comprise the costs associated with unproved reserves. These include geological and geophysical costs for the identification and investigation of areas with possible oil and gas reserves and administrative, legal and consulting costs in connection with exploration. They also include all impairments on exploration wells where no proved reserves could be demonstrated. Depreciation of economically successful exploration wells is reported as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and write-ups.\n\n## e) Research and development\n\nExpenditure related to research activities is recognized as expense in the period in which it is incurred. Research and development (R&D) expenses, which are presented in the income statement within other operating expenses, include all direct and indirect materials, personnel and external services costs incurred in connection with the focused search for new insights related to the development and significant improvement of products, services and processes and in connection with research activities. Development costs are capitalized if the recognition criteria according to IAS 38 are fulfilled.\n\n## f) Exploration and production sharing agreements\n\nExploration and production sharing agreements (EPSAs) are contracts for oil and gas licenses in which the oil or gas production is shared between one or",

The acquisition costs of geological and geophysical studies before the discovery of proved reserves form part of expenses for the period. The costs of wells are capitalized and reported as intangible assets until the existence or absence of potentially commercially viable oil or gas reserves is determined. Wells which are not commercially viable are expensed. The costs of exploration wells whose commercial viability has not yet been determined continue to be capitalized as long as the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- \u25b8 Sufficient oil and gas reserves have been discovered that would justify completion as a production well.\n\n- \u25b8 Sufficient progress is being made in assessing the economic and technical feasibility to justify beginning field development in the near future.\n- \u25b8 The period for which the entity has the right to explore in the specific area has not expired.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Recoverability of unproved oil and gas assets\n\nThere may be cases when costs related to unproved oil and gas properties remain capitalized over longer periods while various appraisal and seismic activities continue in order to assess the size of the reservoir and its commerciality. Further decisions on the optimum timing of such developments are made from a resource and portfolio point of view. As soon as\n\noverhauls). The present value of the expected cost for the decommissioning of an asset after its use is included in the cost of the respective asset when a decommissioning provision is recognized (see 2.3s). Costs for replacements of components are capitalized and carrying values of the replaced parts are derecognized. Costs relating to minor maintenance and repairs are treated as expenses in the year in which they are incurred.\n\nIntangible assets and depreciable property, plant and equipment (except for oil and gas assets and a contract-related intangible asset in E&P, see 2.3h) are amortized or depreciated on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life.",

        "page_content": "there is no further intention to develop the discovery, the assets are immediately impaired.\n\nExploratory wells in progress at year-end which are determined to be unsuccessful subsequent to the statement of financial position date are treated as non-adjusting events, meaning that the costs incurred for such exploratory wells remain capitalized in the financial statements of the reporting period under review and will be expensed in the subsequent period.\n\nLicense acquisition costs and capitalized exploration and appraisal activities are not amortized as long as they are related to unproved reserves, but tested for impairment when there is an indicator for a potential impairment. Once the reserves are proved and commercial viability is established, the related assets are reclassified into tangible assets. Development expenditure on the construction, installation or completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms and pipelines and drilling development wells is capitalized within tangible assets. Once production starts, depreciation commences. Capitalized exploration and development costs and support equipment are generally depreciated based on proved developed reserves by applying the unit-of-production method; only capitalized exploration rights and acquired reserves are amortized on the basis of total proved reserves, unless a different reserves basis is more adequate.\n\n## Significant estimate: Oil and gas reserves\n\nOMV Group's oil and gas reserves are estimated by the Group's petroleum engineers in accordance with industry standards and reassessed at least once per year. In addition, external reviews are performed regularly. In 2021, DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) reviewed the reserves as of year-end 2020 of the majority of the oil and gas assets. The 2021 review did not include the reserves of the oil and gas assets in Russia and Malaysia (last review in 2020) and in Tunisia, KRI and Yemen (last review in 2018). An external review of the oil and gas assets not reviewed in 2021 is planned for 2022.\n\nThe results of the external reviews did not show significant deviations from the internal estimates, except for one case. In order to obtain a reasonable assurance on the reserves numbers of the field with a material deviation to D&M as of 31 December 2020, OMV engaged an independent external specialist to provide an opinion on OMV's approach for determining the reserves, which was deemed appropriate.\n\nOil and gas reserve estimates have a significant impact on the assessment of recoverability of carrying amounts of oil and gas assets of the Group. Downward revisions of these estimates could lead to impairment of the asset's carrying.\n\nIn addition, changes to the estimates of oil and gas reserves impact prospectively the amount of amortization and depreciation as well as the valuation of the financial asset related to the reserves redetermination right out of the acquisition of an interest in the Yuzhno Russkoye field.\n\n## i) Associated companies and joint arrangements\n\nAssociated companies are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control nor joint control over the financial and operating policies. Joint arrangements, which are arrangements of which the Group has joint control together with one or more parties, are classified into joint ventures or joint operations. Joint ventures are joint arrangements in which the parties that share control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint operations are joint arrangements in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\nInvestments in associated companies and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method, under which the investment is initially recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for the Group's share of the profit or loss less dividends received and the Group's share of other comprehensive income and other movements in equity.\n\nSignificant joint exploration and production activities in the E&P segment are conducted through joint operations which are not structured through a separate vehicle. For these joint operations, OMV recognizes in the consolidated financial statements its share of the assets held and liabilities and expenses incurred jointly with the other partners, as well as the group's income from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation. Acquisitions of interests in a joint operation, in which the activity of the joint operation constitutes a business, are accounted for according to the relevant IFRS 3 principles for business combination accounting (see 2.3a).\n\nIn addition, there are contractual arrangements similar to joint operations in the Group which are not jointly controlled and therefore do not meet the definition of a joint operation according to IFRS 11. This is the case",

        "page_content": "when the main decisions can be taken by more than one combination of affirmative votes of the involved parties or where one other party has control. OMV assesses whether such arrangements are within or out of scope of IFRS 11 on the basis of the relevant legal arrangements such as concession, license or joint operating agreements which define how and by whom the relevant decisions for these activities are taken. The accounting treatment for these arrangements is basically the same as for joint operations. As acquisitions of interests in such arrangements are not within the scope of IFRS 3, OMV's accounting policy is to treat such transactions as asset acquisitions.\n\n## j) Impairment of assets\n\nIntangible assets, property, plant and equipment (including oil and gas assets) and investments in associated companies and joint ventures are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Impairment tests are performed on the level of the asset or the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs).\n\nIf assets are determined to be impaired, the carrying amounts are written down to their recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal or value in use.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU. The pre-tax discount rate is determined by way of iteration. The cash flows are generally derived from the recent budgets and planning calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.\n\n## 2021\n\nBrent oil price (USD/bbl)\n\nEUR-USD exchange rate\n\nBrent oil price (EUR/bbl)\n\nRealized gas price (EUR/MWh)\n\nCO2 price (EUR/t)\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal is determined on the basis of the recent market transactions, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.\n\nIf the reasons for impairment no longer apply in a subsequent period, a reversal is recognized in profit or loss. The increased carrying amount related to the reversal of an impairment loss shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization and depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized in prior years.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Recoverability of assets\n\nEvaluating whether assets or CGUs are impaired or whether past impairments should be reversed, require the use of different estimates and assumptions such as price developments, production volumes and discount rates.\n\nThe key estimates and assumptions used bear the risk of change due to the inherent volatile nature of the various macro-economic factors and the uncertainty in asset or CGU specific factors like reserve volumes and production profiles, which can impact the recoverable amount of assets and/or CGUs.\n\nThe key valuation assumptions for the recoverable amounts of E&P assets are the oil and natural gas prices, production volumes, exchange and discount rates. The production profiles were estimated based on reserves estimates (see Note 2.3h) and past experience and represent management's best estimate of future production. The cash flow projections for the first five years are based on the mid-term plan and thereafter on a 'life of field' planning and therefore cover the whole life term of the field.\n\nThe nominal commodity price assumptions and the EUR-USD exchange rates are listed below:\n\n|   2022 |   2023 |   2024 |   2025 |   2026 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n|  65    |  65    |  65    |  65    |  65    |\n|   1.22 |   1.22 |   1.22 |   1.22 |   1.22 |\n|  53    |  53    |  53    |  53    |  53    |\n|  15    |  14    |  14    |  14    |  15    |\n|  55    |  58    |  61    |  64    |  68    |",

From 2035 onwards, OMV applied a Brent oil price of USD 60/bbl. All before mentioned assumptions for the years after 2026 are based on 2026 real terms. Gas prices are assumed to remain stable in real terms after 2026.\n\nAs there were no significant changes in the assumptions in 2021 in comparison to 2020, there was no indication for an impairment due to price changes in the E&P segment in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, OMV revised its long-term oil and gas price assumptions in order to take into account the uncertainty over the pace of the energy transition to a lower-carbon energy sources. In addition, the shortterm oil and gas price assumption were updated in order to reflect the significant decrease in oil and gas prices due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe assumptions used for oil and gas prices for short and medium term are based on management's best estimate and were consistent with external sources. The long-term assumptions were consistent with data provided by external studies and consider long-term views of global supply and demand. In particular, OMV's long term assumptions and the inverse price curve applied for Brent oil, take into consideration the impacts of climate-related matters and energy transition to lower-carbon energy sources.\n\nIn the R&M and C&M business, the main assumptions for the calculation of the recoverable amounts are the relevant margins, volumes as well as discount, inflation and growth rates. The value in use calculation is based on the cash flows of the 5year mid-term planning and a terminal value.\n\n## k) Assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts are to be realized by sale rather than through continued use. This is the case when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are no longer amortized or depreciated.\n\n## l) Leases\n\nOMV as a lessee recognizes lease liabilities and rightof-use assets for lease contracts according to IFRS 16. It applies the recognition exemption for short-term leases and leases in which the underlying asset is of low value and therefore does not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for such leases. Leases to explore for and use oil and natural gas, which comprise mainly land leases used for such activities, are not in the scope of IFRS 16. The rent for these contracts is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nNon-lease components are separated from the lease components for the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of fixed lease payments and lease payments which depend on an index or rate over the determined lease term with the applicable discount rate. Right-of-use assets are recognized at the value of the lease liability plus prepayments and initial direct costs and presented within property, plant and equipment.\n\nOMV as a lessor entered into contracts which were assessed as operating leases, for which fixed and variable rent is recognized as revenue from rents and leases over the period of the lease.",

        "page_content": "## Significant estimates and judgements: Leases\n\nOMV has a significant number of contracts in which it leases filling stations. Many of those contracts include prolongation and termination options. Prolongation options or periods after termination options are included in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the lease is prolonged or not terminated. When determining the lease term the Group takes into account all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for shortening or prolonging the lease term using the available options. When assessing the lease term of leases in filling stations for periods covered by prolongation or termination options, the assumption was applied that the lease term will not exceed 20 years.\n\nOptional periods, which have not been taken into account in the measurement of the leases, exist mainly for E&P equipment in Romania, office buildings, a plot of land in Belgium and gas storage caverns in Germany. The prolongation option for the office buildings and the gas storage caverns can only be exercised in the distant future.\n\n## m) Non-derivative financial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, OMV classifies its financial assets as subsequently measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) or fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends both on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial assets. All regular way trades are recognized and derecognized on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nDebt instruments are measured at amortized cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u25b8 the asset is held within the business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- \u25b8 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nThese assets are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses. Interest income, impairment losses and gains or losses on derecognition are recognized in profit or loss.\n\nOMV recognizes allowances for expected credit losses (ECLs) for all financial assets measured at amortized costs. The ECL calculation is based on external or internal credit ratings of the counterparty and associated probabilities of default. Available forward-looking information is taken into account, if it has a material impact on the amount of valuation allowance recognized.\n\nECLs are recognized in two stages. Where there has not been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, credit losses are measured at 12 month ECLs. The 12 month ECL is the credit loss which results from default events that are possible within the next 12 months. The Group considers a financial asset to have low credit risk when its credit risk rating is equivalent to the definition of 'investment grade'.\n\nWhere there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition, a loss allowance is required for the lifetime ECL, i.e. the expected credit losses resulting from possible default events over the expected life of a financial asset. For this assessment, OMV considers all reasonable and supportable information that is available without undue cost or effort. Furthermore, OMV assumes that the credit risk on a financial asset has significantly increased if it is more than 30 days past due. If the credit quality improves for a lifetime ECL asset, OMV reverts to recognizing allowances on a 12 month ECL basis. A financial asset is considered to be in default when the financial asset is 90 days past due unless there is reasonable and supportable information that demonstrates that a more lagging default criterion is appropriate. A financial asset is written off when there is no reasonable expectation that the contractual cash flows will be recovered.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets from contracts with customers a simplified approach is adopted, where the impairment losses are recognized at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. In case there are credit insurances or securities held against the balances outstanding, the ECL calculation is based on the probability of default of the insurer/securer for the insured/secured element of the outstanding balance and the remaining amount will take the probability of default of the counterparty.\n\nNon-derivative financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) include trade receivables from sales contracts with provisional pricing and investment funds because the contractual cash flows do not represent solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Furthermore, this measurement category includes portfolios of",

These assets are measured at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss.\n\nEquity instruments are either measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) or at fair value through OCI (FVOCI) . OMV elected irrevocably to classify as investments at FVOCI the majority of its non-listed equity investments which are held for strategic purposes and not trading. Gains and losses on equity investments measured at FVOCI are never recycled to profit or loss and they are not subject to impairment assessment. Dividends are recognized in profit or loss unless they represent a recovery of part of the cost of an investment.\n\nOMV derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Fair value and recoverability of financial assets\n\nThe management is periodically assessing the receivable related to expenditure recoverable from the Romanian State related to obligations for decommissioning and restoration costs in OMV Petrom SA. The assessment process is considering inter alia the history of amounts claimed, documentation process related requirements, potential litigation or arbitration proceedings.\n\nAs part of the acquisition of the interest in Yuzhno Russkoye gas field in 2017, OMV took over a contractual position towards Gazprom with regard to the reserves redetermination. The volume of gas reserves in Yuzhno Russkoye field is contractually agreed and, in case the reserves are higher or lower than what was assumed in the agreement, either OMV could be obligated to compensate Gazprom (but would profit in the future from higher sales volumes) or Gazprom could be obligated to compensate OMV. The payment for the reserve redetermination is linked to the actual amount of the gas reserves. The actual volume of gas reserves in Yuzhno Russkoye is expected to be agreed in 2023. The estimated volume of gas reserves is regularly reviewed by the Group's petroleum engineers as part of the yearly review process and is assumed to be lower than the contractually agreed volume (see Note 18 - Financial Assets - for more details).\n\n## n) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nDerivative instruments are used to hedge risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. Derivative instruments are recognized at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as income or expense, except where hedge accounting according to IFRS 9 is applied.\n\nThose derivatives qualifying and designated as hedges are either\n\n- \u25b8 a fair value hedge when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability,\n- \u25b8 a net investment hedge when hedging the foreign exchange risk in a net investment in a foreign operation.\n- \u25b8 a cash flow hedge when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction, or\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the effective part of the changes in fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective part is recognized immediately in the income statement. Where the hedging of cash flows results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the carrying value of that item will be adjusted for the accumulated gains or losses recognized directly in OCI.\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in OCI and accumulated in the reserve for currency translation differences. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss when the foreign operation is disposed of or sold.\n\nThe Group applies hedge accounting to hedges which are affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. For the purpose of evaluating whether there is an economic relationship between the hedged items and the hedging instruments, the Group assumes that the benchmark interest rate is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform (see Note 2.1a).\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item that can be settled net in cash or another financial instrument are accounted for as financial instruments and measured at fair value. Associated gains or losses are recognized in profit or loss. However, contracts that are entered into",

All other costs of borrowing are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## p) Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized as income or deducted from the related asset where it is reasonable to expect that the granting conditions will be met and that the grants will be received.\n\n## q) Inventories\n\nInventories are recognized at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Costs incurred are generally determined based on the individual costs for not interchangeable goods, the average price method for oil and gas inventories or the FIFO method for petrochemical products. Costs of production comprise directly attributable costs as well as fixed and variable indirect material and production overhead costs. Production-related administrative costs, the costs of company pension schemes and voluntary employee benefits are also included. In refineries, a carrying capacity approach is applied according to which the production costs are allocated to product groups on the basis of their relative market values at the end of the period.\n\n## r) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash balances, bank accounts and highly liquid short-term investments with low realization risk, i.e. negligible short-term exchange and interest risks. The maximum maturity at the time of acquisition for such investments is three months.\n\n## s) Provisions\n\nA provision is recorded for present obligations against third parties when it is probable that an obligation will occur and the settlement amount can be estimated reliably. Provisions for individual obligations are based on the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle the obligation, discounted to the present value in the case of long-term obligations.\n\n## Decommissioning and environmental obligations :\n\nThe Group's core activities regularly lead to obligations related to dismantling and removal, asset retirement\n\nand soil remediation activities. These decommissioning and restoration obligations are principally of material importance in the E&P segment (oil and gas wells, surface facilities) and in connection with filling stations on third-party property. At the time the obligation arises, it is provided for in full by recognizing the present value of future decommissioning and restoration expenses as a liability. An equivalent amount is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of long-lived assets. Any such obligation is calculated on the basis of best estimates. The unwinding of discounting leads to interest expense or income (in case of a negative discount rate) and accordingly to increased or decreased obligations at each statement of financial position date until decommissioning or restoration. For other environmental risks and measures, provisions are recognized if such obligations are probable and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Decommissioning provisions\n\nThe most significant decommissioning obligations of the Group are related to the plugging of wells, the abandonment of facilities and the removal and disposal of offshore installations. The majority of these activities are planned to occur many years into the future, while decommissioning technologies, costs, regulations and public expectations are constantly changing. Estimates of future restoration costs are based on reports prepared by Group engineers and on past experience. Any significant downward changes in the expected future costs or postponement in the future affect both the provision and the related asset, to the extent that there is sufficient carrying amount, otherwise the provision is reversed to income. Significant upward revisions trigger the assessment of the recoverability of the underlying asset.\n\nProvisions for decommissioning and restoration costs require estimates of discount rates, which have material effects on the amounts of the provision. The real discount rates applied for calculating the provision for decommissioning and restoration costs were between -1.97% and 5.22% (2020: -1.96% and 3.10%).\n\n## Pensions and similar obligations : OMV has both de-\n\nfined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. In the case of defined contribution plans , OMV has no obligations beyond payment of the agreed premiums, and no provision is therefore recognized. The reported",

        "page_content": "expense corresponds to the contributions payable for the period.\n\nIn contrast, participants in defined benefit plans are entitled to pensions at certain levels and are generally based on years of service and the employee's average compensation. These defined benefit plans expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk (as a result of indexation of pension) and market risk. Defined benefit pension obligations are accounted for by recognizing provisions for pensions.\n\nEmployees of Austrian Group companies whose service began before December 31, 2002 are entitled to receive severance payments upon termination of employment or on reaching normal retirement age. The entitlements depend on years of service and final compensation levels. Entitlements to severance payments for employees whose service began after December 31, 2002 are covered by defined contribution plans. Similar obligations as entitlement to severance payments also exist in other countries, where the Group provides employment.\n\nEmployees in Austria and Germany are entitled to jubilee payments after completion of a given number of years of service. These plans are non-contributory and unfunded.\n\nProvisions for pensions, severance payments and jubilee payments are calculated using the projected unit credit method, which divides the costs of the estimated benefit entitlements over the whole period of employment and thus takes future increases in remuneration into account. Actuarial gains and losses for defined benefit pension and severance payment obligations are recognized in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income. Such actuarial gains and losses are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Actuarial gains and losses on obligations for jubilee payments are recognized in profit or loss. Net interest expense is calculated on the basis of the net defined benefit obligation and disclosed as part of the financial result. Differences between the return on plan assets and interest income on plan assets included in the net interest expense is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nProvisions for voluntary and mandatory separations under restructuring programs are recognized if a detailed plan has been approved by management and communicated to those affected prior to the statement of financial position date and an irrevocable commitment is\n\nthereby established. Voluntary modifications to employees' remuneration arrangements are recognized on the basis of the expected number of employees accepting the employing company's offer. Provisions for obligations related to individual separation agreements which lead to fixed payments over a defined period of time are recognized at the present value of the obligation.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Pensions and similar obligations\n\nThe projected unit credit method calculation of provisions for pensions, severance and jubilee entitlements requires estimates for discount rates, future increases in salaries and future increases in pensions. For current actuarial assumptions for calculating expected defined benefit entitlements and their sensitivity analysis see Note 23 - Provisions.\n\nThe biometrical basis for the calculation of provisions for pensions, severance and jubilee entitlements of Austrian Group companies is provided by AV\u00d6 2018 P - Rechnungsgrundlagen f\u00fcr die Pensionsversicherung (Biometric Tables for Pension Insurance) - Pagler & Pagler, using the variant for salaried employees. In other countries, similar actuarial parameters are used. Employee turnover was computed based on age or years of service respectively. The expected retirement age used for calculations is based on the relevant country's legislation.\n\nProvision for onerous contracts are recognized for contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting a contractual obligation exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under the contract. These provisions are measured at the lower amount of the cost of fulfilling the contract and any potential penalties or compensation arising in the event of non-performance.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Provisions for onerous contracts\n\nOMV concluded in the past several long-term, noncancellable contracts that became onerous due to negative development of market conditions. This led to the recognition of onerous contract provisions in the Group's financial statements for the unavoidable costs of meeting the contract obligations.\n\nThe estimates used for calculating the positive contributions that partly cover the fixed costs were based on external sources and management expectations. For more details see Note 23 - Provisions.",

Long-term liabilities are discounted using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## u) Taxes on income and deferred taxes\n\nIn addition to corporate income taxes and trade earnings taxes, typical E&P taxes from oil and gas production like the country's/national oil company's profit share for certain EPSAs (see 2.3f) are disclosed as income taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgements: Recoverability of deferred tax assets\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets requires an assessment of when those assets are likely to reverse, and a judgement as to whether or not there will be sufficient taxable profits available to offset the assets when they reverse. This assessment of recoverability requires assumptions regarding future taxable profits and is therefore uncertain. In OMV, this assessment is based on detailed tax plannings which covers in E&P entities the whole life of field and a five year period in the other entities.\n\nChanges in the assumptions regarding future taxable profits can lead to an increase or decrease of the amount of deferred tax assets recognized which has an impact on the net income in the period in which the change occurs.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities at Group level are shown net where there is a right of set-off and the taxes relate to matters subject to the same tax jurisdiction.\n\n## v) Long Term Incentive (LTI) Plans and Equity Deferral\n\nThe fair value of share-based compensation expense arising from the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) -\n\nOMV's main equity settled plan - is estimated using a model which is based on the expected target achievements and the expected share prices. For cash-settled awards, a provision based on the fair value of the amount payable is built up over the vesting period, so that by the end of the vesting period the fair value of the bonus shares to be granted is fully provided for. The provision is remeasured at the end of each reporting period up to the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss. For share settled awards, the grant date fair value is recognized as an expense (including income tax), with a corresponding increase in equity, over the vesting period of the awards. The amount recognized as expense is adjusted to subsequent changes in parameters other than market parameters. In addition, the Equity Deferral part of the annual bonus is settled in shares. Accordingly, the related expense is recognized against equity. For share-based awards, the award is settled net of tax to the participants.\n\n## w) Fair value measurement\n\nThe fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be transferred at the measurement date, based on the assumption that such transfers take place between participants in principal markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best use into account.\n\nFair values are determined according to the following hierarchy:\n\nLevel 1:    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. For OMV Group this category will, in most cases, only be relevant for securities, bonds, investment funds and futures contracts.\n\nLevel 2:\n\nLevel 3:\n\nValuation technique using directly or indirectly observables inputs. In order to determine the fair value for financial instruments within Level 2, usually forward prices of crude oil or natural gas, interest rates and foreign exchange rates are used as inputs to the valuation model. In addition counterparty credit risk as well as volatility indicators, if applicable, are taken into account.\n\nValuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models using significant unobservable inputs (e.g. long-term price assumptions and reserves estimates).",

Major changes in consolidated Group are described below.\n\n## Exploration & Production\n\nAs per May 14, 2021, OMV Petrom finalized the sale of its 100% share in Kom-Munai LLP and Tasbulat Oil Corporation LLP (both based in Aktau, Kazakhstan) to Magnetic Oil Limited.\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nOn May 31, 2021, OMV closed the transaction to sell its 51% interest in Gas Connect Austria GmbH (based in Vienna) to VERBUND. The purchase price agreed for the 51% OMV stake in Gas Connect Austria GmbH amounted to EUR 271 mn, less dividend payouts for the 2020 business year totaling around EUR 33 mn (for the 51% OMV interest). In addition, VERBUND assumed the outstanding liabilities of Gas Connect Austria GmbH to OMV of around EUR 212 mn. Under the conditions of the purchase agreement, VERBUND has paid approximately EUR 451 mn to OMV. OMV has settled a cash pool liability to a subsidiary of Gas Connect Austria GmbH of around EUR 7 mn.\n\nThe above listed sales transactions did not have a significant impact on the income statement.\n\n## Chemicals & Materials\n\nThere were no significant changes in group structure in 2021.\n\nOn October 29, 2020 OMV increased its stake in Borealis Group from 36% to 75% which led to obtaining control and consequently full consolidation of Borealis Group and discontinuation of the equity method.\n\n## Cash flow impact of divestments\n\nIn cash flow from investing activities, the line 'Proceeds from the sale of subsidiaries and businesses, net of cash disposed' was mainly attributable to a cash inflow of EUR 443 mn related to the divestment of Gas Connect Group and EUR 94 mn related to the divestment of Kom-Munai LLP and Tasbulat Oil Corporation LLP, as well as to prepayments received for the planned divestments of the retail business in Germany (EUR 75 mn) and of OMV's business in Slovenia (EUR 35 mn).

Internal reporting and the relevant information provided to the chief operating decision-maker in order to assess performance and allocate resources has been updated to reflect the current organization structure.\n\n## Business operations and key markets\n\nFor business management purposes, OMV is divided into three operating Business Segments: Exploration & Production, Refining & Marketing, and Chemicals & Materials, as well as the segment Corporate and Other (Co&O). Each segment represents a strategic unit with different products and markets. Each Business Segment is managed independently. Strategic business decisions are made by the Executive Board of OMV. With the exception of Co&O, the reportable segments of OMV are the same as the operating segments.\n\nExploration & Production (E&P) engages in the business of oil and gas exploration, development and production and focuses on the regions Central and Eastern Europe, North Sea, Middle East and Africa and Asia-Pacific.\n\nThe Refining & Marketing (R&M) Business Segment refines and markets crude and other feedstock. It operates the refineries Schwechat (Austria), Burghausen (Germany) and Petrobrazi (Romania) with an annual capacity of 17.8 mn t. In these refineries, crude oil is processed into petroleum products, which are sold to commercial and private customers. Furthermore, it operates across the gas value chain with a successful gas sales and logistics business in Europe. OMV markets storage capacities in Austria and Germany. The business segments' activities also cover supply, marketing, and trading of gas in Europe and Turkey and the Group's power business activities, with one gas-fired power plant in Romania.\n\nOMV has a strong position in the markets located within the areas of its supply, serving commercial customers, and operating a retail business of approximately 2,100 filling stations.\n\nOMV holds minority stakes in various equity-accounted investments, the most significant one is the 15% participation in ADNOC Refining (United Arab Emirates) with annual capacity of 7.1 mn t OMV share.\n\nThe Chemicals & Materials (C&M) Business Segment is one of the world's leading providers of advanced and circular polyolefin solutions and a European market leader in base chemicals, fertilizers, and plastics recycling.\n\nSince the full consolidation of Borealis in 2020, OMV has a production capacity, including joint ventures, of 7.0 mn t base chemicals, 5.8 mn t polyolefins, 0.4 mn t compounding and 4.3 mn t fertilizers. The majority of production is located in Europe, with two overseas manufacturing facilities in the United States, one in Brazil and one in South Korea. In addition, OMV holds minority stakes in various equity-accounted investments, the most significant ones being Borouge (United Arab Emirates) a Borealis' joint venture with ADNOC that operates the largest petrochemical complex in the world and the Baystar joint venture (United States) which serves the customer base in the North American markets. A new plant based on Borstar technology on the site in Pasadena is currently under construction.\n\nOMV group is pursuing various initiatives in mechanical and chemical recycling and renewable polyolefins.\n\nGroup management, financing and insurance activities and certain service functions are concentrated in the Corporate & Other (Co&O) segment.\n\nOne of the key measures of operating performance for the Group is Clean CCS Operating Result. Total assets include intangible assets as well as property, plant and equipment. Sales to external customers are split up by geographical areas on the basis of where the risk is transferred to the customers. The net revenues of commodity trading activities within the scope of IFRS 9 and hedging results are reported in the country in which the reporting subsidiary is located. Accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, with certain exceptions for intra-group sales and cost allocations by the parent company, which are determined in accordance with internal OMV policies. Management is of the opinion that the transfer prices of goods and services exchanged between segments correspond to market prices. Business transactions not attributable to operating segments are included in the results of the Co&O segment.\n\nThe disclosure of special items is considered appropriate in order to facilitate analysis of ordinary business performance. To reflect comparable figures, certain items affecting the result are added back or deducted.",

Furthermore, to enable effective performance management in an environment of volatile prices and comparability with peers, the Current Cost of Supply (CCS) effect is eliminated from the result. The CCS effect, also called inventory holding gains and losses, is the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the current cost of supply based on purchases from the most recent month and\n\nthe cost of sales calculated using the weighted average method, after adjusting for any changes in valuation allowances. In volatile energy markets, measurement of the costs of petroleum products sold based on historical values (e.g. weighted average cost) can have distorting effects on reported results. This performance measurement indicator enhances the transparency of results and is commonly used in the oil industry. OMV, therefore, publishes this measure in addition to the Operating Result determined according to IFRS.\n\n## Segment reporting\n\nIn EUR mn\n\nSales revenues\n\n1\n\nIntersegmental sales\n\nSales to third parties\n\nOther operating income\n\nNet income from equity-accounted invest-\n\nments\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\nImpairment losses (incl. exploration & ap-\n\npraisal)\n\nWrite-ups\n\nOperating Result\n\nSpecial items for personnel restructuring\n\nSpecial items for unscheduled depreciation\n\nand write-ups\n\nSpecial items for asset disposal\n\nOther special items\n\nSpecial items\n\nCCS effect\n\nClean CCS Operating Result\n\nSegment assets\n\n2\n\nAdditions in PPE/IA\n\n3\n\nEquity-accounted investments\n\n| 2021    | 2021    | 2021    | 2021   | 2021    | 2021            | 2021       |\n|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|------------|\n| E&P     | R&M     | C&M     | Co&O   | Total   | Consoli- dation | OMV  Group |\n| 6,712   | 25,928  | 11,618  | 376    | 44,634  | (9,079)         | 35,555     |\n| (4,828) | (2,780) | (1,109) | (361)  | (9,079) | 9,079           | -          |\n| 1,884   | 23,148  | 10,509  | 14     | 35,555  | -               | 35,555     |\n| 347     | 274     | 249     | 63     | 933     | -               | 933        |\n| 55      | 12      | 534     | -      | 600     | -               | 600        |\n| 1,396   | 429     | 535     | 41     | 2,401   | -               | 2,401      |\n| 325     | 718     | 495     | 0      | 1,538   | -               | 1,538      |\n| 0       | 3       | -       | -      | 4       | -               | 4          |\n| 2,439   | 922     | 1,828   | (74)   | 5,115   | (51)            | 5,065      |\n| 14      | 7       | -       | 9      | 30      | -               | 30         |\n| 100     | 713     | 483     | -      | 1,297   | -               | 1,297      |\n| (209)   | (7)     | -       | (6)    | (223)   | -               | (223)      |\n| 492     | (204)   | (87)    | 9      | 210     | -               | 210        |\n| 398     | 509     | 396     | 12     | 1,315   | -               | 1,315      |\n| -       | (430)   | -       | -      | (430)   | 12              | (418)      |\n| 2,837   | 1,001   | 2,224   | (62)   | 5,999   | (39)            | 5,961      |\n| 12,217  | 3,989   | 5,283   | 241    | 21,730  | -               | 21,730     |\n| 1,251   | 621     | 724     | 28     | 2,624   | -               | 2,624      |\n| 429     | 1,325   | 5,133   | -      | 6,887   | -               | 6,887      |\n\n4\n\n- 1 Including intra-group sales\n- 2 Property, plant and equipment (PPE), intangible assets (IA), not including assets reclassified to assets held for sale\n- 3 Excluding additions in assets reclassified to held for sale and additions to decommissioning assets\n- 4 Excluding assets held for sale",

For further details see Note 18 - Financial assets.\n\n## Gains from fair value changes of trading invento-\n\nries refer to emissions certificates held for trading in Refining & Marketing and Chemicals & Materials (Austria and Germany). For further details on Emissions certificates see Note 23 - Provisions.\n\nGains from fair value changes of other derivatives were related to forward contracts of emissions certificates in Refining & Marketing and Chemicals & Materials (Austria and Germany).\n\nGains on the disposal of businesses, subsidiaries, tangible and intangible assets relate mostly to gains on the sale of Wisting oil field. On December 17, 2021, OMV (NORGE) AS, closed the divestment of its entire 25% stake in the Wisting licenses to Lundin Energy AB. The purchase price before customary closing adjustments was USD 320 mn, with a contingent payment of\n\nup to USD 20 mn depending on final project CAPEX. The economic effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2021. The transaction led to a gain of EUR 261 mn.\n\nResidual other operating income contained mostly storage income related to Erd\u00f6l-Lagergesellschaft m.b.H. (EUR 43 mn) and insurance compensation related to 2020 process safety incident in Borealis cracker in Sweden (EUR 34 mn).\n\n2020 contained gains from revaluation and recycling effects related to the previously held 36% interest in Borealis AG (EUR 1,284 mn), storage income related to Erd\u00f6l-Lagergesellschaft m.b.H. (EUR 50 mn) as well as insurance compensation related to a process safety incident in Borealis cracker in Sweden (EUR 41 mn).\n\nIncome from equity-accounted investments was mainly impacted by Abu Dhabi Polymers Company Limited (Borouge). 2020 primarily contained income from the previously held 36% interest in Borealis AG amounting to EUR 172 mn.\n\n## Expenses from equity-accounted investments were\n\nmainly impacted by Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company.

Furthermore, in 2021 reported impairment losses attributable to exploration and appraisal (EUR 74 mn) were mainly related to unsuccessful exploration wells and exploration licenses in Australia, Norway, Romania and New Zealand.\n\nMoreover, impairments in 2021 included mainly unsuccessful workovers and obsolete or replaced assets in Romania (EUR 87 mn).\n\nIn 2020 the significant drop in the oil and gas prices led to the change in OMV's price assumptions and have triggered impairment testing throughout the Exploration & Production portfolio. This led to pre-tax impairments of EUR 1,222 mn (intangible assets EUR 614 mn and tangible assets EUR 608 mn) and pre-tax write-ups of EUR 91 mn in 2020 for exploration and appraisal, de-",

The impairments have been recorded in different countries across the portfolio, mainly related to assets in New Zealand, Romania, Austria and United Arab Emirates.\n\nMoreover, the planned sale of assets in Kazakhstan by OMV Petrom (51% subsidiary of OMV) in 2020 led to the reclassification to 'held for sale', which triggered a pre-tax write-up of EUR 28 mn. Other impairments in 2020 were mainly related to unsuccessful workovers and obsolete or replaced assets in Romania (EUR 58 mn). Furthermore, impairment losses in 2020 included impairments of EUR 149 mn related to unsucessfull exploration wells and exploration licenses in Malaysia, Austria, Norway and New Zealand.\n\n## Impairments and write-ups in Refining & Marketing\n\nThe deterioration in the margin outlook led to a change in price assumptions and triggered impairment testing in the ADNOC Refining and Trading CGU which is accounted for at-equity. This led to an impairment of EUR 669 mn due to lower refining margins and production volumes in ADNOC Refining using an after-tax discount rate of 6.61%. A decrease in the margin of USD 1/bbl for all years would lead to an additional impairment of approximately EUR 600 mn.\n\n## 8 Exploration expenses\n\nThe following financial information represents the amounts included within the Group totals relating to exploration for and appraisal of oil and natural gas\n\nIn 2020 there were no significant impairments in the segment Refining & Marketing. The long-term power and CO2 price assumptions were revised in 2020, taking into account the improved power generation market in Romania. This led to the full reversal of impairments for the Brazi gas-fired power plant in Romania amounting to EUR 107 mn pre-tax based on an after-tax discount rate of 4.26%.\n\n## Impairments in Chemicals & Materials\n\nImpairment losses of EUR 444 mn were recognized for the nitrogen business unit of Borealis Group to reflect the fair value less cost of disposal as of December 31, 2021. The valuation was based on the binding offer from EuroChem for the acquisition of the diposal group received on February 2, 2022.\n\nThe lack of profitability in recent years and the significant deviation in 2021 of the financial performance of the Rosier Group from the budget qualified as a triggering event for an impairment test. The main reasons were the market conditions being increasingly competitive with the pressure of the vertically integrated competitors and disruption in the raw material supply during the year. As a result, property, plant and equipment was impaired by EUR 39 mn in 2021.\n\nresources.

The tables hereafter reconcile the effective tax rate and the standard Austrian corporate income tax rate of 25% showing the major influencing factors.\n\n## Tax rate reconciliation\n\n| In %                                                                 |        |        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                                                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n| Austrian corporate income tax rate                                   | 25.0   | 25.0   |\n| Tax effect of:                                                       |        |        |\n| Differing foreign tax rates                                          | 26.1   | (8.3)  |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                              | 3.7    | 22.6   |\n| Non-taxable income                                                   | (10.4) | (55.7) |\n| Change in tax rate                                                   | (0.1)  | (1.3)  |\n| Permanent effects within tax loss carryforwards                      | 0.1    | 0.1    |\n| Tax impairments and write-ups on investments at parent company level | 0.7    | (14.1) |\n| Change in valuation allowance for deferred taxes                     | (1.8)  | (36.5) |\n| Taxes related to previous years                                      | 0.7    | (6.2)  |\n| Other                                                                | (1.4)  | 5.5    |\n| Effective Group income tax rate                                      | 42.4   | (68.8) |\n\n## Tax rate reconciliation\n\n|                                                                      | In EUR mn   | In EUR mn   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                      | 2021        | 2020        |\n| Theoretical taxes on income based on Austrian income tax rate        | 1,218       | 219         |\n| Tax effect of:                                                       |             |             |\n| Differing foreign tax rates                                          | 1,270       | (73)        |\n| Non-deductible expenses                                              | 178         | 198         |\n| Non-taxable income                                                   | (508)       | (487)       |\n| Change in tax rate                                                   | (3)         | (12)        |\n| Permanent effects within tax loss carryforwards                      | 5           | 1           |\n| Tax impairments and write-ups on investments at parent company level | 32          | (123)       |\n| Change in valuation allowance for deferred taxes                     | (88)        | (320)       |\n| Taxes related to previous years                                      | 32          | (55)        |\n| Other                                                                | (71)        | 49          |\n| Total taxes on income and profit                                     | 2,066       | (603)       |\n\nDiffering foreign tax rates effects in 2021 mostly related to subsidiaries operating in tax jurisdictions with high corporate income tax rates (Norway, Libya and United Arab Emirates).

For the impairment test of the goodwill allocated to Middle East and Africa, an after-tax discount rate of 9.44% (2020: 9.23%) and for goodwill allocated\n\nto SapuraOMV an after-tax discount rate of 8.0% (2020: 7.88%) was used.\n\nAn after-tax discount rate of 12.73% related to the goodwill allocated to Middle East and Africa and an after-tax discount rate of 9.19% related to SapuraOMV goodwill would lead to zero headroom.

As OMV, with its 40% interest (2020: 40%) does not have joint control over Abu Dhabi Polymers Company Limited (Borouge), the company is accounted for as an associated company.\n\nBayport Polymers LLC , registered in Pasadena (incorporated in Wilmington), is currently building a polyethylene facility as well as an ethane steam cracker with the objective of supplying the abundantly available and competitively priced ethane in the United States to its polyethylene units. As OMV has joint control over Bayport Polymers LLC (50/50 share split), it accounts the company as joint venture.\n\nOMV also holds a 15% (2020: 15%) interest in Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company , registered in Abu Dhabi, which runs a refinery hub with integrated petrochemicals. According to the contractual agreement between the shareholders, OMV has strong participation rights which represent significant influence as per IAS 28 definition. In 2021 the deterioration in the margin outlook led to a change in price assumptions and triggered impairment testing in the ADNOC Refining and Trading CGU. This led to an impairment of EUR 669 mn. For further details please refer to Note 7 - Depreciation, amortization, impairments and writeups.\n\nThe above mentioned companies are not listed on public exchanges thus quoted market prices do not exist.

In spite of holding the majority of voting rights in the general assembly, OMV does not have control over ELG. The significant decisions on the financial and operating policies are delegated to the standing shareholder's committee in which a quorum of two thirds of the share capital is required for decisions.\n\nOMV exercises joint control over Abu Dhabi Petroleum Investments LLC (ADPINV, OMV's interest 25%, 2020: 25%), registered in Abu Dhabi, and Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO; indirect interest of OMV amounts to 10%, 2020: 10%), registered in Karachi, and accounts both investments at-equity. ADPINV is a holding company for its 40% interest in PARCO. As unanimous consent of the parties is required for decisions about relevant activities and OMV has rights to the net assets based on the legal structure, OMV classified the companies as joint ventures according to IFRS 11.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, OMV has a 10% interest (2020: 10%) in Pearl Petroleum Company Limited , registered in Road Town, British Virgin Islands, which is involved in exploration and production of hydrocarbons in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. According to the contractual agreement between OMV and Pearl Petroleum Company Limited (Pearl), OMV has significant influence within the meaning of IAS 28, as unanimous consent is required for some strategic decisions. Therefore Pearl is accounted for using the equity method although OMV's share is just 10%.\n\nOMV also holds 50% share (2020: 50%) in Borouge Pte.Ltd ., based in Singapore, which is responsible for marketing and sales of the products produced by Abu Dhabi Polymers Company Limited (Borouge). Even though OMV holds a 50% interest in Borouge Pte. Ltd., OMV has no joint control and thus accounts for it as an associated company.\n\nIn June 2021, OMV subscribed through Borealis Group to a new share issue, thus acquiring 10% in Renasci N.V. , a company incorporated in Belgium. Renasci N.V. is principally engaged in the development of the proprietary processes and know how about various technologies regarding waste treatment and recycling. Through the shareholder agreement, Borealis is guaranteed two seats on the board of Renasci N.V. and participates in major significant financial and operating decisions. The Group has therefore determined that it has significant influence over this entity, even though it only holds 10% of the voting rights. Therefore, the investment is accounted for as an associated company.\n\nAs per September 30, 2021, OMV finalized the sale of its 40% share in SMATRICS GmbH & Co KG (based in Vienna) and its 40% share in E-Mobility Provider Austria GmbH (based in Vienna) to VERBUND AG.\n\nFor further details, please refer to Note 38 - Direct and indirect investments of OMV Aktiengesellschaft.\n\n## Statement of comprehensive income for individually immaterial associates and joint ventures - Group's share\n\nIn EUR mn\n\nCarrying amount reconciliation for individually immaterial associates and joint ventures\n\n|                            | 2021       | 2021           | 2020       | 2020           |\n|----------------------------|------------|----------------|------------|----------------|\n|                            | Associates | Joint ventures | Associates | Joint ventures |\n| Sales revenue              | 8,557      | 273            | 1,177      | 136            |\n| Net income for the year    | 129        | 14             | 28         | 0              |\n| Other comprehensive income | 1          | -              | (2)        | -              |\n| Total comprehensive income | 130        | 14             | 25         | 0              |\n\n| In EUR mn                                   |                  |                    |                  |                     |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------|\n|                                             | 2021             | 2021               | 2020             | 2020                |\n|                                             | Associates 1 802 | Joint ventures  91 | Associates 1 553 | Joint ventures  150 |\n| January 1  Currency translation differences | 59               | (2)                | (69)             | (9)                 |\n| Changes in consolidated Group               | 25               | (15)               | 322              | 7                   |\n| Additions and other changes                 | -                | -                  | 13               | -                   |\n| Net income                                  | 129    1         | 14    -            | 28               | 0  -                |\n| Other comprehensive income                  | (55)             |                    | (2)              |                     |\n| Disposals and other changes                 |                  | -                  | (1)              | (54)                |\n| Dividends distributed                       | (92)             | -                  | (42)             | (5)                 |\n| December 31                                 | 868              | 89                 | 802              | 91                  |",

As of December 31, 2021, the arbitration procedure is ongoing.\n\nAdditionally, other sundry financial assets contained receivables towards partners in the Exploration & Production business as well as seller participation notes in Carnuntum DAC (see Note 36 - Unconsolidated structured entities - for further details).\n\n## Equity investments measured at FVOCI\n\n| In EUR mn                                                     | 2021       | 2021                                 | 2021                            |            |                                      |                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Investment                                                    | Fair value | Fair value  adjustment  through  OCI | Dividend  recognized  as income | Fair value | Fair value  adjustment  through  OCI | Dividend  recognized  as income |\n| APK-Pensionskasse Aktiengesellschaft                          | 2          | (0)                                  | 0                               | 3          | 0                                    | -                               |\n| BSP Bratislava-Schwechat Pipeline GmbH                        | -          | -                                    | -                               | -          | (3)                                  | -                               |\n| Wiener B\u00f6rse AG                                               | 4          | (0)                                  | 1                               | 5          | 0                                    | 0                               |\n| FSH Flughafen-Schwechat-Hydranten-Gesell- schaft GmbH & Co OG | 2          | -                                    | -                               | 2          | -                                    | 0                               |\n| WAV W\u00e4rme Austria VertriebsgmbH                               | 2          | -                                    | 0                               | 2          | -                                    | 0                               |\n| Bockatech Limited                                             | 3          | -                                    | -                               | -          | -                                    | -                               |\n| Oil Insurance Limited                                         | -          | -                                    | 4                               | 0          | -                                    | 2                               |\n| Other                                                         | 2          | -                                    | 4                               | 2          | 0                                    | 0                               |\n| Equity investments measured at FVOCI                          | 16         | (1)                                  | 9                               | 14         | (2)                                  | 3                               |",

The sales transaction was closed on September 30, 2021.\n\nOn December 3, 2021, OMV finalized the sale of its 100% share in Haramidere Depoculuk Anonim \u015eirketi (based in Instanbul) to CAN ULUSLARALASI YATIRIM ANONIM SIRKETI.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in Refining & Marketing related to OMV retail businesses in Germany and Slovenia.\n\nOn December 14, 2020, OMV and EG Group reached an agreement for EG Group to acquire the OMV retail business (285 filling stations) in Germany. The transaction is subject to required regulatory approvals and closing is expected in 2022.\n\nDuring 2021 OMV decided to sell its retail business in Slovenia (120 filling stations) which led to the reclassification to assets and liabilities to held for sale. This reclassification did not lead to an impairment loss. On June 8, 2021 OMV and MOL Group reached an agreement for MOL Group to acquire OMV Slovenia. The transaction is subject to required regulatory approvals and closing is expected in 2022.\n\n## Chemicals & Materials\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in Chemicals & Materials related entirely to the nitrogen business unit of Borealis Group.\n\nDuring 2021 OMV decided to sell the nitrogen business unit in Borealis Group (75% held by OMV) including fertilizer, technical nitrogen and melamine products. This led to the reclassification of the disposal group to assets and liabilities held for sale without having an impact on the income statement at that time. The Borealis Group's share in fertilizer production sites in the Netherlands and Belgium ('Rosier') is presently not being considered within the potential sales process. Closing of the sales transaction is expected in 2022.\n\nOMV determines the net position of emission certificates for the Group. As of December 31, 2021 an obligation to surrender 2,277,248 emission certificates (market value: EUR 172 mn) related to the nitrogen business unit was not included in the balance sheet line 'Liabilities associated with assets held for sale', due to the net presentation policy.\n\nThe result of the measurement at fair value less cost of disposal of the nitrogen business as of December 31, 2021 has led to an impairment which is described in more details in the Note 7 - Depreciation, amortization, impairments and write-ups.",

There are no different classes of shares and no shares with special rights of control. All shares are entitled to dividends for the financial year 2021, with the exception of treasury shares held by OMV Aktiengesellschaft.\n\nAs the authorized capital granted by the Annual General Meeting on May 14, 2014 expired on May 14, 2019, the Annual General Meeting decided upon a new authorized capital on September 29, 2020. Specifically, it authorized the Executive Board until September 29, 2025 to increase the share capital of OMV with the consent of the Supervisory Board - at once or in several tranches - by an amount of up to EUR 32,727,272 by issuing up to 32,727,272 new no-par value common voting shares in bearer form in return for contributions in cash. The capital increase can also be implemented by way of indirect offer for subscription after taking over by one or several credit institutions according to Section 153 Paragraph 6 Austrian Stock Corporation Act. The issue price and the conditions of issuance can be determined by the Executive Board with the consent of the Supervisory Board.\n\nFurther, the Annual General Meeting authorized the Executive Board, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to exclude the subscription right of the shareholders if the capital increase serves to (i) adjust fractional amounts or (ii) satisfy stock transfer programs, in particular long term incentive plans, equity deferrals or other participation programs for employees, senior employees and members of the Executive Board/management boards of the Company or one of its affiliates, or other employees stock ownership plans.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board was authorized to adopt amendments to the Articles of Association resulting from the issuance of shares according to the authorized capital.\n\n## Capital reserves\n\nCapital reserves have been formed by the contribution of funds into OMV Aktiengesellschaft by its shareholders over and above the capital stock, on the basis of their ownership relationship.\n\n## Hybrid capital\n\nThe hybrid capital recognized in equity in the amount of EUR 2,483 mn consists of perpetual, subordinated hybrid notes. According to IFRS, the net proceeds of the hybrid notes are fully treated as equity because the repayment of the principal and the payments of interest are solely at the discretion of OMV.\n\nOn December 7, 2015, OMV issued hybrid notes with an aggregate principal amount of EUR 1,500 mn, in two tranches of EUR 750 mn:\n\n- \u25b8 The hybrid notes of tranche 1, with the first call date in 2021, were called and redeemed at their principal amount (plus interest accrued) on November 30, 2021.\n- \u25b8 The hybrid notes of tranche 2 bear a fixed interest rate of 6.250% per annum until, but excluding, December 9, 2025, which is the first call date of tranche 2. From December 9, 2025 (including), tranche 2 will bear an interest rate per annum at the relevant five-year swap rate for the relevant interest period plus a specified margin and a step-up of 100 basis points.\n\nInterest is due and payable annually in arrears on December 9 of each year, unless OMV elects to defer the relevant interest payments. The outstanding deferred interest must be paid under certain circumstances, in particular, if the Annual General Meeting of OMV resolves upon a dividend payment on OMV shares.\n\nOn June 19, 2018 OMV issued a hybrid bond with a principal amount of EUR 500 mn. The hybrid bond bears a fixed interest rate of 2.875% per annum until, but excluding, June 19, 2024. From June 19, 2024 (including), until, but excluding, June 19, 2028, the hybrid notes will bear interest at a rate corresponding to the relevant five-year swap rate plus a specified margin. From June 19, 2028 (including), the notes will bear an interest rate per annum at the relevant five-year swap rate for the relevant interest period plus a specified margin and a step-up of 100 basis points. Interest is due and payable annually in arrears on June 19 of each year, unless OMV elects to defer the relevant interest payments. The outstanding deferred interest must be paid under certain circumstances, in particular, if the Annual General Meeting of OMV resolves upon a dividend payment on OMV shares.",

From the first reset date (including), until, but excluding, September 1, 2030, the hybrid notes of tranche 1 will bear interest per annum at a reset interest rate which is determined according to the relevant five-year swap rate plus a specified margin. From September 1, 2030 (including), the hybrid notes of tranche 1 will bear an interest rate per annum at the relevant five-year swap rate for each interest period thereafter plus a specified margin and a step-up of 100 basis points.\n- \u25b8 The hybrid notes of tranche 2 bear a fixed interest rate of 2.875% per annum until, but excluding September 1, 2029, which is the first reset date of tranche 2.

The outstanding deferred interest must be paid under certain circumstances, in particular, if the Annual General Meeting of OMV resolves upon a dividend payment on OMV shares.\n\nThe hybrid notes outstanding as of December 31, 2021 do not have a scheduled maturity date and they may be redeemed at the option of OMV under certain circumstances. OMV has, in particular, the right to repay the hybrid notes at certain call dates. Any accrued unpaid interest becomes payable when the notes are redeemed. In the case of a change of control, for example, OMV may call the hybrid notes for redemption or else the applicable interest rate will be subject to an increase according to the terms and conditions of the hybrid notes.\n\n## Revenue reserves\n\nThe Group's revenue reserves included the net income and losses of consolidated subsidiaries and equity accounted investments, as adjusted for the purposes of consolidation.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nThe Annual General Meetings for the years 2000 to 2011 (with the exception of 2010) and 2019 approved the repurchase of treasury shares. The costs of repurchased shares have been reflected as a reduction in equity. Gains or losses on the re-issue of treasury shares (issue proceeds less acquisition cost) result in an increase or a reduction in capital reserves.\n\nOn May 18, 2016, the Annual General Meeting authorized the Executive Board for a period of five years from the adoption of the resolution, therefore, until (including) May 17, 2021, upon approval of the Supervisory Board, to dispose of or utilize stock repurchased or already held by the Company to grant treasury shares to employees, senior employees and/or members of the Executive Board/management boards of the Company or one of its affiliates including for purposes of share transfer programs, in particular long term incentive plans including matching share plans or other stock ownership plans, under exclusion of the general purchasing possibility of shareholders (exclusion of subscription rights). The authorization can be exercised as a whole or in parts or even in several tranches by the Company, by a subsidiary (section 189a number 7 Austrian Commercial Code) or by third parties for the account of the Company.\n\nOn June 2, 2021 the Annual General Meeting authorized the Executive Board for a period of five years from the adoption of the resolution, therefore, until and including June 1, 2026, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board, to dispose of or utilize repurchased treasury shares or treasury shares already held by the Company to grant to employees, executive employees and/or members of the Executive Board/management boards of the Company or its affiliates including for purposes of share transfer programs, in particular long term incentive plans including equity deferrals or other stock ownership plans, and to thereby exclude the general purchasing right of shareholders (exclusion of subscription rights).

The investment plans in Belgium follow the\n\ninvestment strategy of the respective insurance company as well as local legal regulations.\n\nThe allocation of plan assets was mainly in debt securities and insurance contracts. Except for the insurance contracts, which are not quoted, the majority of plan assets are invested in liquid active markets for which quoted prices are available.\n\nIn 2022, defined benefit related contributions for 2021 to external pension funds of EUR 3 mn are planned.",

The present value of the provision as at December 31, 2021 was EUR 390 mn (2020: EUR 327 mn). The provision represents the unavoidable costs of meeting the contractual obligations. Thereby, income and costs from future purchases and sales of LNG are taken into account, since the regasifi-\n\ncation of LNG and subsequent sale of the gas positively contributes to the coverage of the fixed costs. The volume assumptions are based on management's best estimates of available LNG volumes in the future. The prices are based on forward rates, where available. If no forward prices are available, the prices represent management's best estimate of future prices, derived from current market prices or forward rates of the preceding period. The calculation is based on an interest rate of 4.51% (2020: 3.96%). A 50% decrease in LNG margin would lead to an additional provision of EUR 135 mn, a 50% decrease in LNG volumes to an additional provision of EUR 106 mn. Furthermore, a 1 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would lead to an additional provision of EUR 25 mn.\n\nAs per end of 2021, the provision for the related noncancellable transportation commitments of OMV Gas Marketing & Trading GmbH amounted to EUR 65 mn (2020: EUR 68 mn). The calculation is based on the difference between the fixed costs for using the capacities",

Besides the discount rates, the key assumptions are the gas prices at the relevant gas hubs which are based on forward rates where available and on management's best estimates for the remaining contract term.\n\nOther personnel provisions included short-term provisions related to personnel reduction schemes of EUR 17 mn (2020: EUR 29 mn).The remaining amount was mainly related to boni provisions.\n\n## Emissions certificates\n\nDirective 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the European Council established a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme, requiring member states to draw up national plans to allocate emissions certificates. Under this scheme, affected OMV Group companies are entitled to yearly allocation of free emissions certificates.\n\nThe New Zealand Government established a greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme under the Climate Change Response Act 2002. Under this scheme New Zealand companies are not entitled to receive free emission certificates. OMV has purchased certificates to meet its own use liability. Apart from purchased certificates, each sale of gas to domestic customers in\n\nNew Zealand creates an obligation for OMV. OMV receives units of emission certificates from customers to meet this obligation.\n\nIn Germany, the fuel emissions trading act (BEHG; Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz) came into force on December 20, 2019, and is the basis for German national certificate trading scheme for emissions from fossil fuels. It obliges the distributors - suppliers who deliver to end customers and/or who take the fuel from the pipeline network (origin of energy tax) - of fuels to acquire CO2 emission certificates from January 1, 2021 onwards. According to Section 38 (2) of the Energy Tax Act, the tax debtor is the supplier; therefore, all companies in possession of an energy tax supplier's certificate are to be considered as distributors. Unlike under European Trading Scheme, certificates under BEHG are not eligible for trading and are not freely allocated, but have to be purchased from the German Emissions Trading Authority (DEHSt; Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle).\n\nIn 2022 OMV expects to surrender 10,143,712 emissions certificates from European Trading Scheme, 3,834,557 BEHG certificates and 2,802,025 NZ certificates for (not yet externally verified) emissions, out of which 2,424,921 emissions certificates are expected to be transferred to OMV from customers in New Zealand.\n\n## Emissions certificates\n\n|                                         | 2021                      | 2021                | 2021                | 2020                      | 2020                |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|\n|                                         | European  Trading  Scheme | NZ  Trading  Scheme | DE  Trading  Scheme | European  Trading  Scheme | NZ  Trading  Scheme |\n| Certificates held as of January 1       | 12,210,093                | 111,798             | -                   | 9,331,156                 | 106,211             |\n| Free allocation for the year            | 5,891,495                 | -                   | -                   | 3,038,336                 | -                   |\n| Certificates surrendered 1              | (10,794,999)              | (2,883,744)         | -                   | (6,602,598)               | (5,635,404)         |\n| Changes in consolidated Group           | -                         | -                   | -                   | 5,310,058                 | -                   |\n| Net purchases and sales during the year | 4,424,111                 | 1,150,465           | 3,617,321           | 1,133,141                 | 444,172             |\n| Certificates received from customers    | -                         | 1,873,155           | -                   | -                         | 5,196,819           |\n| Certificates held as of December 31     | 11,730,700                | 251,674             | 3,617,321           | 12,210,093                | 111,798             |",

Under the arrangement, the bank agrees to pay amounts to a supplier participating in the program in respect of invoices owed by the Group and receives settlement from OMV later. The principal purpose of those programs is to facilitate efficient payment processing and enable the\n\nconsenting suppliers to sell their receivables due from OMV to a bank before their maturity. The Group has not derecognized the majority of original liabilities to which the arrangement applies because neither legal release was obtained nor the original liability was substantially modified while entering into the arrangement. Most liabilities remain within trade payables and other financial liabilities until payment. From OMV's perspective, these arrangements do not significantly extend payment terms beyond the normal terms agreed with other suppliers that are not participating in the programs. Consequently, cash effects are included in the cashflow from operating activities.",

Management is of the opinion that litigations, to the extent not covered by provisions or insurance, will not materially affect the Group's financial position.\n\nThe production facilities and properties of all Group companies are subject to a variety of environmental protection laws and regulations in the countries where they operate. The estimated cost of known environmental obligations has been provided in accordance with the Group's accounting policies. Provisions for decommissioning and restoration are recognized if an obligation exists at the statement of financial position date.\n\nManagement believes that compliance with current laws and regulations and future more stringent laws and regulations will not have a material negative impact on the Group's results, financial position or cash flows in the near future.\n\nFinancing commitments provided to related parties are detailed in Note 35 - Related parties.\n\nIn May 2009, OMV signed an agreement with the sellers Crescent Petroleum International Limited (Crescent) and Dana Gas PJSC (Dana) to acquire a 10% share in Pearl Petroleum Company Limited (Pearl), a company that holds a contract over and operates Khor Mor and Chemchemal gas fields in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. The agreement included contingent payments to be made by OMV which are dependent on further reserves determinations (Earn Out Payments). The reserves determinations will have to be made by a jointly appointed independent expert.\n\nIn this connection, in May 2019, OMV received an invoice from Crescent and Dana amounting to approximately USD 241 mn and later unsubstantiated and rejected allegations of damages in an amount of up to more than one billion USD. OMV rejected the invoice due to at the time pending independent expert determination before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and two arbitrations before the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA): one arbitration under",

In Februay 2020, a second independent expert determination was initiated by Crescent and Dana before the ICC in respect of another revision of the Chemchemal FDP. The two independent expert determinations before the ICC have been decided in favor of OMV and concluded that the respective Chemchemal FDP's were not compliant with the criteria in the JVA. In December 2021, the LCIA also ruled in OMV's favor in respect of JVA Arbitration and all claims from Crescent and Dana against OMV in respect of damages under the JVA were rejected. The SSA Arbitration is in progress.Depending on further progress of the SSA arbitration proceedings and not yet commenced reserve determinations under the SSA, a contingent payment could potentially arise; however, such event is not deemed probable at this stage, claims for unjustified enrichment are deemed even less probable. OMV's position is further strengthened by the recent LCIA decision in JVA Arbitration in favor of OMV. Therefore, no provision has been recognized in OMV's Group Financial Statements. Furthermore, at the date of these financial statements, a reliable estimate of the potential additional payment, if any, cannot be made.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the Bulgarian Commission for Protection of Competition announced the initiation of an investigation regarding the determination of the prices on\n\nfuel market. OMV Bulgaria EOOD is subject to this investigation, among other major manufacturers and retailers on Bulgarian market. During 2020 two requests of providing information were received from authorities and the responses were submitted in due time. There were no additional requests from authorities in 2021, but the investigation is not yet finalized. The sanctions for antitrust infringements are up to 10% of the total company's turnover of the respective undertaking for the financial year prior to the sanctioning decision. At the date of these financial statements,OMV is not able to evaluate the outcome of the investigation and no provision was recorded in this respect.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, one other proceeding was pending against OMV related to local service contractors in one of the subsidiaries. OMV's share of claimed amount is around USD 330 mn. Management currently does not believe that any of the alleged matters will have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations. However, this assessment is based on assumptions deemed reasonable by management including those about future events and uncertainties. The outcome of these matters is ultimately uncertain, such that unanticipated events and circumstances might occur that might cause management to change those assumptions and give rise to a material adverse\n\neffect on our financial position in the future.",

With the focus on strengthening OMV's balance sheet, delivering a positive free cash flow and growing its profitability, the financial steering framework represents sustainable, risk-monitored and future-oriented value creation for OMV and its stakeholders.\n\nOMV manages its capital structure to safeguard its capital base in order to preserve investor, creditor and market confidence, as well as to provide a sustainable financial foundation for the future operational development of the Group. OMV's financing strategy focuses on cash flow and financial stability. Principal targets are a positive free cash flow after dividends and a strong investment grade credit rating on the basis of a healthy balance sheet and a long-term gearing ratio, excluding leases, of below 30%.\n\n## Capital Management - key performance measures\n\n| In EUR mn (unless otherwise stated)   |        |        |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|                                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n| Bonds                                 | 8,070  | 8,869  |\n| Other interest-bearing debts 1        | 1,765  | 2,130  |\n| Debt excluding leases                 | 9,835  | 10,999 |\n| Cash and cash equivalents 2           | 5,064  | 2,869  |\n| Net Debt excluding leases             | 4,771  | 8,130  |\n| Equity                                | 21,996 | 19,899 |\n| Gearing Ratio excluding leases in %   | 22     | 41     |\n\n- 1 Including other interest-bearing debts that were reclassified to liabilities associated with assets held for sale\n- 2 Including cash and cash equivalents that were reclassified to assets held for sale\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nFor the purpose of assessing liquidity risk, yearly budgeted operating and financial cash flows of the Group are monitored and analyzed on a monthly basis. Thus, every month the Group generates a forecasted net change in liquidity which is then compared to the total month end balances of money market deposits and loans as well as maturities of the current portfolio and the available liquidity reserves of the same month. This analysis provides the basis for financing decisions and capital commitments.\n\nTo ensure that OMV Group remains solvent at all times and retains the necessary financial flexibility, liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit lines and short term uncommitted money market lines are maintained. As of December 31, 2021, the average weighted maturity of the Group's debt portfolio (excluding lease liabilities) has been 5.1 years (as of December 31, 2020: 5.3 years).\n\nOMV Group's operational liquidity management is done centrally via a cash pooling system, which enables optimum use of existing cash and liquidity reserves to the benefit of every individual member of cash pooling system and therefore the Group as a whole.\n\nDetails of OMV Group's financial liabilities are shown in Note 24 - Liabilities.\n\n## Market risk\n\nDerivative and non-derivative instruments are used to manage market price risks resulting from changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, which could have a negative effect on assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.\n\nHedges are generally placed in the legal entities where the underlying exposure exists. When certain conditions are met, the Group may elect to apply IFRS 9 hedge accounting principles in order to recognize the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments at the same time as the hedged items.\n\nDerivatives are only used for economic hedging purposes and not as speculative investments. However, where derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments (i.e. hedge accounting is not applied), they are valued through profit or loss for accounting purposes.\n\nThe tables hereafter show the fair values of derivative financial instruments together with their notional amounts.

European Emission Allowance purchases are always executed in due time and it is OMV's highest priority to fulfill all legal obligations under the ETS. OMV monitors price risks from emission allowances and manages it using derivative instruments (spots and forwards) traded billaterally on the secondary market (so-called over-the-counter or OTC transactions).\n\n## Exploration & Production\n\nIn order to protect the Group's result and cash flow from the potential negative impact of falling oil and gas prices as well as to ensure sufficient liquidity headroom in order to enable the Group's growth strategy, OMV uses financial derivatives to secure favorable oil and gas prices from time to time. When doing so, OMV enters into derivative positions selling forward parts of its future production, thereby locking in future oil and gas prices and reducing exposure to market prices in the periods for which the hedges are concluded. OMV Group adopts a flexible approach to monetize hedges\n\nprior to their maturity with the aim to generate a positive contribution to the results.\n\nIn 2021, oil and gas derivative contracts were concluded, resulting in a total negative Operating result impact of EUR (675) mn (oil: EUR (82) mn, gas: EUR (594) mn).\n\nIn 2020, oil and gas derivative contracts were entered into, resulting in a total negative Operating result impact of EUR (37) mn (oil: EUR (30) mn, gas: EUR (7) mn).\n\nFor these derivative instruments no hedge accounting was applied.\n\n## Refining & Marketing\n\nCommodity price risk management in Refining and Marketing refers to analysis, assessment, reporting and hedging of market price risk exposure arising from nontrading and trading activities, covering refining (refinery margin, inventories up to a defined threshold) as well as oil and gas marketing activities (marketing margin, inventories up to a defined threshold) and producing power (spark spreads) in addition to proprietary trading positions.",

        "page_content": "Limited proprietary trading activities are performed for the purpose of creating market access within the oil, power and gas markets. In Gas trading, OTC swaps, options, futures and forwards are used to hedge purchase and sales price risks. The aim is to hedge the price risk on inventory fluctuations and the differences in terms and conditions of purchases and sales.\n\nIn Refining and Marketing, derivative instruments are used for both hedging selected product sales and reducing exposure to price risks on inventory fluctuations. Crude oil and product swaps are used to hedge the refining margin (crack spread), which is the difference between crude oil prices and bulk product prices.\n\nFurthermore, exchange-traded oil futures as well as OTC contracts (contracts for difference and swaps) are used to hedge short-term purchase and sales market price risks.\n\nSwaps do not involve an investment at the time the contracts are concluded; settlement normally takes place at the end of the quarter or month. The premiums on options are payable when the contract is concluded; where options are exercised, payment of the difference between strike price and average market price for the period takes place at contract expiration.\n\n## Chemicals & Materials\n\nFor the chemical production, some of the forecasted cracker feedstock purchases and finished product sales are hedged through refined oil products swaps. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied to those derivatives, except for the derivatives that are used to limit the price risk on the inventory held for immediate consumption. Contracts not designated as cash flow hedges are classified as fair value through profit or loss and stated at fair value.\n\nBorealis hedges its forecasted electricity purchases using electricity swaps.\n\n## Cash flow hedges in Refining & Marketing and Chemicals & Materials\n\nIn the Refining & Marketing and Chemical & Materials Business, OMV is especially exposed to volatile refining margins and inventory risks. In order to mitigate those risks corresponding hedging activities are taken, which include margin hedges, stock hedges, feedstock and commodity hedges. Additionally, cash flow hedge accounting is applied to forecast electricity purchases and forecast natural gas purchases. Also a part of the hedges done for future sales and purchases of the crackers has been designated as cash flow hedge.\n\nThe risk management strategy is to harmonize the pricing of product sales and purchases in order to remain within an approved range of priced stocks at all times, by means of undertaking stock hedges so as to mitigate the price exposure. The range is a defined maximum deviation from the target stock level, as defined in the Annual Plan for hedging activities.\n\nFurthermore, in respect of refinery margin hedges, crude oil and products are hedged separately, with the aim to protect future margins. Endorsed mandates are documented and defined within the Annual plan for hedging activities.\n\nIn case of refinery margin hedges only the product crack spread is designated as the hedged item, buying Brent Crude Oil on a fixed basis and selling the product on a fixed basis. The crack spread for different products is a separately identifiable component and can therefore represent the specific risk component designated as hedged item. There are limits set for the volume of planned hedged sales to avoid over hedging.\n\nIn 2020 the risk management objective for the refinery margin hedges changed and therefore most of the hedging relationships were discontinued.The accumulated gains and losses remained in the cash flow hedging reserve upon realization of the hedged item. In addition hedge accounting related to forecast sales of specific products has been terminated because cash flows have no longer been expected to occur due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The accumulated gains and losses were immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nStock hedges are used to mitigate price exposure whenever actual priced stock levels deviate from target levels. Forecast sales and purchase transactions for crude oil and oil products are designated as the hedged item. Historically, Brent crude oil has formed the largest risk component of the stock price, however in some cases also oil products are used for stock hedges. In such cases, Platts / Argus product price is used as the risk component. Other components like product crack spreads and other local market cost components are not hedged.\n\nThe hedging relationships are established with a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the commodity derivatives are identical to the hedged risk components. Hedge ineffectiveness can arise from timing differential between derivative and hedged item delivery and pricing differentials (derivatives are valued on the future",

        "page_content": "monthly average price (or other periods) and sales/purchases on the pricing at the date of transaction/delivery).\n\nFor 'Forecast purchases' the hedge ineffectiveness is included in line item 'Purchases (net of inventory variation)' in OMV's Consolidated income statement. The hedge ineffectiveness and recycling of 'Forecast sales' for hedges where a risk component of the non-financial item is designated as the hedged item in the hedging relationship is shown in line item 'Sales revenues' in OMV's Consolidated income statement.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk management\n\nOMV operates in many countries and currencies, therefore industry-specific activities and the corresponding foreign exchange rate risks need to be analyzed precisely. The USD represents OMV's biggest risk exposure, in the form of movement of the USD against the EUR and also against other main OMV Group currencies (RON, RUB, NOK, NZD and SEK). Movements of these currencies against the EUR are also important sources of risk. Other currencies have only a limited impact on cash flow and Operating result. The transaction risk on foreign currency cash flows is monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group's long and short net position is reviewed at least on a semiannual basis and the sensitivity is calculated. This analysis provides the basis for management of transaction risks on currencies. Since OMV produces commodities that are mainly traded in USD, OMV Group has an economic USD long position.\n\nFX options, forwards and swaps are mainly used to hedge foreign exchange rate risks on outstanding receivables and payables. The market value of these instruments will move in the opposite direction to the value of the underlying receivable or liability if the relevant foreign exchange rate changes. When certain conditions are met, the Group may elect to apply IFRS 9 hedge accounting principles in order to recognize the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments at the same time as and the hedged items. Certain hedges which refer to a forecasted currency position are therefore classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\nTranslation risk is also monitored on an ongoing basis at Group level, and the risk position is evaluated. Translation risk arises on the consolidation of subsidiaries with functional currencies different from EUR. The largest exposures result from changes in RON, USD, RUB, NOK, and SEK denominated assets against the EUR.\n\nA foreign currency exposure arises from the Group's long-term net investment in its subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange translation differences relating to these net investments are recognized in other comprehensive income. Borealis has hedged part of its investment in an associated company which has USD as its functional currency, by designating certain external loans in USD as hedges of the Group's investments in its foreign operations. The hedged risk in the net investment hedge is the risk of a weakening USD against the EUR that will result in a reduction in the carrying amount of the Group's net investment in the associated company in USD. The EUR/USD impact on the measurement of the loan is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nTo assess hedge effectiveness, the Group determines the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item by comparing changes in the carrying amount of the debt that is attributable to a change in the spot rate with changes in the investment in the foreign operation due to movements in the spot rate (the dollar-offset method). The Group's policy is to hedge the net investment only to the extent of the debt principal.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the USD borrowing. The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 as the underlying risk of the hedging instrument is identical to the hedged risk component. Hedge ineffectiveness will arise when the amount of the investment in the foreign associated company becomes lower than the amount of the borrowing.\n\n## Interest rate management\n\nTo facilitate management of interest rate risk, OMV's liabilities are analyzed in terms of fixed and floating rate borrowings, currencies and maturities. Appropriate ratios for the various categories are established, and where necessary, derivative instruments are used to hedge fluctuations outside predetermined ranges.\n\nInterest rate swaps can be used to convert fixed rate debt into floating rate debt, and vice versa. In the year 2021 the impact of interest rate swaps has not been material (2020: no material impact).\n\nThe hedge ineffectiveness and recycling of Interest rate swaps are both shown in line item 'interest expenses' in OMV's Consolidated income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Interest rate benchmark reform (IBOR Reform)\n\nThe Group is continuously evaluating contractual terms in respect of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) transition exposures. Where necessary, agreements will be amended to provide for alternative benchmark rates, which shall be in accordance with Loan Market Association (LMA) standard at the time, to apply in relation to the affected currencies.\n\nAs per end of December 2021, for the undrawn multicurrency EUR 1 bn Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) a drawdown waiver is in place for currencies where IBOR rates were discontinued as a Screen Rate from December 31, 2021 (CHF,GBP,JPY). The RCF drawdown waiver shall cease to have effect if the Facility is amended to provide for alternative benchmark rates, which shall be in accordance with LMA standard at a time.\n\nIn addition, a JPY  loan tranche of EUR 38 mn has been successfully transitioned to Tokyo Overnight Average Rate (TONAR).\n\nThe Group considers that it is, in principle, exposed to uncertainties resulting from the interest rate benchmark reform in respect of its hedges of (3 month) USD LIBOR interest risks related to the existence of two outstanding USD interest rate swaps, with a nominal amount of EUR 97 mn in total and a cross currency interest rate swap of EUR 38 mn. Their hedging period spans beyond 2021 when uncertainties about the existence of the USD LIBOR rates arise. OMV Group expects that the hedging instrument and the hedged risk of the hedged item will not change as a result of the reform. However, any hedge ineffectiveness would be accounted for in the income statement.\n\nFor further information in respect of IBOR reform see see Note 2 - Accounting policies, judgements and estimates.\n\n## Impact of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\n| In EUR mn                                                                       | Benchmark    | Carrying Value  (notional amount  for derivatives)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-derivative assets                                                           |              |                                                      |\n| Loan receivable                                                                 | USD LIBOR    | 987                                                  |\n| Non-derivative liabilities                                                      |              |                                                      |\n| Loan liabilities                                                                | USD LIBOR    | 189                                                  |\n| Loan liabilities                                                                | JPY LIBOR    | 38                                                   |\n| Derivatives                                                                     |              |                                                      |\n| Interest rate swap (designated in a hedge relationship)                         | USD LIBOR    | 44                                                   |\n| Interest rate swap (designated in a hedge relationship)                         | USD LIBOR    | 53                                                   |\n|                                                                                 | JPY LIBOR    |                                                      |\n| Cross currency interest rate swap (valued at fair value through profit or loss) | to USD LIBOR | 38                                                   |\n\n## Impact of Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\n| In EUR mn  Undrawn commitments                 |               |       |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------|-------|\n| Financing commitments provided                 |               |       |\n|                                                | USD LIBOR     | 251   |\n| Committed borrowing facilities - available RCF | Multicurrency | 1,000 |\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nFor open hedging contracts sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effect of market price fluctuations (+/-10%) on market value. The sensitivity of OMV Group's overall earnings differs from the sensitivity shown below, since the contracts concluded are used to hedge operational exposures.\n\nThe effect of market price fluctuations on profit or loss or other comprehensive income depends on the type of derivative used and on whether hedge accounting is applied. Market price sensitivity for derivatives to which cash flow hedge accounting is applied is shown in the sensitivity table for other comprehensive income. Sensitivity to market price fluctuations for all other open derivatives is shown in the sensitivity tables for profit before tax.",

On Group level, the EUR-RON sensitivity not only includes the net RON exposure versus the EUR but also the net RON exposure versus the USD, since the USD-RON\n\nexposure can be split into a EUR-RON and EUR-USD exposure. The same is true for the EUR-NOK, EURSEK and EUR-NZD exposure.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis for financial instruments affecting profit before tax 1\n\n|         | In EUR mn                        | In EUR mn                   | In EUR mn                   | In EUR mn   | In EUR mn   | In EUR mn   | In EUR mn                   |\n|---------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------|\n|         | 2021                             | 2021                        | 2020                        | 2020        | 2020        | 2020        | 2020                        |\n|         | 10%  apprecia-  tion of the  EUR | 10%                         | 10%  apprecia-  tion of the |             |             |             | 10%                         |\n|         |                                  | deprecia-  tion of the  EUR |                             |             |             | EUR         | deprecia-  tion of the  EUR |\n| EUR-RON | (2)                              | 2                           | (11)                        |             | 11          | 11          | 11                          |\n| EUR-USD | (114)                            | 114                         |                             | (27)        | 27          | 27          | 27                          |\n| EUR-NZD | (4)                              | 4                           | (4)                         |             | 4           | 4           | 4                           |\n| EUR-NOK | 23                               | (23)                        | (8)                         |             | 8           | 8           | 8                           |\n| EUR-SEK | (6)                              | 6                           |                             | (0)         |             |             | 0                           |\n\n- 1 Refers only to financial instruments and is not the same as the Group's overall foreign exchange rate sensitivity in terms of operating result",

The effect of an interest rate increase of 0.5 percentage points on the financial assets measured at FVTPL as of December 31, 2021, would have been a EUR (4) mn reduction in the market value of these financial assets (2020: EUR (9) mn). A 0.5 percentage points fall in the interest rate as of December 31, 2021 would have led to an increase in market value of EUR 4 mn (2020: EUR 9 mn).\n\nOMV regularly analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on interest income and expense from floating rate deposits and borrowings. Currently the effects of changes in interest rates are not considered to be a material risk.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nThe main counterparty credit risks are assessed and monitored at Group level and Segment level using predetermined criteria and limits for all counterparties, banks and security providers. On the basis of a risk assessment, counterparties, banks and security providers are assigned a credit limit, an internal risk class and a\n\nspecific limit validity. The risk assessments are reviewed at least annually or on an ad-hoc basis. The credit risk processes are governed by guidelines at OMV Group level stipulating the group-wide minimum requirements. The main counterparties with contracts involving derivative financial instruments have investment grade credit ratings. OMV uses commercial trade insurance for parts of its receivables in some business areas to mitigate risk. Based on the high economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, special attention is paid to early warning signals like changes in payment behavior.\n\nCredit risk is the risk that OMV Group's counterparties will not meet their obligation under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from credit exposures with customer accounts receivables (see Note 18 - Financial assets), from its operating activities as well as from its financial activities such as financial investments, including deposits with banks and financial institutions (see Note 26 - Statement of cash flows), foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments (see Note 18 - Financial assets).",

The net column would be on the Group's statement of financial position, if all set-off rights were exercised.\n\nDuring 2021 OMV has updated its assessment of IAS 32.42 netting criteria further to a legal assessment of the major agreements in place.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets\n\n|                                  | Note   | Financial  instruments  (gross)   | Amounts set  off in the  statement of  financial  position   | Financial  instruments in  the statement  of financial  position (net)   | Liabilities with  right of set-off  (not offset)   | Net   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------|\n|                                  |        | 2021                              | 2021                                                         | 2021                                                                     | 2021                                               | 2021  |\n| Derivative financial instruments | 18     | 21,462                            | (16,844)                                                     | 4,619                                                                    | (1,421)                                            | 3,197 |\n| Trade receivables                | 18     | 6,998                             | (2,480)                                                      | 4,518                                                                    | (107)                                              | 4,411 |\n| Other sundry financial assets    | 18     | 2,231                             | (97)                                                         | 2,135                                                                    | (104)                                              | 2,031 |\n| Total                            |        | 30,691                            | (19,420)                                                     | 11,271                                                                   | (1,633)                                            | 9,639 |\n|                                  |        | 2020                              | 2020                                                         | 2020                                                                     | 2020                                               | 2020  |\n| Derivative financial instruments | 18     | 2,573                             | -

        "page_content": "## 32  Share based payments\n\n## Long Term Incentive (LTI) plans\n\nLTI plans with similar conditions are granted annually to the Executive Board and selected senior managers in the Group. At vesting date, shares will be granted to the participants. The number of shares is determined depending on the achievement of defined performance criteria. The defined performance criteria may not be amended during the performance period of the LTI plans. However - in order to maintain the incentivizing character of the program - the Remuneration Committee will have discretion (until LTI Plan 2020 for the Executive Board) to adjust the threshold/ target/maximum levels of the free cash flow in case of material changes in external factors such as oil and gas prices. The adjustment is possible in both directions and will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. The Executive Board has the discretion to adjust the thresholds/targets/maximum levels of the free cash flow for Senior Managers accordingly. Disbursement is made in cash or in shares. Executive Board members and senior managers as active participants of the plans are required to build up an appropriate volume of shares and to hold those shares until retirement or departure from the company. For senior managers, if the LTIP eligibility lapses, but they are still in an active employment with the company, the shareholding requirement expires when the last LTIP is paid out. The shareholding requirement is defined as a percentage of the annual\n\ngross base salary, for the Executive Board, and as a percentage of the respective Target LongTerm Incentive for the senior managers. Executive Board members have to fulfill the shareholding requirement within five years after the initial respective appointment. Until fulfillment of the shareholding requirement the disbursement is in form of shares whilst thereafter the plan participants can decide between cash or share settlement. As long as the shareholding requirements are not fulfilled the granted shares after deduction of taxes are transferred to a trustee deposit, managed by the Company.\n\nFor share-based payments the grant date fair values are spread as expenses over the three years performance period with a corresponding increase in shareholders' equity. In case of assumed cash-settlements a provision is made for the expected future costs of the LTI plans at statement of financial position date based on fair values.\n\nIn 2021 Borealis introduced a LTI plan, which is harmonized with the above described LTI Plan. The shareholding requirement is only applicable to the Executive Board members of Borealis and not to senior managers.",

The holding period of the Equity Deferral is three years from vesting. The plan also seeks to prevent inadequate risk-taking.\n\nThe Annual Bonus is capped at 180% of the target Annual Bonus (until 2017: 200% of the annual gross salary). A minimum of one third of the Annual Bonus (until 2017: 50% of the granted Annual Bonus) is granted in shares. The determined bonus achievement is settled per March 31 following the period end whereby at the\n\nstatement of financial position date the target achievements and the share price is estimated (the latter on basis of market quotes). In case of major changes in external factors such as oil and gas prices the Remuneration Committee can adjust the threshold, target and/or maximum levels (but not the criteria as such nor the vesting) for the Financial Targets of the Annual Bonus. The granted shares after deduction of taxes are transferred to a trustee deposit, managed by the Company, to be held for three years.\n\nIn 2021 expenses amounting to EUR 3 mn were recorded with a corresponding increase in equity (2020: EUR 1 mn).",

A large number of other OMV employees also benefit from these two forms of insurance, and the insurers levy lump-sum premiums, which are not specifically attributed to the Board members.\n\n## 36  Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nOMV is selling trade receivables in a securitization program to Carnuntum DAC, based in Dublin, Ireland. In 2021, OMV transferred trade receivables amounting in total to EUR 4,573 mn to Carnuntum DAC (2020: EUR 3,458 mn).\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, OMV held seller participation notes amounting to EUR 95 mn (2020: EUR 88 mn) and complementary notes amounting to EUR 89 mn (2020: nil) in Carnuntum DAC shown in other financial assets. As of December 31, 2021, the maximum exposure to loss from the securitization transaction was EUR 110 mn (2020: EUR 80 mn).\n\nSee Note 32 - Shared based payments - for details on Long Term Incentive Plans and Equity Deferral.\n\nIn 2021, remuneration expenses for the Supervisory Board amounted to EUR 0.6 mn (2020: EUR 0.6 mn).\n\nThe seller participation notes are senior to a loss reserve and a third party investor participation. The complementary notes are senior to seller participation notes and are of the same seniority as the senior notes issued by the program. The risk retained by OMV Group is insignificant and therefore the trade receivables sold are derecognized in their entirety. The receivables are sold at their nominal amount less a discount. The discount was recognized in profit or loss and amounted in total to EUR 29 mn in 2021 (2020: EUR 21 mn). Interest income on the notes held in Carnuntum DAC amounted to EUR 2 mn in 2021 (2020: EUR 2 mn). In addition, OMV received a service fee for the debtor management services provided for the receivables sold.",

The bill stipulates the reduction in corporate income tax rate from 25% to 24% in 2023 and further to 23% from 2024 onward. Had the new tax rates been substantially enacted as of December 31, 2021, the Group's deferred tax assets would have decreased by EUR 42 mn.\n\nOn February 2, 2022, Borealis Group has received a binding offer from EuroChem for the acquisition of Borealis' nitrogen business including fertilizer, melamine and technical nitrogen products. The offer values the business on an enterprise value basis at EUR 455 mn. Borealis Group will initiate mandatory information and consultation procedures with employee representatives. The transaction is also subject to certain closing conditions and regulatory approvals, with closing expected for the second half of 2022. Borealis Group will continue to focus on its core activities of providing innovative and sustainable solutions in the fields of polyolefins and base chemicals and on the transformation towards a circular economy.\n\nOn February 15, 2022, the Iraqi Federal Supreme Court passed the Judgment that the Kurdistan Regional Oil & Gas Law (KROGL) of 2007 violates certain Articles of Iraq's Constitution of 2005. The Judgment contradicts earlier analysis and also rulings. The Judgment challenges Kurdistan Regional Government's (KRG's) authority to enter into Oil and Gas Contracts with foreign parties and grants the Federal Ministry of Oil a right to follow up with foreign parties the way forward for these Contracts entered into. It is unclear how the Federal Government and KRG will proceed in respect of the above and settle this dispute. OMV is in process of assessing the matter, and it is too early to determine any implications on OMV's 10% shareholding in Pearl Petroleum Company Limited.\n\nOn February 21, 2022, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia signed decrees recognizing two pro-Russian breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Consequently, the European Union (EU), the United States of America (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) responded with targeted sanctions on Russian individuals and the Russian financial system. As a direct consequence, Germany halted the certification process of Nord Stream 2. One day later, the US announced sanctions targeting Nord Stream 2 AG and its corporate officers.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, Russia started a broad offensive in Ukraine with simultaneous attacks across various areas. The EU, the US and the UK imposed further sanctions including financing restrictions targeting certain Russian banks and state-owned companies like Gazprom. The EU announced the resolution on enactment of additional and more severe sanctions for Russia, specifically targeting inter alia the Russian banking system, Russian individuals and the energy and transport sectors. Gas supplies continued without interruption in line with the existing contractual obligations.\n\nRussia continued the widespread attacks across Ukraine and intensified the attacks during the following days. The EU imposed sanctions against Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov and announced further sanctions including but not limited to provision of loans and credits to certain listed banks and companies some of which are active in the oil business (like Gazprom Neft). The EU, the US and the UK decided to exclude seven banks from the SWIFT-System.\n\nOn March 1, 2022, the Executive Board of OMV has decided to not further pursue negotiations with Gazprom on the potential acquisition of a 24.98% interest in the Achimov 4A/5A phase development in the Urengoy gas and condensate field and to terminate the Basic Sale Agreement dated October 3, 2018. Furthermore, OMV will review its involvement in the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.\n\nIn light of further sanctions, Russia announced countersanctions, in particular restrictions on dividend payments to foreign shareholders in Russian companies.\n\nOn March 4, 2022, the US, the EU and the UK imposed further property blocking sanctions on individuals and Russia enacted countersanctions including inter alia restrictions on sales of shares open or closed joint-stock companies. Russia also announced property blocking sanctions against foreign individuals and companies.\n\nOn March 5, 2022, the Executive Board of OMV took the decision not to pursue any future investments in Russia. The 24.99% interest in Yuzhno Russkoye will be subject to a strategic review. This review comprises all options including possibilities to divest or exit. As a consequence, OMV expects non-cash value adjustments of EUR 0.5 - 0.8 bn (as of December 31, 2021). In addition, OMV will recognize a non-cash value adjustment charge of EUR 987 mn (loan plus accrued in-",

While OMV does not have operations in Ukraine, OMV has business relationships with Russian entities and shareholdings in Russia.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, OMV reported the following net asset values related to Russian operations:\n\n## Net assets\n\n|                                  | In EUR mn   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|\n|                                  | 2021        |\n| Nord Stream 2 Loan               | 987         |\n| Reserve Redetermination Rights 1 | 432         |\n| JSC GAZPROM YRGM Development 1   | 650         |\n| OJSC SEVERNEFTEGAZPROM 1         | 117         |\n| Total Net Assets                 | 2,185       |\n\n- 1 related to Yuzhno Russkoye gas field in West Sibiria\n\nDisruptions in Russian commodity flows to Europe could result in further increases in European energy prices and accelerate the risk of cost inflation. OMV imported on average 7.34 TWh per month of natural gas under a long-term supply agreement with Gazprom to the German and Austrian gas hubs in 2021. From today's point of view, OMV does not expect natural gas exports from Russia to stop. In the unlikely event of short-term gas supply disruptions from Russia, OMV\n\ncan use the remaining gas in storage to supply customers and has access to other liquid gas market hubs in Europe. OMV has formed a Group Emergency Management Team (GEMT). This internal unit spans all relevant business areas and functions. The GEMT monitors, analyses and constantly assesses the latest situation in order to take any necessary decisions quickly and implement any measures without delay.",

Proved oil and gas reserves were estimated based on a 12-month average price, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements.\n\nProved developed reserves are those proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing\n\nwells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the costs of the required equipment are relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well and through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate. It should be reasonably certain that the required future expenditure will be made to safeguard existing equipment within the current budget.\n\nProved undeveloped reserves are those proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion or substantial new investment is required in order to safeguard or replace ageing facilities.",

Future development costs include the estimated costs of development drilling and installation of production facilities. For all three categories year-end costs without consideration of inflation are assumed. Future income tax payments are calculated on the basis of the income tax rate applicable in each of the countries in which the Group operates. The present cash value results from\n\nthe discounting of the future net cash flow at a discount rate of 10% per year. The standardized measure does not purport to be an estimate of the fair value of the Group's proven reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, amongst many other factors, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves, anticipated changes in future prices and costs as well as a discount factor representative of the risks inherent in the production of oil and gas.\n\nStandardized measure of discounted future net cash flows\n\nIn EUR mn\n\n|                                                            | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   | Subsidiaries and equity-accounted investments   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                            | Romania  and Black  Sea                         | Austria                                         |                                                 | Russia  North Sea                               | Middle  East and  Africa                        | New  Zealand  and  Australia                    | Malaysia                                        | Total                                           |\n|                                                            | 2021                                            | 2021                                            | 2021                                            | 2021                                            | 2021                                            | 2021                                            | 2021                                            | 2021                                            |\n| Subsidiaries                                               |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |\n| Future cash inflows                                        | 17,585                                          | 3,336                                           | 2,625                                           | 5,608                                           | 16,545                                          | 1,905                                           | 1,433                                           | 49,038                                          |\n| Future production and decommis- sioning costs              | (9,221)                                         | (1,612)                                         | (2,148)                                         | (2,293)                                         | (5,419)                                         | (1,647)                                         | (490)                                           | (22,831)                                        |\n| Future development costs                                   | (1,422)                                         | (246)                                           | -

        "page_content": "## Consolidated Report on the Payments Made to Governments\n\n## Section 267c of the Austrian Commercial Code\n\nSection 267c of the Austrian Commercial Code (UGB) requires that large undertakings and public interest entities that are active in the extractive industry or logging of primary forests prepare the following consolidated report on payments to governments. This section implements Chapter 10 of the EU Accounting Directive (2013/34/EU). The 'Basis of preparation' paragraph provides information to the reader about the contents of the report. This also includes information on the type of payment for which disclosure is required and how OMV has implemented the regulations in the preparation of the report.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\n## Reporting entities\n\nUnder the requirements of the regulation, OMV Aktiengesellschaft is required to prepare a consolidated report covering payments made to governments for each financial year in relation to extractive activities by itself and any subsidiary undertakings included in the consolidated Group financial statements.\n\n## Activities within the scope of the report\n\nPayments made by OMV Group (hereafter OMV) to governments that arose from exploration, prospection, discovery, development, and extraction of minerals, oils, and natural gas deposits or other materials within extractive activities are presented in this report.\n\n## Government\n\nA 'government' is defined as any national, regional or local authority of a country and includes a department agency or entity undertaking that is controlled by the government authority and includes national oil companies.\n\nIn cases where a state-owned entity engages in activities outside its designated home jurisdiction, then it is not deemed to be a reportable governmental body for these purposes and thus payments made to such an entity in these circumstances are not reportable.\n\n## Project definition\n\nThe regulation also requires payments to be reported on a 'project' basis as well as on a government and governmental body basis. A project is defined as the operational activities that are governed by a single contract, license, lease, concession, or similar legal agreement and form the basis for payment liabilities to the government. Where these agreements as per the aforementioned definition are substantially interconnected, these agreements are treated for the purpose of these regulations as a single project.\n\n'Substantially interconnected' is defined as a set of operationally and geographically integrated contracts, licenses, leases, concessions, or related agreements with substantially similar terms that are signed with a government, giving rise to payment liabilities. Such agreements can be governed by a single contract, joint venture agreement, production sharing agreement or other overarching legal agreement.\n\nThere may be instances, for example, corporate income taxes, where it is not possible to attribute the payment to a single project and therefore these payments are shown at the country level.\n\n## Cash and payments in kind\n\nIn accordance with the regulation, payments have to be reported on a cash basis. This means that they are reported in the period in which they are paid and not in the period in which they are accounted for on an accruals basis.\n\nRefunds are also reported in the period in which they are received and will either be offset against payments made in the period or be shown as negative amounts in the report.\n\nPayments in kind made to a government are converted to an equivalent cash value based on the most appropriate and relevant valuation method for each payment type. This can be at cost or market value and an explanation is provided in the report to help explain the valuation method. Where applicable, the related volumes are also included in the report.\n\n## Payment reporting methodology\n\nThe regulation requires that payments are to be reported where they are made to governments by OMV. It is required that the report reflect the substance of each transaction and activity. Based on these requirements, OMV has considered its reporting obligation as:",

The report will show both the value and volume of the government's production entitlement for the relevant period in barrels of oil equivalent (boe).\n\nThe government share of any production entitlement will also include any entitlements arising from an interest held by a state-owned entity as an investor in projects within its sovereign jurisdiction. Production entitlements arising from activities or interests outside a stateowned entity's sovereign jurisdiction are excluded.\n\n## Taxes\n\nTaxes levied on income, production or profits of companies are reported. Refunds will be netted against payments and shown accordingly. Consumption taxes, personal income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes and environmental taxes are not reported under the regulation. Although there is a tax group in place, the reported corporate income taxes for Austria relate entirely to the extractive activities in Austria of OMV's subsidiaries, with no amounts being reported relating to OMV's nonextractive activities in Austria.\n\n## Royalties\n\nRoyalties relating to the extraction of oil, gas and minerals paid to a government are to be disclosed. Where royalties are paid in kind, the value and volume are reported.\n\n## Dividends\n\nIn accordance with the regulations, dividends are reported when paid to a government in lieu of production entitlements or royalties. Dividends that are paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder are not reported, as long as the dividends are paid on the same terms as that of other shareholders.\n\nFor the year that ended December 31, 2021, OMV had no such reportable dividend payments to a government.\n\n## Bonuses\n\nBonuses include signature, discovery and production bonuses in each case to the extent paid in relation to the relevant activities.\n\n## Fees\n\nThese include license fees, rental fees, entry fees and all other payments that are paid in consideration for access to the area where extractive activities are performed.\n\nThe report excludes fees paid to a government that are not specifically related to extractive activities or access to extractive resources. In addition, payments paid in return for services provided by a government are also excluded.\n\n## Infrastructure improvements\n\nThe report includes payments made by OMV for infrastructural improvements, such as the building of a road or bridge that serves the community, irrespective of whether OMV pays the amounts to non-government entities. These are reported in the period during which the infrastructure is made available for use by the local community.",

As SNGP is an associated company and therefore accounted for using the equity method in the OMV Group Consolidated Financial Statements, it does not meet the definition of a reporting entity in the context of the Austrian Commercial Code.\n\nOn January 31, 2019, OMV and Sapura Energy Berhad closed the agreement to form a strategic partnership. The new entity, SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn. Bhd., and\n\nits subsidiaries are fully consolidated in OMV's Group financial statements.\n\nThere were no major acquisitions during 2021.\n\nAs per May 14, 2021, OMV Petrom finalized the sale of its 100% share in Kom-Munai LLP and Tasbulat Oil Corporation LLP (both based in Aktau, Kazakhstan).\n\nOn August 1, 2021, SapuraOMV Upstream Sdn. Bhd. sold its share in SapuraOMV Upstream (PM) Inc., which held interests in various producing assets located offshore Peninsular Malaysia.\n\nOf the seven payment types that are required by the Austrian regulations to be reported upon, OMV did not pay any dividends or infrastructure improvements that met the defined accounting directive definition, and therefore these categories are not shown.",

In volatile energy markets, measurement of the costs of petroleum products sold based on historical values (e.g., weighted average cost) can have distorting effects on reported results (Operating Result, net income, etc.). The amount disclosed as CCS effect represents the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a weighted average basis (adjusted for the change in valuation allowances related to net realizable value) and the charge based on the current cost of supply. The current cost of supply is calculated monthly using data from supply and production systems at the Refining & Marketing level.\n\n## CEE\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe\n\n## CEGH\n\nCentral European Gas Hub\n\ncf\n\nStandard cubic feet (60 \u00b0F/16 \u00b0C)\n\n## CGU\n\nCash generating unit\n\n## Clean CCS EPS\n\nClean CCS Earnings Per Share are calculated as clean CCS net income attributable to stockholders divided by weighted number of shares.\n\n## Clean CCS net income attributable to stockholders\n\nNet income attributable to stockholders, adjusted for the after-tax effect of special items and CCS\n\n## Clean CCS Operating Result\n\nOperating Result adjusted for special items and CCS effects.
