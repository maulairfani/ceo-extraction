Thanks to its robust and balanced business model, coupled with the strategic choices made over the past few years, the Group has come through the crisis remarkably well and continued its virtuous path. The exceptional financial performance achieved in 2021-a combination of very strong sales growth, market share gains and a record increase in profitability-enables us to pursue our dynamic shareholder return policy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has again made huge progress in sustainable development, gender equality and inclusion. It is vital to continue accelerating in tackling today's huge environmental and societal challenges. This is what we do particularly with L'Or\u00e9al for the Future. This/uni00A0programme, launched during the pandemic, aims/uni00A0at a/uni00A0more radical transformation of our company towards being an ever more exemplary, responsible, and supportive corporate citizen.\n\nThis dual excellence-financial performance and environmental, social, and societal exemplarity-forms the backbone of our strategy.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors and myself, I would like to warmly thank and congratulate each and every one of L'Or\u00e9al's 85,400 employees. It is they who-through their quality, creativity, engagement, and desire to act responsibly-create lasting, shared value.\n\n2021 was also a year of change with regards to governance and shareholder structure, in order to/uni00A0strengthen L'Or\u00e9al's position in the years to come.\n\nFollowing the dissociation of the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer, in May Nicolas Hieronimus became in May the sixth CEO in L'Or\u00e9al's 112-year history. The transition, prepared long in advance, took place seamlessly and in the spirit of continuity, true to the tradition of our company. The two roles are complementary and clearly defined. As Chairman, I will oversee the definition of the strategic orientations and ensure e/ffective governance. I am particularly honoured to continue serving the company I have devoted my life to.\n\nI am convinced that our commitment to continuously improving our governance will be a fundamental asset for the Group in the long term. In this regard, receiving the 2021 Grand Prix Award for Corporate Governance from l'AGEFI is a source of great pride and encourages us to intensify our e/fforts.\n\nAnother strategic milestone was the reinforcement of the shareholder stability around the Bettencourt Meyers founding family and Nestl\u00e9. The agreement, approved by the Board, for the repurchase by L'Or\u00e9al of 4% of its capital held by Nestl\u00e9, is in the interest of L'Or\u00e9al and all its shareholders.\n\nI have immense confidence in L'Or\u00e9al's future. Driven by the vision, talent, and commitment of Nicolas Hieronimus and all our teams, a new era of the L'Or\u00e9al Adventure is beginning.\n\nIt truly promises to be remarkable.",

As the world's leading beauty company, we continued to drive the market with strong innovations. One of the most interesting things to note is/uni00A0our balanced business model and our unique portfolio of brands.\n\nOur success can also be explained by our virtuous growth model. We continued to invest in our brands and in game-changing innovations, despite all the uncertainties of the market, fuelling more growth while still delivering on profit. In addition, we saw incredible agility and outstanding results from our teams. And, we continued to leverage our digital edge. We accelerated in e-commerce, optimised consumer engagement in the new O+O (2) world and reinvented beauty experiences.\n\n- (1) Like-for-like: based on comparable structures and identical exchange rates.\n- (2) O/ffline + Online.\n- (3) New technologies for the beauty industry.\n- (4) Artificial intelligence.\n\nI am confident in the continued growth of the beauty market. In the years to come, this/uni00A0growth will be further driven by expanding middle classes and increased premiumization. L'Or\u00e9al will continue its transformation to become a Beauty Tech (3) powerhouse. By harnessing the power of data, AI (4) and strategic tech partnerships, we will redefine the future of beauty. And let's not forget Green Sciences (5) . Already well underway, this approach will help us reconcile performance, safety and sustainability, and meet our L'Or\u00e9al for the Future commitments. L'Or\u00e9al is uniquely positioned to succeed in 2022 and/uni00A0beyond. In a global context that remains volatile at the /uni00A0beginning of the year, we/uni00A0are confident in our ability to outperform the market in/uni00A02022 and achieve another year of growth in sales and profits.",

L'Or\u00e9al's  raison  d'\u00eatre  is  included  in  the  strategies defined by its Board of Directors and its business model.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's raison d'\u00eatre was developed following work implemented over almost two years, initiated and driven at the highest level by Mr Jean-Paul Agon and Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, as  well  as  several  members  of  the  Executive  Committee. L'Or\u00e9al's  raison  d'\u00eatre  was  the  result  of  dialogue  with  Group employees in three of its key countries (France, the United States and China) and many  external stakeholders, including consumers. The progress made was discussed several times in the Executive  Committee.  For  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  aim  was  to  collect  and formalise  what  it  contributes  to  the  world  as  a  company,  its values and its commitments in one document.\n\nThis raison d'\u00eatre was approved on 6 February 2020 by the Board of  Directors,  who  incorporated  it  into  their  Management  Report published  in  the  2019  Universal  Registration  Document  and presented  to  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  Shareholders  on 30 June 2020.\n\nA  single  sentence  epitomises  L'Or\u00e9al's  sense  of  purpose  ( raison d'\u00eatre) : 'Create the beauty that moves the world.' It is defined in concrete  actions  made  to  consumers,  employees,  clients, suppliers, shareholders, service providers and communities. L'Or\u00e9al is committed to fighting climate change, by respecting biodiversity and preserving natural resources, and to championing the cause of women.\n\n## 1.1.2. A clear mission and strategy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  defined  a  clear  vision  that  is  broken  down  into  two points: its sense of purpose ( raison d'\u00eatre) , which is detailed above, and Beauty for All. L'Or\u00e9al aims to offer women and men around the  world  the  best  in  cosmetics  in  terms  of  quality,  effectiveness, safety,  sincerity  and  responsibility  in  order  to  meet  all  their  needs and all their beauty wishes in their infinite diversity. More than ever, L'Or\u00e9al's  vision  takes  on  its  full  meaning  and  represents  a  strong anchor in this increasingly unpredictable and complex environment.\n\n## PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Group: the fundamentals\n\nIn its Management Report, L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors reports on  the  implementation  of  the  commitments  included  in  its raison d'\u00eatre, and on the progress towards the goals set:\n\n- \u25cf for  L'Or\u00e9al,  economic  performance  is  inseparable  from  its corporate  social  responsibility  performance.  The  results  of  the Group's  non-financial  performance,  which  are  reviewed  by external  auditors  along  with  its  financial  performance,  reflect the  achievements  of  L'Or\u00e9al  arising  from  its  raison  d'\u00eatre. Chapter  4  of  this  document,  'L'Or\u00e9al's  Corporate  Social Responsibility', reports on the social, environmental and societal policies and progress, inclusion and ethics within the L'Or\u00e9al for the  Future  programme covering the Group's commitments to sustainable development;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al also presents its progress and achievements in nonfinancial  areas  through  its  annual  reporting  made  to  the United Nations Global Compact;\n- \u25cf this  chapter  also  reports  on  the  Group's  financial  performance, particularly through its business model (see section 1.2. 'Business model:  Economic  and  societal  excellence  to  create  lasting value for all' of this document); and\n- \u25cf the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility performance is one of  the  factors  considered  in  determining  the  variable portion of the remuneration of L'Or\u00e9al's executive corporate  officers  (see  section  2.4.  'Remuneration  of directors and corporate officers' of this document) and the Group's senior managers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's strategy is Glocalization, meaning the globalisation of its brands  with  a  detailed  understanding  and  respect  for  local differences.  The  goal  is  to  offer  beauty  by  responding  to  the specific aspirations of consumers in every region of the world. In contrast  to  standardisation,  it  is  based  on  careful  attention  to consumers and a deep respect for their differences (1) .\n\n## 1.1.3. The challenge of innovation: the strength of Research, Innovation and Technology\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  believes  that  beauty  happens  when  science  and technology come together to impress and meet the needs of consumers  who  expect  new  experiences  over  and  above products and services.\n\nOn the one hand, the beauty of the future is now focused on Green Sciences as a new frontier of Research that reconciles efficiency,  naturalness  and  sustainability  to  give  the  Group's products, formulas or even  packaging  a  competitive advantage;  and,  on  the  other  hand,  on  Beauty  Tech  to\n\nenhance  science  via  cutting-edge  technologies  on  a  large scale and to offer unparalleled beauty experiences.\n\nInnovation  is  at  the  heart  of  the  model  and,  coupled  with technology, is a driving force for growth and discovery of new areas  of  beauty.  Data,  artificial  intelligence,  robotics  and nanotechnologies  will  strengthen  and  speed  up  the  Group's innovations  to  help  make  it  a  champion  of  Beauty  Tech. L'Or\u00e9al  invents  the  beauty  of  the  future  while  becoming  the company of the future.\n\n1",

The dual goal: economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  economic  and  financial  performance  is  not sufficient. Because there will be no economic growth without sustainability in the future, L'Or\u00e9al has set itself the dual goal of excellence,  in  both  the  economic  and  ESG  (Environmental, Social and Governance) domains. It will be the condition for its success  and  its  long-term  existence.  Because  L'Or\u00e9al  is  the global  leader  in  beauty,  it  has  the  duty  to  contribute  to  the\n\nbeauty of the planet and be the champion in corporate social responsibility. And  it is because  L'Or\u00e9al is a social, environmental, societal and ethical leader that it will achieve greater performance in the future. The two performances go hand in hand and mutually enhance each other, as L'Or\u00e9al has demonstrated to date.\n\n## 1.1.5. Stable governance\n\nThe stability of the Group's governance in a changing world makes it possible to work towards long-term objectives and to ensure regular growth.\n\n## Loyal shareholders, stable capital structure\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS AT 31 DECEMBER 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) Consisting of Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers,  Mr  Jean-Pierre  Meyers, Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers, along with T\u00e9thys SAS.\n- (2) Concerns  the  current  and  former  employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al.  Pursuant  to  law no.  2015-990  of  6  August  2015,  since  2016,  the  percentage  also  includes  the performance  shares  granted  in  accordance  with  Article  L.  225-197-1  of  the French  Commercial  Code.  Including  0.89%  as  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Employee Savings  Plan  and  employee  investment  fund  as  defined  by  Article  L.  225-102 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nOn 7 December 2021, L'Or\u00e9al entered into an agreement with Nestl\u00e9 to repurchase L'Or\u00e9al shares with a view to cancelling them.  The  conclusion  of  this  contract  was  authorised  by the  Board  of  Directors  at  its  meeting  of  7  December  2021, after having reviewed the findings of the independent expert's report.  The  shares  repurchased  on  15  December  were allocated to the cancellation target.\n\nThis transaction with Nestl\u00e9 constituted a further strategic step in  strengthening L'Or\u00e9al's shareholder stability, in the interests of the Company and that of all its shareholders.\n\nOn  9  February  2022,  the  Board  of  Directors  cancelled 22,260,000 shares repurchased by L'Or\u00e9al from Nestl\u00e9 effective as of 10 February 2022.\n\nFollowing  this  cancellation,  the  stake  held  by  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers and her family is 34.69% of the share capital, while  Nestl\u00e9's  stake  is  20.10%.  As  at  10  February  2022,  the Company no longer holds any of its own shares (see section 7.3.2. 'Changes  in  allocation  of  the  share  capital  and  voting  rights over the last three years' of this document).\n\n## Separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer with effect from 1 May 2021\n\nOn  14  October  2020,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  the  Board  of Directors announced its intention to dissociate the functions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to renew Mr Jean-Paul Agon's  mandate  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  a position  he  had  held  since  2011,  and  to  appoint  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThis new governance took effect on 1 May 2021, by decision of  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  meeting  held  following  the company's Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2021.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  convinced  that  the  proposed organisation will guarantee the sustainability of the performance, values and commitments of the Group, as well as the quality of its governance.\n\n## A balanced and committed Board of Directors, which fully plays its role of reflection and strategic impetus\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  defines  the  strategic  orientations  of L'Or\u00e9al and monitors its implementation, in accordance with its  corporate  interest,  taking  the  social  and  environmental challenges of its business activity into consideration. It oversees the  management  of  both  the  financial  and  non-financial aspects,  and  ensures  the  quality  of  the  information  provided to shareholders and to the market.\n\nThe  composition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  makes  it  possible  to  take into  account  the  specific  nature  of  its  shareholding  structure while guaranteeing the interests of all its stakeholders.\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  comprised 16 members:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairman, Mr Jean-Paul Agon;\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus;\n- \u00b7 three Directors (one of whom is the Board's Vice-Chairman) from  the  Bettencourt  Meyers  family,  which  owns  33.30% of  the  share  capital (1) -  Ms  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers, Mr Jean-Victor Meyers and Mr Nicolas Meyers;\n- \u00b7 two  Directors  (one  of  whom  is  the  Board's  Vice-Chairman) linked  to  Nestl\u00e9,  which  owns  19.30%  of  the  share  capital (1) -Mr Paul Bulcke and Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch;",

The global cosmetics market is worth nearly \u20ac230 billion (1) . It is a particularly robust market that has  demonstrated  a  certain  resilience  in  the  current  crisis  and  which  has  recovered  strongly  overall.  The  cosmetics  consumer always looks for quality and novelty value, and puts a premium on leading-edge technology, trends and new ideas.\n\n## GLOBAL COSMETICS MARKET IN 2021 (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2021,  the  beauty  market  grew  by  around  8%,  almost regaining its 2019 level.\n\nAfter  2020,  when  many  points  of  sale  and  hair  salons  were closed, in 2021 points of sale reopened almost completely and online  sales  increased.  The  different  distribution  universes  of the  beauty  market  suffered  contrasting  effects,  as  did  the different regions.\n\nIn  effect,  general  public  products,  offered  in  mass-market retail  channels  were  relatively  spared  during  the  crisis  and growth was stable in 2021, at near-record levels; while luxury products  were  more  heavily  impacted  by  the  closing  of department  stores  and  other  selective  channels,  and  so  the recovery  in  this  segment  was  more  marked  in  2021.  Similarly, Travel Retail suffered greatly from the drastic drop in air traffic, and  is  still  far  from  pre-crisis  levels.  Professional  products declined  sharply  in  volume  due  to  salon  closures;  they  also recorded a significant catch-up effect afterwards.\n\nThe Dermocosmetics segment stood out significantly, as its 2020 growth  continued  in  2021,  driven  by  the  strong  demand  for health-related products prescribed by dermatologists.\n\nIn  terms  of  product  categories,  2021  saw  positive  trends continue  for  skin  care;  this  category  remains  the  leading contributor to the growth of the beauty market. Haircare also recorded a strong performance this year, as demand held up during the global crisis. However, the recovery in the make-up category is not yet sufficient to offset the decline associated with the crisis.\n\nThe level  of  economic recovery varied in different regions of the world, which therefore had an impact on the recovery of the market.\n\n- \u00b7 Europe was the region most heavily impacted by the crisis, to a lesser extent in the countries of Northern Europe, and the recovery remains limited;\n- \u00b7 In  North Asia, in some countries, such as China, where the epidemic was more rapidly contained, the markets did not decline  during  the  crisis  and  continued  to  grow  in  2021. Other countries, however, followed the global trend;\n- \u00b7 Having  fallen  sharply  in  2020,  the  US  market  recovered strongly in 2021, exceeding 2019 levels;\n- \u00b7 Other markets (Latin America, Africa and the Middle East) are pretty close to getting back to their pre-crisis levels.\n\nThe acceleration of digitalisation, in online sales, communication and in sales via social media, continued in 2021, but at a slower pace than in 2020.\n\n1",

PRESENTATION OF THE GROUP INTEGRATED REPORT Business model: Economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A solid market carried by major socio-demographic changes\n\nEstimated at nearly \u20ac230 billion (2) , the global cosmetics market has  grown  at  a  steady  pace  over  the  long  term,  driven  by several fundamental trends:\n\n- \u00b7 the first and probably most important factor is the insatiable desire for beauty across all countries and cultures: beauty is synonymous  with  well-being,  pleasure,  confidence  and self-esteem,  at  every  stage  in  life.  This  phenomenon  was stronger in 2021 with a consolidation between health/wellbeing and beauty;\n- \u00b7 secondly, global digitalisation, because beauty and digital are  a  perfect  match.  Discovering  beauty  and  buying products  online  has  never  been  simpler.  Digital  is  a tremendous  booster  for  the  beauty  market,  a  trend  that intensified in 2021;\n- \u00b7 thirdly,  premiumisation:  consumers  are  ready  to  pay  more and  trade  up  for  products  with  new  benefits,  better performance and superior quality;\n- \u00b7 finally,  increased penetration of beauty all over the world. First, because of e-commerce, which is extending our reach far beyond the limits of traditional distribution, especially in emerging economies. Also because of the many areas that remain to be explored in terms of categories and countries. And  finally,  because  there  are  always  new  consumer targets with the expansion of the middle classes related to urbanisation, an ageing population, male consumers, etc.\n\n## 1.2.4. Meeting the global demand for beauty\n\nWith \u20ac32.28 billion in net sales and 85,412 employees in 2021, L'Or\u00e9al is the world leader in beauty.\n\nBuilding  on  a  long-term  vision,  with  a  clear  strategy,  L'Or\u00e9al continues its development by relying on its fundamental assets and  transforming  itself  to  respond  to  the  new  aspirations  of consumers,  employees  and  society.  Because  the  beauty market  is  a  growing  market  with  a  focus  on  the  future,  the Group  is,  now  more  than  ever,  in  a  position  to  seize  all opportunities,  strengthen  its  leadership  and  ensure  tomorrow's success.\n\n## Focus on a single, unique business: beauty, nothing but beauty and all beauty\n\nFor  over  a  century,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  carried  out  a  single  business: creating  beauty.  Cosmetics  are  rich  in  meaning.  They  allow each  person  to  boost  their  self-confidence,  express  their personality and open up to others.\n\nFocusing  on  a  single  business  represents,  more  than  ever,  a major competitive advantage for L'Or\u00e9al. In effect, the Group boasts  more  than  one  hundred  years  of  cosmetic  expertise, talented specialists and an in-depth knowledge of consumers, built  on  a  detailed  knowledge  of  beauty  cultures,  needs, desires  and  aspirations  in  their  infinite  diversity.  The  digital revolution, in perfect alignment with 'social beauty', connected and shared, acts to speed up the development of the  beauty  market  driven  by  economic,  technological, demographic and sociological developments.\n\nBy  focusing  its  energy  on  a  single  business,  along  with  an obsession  for  seizing  'what  is  new  and  fresh'  ( \"Saisir  ce  qui commence\" ),  L'Or\u00e9al is able to identify new consumer trends very quickly and respond rapidly.",

        "page_content": "## The best on Innovation to address the ongoing search for quality and premiumisation\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  harnesses  the  power  of  its  innovation  to  continually enhance the performance of its products and services.\n\nInnovation  has  always  been  the  core  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  model: the Group was born from a breakthrough innovation - safe hair dye invented by its founder Eug\u00e8ne Schueller. Cosmetics is an offer  business:  beauty  is  an  ideal  and  an  ongoing  quest. Consumers  always  want  to  try  new  products,  and  they  are willing to pay  more  for  innovations  that offer superb performance, quality and benefits. Because L'Or\u00e9al records a significant  share  of  its  sales  with  new  products  every  year,  the Group has a duty to be the champion of cosmetics innovation.\n\nGiven the acceleration of scientific and technological progress, and  the  growing  demands  of  consumers,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  able  to innovate  and  lead  in  all  areas:  formulation,  packaging, products, services, point-of-sale and online experience, personalisation,  brand  image  and  reputation,  etc.  The  beauty of the future will be fuelled and nurtured by Green Sciences (1) , this new  research  frontier  that  brings  together  efficacy, naturalness  and  sustainability  to  give  the  Group's  products  a new competitive advantage.\n\nBecause  the  future  of  beauty  is  limitless,  it  is  the  Group's responsibility  to  offer  maximum  creativity  and  inventiveness through all its brands to surprise and satisfy consumers.\n\n## Digital technologies are accelerating marketing models for brands, products, services and customer experience.\n\nThe  cosmetics  market  is  becoming  increasingly  digital  and competitive, with the arrival of new players from new markets and other industries such as fashion, luxury and e-commerce.\n\nIn  this  context,  the  superior  marketing  of  the  Group's  brands and products is a key and differentiating factor. The creation and  development  of  major  brands  prized  by  consumers around the world, the launch of new or innovative franchises, the  design  of  new  products  and  services,  including  in  the e-commerce  sphere,  will  all  be  essential  and  fundamental assets for the next decade.\n\n## Glocalization: a unique development strategy that respects differences\n\n## The battle on Emerging Markets, aimed at conquering hundreds of millions of new consumers\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  the  goal  of  attracting  hundreds  of  millions  of new consumers in the coming years, particularly in emerging countries.  Over  the  next  decade,  North  Asia  and  the SAPMENA-SSA  zone  will  be  the  key  areas  in  the  battle  for global  leadership  and  will  represent  a  particularly  significant source  of  growth  in  the  beauty  market.  Although  L'Or\u00e9al  is already  the  leader  in  this  region,  the  potential  here  is  still enormous,  since  the  Group's  market  share  remains  limited. Consumption from Chinese customers should continue to rise sharply due to the increase in their living standards and their growing appetite for beauty.\n\nAt the same time, L'Or\u00e9al also aims to accelerate its presence in Africa, which is the Group's 'next frontier' and to continue its expansion in other regions of the world.\n\n## Priority to digital and Beauty Tech to become the champion\n\nTechnology,  particularly  Beauty  Tech,  is  the  future  of  beauty because of the phenomenal  breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things, 3D  printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, etc., which make it possible to expand L'Or\u00e9al's offering and satisfy all consumer expectations.\n\nDigital has radically transformed the Group, and today is fully integrated  in  the  business,  brands,  and  jobs,  in  all  countries, and relies on a solid network of over 3,000 digital experts and close  to  52,000  employees  trained  and  a  wealth  of  in-house know-how. Digital has boosted L'Or\u00e9al's strengths tenfold and represents a tremendous booster of opportunities and growth. It  enhances the power of brands and products, enriches the connection  with  consumers  and  creates  experiences,  new services and personalisation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al,  which  is  already  a  digital-first  company,  decided  to be the pioneer, champion and leader of Beauty Tech in all its areas  of  application.  By  building  up  state-of-the-art  and secure IT, its leadership in Beauty Tech, its expertise in artificial intelligence and data will enable L'Or\u00e9al to be a data-driven company for all its activities and business lines.\n\nBeauty Tech will ensure that beauty for all evolves into beauty for  each  person.  To  achieve  this,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  a  unique strength:  being  the  only  company  that  can  combine  more than  110  years  of  scientific  beauty  expertise  and  knowledge of our consumers with cutting-edge digital excellence.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  relies  on  a  single  strategy  -  Glocalization  -  meaning the  globalisation  of  its  brands  with  a  detailed  understanding and  respect  for  local  differences.  Since  beauty  lies  at  the crossroads of contemporary and future civilisational issues, the Glocalization strategy is more relevant than ever, timeless and evolutionary. The goal of the Glocalization strategy is to offer bespoke  and  inclusive  beauty  by  responding  to  the  specific aspirations  of  consumers  in  every  region  of  the  world.  In contrast to standardisation, it is based on careful attention to consumers  and  a  deep  respect  for  the  differences  in  their needs, lifestyles, desires and traditions.\n\n1",

A portfolio of diverse and complementary brands\n\nTo  meet  the  beauty  expectations  of  consumers  all  over  the world,  the  Group  has  the  richest,  most  varied  and  most powerful  brand  portfolio  in  the  cosmetics  industry.  Moreover, its  brands  are  constantly  being  reinvented  so  that  they  are always a perfect match with local consumer demand.\n\nNew acquisitions  also  regularly  provide  valuable  additions  to this unique portfolio to respond to consumer trends.\n\nSome  of  these  acquisitions  are  global  brands,  such  as  the CeraVe  skincare  brand  in  the  Active  Cosmetics  Division portfolio,  the  Italian  Prada  and  Valentino  brands,  as  well  as Mugler and Azzaro perfumes for L'Or\u00e9al Luxe, Logocos with its vegan  and  organic  concept  for  the  Consumer  Products Division;  and  Pulp  Riot,  which  expands  the  growth  potential of Professional Products.\n\nOther  acquisitions  aim  to  extend  the  Group's  geographic scope:  the  makeup  brand  Vogue  in  Colombia,  Interbeauty in  Kenya,  Niely  Cosmeticos  in  Brazil,  Stylenanda  in  South Korea, Takami Co in Japan and Youth To The People in the United States.\n\nThese  acquired  companies,  through  their  integration  and deployment, are helping to accelerate the Group's penetration of their markets and drive organic growth going forward.\n\n## 1.2.6. The bet on Research, Safety and Innovation\n\nThe  cosmetics  market  is  driven  by  supply  and  innovation. L'Or\u00e9al's  success,  today  and  in  the  future,  is  fed  by  its permanent  obsession  for  innovation,  which  feeds  into  its performance in all its forms.\n\nWith  4,054  researchers  and  a  budget  of  approximately  3.2% of  sales,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  the  top  Research  and  Innovation  (R&I) force in the cosmetics industry. R&I is a powerful organisation, in  which  the  level  of  expertise  and  wealth  of  scientific  and\n\ntechnical  data  represent  a  significant  asset.  The  Group's laboratories make no compromise about the absolute safety of its ingredients, superior quality and the effectiveness of the formulas, and the sincerity of its claims.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  invests  in  all  areas,  from  Advanced  Research  to formulation  and  from  France  to  regional  centres  anchored  in the major markets around the world.

Augmented  Beauty  seeks  to  meet  and anticipate  consumer  expectations  by  offering  breakthrough innovations that incorporate new and ever-more personalised experiences  with  services  and  applications.  This  also  means that L'Or\u00e9al can directly connect with and reach out to more and  more  consumers,  collecting  information  on  their  beauty rituals,  their  use  of  products,  their  everyday  concerns,  and gathering their opinions in real time - all while complying with and safeguarding laws on consumers' data privacy.\n\n## A partnership-based approach to building a data ecosystem\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  entered  into  several  strategic  partnerships  with scientific 'Tech' specialists in order to reinforce its knowledge and  understand  how  beauty  can  be  affected  by  hormonal activity, sleep  and  environmental  conditions,  particularly pollution.\n\n## Precision health\n\nAt the beginning of 2022 (1) , an unprecedented partnership was signed  between L'Or\u00e9al  and  Verily,  a  subsidiary  of  Alphabet specialising  in  precision  health.  The  aim  is  to  decrypt  the ageing  mechanisms  of  hair  and  skin  and  inform  L'Or\u00e9al's strategy and product development with new precision beauty technologies.  This  combination  will  enable  L'Or\u00e9al  to  pool its profound  scientific knowledge  of  skin  with  Verily's comprehensive clinical research capabilities, to decode and discover  the  links  between  exposome,  skin  aging,  and  deep biology of the skin. It will  also  make it  possible  to  explore  the development of new technologies and tele-diagnosis solutions such  as  sensors,  and  Artificial  Intelligence  algorithms  for dermatology  and  skincare,  that  can  form  the  basis  for  new services.\n\n## Learning about the impact of hormonal cycles\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  announced  a  partnership  with  Clue,  an  app dedicated to menstrual cycles, to enrich knowledge about the impact  of  hormonal  cycles  on  skin  health  and  quality.  This collaboration combines L'Or\u00e9al's historical expertise in skincare knowledge  with  Clue's  leadership  in  menstrual  cycle  data thanks  to  its  12  million  subscribers  in  190  countries.  It  will\n\nalso  be  enriched  by  the  participation  of  dermatologists, endocrinologists  and  gynaecologists  with  whom  the  Group already works. Thanks to the enrichment of this knowledge, all consumers  will  benefit  from  the  best  personalised  skincare routines, from the first menstrual cycle to the menopause, taking into account the health of their skin, as well as their beauty and well-being aspirations.\n\n## An exposome platform\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  entered  a  long-term  research  partnership  with BreezoMeter,  a  leader  in  environmental  information  on  air quality,  pollen  and  fire.  The  aim  is  to  improve  the  health  and safety  of  billions  of  people  around  the  world  by  providing accurate,  exploitable  data  (filters,  UV,  pollution,  etc.).  The respective  expertise  of  the  partners  in  skin  sciences  and  the climate  environment  will  combine  to  develop  an  exposome platform based around beauty, able to offer practical advice to consumers on their skin routines to combat the effects of their environment on skin ageing.\n\n## Global Research\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  today  has  a  powerful  R&I  model  with  a  level  of expertise and a wealth of scientific and technical data, which represent  a  true  asset.  Advanced  Research  teams  create, develop and source raw materials, drawing on the knowledge of skin  and  hair  from  around  the  world;  the  Applied  Research teams  then  develop  formula  architectures  that  improve  the performance of assets, and the Development laboratories create innovative formulas with a proven superiority for each brand. This innovation model is nurtured by a constant dialogue between the laboratories and marketing to respond to the expectations  of  consumers,  supporting  them  with  the  latest technological breakthroughs.\n\n## Research facilities around the world\n\nIn  order  to  adapt  to  consumer  expectations  worldwide, L'Or\u00e9al's  Research  teams  work  in  20  cosmetics  research centres and 13 assessment centres. The research centres are grouped  into  three  global  centres  in  France  (Advanced Research,  Haircare  and  Cosmetics).  The  six  regional  hubs (Japan,  US,  China,  India,  South  Africa  and  Brazil)  identify consumer needs and study their cosmetics habits. R&I teams build  on  this  rich  seam  of  local  scientific  ecosystems  to develop  collaboration  agreements  and  partnerships  of excellence.  The  data  generated  enables  researchers  to develop new products, that are perfectly in tune with market needs and local expectations. The innovations produced are also shared in a coordinated way to promote discussion flows.\n\n1",

Today,  none  of  the  Group's products  or  ingredients  are  tested  on  animals  by  L'Or\u00e9al. For  more  than  30  years  and  since  1989,  L'Or\u00e9al  definitively stopped the safety testing of its products on animals, 14 years before  it  was  officially  prohibited.  The  Group  believes  that there  are  other  effective  ways  of  ensuring  that  cosmetic products  are  safe  that  do  not  involve  animal  testing. For example, over 40 years ago, L'Or\u00e9al was the first company to develop reconstructed skin, which is a more accurate way to  test  the  effects  of  ingredients  and  cosmetic  products  on human  skin  than  any  other  method.  Different  types  of reconstructed  human  skin  are  currently  produced  in  France, China  and  Brazil,  in  the  laboratories  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  subsidiary, Episkin.  This  technology  is  made  available  to  governments, organisations  and  other  companies  so  they  do  not  have  to resort to animal testing.\n\n## Number of patents filed\n\n|   2019 |   497 |\n|--------|-------|\n|   2020 |   500 |\n|   2021 |   517 |\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  a  pioneer  in  technology  and  methods  free  from animal testing.\n\nThe Group has also been active in advocating for alternative methods in China. L'Or\u00e9al has been working with the Chinese authorities for over 10 years on introducing methods that are free from animal testing for all cosmetic products. Over the last few  years,  China  abolished  the  requirement  to  carry  out animal  testing  that  applies  to  most  cosmetics  sold  in  the country.  Since  2014,  the  Chinese  authorities  no  longer  test non-functional  cosmetics  (such  as  shampoo  or  make-up) manufactured  locally,  and  this  progress  is  gradually  being extended:  since  2021,  these  same  cosmetics  imported  into China no longer need to be tested on animals, subject to a certificate of compliance with manufacturing best practices.",

        "page_content": "## A new solar filter: Mexoryl 400\n\n## Preparing for a sustainable future\n\nUltraviolet UVA and UVB rays are some of the main causes of skin cancer. Accordingly, it is essential to stay protected from all this radiation during your lifetime. L'Or\u00e9al has a long history of expertise in the development of sunscreens, starting with its patenting of Mexoryl SX in 1982, followed by Mexoryl XL in 1989. The combination covers the UVB and short UVA range well,  though  less  so  the  long  UVA  range.    After  10  years  of research in collaboration with BASF, in 2021 L'Or\u00e9al launched MEXORYL  400,  the  first  solar  filter  that  absorbs  previously inaccessible  long  UVA  rays.  By  widening  the  range  of  solar filtration,  this  filter  plays  an  active  role  in  preventing  deep skin  damage.  Combined  with  several  filters,  the  products now  provide  complete  protection  across  the  entire  UV spectrum and thus protect the skin from sun damage.\n\n## Transparency\n\n## More  transparency  to  promote  responsible choices\n\nIn order to meet consumers' growing demand  for transparency  in  the  ingredients  that  make  up  the  products, L'Or\u00e9al has strengthened its approach through new initiatives that  improve  information  and  allow  everyone  to  make informed  choices.  Launched  in  March  2019,  the  Inside  Our Products  website  answers  questions  from  the  general  public about  what  goes  into  the  ingredients  used  in  the  Group's products. The platform lists more than 1,300 ingredients and is now  accessible  in  45  countries  and  in  8  languages.  This content,  based  in  scientific  foundations,  is  gradually  being added to the websites of the Group's major brands (L'Or\u00e9al Paris,  Garnier,  La  Roche-Posay,  Maybelline,  Redken,  Essie, K\u00e9rastase,  Yves  Saint  Laurent  etc.).  As  a  continuation  of  this initiative, the  Product  Impact  Labelling  (PIL)  system  for displaying  the  environmental  and  social  impact  of  products, that  has  been  used  in  several  European  countries  for  the Garnier haircare and skincare brand, has now been extended to the La Roche Posay, Vichy and Biotherm skincare brands in France and will be rolled out gradually in new markets and for new product categories.\n\n## The transparency of fragrances\n\nFaced  with  increasing  consumer  demand  for  information  on the composition of its beauty products, L'Or\u00e9al is pursuing its transparency  approach  by  launching  InFragrance,  a  new information  platform  dedicated  to  fragrance  ingredients.  Its development began three years ago with the analysis of more than  20,000  perfume  formulas  working  jointly  with  its  main perfume suppliers  (Firmenich,  Givaudan,  and  IFF  and  Mane), given that  each fragrance is  a  unique  complex  composition that  combines  a  large  number  of  ingredients.  The  challenge was to preserve the know-how and confidentiality associated with the uniqueness of each fragrance in a system that works for both consumer products and luxury fragrances: it allows us to understand the natural or synthetic origin of the ingredients, their  olfactory  properties and the way they are combined to create  the  fragrance  of  products.  Roll-out  of  the  platform began in the United States with Atelier Cologne, Garnier and Yves Saint-Laurent.\n\nThe  model  will  then  extend  to  all  of  the  Group's  brands throughout  the  world.  As  a  responsible  leader  in  the  beauty industry, L'Or\u00e9al would like the InFragrance model to be open to other players in the sector, both manufacturers and retailers, so as to provide more transparency to consumers.\n\n## Stronger together when making sustainable consumer choices\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has announced a ground-breaking global collaboration with Henkel, LVMH, Natura & Co and Unilever to develop the Eco Beauty Score, a rating system to assess the environmental  impact  of  beauty  products,  which  pools  their experience, knowledge and data in this area. The scheme will provide consumers with transparent and comparable information  on  the  environmental  impact  of  products  in  the form  of  an  overall  score,  to  be  made  available  in  late  2022. This  approach  is  based  on  a  full  analysis  of  their  life  cycle (formula,  packaging  and  use)  using  a  common  scientific methodology established with the consulting firm Quantis. This system,  common  to  all  cosmetics  companies,  aims  to  allow consumers  to  make  more  sustainable  consumer  choices. In  addition,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  above-mentioned  companies have invited all other cosmetics players to join them.\n\n## A sustainable investment that targets water use\n\nThrough its corporate venture fund BOLD (Business Opportunities  for  L'Or\u00e9al  Development), in  2021  L'Or\u00e9al  took a  minority  stake  in  the  Swiss  start-up  Gjosa,  which  develops unique  water-saving  solutions.  L'Or\u00e9al  and  Gjosa  have  been working  together  since  2015  to  reduce  the  amount  of  rinse water  used  by  65%  via  a  shower  head  that  can  reduce the  flow  of  water  without  compromising  its  ability  to  rinse a  shampoo.  Presented  in  January  2021  at  the  Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, L'Or\u00e9al Water Saver technology operates using  micro-ionised  droplets  in  a  high-pressure  flow. The  system  connected  to  the  tub  has  three  slots  for  infusing shampoo,  conditioner  and  care  products  directly  into  the water  stream,  while  the  shower  head  reduces  water consumption in salons by up to 65%. It is being used in about 100  pilot  hair  salons.  TIME  Magazine  named  it  one  of  the 100 Best Inventions of 2021.\n\n## Laboratories of the future are hiring cobots (collaborative robots)\n\nRALF  (Robot  Assistance  with  Laboratory  Flexibility)  is  a  modular platform that works with an operator to prepare and process hair strands.  Designed  with  the  Labman  company,  RALF  brings together multiple strands of expertise in the field of hair treatment (assessment, physical measurement, hair knowledge, mechatronic prototyping, robotic programming, IT and security, among others) to provide appropriate responses to tests, such as the  automated  application  of  dyes  to  hair,  standardised  hair setting  procedures,  and  so  on.  The  results  obtained  show  that RALF  is  able  to  automate  low  value-added  tasks,  such  as  dye application, standardising operator-dependent tests, and guaranteeing the quality and traceability of data, while reducing the amount of water used to shampoo and rinse hair.\n\n1",

Operations, specialised expertise and core values to contribute to growth\n\nThe Operations Division harnesses the most specialised, agile, effective and  connected  technological  expertise,  from packaging  design  and  product  development,  sourcing  and production through to distribution of all the Group's products, contributing  with  brands  to  offer  consumers  worldwide  the most advanced cosmetic products and services.\n\nThe  Operations  Division  guarantees  consumers  compliance with  strict  standards  of  quality,  safety,  security  and  societal and environmental responsibility all over the world.\n\n## Agility and resilience to meet changing demands and better respond to consumer expectations\n\nRelying on an approach of operational excellence conducted for  years,  high-tech  industry  is  at  the  core  of  L'Or\u00e9al's Operations  Division.  As  a  result,  the  integration  of  data  and new  technologies  all  along  the  value  chain  responds specifically  both  to  the  new  challenges  of  personalisation, agility  and  traceability  expected  by  consumers  and  to  the new  needs  of  its  employees:  simplification,  ergonomics, real-time access to data, new capacities related, for example, to  the  use  of  virtual  reality,  3D  printing,  artificial  intelligence, etc.\n\nFor  product  development,  3D  printing  of  prototypes  for products  and/or  functional  packaging  components  reduces development  times  and  therefore  brings  products  to  the market faster.  This  fast  prototyping  ensures  an  agile  response to  consumers'  new  consumer  beauty  expectations  and cosmetic trends.\n\nIn  production,  the  combination  of  technologies  such  as 3D printing, artificial intelligence, connected objects (Internet of Things, IoT), cobots (collaborative robots) and virtual reality are  new  tools  to  assist  operators  and  to  develop  new,  agile and more flexible production lines.\n\nIn traceability and productivity, the IoT and data management (Big Data) open up exciting prospects for improving the supply chain,  creating  smoother  flows  for  the  customer  experience, managing  the  omni-channel  experience  and  increased interaction with consumers.\n\n## At the centre of design and development is innovation in responsible packaging\n\nThe packaging of a product is the first identifying link between a brand and its consumers. Beyond science, experience and performance, packaging is a key differentiating factor for the product  and  therefore  for  the  value  perceived  by  the consumer. The L'Or\u00e9al teams, distributed over five Packaging Hubs  around  the  world,  specialise  in  design,  consumer experience  (ease  of  use  and  creativity),  innovation  in packaging, and product development.\n\nThey  rely  on  the  expertise  of  laboratories  dedicated  to materials  and  packaging  to  offer  cutting-edge  innovations worldwide.  L'Or\u00e9al  filed  517  patents  for  packaging  and processes in 2021.\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  committed  to  an  eco-design process  for  sustainable  packaging  and  has  very  significantly intensified  its  progress  in  recent  years.  The  process  occurs  in three steps: Reduce the intensity of packaging and thus avoid using  too  many  resources;  Replace  impactful  materials  with materials that have a better environmental footprint (renewable,  post-consumer  recycled);  Recycle  by  creating packaging that will contribute to the circular economy.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  96%  of  the  Group's  products  were eco-designed. By 2025, 100% of the Group's plastic packaging will  be  refillable,  reusable,  recyclable  or  compostable.  By 2030, all the plastics used in L'Or\u00e9al's product packaging will be recycled or biosourced in origin. As part of an innovative, long-term  partnership  with  green  biotech  company  Carbios, L'Or\u00e9al announced the design of the first cosmetic bottle for Biotherm in 2021 to be made from fully recycled plastics using Carbios'  enzymatic  technology.  In  2021,  with  its  partner Paboco, L'Or\u00e9al developed the first cardboard-based bottle for the La Roche Posay and Kiehl's brands.\n\n## A purchasing programme that combines economic, environmental and social value with high standards in terms of quality and security\n\nTo  accompany  the  Group's  growth,  the  Purchasing  teams select  the  most  economically,  environmentally  and  socially effective suppliers in accordance with the L'Or\u00e9al Buy & Care responsible purchasing policy. Supplier performance is monitored  thanks  to  precise  indicators  relating  to  social, environmental and ethical criteria and through their ability to innovate  and  to  meet  the  Group's  requirements  in  terms  of quality, agility, service and competitiveness.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al builds solid relationships with its suppliers which makes it possible  to  work  with  them  on  their  supply  chains  for responsible  sourcing  and  ensure  the  agility,  reliability  and traceability  of  sourcing.  In  2021,  the  Group  conducted 1,236 social audits, a total of more than 14,900 since 2006.\n\nFurthermore,  by  creating  the  Solidarity  Sourcing  responsible purchasing programme, L'Or\u00e9al chose as from 2010 to enable sourcing  from  suppliers  with  an  inclusive  solidarity  model, in other words, companies  that  offer  employment  to vulnerable  workers  and  people  in  economically  or  socially disadvantaged communities, such as people with a disability, the long-term unemployed or fair trade suppliers (see section 4.3.3.6. 'Measures taken in favour of local communities' of this document). At the end of 2021, 89,093 people had been able to access employment via the Solidarity Sourcing programme.",

In 2021, 97%  of  L'Or\u00e9al  plants  were  ISO  9001  (Quality  Management) certified and 100% were ISO 22716 (Best cosmetics manufacturing practices) compliant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ~100 quality controls\n\n## For each cosmetic product\n\nProducts meet the same standards of excellence and quality all over the world\n\nIdentical processes are followed in the 39 plants, from the reception of raw materials, through the manufacturing of formulas and the packaging of finished products, until products are placed on the market\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Plants certified to the highest level\n\n100%\n\nof the Group's plants\n\nare ISO 22716 * compliant\n\n- *   Best practices in cosmetics manufacturing\n- ** Quality management\n\n97%\n\nof the Group's plants\n\nare ISO 9001** compliant\n\nThis unique quality management system guarantees manufacturing  excellence  and  the  quality  of  products  with the same high standards applicable everywhere in the world. It  includes efficient production methods and stringent control standards:  around  100  quality  controls  are  carried  out  on  a single  product  during  the  production  cycle,  from  the  input of  raw  materials  and  packaging  to  when  products  leave the plant and heads towards customers and consumers.\n\nThe ongoing quality improvement process has been effective as  seen  in  the  low  rate  of  consumer  complaints  in  2021: 39 complaints per million products sold.\n\n<!-- image -->",

L'Or\u00e9al Brazil was awarded the highly prestigious Sir George  Earle  Trophy,  the  highest distinction allotted by the RoSPA  Awards.  This  award recognises  excellence  in  management  and  performance  in terms of health, safety and well-being, both inside and outside of work.\n\n## At the heart of production: environmental protection\n\nThe Group's environmental policy aims to roll out best practice in sustainable production so as to limit the direct impact of the Group's  business  activities  on  the  environment,  and  to preserve biodiversity and resources: energy efficiency, use of renewable  energy,  optimisation  of  water  consumption  and recycling,  preservation  of  biodiversity,  reduction  of  waste production,  etc.  In  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  continued  to  prioritise programmes  to  reduce  its  environmental  footprint  (e.g. continuation of renewable energy projects around the world, start-up  of  two  new  treatment  plants  in  France)  with,  since 2019,  a  -35%  drop  in  CO2  emissions  in  absolute  value  (-87% since  2005),  a  -5%  drop  in  water  consumption  per  unit  of finished  product  (-53%  since  2005),  and  a  -1%  drop  in  waste generation  per  unit  of  finished  product  (-38%  since  2005). It  should be noted that 97% of residual waste was recovered in  2021,  meaning  that  it  was  reused,  recycled  or  used  for energy recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2005\n\n2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowth in production\n\nWaste generation per finished product unit\n\nWater consumption per finished product unit\n\nCO/two.denominator emissions in absolute terms\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n60 industrial sites (1) were 'carbon neutral' (2) at the end of 2021, an increase of 20% since 2020. 25 plants are carbon neutral: Libramont  in  Belgium,  Settimo  in  Italy,  Burgos  and  Alcal\u00e1  de Henares  in  Spain,  Rambouillet,  Ormes,  Gauchy,  Vichy, La  Roche-Posay,  Tours,  Aulnay,  Saint-Quentin,  Lassigny  and Caudry in France, Karlsruhe and Salzhemmendorf in Germany, Yichang and Suzhou in China, Montreal in Canada, Funza in Colombia, Florence, Franklin, Piscataway and North Little Rock in the USA, and Baddi in India.\n\nAll L'Or\u00e9al  USA  sites  (production  and  distribution  sites, administrative sites, research  centres)  achieved  carbon neutrality  in  2021  (see  section  4.3.1.1.3.  'Fighting  climate change on operated sites, A/ Fighting climate change' of this document).\n\n1",

        "page_content": ".\n\nBusiness model: Economic and corporate excellence to create lasting value for all\n\nAt  year-end  2021,  there  were  six  Waterloop  Factory  plants (Burgos in Spain, Settimo in Italy, Vorsino in Russia, Libramont in Belgium, Mexico City in Mexico and Yichang in China): all the water  required  by  the  utilities  (equipment  cleaning,  steam production, etc.) comes from reused water or water recycled in  a  closed  loop  on  the  site  (see  section  4.3.1.1.4.,  Preserving water resources on operated sites, in this document).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  for  over  25  years  to  environmental leadership was recognised in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, with the best possible rating by the CDP (1) :  a  triple  \"A\". L'Or\u00e9al is thus the only company in the world, out of more than 12,000 companies assessed, to receive a triple 'A' ranking for the  sixth  consecutive  year,  for  its  commitment  and  results  in each of the key areas for environmental protection: the fight against climate change, sustainable water management and the fight against deforestation.\n\n## Rapidly changing omni-channel logistics strategy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Group's  supply  chain  organises  and  optimises  all product  delivery  flows  to  all  our  customers  as  well  as  direct deliveries  to  e-commerce  consumers.  It  is  responsible  for making sure  that  the  products  are  delivered  under  optimum conditions,  at  the  right  time  and  at  the  best  cost.  L'Or\u00e9al distributes  more  than  6  billion  products  accross  all  channels. The supply chain and its distribution centres were particularly strategic and responsive in 2021 in order to provide deliveries to  consumers  and  thus  support  L'Or\u00e9al's  growth,  despite  a challenging global context in the supply of raw materials and transport.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  unique  in  the  cosmetics  market  in  that  it  serves  a global market through a diverse range of distribution channels (see  below)  with  a  portfolio  of  many  different  beauty  and cosmetic  product  categories.  L'Or\u00e9al  continuously  optimises all information  flows  and  physical  flows  from  suppliers to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe goal is to increase agility to handle market variations on all distribution channels and to adapt to market expectations in real  time.    L'Or\u00e9al  has  therefore  implemented  a  planning strategy for  the  manufacturing, sales and distribution process (S&OP, Sales and Operations Planning) in order to deliver an optimum service to the Group's customers. Digitalisation of the supply chain and data management are critical challenges, and represent a real opportunity, especially in the retail sector and in  stores  managed  directly  by  L'Or\u00e9al.  It  can  provide  a comprehensive view of business in a store, as well as improve understanding of the consumer purchase journey.\n\nThe supply chain network composed of 148 distribution centres is a  strategic  lever  to  ensure  agile  coverage  of  market challenges  and  expand  our  service  offer.  To  create  a  more responsive  supply  chain,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  investing  in  its  plants  to gradually  transform  them  into  Fulfilment  Centres  for  more services: powered by automation and data, they will manage a range of services to consumers such as personalisation, box preparation, tailor-made delivery, and so on. They will facilitate stock  interoperability  for  omnichannel  management  and\n\nallow enhanced product traceability for greater transparency to  consumers.  In  France,  the  Mitry-Mory  plant  in  the  Paris region  was  transformed  to  meet  the  changing  demands  of hairdressers  with  an  increasing  number  of  small  and  split orders, based on the direct to consumer model.\n\nSustainable  development  is  also  central  to  the  supply  chain strategy. In order to reduce its environmental footprint, L'Or\u00e9al is  co-creating  with  carriers  low-carbon  multimodal  solutions adapted  to  the  specific  features  of  each  geographic  zone (green delivery,  reduced air  freight,  hydrogen  engines,  etc.). To  improve  the  energy  efficiency  of  its  centres,  L'Or\u00e9al  is increasing the use of 100% renewable energies everywhere in the  world  and  is  also  targeting  the  elimination  of  the  use  of single use plastic in its centres.\n\nBy the end of 2022, the aim is to eliminate single-use plastic in materials used to fill packaging voids or in adhesive tapes in all distribution centres worldwide. By the end of 2021, 100% of the Group's  distribution  centres  in  Latin  America,  Europe  and SAPMENA-SSA had already achieved this goal.",

Thanks to the expertise, passion and commitment of our 85,400 L'Or\u00e9alians around the world, the Group achieved record growth of +16.1% (1) , twice that of the worldwide beauty market. L'Or\u00e9al gained market share in all Zones, Divisions and categories. Over two years,  the  Group  achieved  growth  of  +11.3%  like-for-like, spectacularly  outperforming  a  market  that  had  returned almost to 2019 levels.\n\nIn 2021, all stars aligned for this historic performance.\n\nIn terms of Zones, North America made a strong comeback and joined North Asia as the primary growth contributor. In Europe,  boosted  by  the  Zone's  reorganisation,  L'Or\u00e9al achieved significant market share gains and saw a return to 2019  levels.  With  an  extremely  volatile  public  health situation  in  SAPMENA-SSA (2) and  Latin  America,  L'Or\u00e9al demonstrated agility and delivered solid performance.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  became  the  Group's  largest  Division,  with remarkable  success  in  fragrances,  while  the  Consumer Products Division, the largest Division by volume, strengthened  its  position,  with  noteworthy  performance  in makeup.  The  fast-growing  Professional  Products  Division continued its far-reaching transformation and became truly omnichannel.  With  a  portfolio  of  brands  that  perfectly matches  consumers'  health  aspirations,  Active  Cosmetics also achieved spectacular growth, doubling in four years.\n\nIn 2021, we again extended our digital lead: e-commerce (3) grew by +25.7% (1) ,  accounting for  28.9%  of  sales.  We  have been able to seize the opportunities offered by new digital channels. At the same time, we are continuing to digitalise points of sale aspart of an integrated omnichannel strategy.\n\nWe  are  also  pursuing  our  Beauty  Tech  transformation  by investing in data  and  artificial intelligence, and  by establishing strategic partnerships such as our alliance with Verily,  to  better  understand and characterise skin and hair aging mechanisms.\n\n## 1.3.1.1. Overview of the results for 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Sales: 32.28 billion euros\n- \u00b7 +16.1% like-for-like (1)\n- \u00b7 +16.9% at constant exchange rates\n- \u00b7 +15.3% based on reported figures\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's exceptional growth, driven by superior innovations, as  well  as  rigorous  cost  control,  has  enabled  us  to  invest extensively in our brands and increase their appeal, while at the  same  time  delivering  record  operating  profit  and  an operating margin up 50 basis points.\n\nWe  are  also  proud  of  our  social  and  environmental performance, which reflects our ambition to grow responsibly and share value with all our stakeholders. First of all,  with  our  employees,  whom  we  associate  with  these exceptional results through a record redistribution of profitsharing schemes. Furthermore, to promote youth employment,  last  year  we  offered  more  than  18,300  job opportunities to young people under 30 as part of our new global  'L'Or\u00e9al  For  Youth'  programme,  which  has  an ambitious target of 25,000 opportunities per year from 2022 to  2025.  Our  efforts  to  support  gender  parity  were  also recognised  by  the  Bloomberg  Gender-Equality  Index.  In addition,  L'Or\u00e9al  USA,  our  largest  subsidiary,  achieved carbon  neutrality  for  all  its  sites  in  2021,  some  four  years ahead of our L'Or\u00e9al for the Future commitments. L'Or\u00e9al is the only company in the world to have been awarded an AAA  score  by  CDP  six  years  in  a  row,  for  environmental leadership  in  tackling  climate  change,  protecting  forests and ensuring water security.\n\nThe  end  of  the  year  was  marked  by  the  strategic transaction  consisting  of  the  buyback  by  L'Or\u00e9al  of  4%  of its own  shares  held  by  Nestl\u00e9,  which  strengthens  our shareholder structure, a key asset in the Group's long- term success.\n\nIn  a  global  context  that  remains  volatile  at  the  beginning of the year, we are confident in our ability to outperform the market in 2022 and achieve another year of growth in both sales and profits.'\n\n- \u00b7 Sales growth compared to 2019: +11.3% like-for-like\n- \u00b7 Record operating profit: 6.16 billion euros, 19.1% of sales\n- \u00b7 Earnings per share (4) : 8.82 euros, an increase of +20.9%\n- \u00b7 Dividend (5) : 4.80 euros, an increase of +20%",

The  benefits  of  its  omnichannel  strategy  were reflected  in  the  recovery  of  in-salon  sales,  the  exceptional performance of the  Salon  Centric  distribution  channel  in  the United States as well as a strong increase in e-commerce.\n\nHaircare remained  the  number  one  growth  category. K\u00e9rastase had  a  spectacular  year,  driven  by  the  success  of Curl  Manifesto .  L'Or\u00e9al  Professionnel,  thanks  to  its  disruptive innovation Metal  Detox ,  and  Redken,  with  its  new Acidic Bonding  Concentrate line,  also  recorded  strong  growth.  Hair colour made a very strong recovery, thanks in particular to the success  of Shades  EQ by  Redken and Dialight by  L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel.\n\nAs an industry leader,the Division is encouraging all its partner hairstylists to engage in the sustainable transition by launching its 'Hairstylists for the Future' programme.\n\n## Consumer products\n\nThe  Consumer  Products  Division  grew  by  +5.6%  like-for-like and +4.5% reported, with +6.5% like-for-like growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe  Division  gained  market  share  in  2021.  The  momentum  is strong in the United States as well as in high- potential markets, including  India,  Brazil,  Mexico  and  Indonesia.  Growth  was driven  by  the  development  of  e-commerce,  in  all  the  Zones and notably in emerging markets.\n\nAll major brands grew, with an exceptional run of innovations in  all  categories:  in  makeup,  with Sky  High mascara  by Maybelline, which  was  the  most  successful  launch  in  the brand's history; in haircare, with premium innovations such as Dream Lengths Wonder Water by Els\u00e8ve, or L'Or\u00e9al Fall Resist in  mainland  China;and  in  skincare,  with  Garnier's  hugely successful Vitamin C Serum in many countries in the SAPMENA and Latin America Zones. NYX Professional Makeup also  had an  exceptional  year,  boosted  by  major  launches  and  new types  of  partnerships,  such  as  the  one  with  hit  Netflix  series Money Heist ( La Casa de Papel ). L'Or\u00e9al Paris strengthened its position  as  the  world's  number  one  beauty  brand  with  sales exceeding 6 billion euros.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al Luxe\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  recorded  strong  growth  at  +20.9%  like-for-like and  +21.3%  reported, in  a  global  luxury  beauty  market  that confirmed  its  recovery  and  saw  a  return  close  to  pre-Covid levels.\n\nThe Division achieved remarkable, balanced performance, by category, geographic Zone and distribution network, and has become the largest Division  of  the  Group.  L'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  took full advantage of the complementarity between its distribution channels, with a balanced acceleration of online and offline sales.",

In  a less  dynamic  makeup  market,  performance  was  driven  by Lanc\u00f4me and Shu Uemura .\n\nThe  Division strengthened  its  position  across  all  Zones, recording  significant  market  share  gains  in  North  Asia  and excellent performance in Europe. Following the reorganisation of  its  distribution  network  in  North  America,  sales  are  again accelerating in this Zone.\n\nAt  the  end  of  the  year,  L'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  finalised  the  acquisition of Youth to the People .\n\n## Active cosmetics\n\n## The Active Cosmetics Division ended the year with exceptional growth at +31.8% like-for-like and +30.3% reported.\n\nThe Division significantly outperformed a booming dermocosmetics market in 2021, with health having become a  core  concern  for  consumers.  It  strengthened  an  already solid relationship with healthcare professionals and confirmed its leadership in dermocosmetic recommendations.\n\nActive Cosmetics posted strong growth across all Zones, with exceptional  performance  in  North  America  and  North  Asia. Offline  sales  saw  a  return  to  strong  double-digit  growth  and online sales were exceptionally buoyant, exceeding one billion euros.\n\nThe Division's major brands reported vigorous growth. La Roche-Posay more than doubled its growth rate compared with 2020, thanks to cutting edge innovations such as Effaclar serum  and Lipikar  EczemaMED, which  is  revolutionising  the treatment  of  eczema. Vichy strengthened  its  leadership  in anti-aging  in  Europe,  particularly  in  skincare  for  menopausal women,  while  accelerating  in  Latin  America  and  North America. SkinCeuticals continued to gather momentum, with the success of Silymarin CF confirming its antioxidant expertise. CeraVe saw spectacular growth for the second year running, in both the United States and the rest of the world.\n\n## Summary by geographic Zone\n\n## Europe\n\n## The  Zone  ended  the  year  up  +10.1%  like-for-like  and  +10.7% reported, and is almost back to its 2019 level like-for-like.\n\nThe  beauty  market  recovered  across  Europe  in  2021  but remained below 2019 levels. L'Or\u00e9al significantly outperformed the European market, driven by a new surge in its online sales and digital leadership. The Group strengthened its position in the vast majority of countries, particularly the United Kingdom, Germany,  France,  Russia  and  the  Scandinavian  countries.\n\nIt  also  gained  market  share  in  all  its  strategic  categories: skincare, haircare,makeup and fragrances.\n\nActive  Cosmetics  delivered  particularly  dynamic  growth, driven by the continued success of CeraVe and La  Roche-Posay.  Despite  the  closure  of  salons  in  several countries  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,  the  Professional Products Division returned to significantly higher performance levels  than  in  2019,  thanks  to  keen  interest  in  its  entire catalogue  and  the  success  of K\u00e9rastase  and  L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel innovations. L'Or\u00e9al Luxe confirmed its leadership in  fragrances,  with  excellent  starts  for Alien  Goddess by Mugler and Luna Rossa Ocean by Prada, and  the strengthening  of  mainstays  like La  Vie  Est  Belle by  Lanc\u00f4me and Libre by  Yves  Saint  Laurent.

In the  last  quarter,  L'Or\u00e9al  China  achieved  like-for-like  growth  of more  than  50%  compared  with  2019.  During  the  Double  11 festival on Tmall, L'Or\u00e9al broke all records and reported further market  share  gains,  confirming  its  brands'  appeal  to  Chinese consumers. The iconic consumer event established L'Or\u00e9al Paris and Lanc\u00f4me as the beauty market No.1 and No.3; Yves Saint Laurent took  the  top  slot  in  makeup,  while  K\u00e9rastase led  the field  in  haircare.  Winning  the  Best  Innovation  award  from ByteDance (TikTok) demonstrates L'Or\u00e9al China's edge in terms of digital activation and brand building.\n\nTravel Retail also continued to grow well thanks to its booming business  in  Hainan,  while  maintaining  the  appeal  of  Group brands.\n\n## SAPMENA - SSA (1)\n\n## The  Zone  grew  by  +13.9%  like-for-like  and  +10.0%  based  on reported figures.\n\nIn SAPMENA, in a volatile context related to the resurgence of the pandemic, e-commerce accelerated. In South-East Asia, L'Or\u00e9al saw a return to pre-Covid levels in the fourth quarter, with Vietnam achieving remarkable performance, boosted by the online sales boom. The Pacific countries recovered thanks to  the  plans  put  in  place  to  stimulate  demand.  India  and Pakistan  continued  to  deliver  solid  performance.  The  Gulf region,hosting  the  World  Expo  in  Dubai,  maintained  growth momentum.\n\nThe Consumer Products Division recorded good performance, thanks to Garnier's haircare lines and the gradual recovery of Maybelline  New  York.  L'Or\u00e9al  Luxe  reported  exceptional performance  in  fragrances,  with  Yves  Saint  Laurent  and Armani.  Growth  for  the  Professional  Products  Division  was\n\ndriven by K\u00e9rastase.

Although  malls  and  professional  salons  experienced  lower footfall  throughout  the  year,  the  beauty  market  nonetheless reported strong growth.\n\nAgainst  this  backdrop,  L'Or\u00e9al  achieved  significant  market share  gains,  with  remarkable  performance  in  Mexico,  Brazil and  Chile.  Growth  was  driven  by  e-commerce  and  offline sales:  the  Group's  brands  welcomed  consumers  returning  to stores  with  targeted  activation,  while  continuing  their  digital engagement  and  online  activation,  leveraging  key  online events such as Buen Fin and Black Friday.\n\nMajor categories posted strong growth, driven by the launch of superior innovations as well as the success of iconic brands and  products,  most  notably  in  haircare,  skincare  and fragrances.  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  increased  its  market  share  gains  in Brazil, Mexico and Chile, thanks to the highly successful launch of  Els\u00e8ve Hidra  Hialur\u00f4nico and  the  activation  of Revitalift.

The Group achieves this through compliance with the directives of the authorities in the countries in which it operates, the application and adaptation of its worldwide, high management standards for health and safety at its operational sites and in business travel situations (see section 4.3.2 of this document).\n\nSince  the  start  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to  taking  action  on  social  issues,  considering  itself responsible for working with its stakeholders, particularly with its suppliers (see section 4.3.1.2 'Involving suppliers in the Group's transformation' of this document), by offering them online training on safety measures in the context of the pandemic, and also its employees with remote working, online training and specific information on cyber security.\n\n1",

L'Or\u00e9al's investment policy responds to long-term objectives\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  a  growing  manufacturing  company  thanks  largely to two types of investments:\n\n- 1. scientific and  manufacturing  investments,  which  are described  in  several  sections  of  this  document  (see sections 1.2.6. 'The bet on research, safety and innovation' and 1.27. 'Operations, expertise and services closer  to  consumers  for  lasting  performance'  of  this document); and\n- 2. marketing  investments,  which  are  made  on  an  ongoing basis  and  are  inherent  to  the  Group's  activities  in  the cosmetics  industry.  Indeed,  winning  new  market  share requires  in-depth  and  situation-specific  studies,  as  well  as advertising and promotional expenses attuned not only to the familiarity of brands and their competitive position, but also  to  constant  changes  in  consumers'  aspirations  something that the subsidiaries' sales and marketing teams monitor  constantly.  Lastly,  investments  in  point-of  sale (POS)  advertising  materials  ensure  optimal  presence  for our brands in points of sale.\n\nFor  reasons  relating  to  strategy  and  competition,  L'Or\u00e9al cannot therefore provide any systematic information on future investments.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group's  investments  totaled  \u20ac1,075.20  million,  or 3.3% of its sales. This level reflects the Group's constant efforts to  improve  manufacturing  efficiency,  research  and  digital development performance and enhance brand value.\n\nInvestment  commitments  in  2021  can  be  broken  down  as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 production  and  the  physical  supply  chain  represented approximately 25% of total investments;\n- \u00b7 marketing  investments,  including  moulds,  POS  advertising materials and stores accounted for 31%;\n- \u00b7 IT investments spread over all these categories represented 29% of total investments; and\n- \u00b7 research  and  the  head  offices  in  the  different  countries accounted for the remainder.\n\nSee notes 3.2.2., 7.2. and 14.2. to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for more details on these investments.\n\nDespite their strategic nature, none of these investments taken individually is material enough at Group level to warrant more detailed disclosure.\n\n## 1.3.2. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): shared and lasting growth\n\n## Priority to Human Capital\n\nAs  our  founder  Eug\u00e8ne  Schueller  declared  with  conviction: 'a  company  is  not  walls  and  machines  but  people,  people and more people.'\n\nThe  Group's  employees,  who  are  strategic  intangible  assets, are one of the Group's main competitive advantages in the long  term,  alongside  its  portfolio  of  brands,  its  governance, Research  and  Innovation,  data  and  technology  with  its transformation to Beauty Tech.\n\nThe  Group's  human  and  social  project  is  based  around  two priorities:  developing  the  individual  performance  of  all  its employees on the one hand, and social performance on the other,  which  is  illustrated  by  the  global  Share  &  Care programme.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has always targeted constant, sustainable growth.\n\nSince  its  very  beginnings,  the  Group  has  been  committed  to developing its presence in all regions of the world by applying the  fundamental  rules  of  a  good  corporate  citizen.  The products  offered  to  consumers  meet  the  highest  quality standards; the Group's social commitments are the same in all\n\nits  subsidiaries;  all  production  centres  comply  with  the  same rules  aimed  at  reducing  their  environmental  footprint.  Social audits  are  conducted  on  the  suppliers  of  the  plants  and distribution centres.\n\nAs far as its resources allow, each subsidiary takes part in the financing  of  sponsorship  initiatives  in  keeping  with  the  key pillars  of  the  Group's  commitment to philanthropy: Research, women  and  the  environment.  Above  and  beyond  its  solid long-term  economic  performances,  L'Or\u00e9al  seeks  to  be exemplary and sets itself demanding standards in order to limit its environmental footprint.\n\nMore  consumers  and  more  growth,  for  L'Or\u00e9al,  necessarily imply  more  responsibilities.  The  Group  intends  to  develop  its activity with the utmost respect for the planet, and to improve its social and economic impact on the life of the people and communities that surround it. It is for this reason that, in 2013, in the context of its Sharing Beauty with All programme, and in 2020  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  set itself  ambitious  Sustainable  Development  Goals  that  were formalised and structured at a strategic level.",

L'Or\u00e9al placed  sustainability  at  the  heart  of  its  strategy,  with  the launch in 2013 of the S haring Beauty With All programme with 2020  targets  focused  on  sustainable  production,  sustainable innovation,  sustainable  consumption  and  shared  growth.  By the end of 2020, the Group had reduced CO2 emissions from its  plants  and  distribution  centres  by  81%  compared  to  2005, while  production  volumes  increased  by  29%  over  the  same period.  By  the  end  of  2020,  72  industrial  sites  were  carbon neutral (using 100% renewable energy), including 19 plants.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme marks the launch of a new  phase  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  sustainable  development  approach, with the intention of building on  the  Group's  earlier achievements  to  accelerate  its  transformation  towards  an increasingly  sustainable  business  model.  L'Or\u00e9al  wants  to engage its entire ecosystem and demonstrate that companies can be part of the solution to the environmental and societal challenges  the  world  is  facing.  Today,  their  acceleration promotes  a  much  more  radical  transformation.  Since  April 2019,  seven  groups  of  internal  experts  have  coordinated\n\nindependent  studies  and  collaborated  with  outside  partners and  civil  society  to  define  the  next  steps  in  L'Or\u00e9al's sustainable development transformation.\n\nIn  June  2020,  the  Group  announced  its  new  sustainability programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  (see  chapter  4  of  this document),  with  a  new  set  of  ambitious  objectives  for  2030, based on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 transform L'Or\u00e9al activities to remain within the 'planetary boundaries' defined by environmental science;\n- \u00b7 associate the Group's ecosystem in its transformation for a more sustainable world; and\n- \u00b7 contribute to meeting the great environmental challenges by creating different funds to promote the regeneration of nature,  the  circular  economy  and  women  in  vulnerable situations.\n\nIn order to reconcile its needs to preserve a planet with limited resources, L'Or\u00e9al has raised its goals and defined targets for improvement  by  2030  that  cover  all  its  direct  and  indirect impacts, related for example to the activity of its suppliers or the use of its products by consumers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1",

AN ORGANISATION SERVING THE GROUP'S DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Group's organisation responds to a dual challenge: pursuing the strategy which has enabled  L'Or\u00e9al  to  be  successful  over  the  last  110  years  and  at  the  same  time inventing the new L'Or\u00e9al of the future, perfectly matched to an ever-changing world.\n\n## 1.4.1. L'Or\u00e9al S.A.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  is  a  French  company,  with  its  head  office  in France. It performs a domestic sales activity in France and an export sales activity in its operating territory. At the same time, L'Or\u00e9al S.A. also acts as the holding company and provides on the  one  hand  strategic  coordination,  and  scientific  and technical  coordination  for  the  Group  throughout  the  world  on the other hand.\n\nThe subsidiaries  operate  the  Group's  business  activities  in  the country  or  region  in  which  they  are  located.  To  do  so,  they define  the  development  strategy  specific  to  their  market, make the most suitable choices in terms of consumer targets and  distribution  channels,  and  manufacture,  directly  or indirectly,  and  market  the  brands  they  decide  to  sell  on their market.\n\nAlmost all  of  the  subsidiaries  are  owned  by  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.  which has a holding or control percentage equal or close to 100% (1) . The detailed list of these subsidiaries is set out in the notes to the consolidated and parent company financial statements.\n\n## 1.4.2. Operational Divisions\n\nThe  Group's  business  activities  are  organised  into  four Operational  Divisions.  In  the  markets,  each  of  these  Divisions develops  and  enhances  its  brand  portfolio  with  consumers (see section 1.2.1. 'L'Or\u00e9al Group Profile' of this document).\n\n## 1.4.3. Geographic zones\n\nThe  Group's  international  development  led  L'Or\u00e9al,  from 1  January  2021,  to  change  its  organisation  to  give  more coherence  to  each  Zone,  particularly  in  terms  of  consumer behaviour  and  market  maturity,  in  order  to  create  the conditions for a cross-functional transformation of the organisation and maximise growth.\n\nThus  the  geographic  zones,  each  of  which  has  operational responsibility for the subsidiaries in their country, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Europe Zone comprises Western and Eastern Europe;\n- \u00b7 North America Zone;\n- \u00b7 North  Asia  Zone  brings  together  mainland  China,  Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea;\n- \u00b7 SAPMENA - SSA Zone incorporates South Asia, the Pacific, the Middle East, North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa; and\n- \u00b7 Latin America Zone.\n\n## 1.4.4. Support Divisions\n\nSeveral specialist corporate departments provide their expertise and  support  to  the  Operational  Divisions,  to subsidiaries in their markets and to the other business activities (see section 1.2.1. 'Group Profile' of this document).\n\nBy  establishing  the  Group-wide  multi-division  Travel  Retail Department, the Group has given itself the resources to grow this  influential  segment  using  a  global  shopper  strategy:  a bespoke approach designed, at the destinations favoured by each nationality, to personalise the experience on the basis of the language, culture and beauty rituals of travellers.",

INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  constantly  changing  environment and like any company, L'Or\u00e9al is necessarily exposed to risks which,  if  they  were  to  materialise,  could  have  a  negative impact  on  its  business  activities,  its  financial  position  and  its assets, particularly in terms of reputation and image.\n\nIn order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate and  manage  the  risks  to  which  it  is  exposed  in  its  different areas of activity.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's risk management consists in identifying, assessing and controlling  risks  that  may  affect  the  smooth  running  of  the Company. It also participates in the Group's development by promoting  good  use  of  resources  to  minimise  the  impact  of negative events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.\n\nBy  contributing  to  preventing  and  managing  the  risks  to  which the Group is exposed, the purpose of the Internal Control system is to enable  the  Group's  manufacturing  and  economic development to take place in a steady and sustainable manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group's businesses.\n\nAt  L'Or\u00e9al,  Internal  Control  is  a  system  that  applies  to  the Company  and  its  consolidated  subsidiaries  and  aims  at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  assets  and  reputation  are  valued  and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nThe control environment, which is critical to the Internal Control system,  good  risk  management  and  the  application  of procedures,  is  based  on  behaviour,  the  organisational structure and employees. At L'Or\u00e9al, it forms part of a culture of rigour and commitment  communicated  by  senior management and in line with the Group's strategic choices.\n\nRisk management and Internal Control is everyone's business, from the governance bodies to all employees.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  system  is  the  subject  of  ongoing supervision in order to verify whether it is relevant and meets the Group's objectives and addresses its issues.\n\nSee also Chapter 3 'Risk factors and control environment' of this document, which includes, in particular, details regarding the identification and management of the most significant risks from  the  point  of  view  of  investment  decision-making,  within the meaning of the regulations, listed in the table below.\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with the laws and regulations in force and the Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n\n## Major risks to which the Group believes it is exposed\n\n|                                    |                                                                            | Residual importance   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Business risks                     | Sanitary crisis*                                                           | Significant           |\n|                                    | Information and cybersecurity systems*                                     | Significant           |\n|                                    | Geographic presence and economic and political environment*                | Significant           |\n|                                    | Crisis management                                                          | Moderate              |\n|                                    | Data                                                                       | Moderate              |\n|                                    | Market and Innovation                                                      | Moderate              |\n|                                    | Business ethics                                                            | Moderate              |\n|                                    | Sales distribution networks                                                | Moderate              |\n|                                    | Human Resources risk                                                       | Limited               |\n|                                    | Product quality and safety                                                 | Limited               |\n|                                    | Safety of people and property                                              | Limited               |\n| Industrial and environmental risks | Product availability*                                                      | Significant           |\n|                                    | Climate change                                                             | Significant           |\n|                                    | Environment and safety                                                     | Limited               |\n| Legal and regulatory risks         | Risk of non-conformity*                                                    | Moderate              |\n|                                    | Intellectual property: trademarks, designs & models, domain names, patents | Limited               |\n|                                    | Product claims                                                             | Limited               |\n| Financial and market risks         | Currency risk*                                                             | Limited               |\n|                                    | Risk on financial equity interests                                         | Limited               |\n|                                    | Risk relating to the impairment of intangible assets                       | Limited               |\n\n- * Most material risks in each category.\n\n1",

It includes the complete text of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors.\n\nAll components of the remuneration of directors and corporate officers are provided, as is the trading  in  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  reported  by  directors  and  corporate  officers  in  2021,  and  the remuneration policy pursuant to Article L. 22-10-8 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## 2.1. FRAMEWORK FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES\n\n## 2.1.1. AFEP-MEDEF Code: the reference Code\n\nThe Code of Corporate Governance to which the Company refers  is  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code.  This  code  may  be  consulted online at the following address: http://www.medef.com/.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-37, section 6 of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  this  chapter  includes  a specific  section  of  the  Management  Report  on  corporate governance and reports on the following, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Board's  composition  and  application  of  the  principle of balanced gender representation on the Board;\n- \u00b7 the  ways  in  which  the  Board's  work  is  prepared  and organised;\n- \u00b7 the remuneration policy for directors and corporate officers;\n- \u00b7 information  relating  to  the  remuneration  and  benefits  of any  kind  for  directors  and  corporate  officers  during  the previous financial year pursuant to Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code; and\n- \u00b7 limitations placed by the Board of Directors on the powers of the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe other information included in the particular section of the Management Report dedicated to corporate governance is published in chapter 7 of this document, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 the table summarising the authorisations in force granted by the  Annual  General  Meeting  (see  section  7.2.2.  'Issued share capital and authorised unissued share capital' of this document);\n- \u00b7 the special rules for shareholder participation in the Annual General  Meeting  or  the  provisions  of  the  Articles  of Association  providing  for  these  rules  (see  section  7.1.11. 'Annual General Meeting' of this document); and\n- \u00b7 the  elements  with  the  potential  to  have  an  impact  in  the event of a public offer for the purchase or exchange of the Company's securities (see section 7.3. 'Shareholder structure' of this document).\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code,  this  chapter  identifies,  in  a  summary  table,  those provisions  of  the  Code  which  were  not  applied  and  explains the reasons for that choice (see section 2.5. 'Summary table of the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  which  have not been applied' of this document).\n\n## 2.1.2. Procedures for exercising the General Management: Separation of the functions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since 1 May 2021\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has a method of corporate governance that is suited to its specificities and is part of a constant quest for progress.\n\nThe procedures for conducting the General Management of L'Or\u00e9al have always been decided in the best interest of the Company and with the constant concern that  the  mode  of governance  chosen  will  make  it  possible  to  optimise  the Group's financial and economic performances and to create the most favourable conditions for its long-term development.\n\nAfter  a  period  of  5  years  (between  2006  and  2011)  during which  the  duties  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors and those of Chief Executive Officer were separated in order to ensure a smooth transition between Sir Lindsay Owen-Jones and  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided in 2011 to merge these positions and to appoint Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  as  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors responsible for the Company's  General Management (Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of L'Or\u00e9al), roles that he held until 30 April 2021.\n\nAs  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association  do  not  provide  for any exception to the legal retirement age of 65 years for the Chief  Executive  Officer,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  was  required to  hand  over  his  duties  as  Chief  Executive  Officer  before 6 July 2021.\n\nOn  his  recommendation,  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee  initiated  the  process  to  appoint  the  future  Chief Executive Officer.\n\nOn  14  October  2020,  on  the  recommendation  of  the Nominations and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors announced its intention to dissociate the functions of Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  renew  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's mandate as Chairman of the  Board  of  Directors,  a  position  he had held since 2011, and appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nMr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  joined  L'Or\u00e9al  34  years  ago.  He  held various positions in marketing before being named to General Management  (L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  France,  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris  World  and L'Or\u00e9al Mexico). In 2008, Mr Jean-Paul Agon appointed him as",

        "page_content": "General Manager of the L'Or\u00e9al Professional Products Division and welcomed him to the Executive  Committee.  In  January 2011,  he  was  appointed  Chief  Executive  Officer  of  L'Or\u00e9al Luxe,  a  role  that  he  held  until  the  end  of  2018.  In  2013, he became Chief Executive Officer of the Selective Divisions (Luxury,  Active  Cosmetics,  Professional  Products).  He  was named Deputy CEO in charge of Divisions in May 2017.\n\nThis new governance took effect on 1 May 2021, by decision of  the  Board  of  Directors  at  the  meeting  held  following  the company's Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2021.\n\nThe proposed organisation guarantees the sustainability of the performance, values and commitments of the Group, as well as the quality of its governance.\n\nThe Board of Directors and Mr Nicolas Hieronimus benefit from Mr Jean-Paul Agon's successful and recognised experience in both  positions.  The  Board  of  Directors  can  count  on  his\n\nexpertise  in  matters  of  governance  to  meet  the  growing expectations of the Group's stakeholders.\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus will provide his expertise in the cosmetics market and his intimate knowledge of L'Or\u00e9al acquired during a  34-year  career  with  the  Group,  as  well  as  his  vision  of  the future  of  beauty  to  implement  the  strategic  guidelines  of  the coming  years.  The  Board  is  convinced  that  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus  will  be  able  to  take  advantage  of  all  the opportunities  offered  by  a  fast-changing  world  to  adapt  the Group and reinvent it in keeping with its values, commitments and purpose ( raison d'\u00eatre ) to 'Create the beauty that moves the world'.\n\nThe  Board,  which  considers  the  participation  of  the  Chief Executive Officer in the discussions of the Board of Directors to be  essential,  submitted  his  appointment  as  a  Director  for approval at the Annual General Meeting held on 20 April 2021, of which 99.21% approved his appointment.\n\n## 2.1.3. Balance of power within the Board of Directors\n\n## 2.1.3.1. Key role of the composition and functioning of the Board of Directors\n\n## A harmonious composition\n\nThe  balance  of  powers  on  the  Board  of  Directors  principally rests on its coherent and harmonious composition and on the qualities of its Directors.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Board of Directors is made up of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, three Directors (one of whom  is  Vice-Chairman  of  the  Board)  from  the  Bettencourt Meyers family, two Directors (one of whom is Vice-Chairman of the Board) linked to Nestl\u00e9, seven independent Directors and two Directors representing the employees.\n\nThus  50%  of  the  Board  are  independent  Directors,  who  are highly committed  and  fully  play  their  role  given  their backgrounds and experience. They all hold responsibilities at the  highest  level  in  major  international  groups,  which  allows them to understand all the dimensions of L'Or\u00e9al's operations, clarify Board discussions and interact effectively with General Management.\n\nAll  Board  members  participate  in  the  discussions  and  are  a driving  force  for  ideas  in  terms  of  the  smooth  running  of  the Board.  The  diversity  and  complementarity  of  the  Directors' experience  and  expertise  (entrepreneurial,  financial,  extrafinancial, including human resources and sustainable development, industrial,  digital,  etc.)  enable  them  to  quickly and thoroughly understand the development issues facing the L'Or\u00e9al Group,  the  leader  in the highly competitive, globalised  cosmetics  market  in  which  the  requirement  to innovate and adapt is very high.\n\n## Specialised active and effective Committees of the Board\n\nThe establishment of Board Committees, their composition and responsibilities  contribute  to  a  good  balance  of  power  and are a point of attention for the Board of Directors. In fact, the Board has set up specialised committees to help all Directors carry  out  their  main  duties  collectively.  The  term  of  office, composition  and  operating  procedures  of  the  Board  are defined in its Internal Rules, which are published by the Board of  Directors  (see  section  2.3.3.  'Activities  of  the  Board Committees' of this document).\n\nAll Committees have a high number of independent Directors: 60% for the Audit Committee and the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, and 50% for the Nominations and Governance  Committee.  The  Chairman  of  each  of  these Committees is independent. Only the Strategy and Sustainability  Committee,  the  organisation  of  which  is  not regulated, is chaired by a non-independent Director within the meaning of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. Two Directors representing employees  sit  on  two  of  the  Board  committees:  one  is  a member  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  and  the  other  is  a  member  of  the  Audit Committee.  The  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  is  a member  of,  and  chairs,  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability Committee.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  not  a  member  of any Committee.\n\nThese  committees  are  completely  free  to  draw  up  their respective agendas. They report on their work to the Board of Directors,  whose  meetings  they  prepare  and  to  which  they make proposals.\n\nAs  part  of  its  review  of  its  activities  at  the  end  of  2021,  the Board  again  emphasised  the  quality  of  the  work  and recommendations of its Committees, which helped to inform its decisions.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nSince  2019,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  met  in  executive sessions, at one or two meetings per year.\n\nThe  Board  considers  that  these  meetings,  which  are  not attended by any corporate officers or any employees of the Group, contribute to good governance. Initially, the Chairman of  the  Board  of  Directors  is  asked  to  attend  these  meetings; after this, they may be held without his or her attendance.\n\n## Regular evaluation of the organisation and functioning of the Board\n\nAs  part  of  the  annual  assessment  of  the  way  the  Board operates, each year Directors set themselves new objectives to  improve  the  quality  of  their  organisation.  They  seek  to achieve optimum effectiveness and ensure that they have the necessary assets to carry out their duties successfully and with complete freedom to act.\n\n2",

Relationships between the Board and General Management\n\n## Powers and duties of the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of  Directors  stipulate  that  the Chief Executive Officer is vested with the broadest powers to act  in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company,  in compliance  with  the  limits  set  by  the  Board;  however, transactions  of  a  significant  amount  or  falling  outside  the Company's  normal  course  of  business  are  submitted  to  the Board of Directors (see section 1.2.2 of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors).\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus exercises these powers within the limit of the  Company's  purpose  subject  to  the  powers  expressly granted by French law to Annual General Meetings and the Board of Directors.\n\nHe represents the Company in its dealings with third parties.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer communicates  completely transparently  with  all  the  Directors  and  keeps  them  regularly informed  of  all  aspects  of  the  Company's  affairs  and  its performances. He is required to provide each Director with all documents and information required to perform their remit.\n\nMore  specifically,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  provides  the Board members with useful information in connection with the preparation of meetings, or at any time during the life of the Company if the importance or urgency of the information so requires. This provision of ongoing information also includes any relevant  information  concerning  the  Company,  and  in particular  press  articles  and  reports  containing  financial analysis.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer gives the Board  and  its Committees the possibility to meet with the senior managers of L'Or\u00e9al within the strict framework of their remits and duties. In consultation  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Board  and the Committees may use external consultants if they consider it necessary.\n\nThe  Board  is  informed,  at  the  time  of  closing  of  the  annual financial  statements  and  the  review  of  the  interim  financial statements or at any other time if necessary, of the Company's financial position and cash position.\n\nThus,  the  Board  has  the  resources  it  needs  to  manage,  with complete  freedom,  the  issues  that  concern  it,  in  particular when this involves determining the strategic orientations of the company,  ensuring  and  monitoring  the  implementation  and overseeing the good management thereof.\n\nThe Board provides the General Management with invaluable support  for  strategic  decision-making  through  its  reflections and the impetus it provides.\n\n## Duties of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board stipulate the following duties of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, in his capacity as Chairman of the Board of Directors: 'The Chairman of the Board of Directors organises and  oversees  the  Board's  work  and  reports  thereon  to  the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman is actively involved in defining the Company's growth  strategy  and  encourages  and  strengthens,  inter  alia, links  between  the  Company  and  the  main  market  players. The  Chairman  oversees  the  work  of  the  Company's  bodies responsible for corporate  governance  and  ensures,  in particular,  that  the  Directors  are  able  to  perform  their  duties. He  may  ask  for  the  communication  of  any  document  or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board must use his best efforts to promote the  values  and  image  of  the  Company  at  all  times.

They  complement  one  another  due  to  their  different professional  experience,  their  skills  and  their  international exposure.\n\nThe  Board  is  attentive  to  maintaining  a  balance  between Directors  with  historical  knowledge  of  the  Company  and Directors who have joined the Board more recently.\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE OF THE DIVERSITY POLICY APPLIED TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n| Criteria                                                                                                                                                            | Policy and objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Means of implementation and outcomes  achieved in 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| with the Internal Rules: \u25cf and \u25cf                                                                                                                                    | Search  for  generational  balance  beyond  compliance no more than one-third of Directors over the age of 70; in  principle,  it  is  agreed  that  Directors  must  resign Directors  are  aged  between  33  and  68,  with  an average age of 55.3.

As to the significance of the business relationship, and in keeping with French Financial Markets Authority - AMF recommendations, the Board of Directors carried  out  a  quantitative  and  qualitative  analysis,  adopting  a  wide  multi-criteria  approach  (duration  and  continuity, importance  of  the  business  relationship  for  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  Director,  and  organisation  of  the  relationship).

Responsible Directors\n\nWithin the scope of French law and the rights and obligations of the Directors as defined in the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors of L'Or\u00e9al, and in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code,  Directors  are  subject  to  compliance  with  the  rules  in force  with  regard  to  conflicts  of  interest  and  stock  market ethics  upon  their  appointment  as  a  Director  and  throughout their term of office.\n\n## Selection of responsible Directors\n\nDirectors  are  appointed,  subject  to  a  vote  of  the  Annual General  Meeting,  following  a  selection  process.  This  process determines  the  Director  profiles  required  by  the  Company  in terms  of  skills,  qualifications  and  experience  needed  to complement those of the Directors already appointed. Issues such as candidates' availability, numbers of directorships held and  independence  are  also  considered  (see  section  2.2.1.2. 'Diversity policy applied to the Board of Directors: experienced Directors who complement one another' of this document).  Thanks  to  this  selection  process  applied  by  the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  and  the  Board  of Directors,  the  Annual  General  Meeting  is  able  to  appoint responsible Directors capable of exercising complete freedom of  judgement.  This  freedom  of  judgement  allows  Directors  to participate, independently, in the work and joint decisions of the  Board  and  the  activities  of  the  Committees.  Particular attention is also paid to directorships held in other companies; Directors  are  required  to  devote  the  necessary  time  and attention  to  their  duties  and  limit  the  number  of  their directorships  to  ensure  their  availability  (see  section  3.3. 'Obligations of due diligence and provision of information' of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, reproduced in full in section 2.3.5. of this document).\n\nWhen joining the Board of Directors, each Director receives a copy  of  the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  and  the  Articles  of Association  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  Stock  Market  Ethics  Code,  the Code of Ethics, etc. These codes adopted by the Company serve  as  a  frame  of  reference  for  Directors  in  terms  of  the standards required by L'Or\u00e9al in this area. As soon as they take up their office, Directors will also receive support in the form of dedicated  meetings  with,  in  particular,  the  Chairman  of  the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Secretary of the Board and  the  Chairman  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee.\n\nMembers  of  the  Board  of  Directors  require  the  necessary objectivity  to  make  an  independent  judgement  on  the conduct of the Company's business. The balance of powers established  within  the  Board  allows  its  members  to  exercise independent judgment. The Board is composed of:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chief Executive Officer, who directly contributes to the work, discussions  and, ultimately, the decisions taken by the Board;\n- \u00b7 the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  who  is  responsible  for developing and maintaining an ongoing relationship of trust between  the  Board  and  the  General  Management, particularly in view of his expertise in matters of governance and the  quality  of  his  discussions  with  the  Chief  Executive Officer, based on a relationship of trust established over the course of many years;\n- \u00b7 Directors  from  major  shareholders  that  have  a  specific interest in the long-term performance of the Company;\n\n- \u00b7 seven  independent  Directors  with  experience  as  senior managers of large international groups, whose independence of  thought,  sense  of  perspective  and  freedom  of  speech enable  them  to  challenge  and  support  the  General Management in defining the Group's strategy; and\n- \u00b7 two Directors representing employees who have extensive knowledge  of  the  Company  (see  section  2.2.1.3.  'Two Directors representing the employees since July 2014' of this document).\n\n## Responsible exercise of office\n\nTo maintain a high standard, the Board of Directors, based on the  work  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee, shall ensure that, throughout their term of office, Directors are able to act in the best interests of the Company, with all the due  diligence  and  care  required  and  subject  to  a  strict confidentiality and loyalty obligation.\n\nDirectors  must  keep  the  Board  informed  of  the  directorships they  hold  in  other  companies,  including  any  involvement  in Board Committees of such French or foreign companies. They are  required  to  notify  the  Board  of  any  situation  that  may constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if  such  conflict  is  only potential, and  must  refrain from participating in the corresponding deliberations.\n\nIn  addition,  each  year  all  Directors  must  issue  a  declaration relating to potential conflicts of interest between their duties to L'Or\u00e9al  and  their  private  or  professional  interests,  specifically with  regard  to  other  directorships  and  roles.  Based  on  these declarations,  the  Board  of  Directors  has  not  identified  any conflict of interests on the date they were issued pursuant to Delegated European Regulation No. 2019/980 supplementing Regulation No. 2017/1129, known as 'Prospectus 3'.\n\nUsing this annual declaration, all relevant information about the Directors  (such  as  their  qualifications,  shareholding  in  the Company,  membership  of  the  board  of  directors  of  other companies, or management positions held in other companies, and  the  fact  that  they  are  considered  independent  by  the Company)  are  made  public.  The  individual  attendance  of Directors  at  meetings  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the Committees of which they are members is also reported.\n\nThe  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  conducts  an annual review of the summary table prepared by the Company of  the  financial  flows  that  occurred  during  the  financial  year between L'Or\u00e9al and interested parties as defined by regulations in order to report to the Board of Directors as part of the regular procedure to evaluate current agreements signed under normal terms  pursuant  to  Article  L.  22-10-12  of  the  French  Commercial Code.  In  case  of  doubts  about  the  classification  of  an agreement,  the  Committee  must  verify  that  the  transactions have been concluded in ordinary course of business and under normal conditions, so that the Board of Directors can implement the procedure for related-party agreements when necessary. In this  case,  the  persons  directly  or  indirectly  interested  in  this agreement do not participate in the assessment. In accordance with  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the  recommendations  of  the French Financial Markets Authority - AMF, the Board of Directors, based  on  the  work  carried  out  by  the  Nominations  and Governance Committee, also analyses each year any possible business relationships between L'Or\u00e9al and companies in which independent Directors hold directorships or perform functions, to ensure these relationships are not significant (see section 2.2.1.4. 'Independent Directors' of this document).\n\nThe information described in Annex 1 of Delegated European Regulation No. 2019/980 set out hereafter contains additional details in this respect.",

'Shareholders'  agreements relating  to  the  securities  comprising  the  Company's  share capital' of this document).\n\nThe Company was informed of the participation, amounting to 100  shares,  of  its  Chairman,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  in  the collective  lock-up  agreements  signed  on  16  December  2016 by T\u00e9thys SAS and members of the Bettencourt Meyers family group under the Dutreil law. The Nominations and Governance  Committee  Meeting  of  6  December  2016 examined  this arrangement  prior to signature of the agreement and considered that it could not be contested on the  basis  of  the  Company's  interests,  nor  could  it  lead  to consequences for the Company's governance, and informed the Board of Directors accordingly.\n\nComposition of the Board of Directors\n\n## Information on service contracts with members of the administrative bodies (Article 12.2 of the Appendix)\n\nNo directors or corporate officers have a service contract with L'Or\u00e9al  or  any  of  its  subsidiaries  providing  for  the  granting  of benefits upon termination of such contract.\n\n## Stock market ethics\n\nThe  Board  noted  the  rules  to  be  applied  to  prevent  insider trading, in particular those resulting from European Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on Market Abuse which became applicable on  3  July  2016,  and  the  recommendations  of  the  French Financial  Markets  Authority  -  AMF,  in  particular  regarding  the periods  during  which  it  is  prohibited  from  trading  in  shares.  It decided to amend its Internal Rules accordingly.\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  legal  provisions,  regulations  and  market recommendations, L'Or\u00e9al's Stock Market Ethics Code points out that inside information must only be passed on and used for professional purposes.\n\nInside information is information of a precise nature, which has not  been  made  public  and  which,  if  it  were  made  public, would  likely  to  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  share  price. Such inside information may fall into one of three categories: strategic,  linked  to  the  definition  and  application  of  the Group's  development  policy;  recurring,  linked  to  the  annual schedule for production and publication of annual and interim financial  statements,  regular  releases  or  periodic  meetings devoted  to  financial  information;  exceptional,  linked  to  a specific programme, project or financial transaction.\n\nThe  Stock  Market  Code  of  Ethics  restates  the  ban  on  any person  in  possession  of  insider  information  from  executing  or ordering  the  execution  of  financial  transactions  on  L'Or\u00e9al shares, and emphasises that any misconduct in this area may result  in  criminal  proceedings. The Internal Rules of the Board specifically  ask  Directors  to  refrain  from  trading  in  L'Or\u00e9al shares precisely in certain periods and when they have access to inside information.\n\nLastly,  Directors  are  required  to  notify  the  AMF  of  each transaction  carried  out  by  them  or  by  persons  closely associated with them related to L'Or\u00e9al shares. This obligation is  periodically  restated  by  the  Company  (see  section  2.6. 'Summary  statement  of  trading  by  Directors  and  corporate officers in L'Or\u00e9al shares in 2021' of this document).\n\n2",

His in-depth knowledge of the company, its environment and the beauty market represent a major asset for the Board in their discussions and decisions relating to the definition of L'Or\u00e9al's strategy  and  the  monitoring  the  implementation  thereof.  Mr Agon is also deeply committed to the values of L'Or\u00e9al and the embedding of its culture.\n\nOver  the  four  years  of  his  tenure  as  Director,  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon's attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors has been  100%;  at  the  Strategy  and  Sustainability  Committee, which he chairs, it has been 100%.\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Mr Patrice Caine as Director\n\nAs the term of office of Mr Patrice Caine as Director is set to expire,  the  renewal  of  his  term  of  office  for  four  years  is submitted to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nMr  Patrice  Caine  has  been  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive Officer of the Thales Group since 2014.\n\nMr  Patrice  Caine  is  an  independent  Director  who  is  deeply involved in the work of the Committees and discussions of the Board.  Of  particular  note  was  his  active  participation  in  the succession  planning  for  General  Management  in  2020 and  2021,  as  part  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee.\n\nThe  Board  benefits  from  Mr  Caine's  expertise  in  the  area  of governance,  his  experience  as  an  executive  in  a  leading international  company,  his  strategic  vision,  his  industrial expertise, as well as an  in-depth  knowledge  of  new technologies and cyber security.\n\nOver the four years of his term as Director, his attendance was 90% for Board meetings (and 100% over the last three years) and  92%  for  meetings  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee (100% over the last three years). Mr Caine joined the Strategy and Sustainability Committee in June 2020. Since that  date,  he  has  participated  in  all  meetings  except  one  in 2020 (100% attendance in 2021).\n\n## \u00b7 Renewal of the term of office of Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo as Director\n\nAs  the  term  of  office  of  Ms  Bel\u00e9n  Garijo  as  Director  is  set  to expire,  the  renewal  of  her  term  of  office  for  four  years  is submitted to the Annual General Meeting.\n\nMs Bel\u00e9n Garijo, of Spanish nationality, has been Chairwoman of the Management Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Merck group, a German science and technology group since 1 May 2021. She previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Merck  Healthcare,  an  entity  pooling  all  the  pharmaceutical activities held by the Merck group.\n\nBel\u00e9n Garijo assumes her office as independent director with great  commitment  and  great  freedom  of  judgement.  The Board  benefits  from  her  experience  as  a  director  of  a  large international  group.  Her  scientific  skills  and  expertise  in research  and  innovation  acquired  during  a  career  in  the pharmaceutical  industry  represent  valuable  assets  for  the Board.\n\nOver  the  four  years  of  her  term  as  Director,  her  attendance rate has been 97% for meetings of the Board of Directors and 86% for meetings of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\nIf  the  Meeting  approves the resolutions concerning the three proposed  renewals  of  term  of  office,  then  the  composition of  the  Board  of  Directors  will  remain  unchanged.  The  Board of Directors will then be composed of 16 members: 14 Directors elected  by  the  Meeting  and  two  directors  representing  the employees.\n\nThe  balances  of  independence  and  gender  will  remain unchanged:\n\n- \u00b7 7 independent Directors out of 14 Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting, i.e. 50%; and\n- \u00b7 7  women  and  7  men  out  of  14  Directors  elected  by  the General Meeting, i.e. a parity of 50%.",

General information on the meetings of the Board of Directors and its Committees in 2021\n\nThe  Board  met  eight  times  in  2021,  including  an  exceptional meeting  of  the  Board  of  Directors  on  5  November  2021 dedicated  to  the  review  of  the  strategic  transaction  of 7  December  2021  (agreement  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and  Nestl\u00e9 relating to L'Or\u00e9al's buyback of 4% of its own shares held by Nestl\u00e9).\n\nFour Committees prepare for the discussions and deliberations by the Board. 17 meetings were held in 2021: 5 for the Strategy and Sustainability Committee, 4 for the Audit Committee, 4 for the Nominations and Governance Committee, and 4 for the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\nDirectors  may  independently  propose  any  subject  that  is appropriate  for  good  governance  to  be  included  on  the agenda for  work  of  the  Board  and  its  Committees.  L'Or\u00e9al's Directors are regularly informed of all the Company's activities and its  performances in a highly competitive universe. Board meetings  are  generally  held  in  the  presence  of  senior managers of the Company invited to attend on the basis of topical  developments  at  L'Or\u00e9al  and  many  aspects  of  its strategy.  In  an  open,  constructive  dialogue,  exchanges  of views, in confidence, contribute to the quality of the Directors' work.  Board  discussions,  encouraged  by  the  Chairman,  take place transparently and in great detail.\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nDirectors meet at least once a year without the presence of the executive corporate officer, Directors representing employees  or  any  other  Group  employee  (Article  4.2  of  the Internal Rules). An executive session was held on 7 December 2021. The Chairman of the Board attended initially, after which he withdrew and t he executive session continued without him. The Audit Committee also meets twice a year in the presence of Statutory Auditors and in the absence of any representative from Management, at the end of the meetings dedicated to reviewing  the  annual  and  interim  financial  statements.  These two meetings were held on 11 February and 29 July 2021.\n\n## Attendance rate\n\nThe  preparation  and  holding  of  Board  and  Committee meetings requires significant availability and investment by the Directors. In 2021, the attendance rate at Board meetings was 95% on average. The individual attendance rate at Board and Committee  meetings  is  specified  below.  The  allocation  of Directors'  fees,  based  on  the  rate  of  attendance  by  each member  at  Board  meetings  and  meetings  of  the  various Committees,  is  described  in  section  2.4.  'Remuneration  of directors and corporate officers' of this document.\n\n## INDIVIDUAL ATTENDANCE RATES OF DIRECTORS IN 2021 AT BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS\n\n|                                         | Board  of Directors   | Strategy  and Sustainability   | Audit   | Nominations  and Governance   | Human Resources  and Remuneration   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Mr Jean-Paul Agon                       | 100%                  | 100%                           |         |                               |                                     |\n| Mr Nicolas Hieronimus (from 20/04/2021) | 100%                  |                                |         |                               |                                     |\n| Ms Fran\u00e7oise Bettencourt Meyers         | 87.5%*                | 100%                           |         | 100%                          | 100%                                |\n| Mr Paul Bulcke                          | 87.5%*                | 100%                           |         | 100%                          | 100%                                |\n| Ms Ana Sofia Amaral                     | 100%                  |                                |         |                               | 100%                                |\n| Ms Sophie Bellon                        | 100%                  |                                | 75%     | 100%                          | 100%                                |\n| Mr Patrice Caine                        | 100%                  | 100%                           |         | 100%                          |                                     |\n| Ms Fabienne Dulac                       | 100%                  |                                | 75%     |                               | 100%                                |\n| Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo                         | 87.5%*                |                                |         |                               | 75%                                 |\n| Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch          | 87.5%*                |                                | 100%    |                               |                                     |\n| Ms Ilham Kadri                          | 100%                  |                                |         |                               |                                     |\n| Mr Georges Liarokapis                   | 100%                  |                                | 100%    |                               |                                     |\n| Mr Jean-Victor Meyers                   | 87.5%*                | 100%                           | 100%*** |                               |                                     |\n| Mr Nicolas Meyers                       | 87.5%*                |                                | 100%**  |                               |                                     |\n| Ms Virginie Morgon                      | 100%                  |                                | 100%    |                               |                                     |\n| Mr Alexandre Ricard (from 20/04/2021)   | 100%                  |                                |         |                               |                                     |\n| 2021 AVERAGE                            | 95%                   | 100%                           | 93%     | 100%                          | 96%                                 |\n\n- * Excluding the exceptional meeting of the Board of Directors held on 5 November 2021 to review the strategic transaction of 7 December 2021 (agreement between L'Or\u00e9al  and  Nestl\u00e9  relating  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  repurchase  of  4%  of  its  own  shares  held  by  Nestl\u00e9),  the  Directors'  attendance  rate  would  have  been  100%.

Main Remits and Internal Rules\n\nThe  Directors  oversee  the  Group's  economic  and  financial management  and  contribute  to  defining  its  strategy,  taking into  account  social  and  environmental  issues.  They  examine and approve the main lines of action adopted by the General Management, which implements them.\n\nWithin this context, the Board of Directors seeks on an ongoing basis  to  adopt  a  modus  operandi  which,  while  strictly complying  with  French  law,  assures  the  conditions  of  good corporate governance.\n\n## Internal Rules that frame and organise actions of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  work  of  the  Board  of  Directors  is  based  on  Internal  Rules, regularly  updated,  and  designed  to  supplement  the  legal, regulatory and statutory rules and the market recommendations to  which  the  Board  of  Directors  refers.  The  Internal  Rules  are made public in full in this document and published on L'Or\u00e9al's website.\n\nThe  Internal  Rules  address  both  the  formal  aspects  of  the Board of Directors' remits and the rights and obligations of the Directors  (knowledge  of  and  compliance  with  regulations, recommendations and obligations, respect of the Company's interest,  obligations  of  diligence  and  provision  of  information, reserve  and confidentiality,  responsibility  with  regard  to  stock market ethics, etc.).\n\n## The Board's involvement in non-financial matters\n\nEvery year, the L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors determines L'Or\u00e9al's strategic directions, which integrate the challenges of climate change  and,  more  generally,  the  issues  of  sustainable development, as well as the Group's sense of purpose ( raison d'\u00eatre )  to  'Create  the  Beauty  that  moves  the  world'.

The  latest  updates  to  the  Internal  Rules  were  made  on 20  April  2021  and  9  February  2022.  These  updates  provide  the option  for  Directors  to  be  consulted  in  writing  under  the conditions  set  out  in  the  regulations,  following  the  approval (100%  of  the  votes  cast)  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of 20  April  2021  of  the  amendment  to  Article  9  of  the  Articles  of Association,  and  change  the  minimum  number  of  shares  that Directors are required to own.\n\nThe  composition  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors,  the  rules  it applies to its work, its modus operandi, and the work that it has carried out in the year, evaluated on an annual basis by the Directors,  as  well  as  the  decisions  made,  are  described  in sections 2.2. and 2.3. of this document.\n\nThe Board of Directors wishes to point out that it carries out its work above all on a collegial basis, in accordance with ethical principles  and  in  compliance  with  regulations  and  market recommendations.\n\nThe  Board's  debates  and  decisions  are  assisted  by  the  work performed by its Committees, which report to the Board after each of their meetings. The Board of Directors ensures that all of the topics within its remit are thoroughly investigated by the Committees in charge of those issues.

The Board's work in 2021\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors met 8 times.\n\nThe  work  and  agendas  were  prepared  so  as  to  cover  all  of  the subjects  within  the  Board's  remit  and  to  meet  the  expectations expressed by the Directors in the annual evaluation of the modus operandi of the Board.\n\nThe Board of Directors is  consistently  informed  of  the  work  of the  various  Committees  by  each  Chairman  and  bases  its decisions on their recommendations.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Board's  activity  was  mainly  focused  on  the  following areas:\n\n## Corporate governance\n\n## Composition of the Board and its Committees\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors deliberated on its composition , taking diversity into consideration in terms of gender, skills, and expertise  (see  section  2.2.1.2.  'Diversity  policy  applied  to  the Board  of  Directors:  experienced  Directors  who  complement one another' of this document).\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021, the renewal of  the  term  of  office  of  three  Directors  were  proposed, namely:  Fran\u00e7oise  Bettencourt  Meyers,  Vice-Chairwoman  of the  Board  of  Directors,  Chairwoman  of  the  family  holding company T\u00e9thys; Mr Paul Bulcke, Vice-Chairman of the Board of  Directors,  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  of  Nestl\u00e9 and Ms Virginie  Morgon,  independent  Director,  Chairwoman of the Management Committee of Eurazeo.\n\nAt  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  20  April  2021,  the  Board  of Directors also proposed the appointment of Alexandre Ricard, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pernod Ricard, as an independent  Director  and  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as  a  Director, considering that the participation of the future Chief Executive Officer in Board meetings was essential to ensure the quality of the Board's discussions.\n\nThe composition of the Committees was reviewed and, on the recommendation  of  the  Nominations  and  Governance Committee,  Nicolas  Meyers  joined  the  Audit  Committee, replacing Mr Jean-Victor Meyers.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Board  welcomed  the  fact  that  L'Or\u00e9al  had been awarded the Grand Prix du Gouvernement d'Entreprise [Grand  Prix  Award  for  exemplary  corporate  governance]  in 2021 by French business and finance magazine L'AGEFI based on an independent evaluation of the corporate governance of all CAC 40 and SBF 120 companies (1) .\n\n## 2021 Annual General Meeting\n\nDue to the Covid-19 related health crisis, on 11 February 2021 the Board decided to invite shareholders to attend the Annual General  Meeting  to  be  held  on  20  April  2021  behind  closed doors, in accordance with the French Order of 25 March 2020 as amended by the French Order of 2 December 2020.\n\nThe Board was kept informed of the conditions for organising the Annual General Meeting behind closed doors, including its live broadcast and, since the meeting was being held without the physical presence  of  shareholders,  the  ability for shareholders to send questions between 17 and 19 April using an email address supplied by L'Or\u00e9al or by phone during the Annual  General  Meeting  (see  also  section  7.1.11.  'Annual General Meeting' of this document).\n\n## New governance as of 1 May 2021\n\nOn  14  October  2020,  following  recommendations  from  the Nominations and Governance Committee, the Board announced its intention to separate the functions of Chairman and  Chief  Executive  Officer,  to  renew  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's mandate as Chairman, and to appoint Mr Nicolas Hieronimus as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThese changes took effect on 1 May 2021 by decision of the Board  of  Directors  at  the  close  of  the  Company's  Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of 20 April 2021. The Meeting was  notably  convened  in  order  to  appoint  Mr  Nicolas Hieronimus  as  a  Director  and  to  approve  the  remuneration policy corresponding to this reorganisation.\n\nThe  Board  believes  that  this  structure  will ensure  the sustainability of the Group's  performance,  values  and commitments, as well as the quality of its governance.\n\n## Evaluation of the modus operandi and organisation of the Board\n\nAs is the case every year, the Board made a full evaluation of its  modus operandi and its organisation. This was discussed as an  agenda  item  at  its  meeting  of  7  December  2021.  This evaluation  led  to  proposals  for  improvements  and  made  it possible  to  define  the  strategic  topics  on  which  the  Board particularly  wished  to  focus  its  reflections  (see  section  2.3.4. 'Self-evaluation by the Board of Directors' of this document).\n\n## Executive sessions\n\nOne  executive  session in  which  the  Directors  meet  in  the absence  of  corporate  officers  and  any  in-house  Directors  or employees, was held on 7 December 2021.\n\nMr  Jean-Paul  Agon  introduced  the  meeting  by  reviewing  his activities  with  a  specific  emphasis  on  the  duties  entrusted  to him by the Board. He reviewed the topics of governance, in particular the organisation and  coordination  of  Board meetings, the chairmanship of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee,  the  chairmanship  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Foundation, relations  with  shareholders  and  stakeholders,  as  well  as  the monitoring  of  capital  operations.  The  Chairman  reported  on the implementation of the separation of functions and on his regular  meetings  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  had informed and consulted him in areas relevant to the specific remit of the Chairman. Mr Jean-Paul Agon also summarised his actions  in  terms  of  his  representation  of  L'Or\u00e9al  in  high-level relationships, within France and internationally.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  decision  of  the  Board  of  Directors based  on  the  recommendation  from  the  Nominations  and Governance Committee, the meeting continued without the Chairman of the Board of Directors, led by the Chairwoman of the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\n## Dialogue with shareholders and investors\n\nThe Board was informed of the expectations and positions of the  main  investors  and  proxy  advisors,  as  expressed  during meetings  with  the  Company's  departments  responsible  for preparing for the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIt  met to respond to the questions posed by the shareholders before the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Board approved the agenda and draft resolutions to be submitted to the vote of the Annual General Meeting.\n\n2",

In 2021, the Chief Financial Officer presented the Board  with  a comprehensive assessment  of  'shareholder relations '  ( roadshows ,  conferences,  events  and  meetings  on specific topics, particularly CSR issues, and e-meetings with the Individual Shareholder Consultation Committee). He provided details of changes in the expectations and focus of investors before and after the publication of results.\n\n## Ordinary contracts (\" conventions courantes \")\n\nIn 2021, the Board determined that ordinary contracts entered into  under  normal  terms  and  conditions  fulfill  the  rdinary conditions criteria, in accordance  with  the  procedure implemented in 2020.\n\n## Remuneration policy, Human Resources, gender balance within the management bodies\n\nBased  on  the  extensive  work  by  and  recommendations  from the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the Board  deliberated  on  the  rules  relating  to  the remuneration policy for directors and corporate officers for 2021, specifically the  policy  for  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  the Chief Executive Officer . It determined the amount to be paid as annual  variable  remuneration  in  2020  to  the  Chairman  and Chief  Executive  Officer,  in  accordance  with  the  remuneration policy  adopted  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on  30  June 2020.\n\nIt approved the Performance shares award plan of 7 October 2021 .\n\nOn 7 October 2021, it approved the principle of increasing the Company's  capital  reserved  for  employees  in  accordance with  the  13th  resolution  approved  by  the  Annual  General Meeting  of  30  June  2020  and  the  20th  and  21st  resolutions approved by the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021, in view of the launch in 2022 of a third  Employee Shareholding plan .\n\nIn  October  2021,  the  Board  interviewed  the  Chief  Human Relations  Officer  on  the  Group's  Human  Resources  policy.  In particular, the Board was updated on the diversity and gender balance  policy deployed  in  the  Company,  specifically  with regard to the gender parity in management bodies. The Chief Human Relations Officer stated that women made up 32% of the  Company's  governing  bodies,  including  the  Executive Committee, and 48% of the Top 300 (strategic positions). On the  proposal  of  General  Management,  the  Board  defined objectives  for  gender  balance  within  management  bodies. The  goal  is  to  maintain  gender  parity  within  the  governing bodies  each  year,  ensuring  that  employees  of  each  gender do  not  represent  less  than  40%.  The  Board  will  be  informed annually  of  the  results  obtained.  The  results  for  2021  are  also presented  in  section  4.3.2.6.  'Promoting  Diversity,  Equity  and Inclusion' of this document.\n\n## Business activity, results and strategy\n\nThe Board of Directors defines the strategic orientations taking social  and  environmental  needs  into  consideration.  It  also considers L'Or\u00e9al's raison d'\u00eatre, which it approved in February 2020.\n\nThe chart showing the L'Or\u00e9al business model can be found in section  1.2.  'Business  model:  economic  and  corporate excellence to create lasting value for all' of this document.\n\n## Business activity and results\n\nThe systematic and in-depth review, at each meeting, of the Group's  activities  and  results and  net  sales  generated  by Division,  geographic zones, brand, and e-commerce, as well as an analysis of market share gains, enables the Directors to be immersed in the Company's realities and to be continually informed of the problems faced by L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  Board  is  also  informed  throughout  the  year  of  the evolutions in the cosmetics market, the results of competitors and the Group's relative positioning.\n\nThe Board was kept regularly informed of the consequences of the Covid-19  health  crisis ,  particularly  with  regard  to  retail activity and the opening of outlets worldwide. The measures to support  and  assist  employees  were  reported  to  the  Board, with a special focus on the organisation of home working.\n\n## Strategic themes in 2021\n\nThe  Board  regularly  meets  with  the  Group's  main  executives and thus benefits from in-depth knowledge of the challenges specific to each business segment. It is able to forge a clear, independent  opinion  of  the  opportunities  for  the  Group's development over the next few years.\n\nIn February 2021, the Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer presented  the  Group's  ethical  policy.  He  reiterated  the importance of having an ethics policy, in particular with regard to Human Rights and the risks of corruption. He explained how these issues were perceived in the various regions of the world. He  detailed  the  organisational  structure  implemented  in  the Group  (networks  of  ethics  champions,  training  and  selfevaluation  tools,  charters,  whistleblowing  websites)  and  the roadmap for the current year.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer presented L'Or\u00e9al's CSR  policy  in  April  2021.  She  presented  the  review  of  the Sharing Beauty with All 2013-2020 programme. She presented the  Group's  new  objectives  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme for 2030 and the Directors were able to discuss the importance of these new commitments.\n\nThe Board  meeting  dedicated  to  the  strategic  seminar  of June  2021 was  designed  to  meet  the  needs  expressed  by Directors as part of the self-evaluation of the work of the Board conducted at the  end  of  2020.  The  first  part  of  the  meeting was devoted to an 'e-visit' of three countries, i.e. China, India and the United States , as well as the Sub-Saharan Africa Zone . The second  part  reflected  on  Beauty  2030  (Strategic Consultation of June 2019) and Post-Covid Beauty (presentation by Nicolas Hieronimus in July 2020).\n\nThe Board also contributes to the development of strategy, by analysing  the  interest  of acquisitions and  the  conclusion  of licensing  contracts.  It  studies  their  impact  on  the  Company's financial structure and its long-term development capabilities. In  2021,  the  Directors  examined  new  projects,  including  the acquisition  of  the  Japanese  company  Takami  Co  and  an agreement to purchase Youth to the People, a US skin care brand based in California.\n\nIn July 2021, the Chief Financial Officer presented a review of acquisitions made over the past 10 years , particularly in terms of  compliance  with  their  original business  plan .  The  Directors discussed  the  contribution  of  acquisitions  to  the  Group's growth and the increase in its operating profit. The qualitative contribution of these acquisitions (for example, the discovery of  new  models  and  technological  innovations)  was  also analysed.",

        "page_content": "In October 2021, the Directors welcomed the Chief Digital and Marketing Officer of L'Or\u00e9al. She provided an overview of the Group's  digital  transformation,  which  began  in  2010.  She explained  the  consequences  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis, which  has  ramped  up  digitalisation  worldwide.  The  Directors were  able  to  discuss  the  strategic  challenges  related  to  this revolution and the development prospects for the Group that will arise from those challenges.\n\nLastly,  in  December  2021,  the  Board  heard  from  the  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer.  She  reviewed  the  activities  of  the Values Committee , which was set up in 2021 at the request of the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Deputy Chief  Executive  Officer  in  charge  of  Research,  Innovation  & Technology,  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer,  Chief Corporate Sustainability Officer, Chief Human Relations Officer and Chief Corporate Affairs and Engagement Officer all sit on this  committee.  The  following  Values  were  restated,  namely: integrity  and  ethics,  human  and  social  progress,  diversity  and inclusion,  corporate  social  responsibility  and  championing  the cause  of  women.  The  Group's  policies  were  reviewed  and discussed with regard to how they reflect its values.\n\n## Strategic transaction approved by the Board of Directors: Agreement between L'Or\u00e9al and Nestl\u00e9 for the repurchase by L'Or\u00e9al of 4% of its own shares held by Nestl\u00e9\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al  met  on  5  November  2021, without the presence of the Directors linked to Nestl\u00e9 and to the Bettencourt Meyers family, to determine its position in the event that L'Or\u00e9al were to receive an offer to repurchase Company shares held by Nestl\u00e9. Consequently, the Board set up an adhoc committee and, based on the recommendations of the said committee, voluntarily appointed an independent expert (Ledouble  firm),  in  line  with  governance  best  practice  and AMF  guidance  relating  to  such  transactions  (i.e.  Nestl\u00e9's potential decision to reduce its shareholding in the Company's capital  and  offer  L'Or\u00e9al  the  possibility  to  repurchase  these shares).\n\n## 2.3.3. Activities of the Board Committees\n\nThe  Board's  debates  and  decisions  are  assisted  by  the  work performed by its Committees, which report to it after each of their meetings. The remits of each Committee are described in detail in the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe  Board's  Committees  act  strictly  within  the  framework  of the remits given to them by the Board. They actively prepare for  its  work  and  make  proposals  but  they  do  not  have  any decision-making powers. All the Directors who are members of\n\nThe  ad-hoc  committee  was  composed  of  four  members (of  which  three  were  Independent  Directors)  and  met  four times between 5 November and 7 December 2021. The remit of its first meeting was to recommend the appointment of an independent expert to the Board; at subsequent meetings, its role was to monitor the satisfactory progress of the work and to report  to  and  assist  the  Board  in  assessing  the  merits  of  any potential project.\n\n- At the meeting of L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors on 7  December  2021,  after  reading  the  conclusions  of  the independent  expert,  the  Directors  unanimously  approved  a strategic  transaction  consisting  of  the  repurchase  by  L'Or\u00e9al, as  part  of  its  share  buyback  programme,  of  22.26  million  of its  own  shares  -  representing  4%  of  its  capital  -  from  Nestl\u00e9. Board  members  linked  to  Nestl\u00e9  and  from  the  Bettencourt Meyers family did not take part in the discussions or votes.\n\nThe  Board  considered  that  the  Nestl\u00e9  transaction  was  in  the best interest of L'Or\u00e9al and all of its shareholders. It constitutes a  new  strategic  milestone  in  reinforcing  the  shareholder stability  of  L'Or\u00e9al.  (see  section  7.3.2.  'Changes  in  allocation of the share capital and voting rights over the last three years' of this document).\n\n## 2.3.2.3. Information provided to the Board on the Company's financial position, cash position and commitments\n\nThe  financial  position  and  the  cash  position  are  reviewed  at least  twice  a  year  at  a  Board  meeting,  when  the  annual financial  statements  are  approved  and  when  the  interim financial  statements  are  reviewed,  or  at  any  other  time  if necessary. The balance sheet structure is solid.\n\nEvery  year,  it  reviews  the  agreements  concluded  and authorised during previous financial years and  which continued in force.\n\nAs attested to by the preparatory work of its Committees (see below), the Board also analyses other aspects of strategy, the Group's  economic  and  financial  management  and  the Company's  commitments  in  terms  of  corporate  social responsibility. The Committees' work systematically gives rise to a  report  presented  by  their  Chairman/Chairwoman  at  Board meetings.\n\n- a Committee  participate  in  Committee  meetings  with complete freedom of judgement and in the interest of all the shareholders.\n- In  2021,  the  Committees  were  once  again  tasked  with preparing the Board's deliberations. The composition of these Committees, their remits and their work in 2021 are described in detail below.\n\n2",

It  enables each  Director  to  ask  questions  about  the  operation  of  the Board and their personal contribution to its work and decisions. This guide was accompanied by a questionnaire prepared in 2020 with the assistance of the Spencer Stuart firm.\n\nThese documents,  approved  by  the  Nominations  and Governance  Committee  before  they  were  sent  to  each Director,  served  as  a  basis  for  the  individual  interviews arranged  between  the  Directors  and  the  Secretary  of  the Board.\n\nThese  interviews  concerned  the  Board's  composition,  its organisation and its modus operandi.\n\nThe  Directors  were  called  upon  to  reconsider  key  governance issues, specifically: General Management structure, appointment of a Lead Director, the executive sessions organised without the presence of Executive Directors, and relations with shareholders in connection to Corporate Governance issues.\n\nCommittee  activities were  reviewed,  in particular the procedure  for  evaluating  current  agreements,  analysing  the independence of Directors and any conflicts of interest.\n\nThe  Directors  expressed  their  opinion  more  specifically  with regard  to  the  quality  and  relevance  of  the  information provided to them and on the agendas for the Board meeting, and gave their points  of  view  on  the  Board's  involvement  in the definition of L'Or\u00e9al's strategy.\n\nThey formulated suggestions for improvements and submitted proposals on strategic issues that they would like to discuss in further detail in 2022.\n\nThe summary of these interviews, carried out by the Secretary of  the  Board,  was  submitted  first  to  the  Nominations  and Governance Committee meeting on 6 December 2021, and, the next day, to the Board of Directors, followed by a debate between the Directors and decisions for 2022.\n\nFirstly,  with  regard  to  the Board's  composition , the  Directors considered  it  completely  satisfactory  and  balanced.  In  2021, the  Board  welcomed  Mr  Alexandre  Ricard,  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer of Pernod Ricard, and Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief  Executive  Officer  of  L'Or\u00e9al  (see  section  2.2.3  'Changes in corporate  offices  and  directorships  of  Directors'  of  this document).  The  number  of  Independent  Directors  -  who represent  50%  of  the  Board  -  was  deemed  appropriate,  given their profile and considerable freedom of expression. The Board is sufficiently diversified in terms of the age, profile and experience of Directors. The genders are represented equally. The Board has the required expertise and the Directors' skillsets are complementary - particularly in terms of experience managing large  companies.  The  international  experience  of  Directors  was highlighted. This diversity of profiles and experience corresponds to  the  requirements  defined  by  the  Board  (see  section  2.2.1.2. 'Diversity  policy  applied  to  the  Board  of  Directors:  experienced Directors who complement one another' of this document). This diversity  allows  the  Board  to  actively  discuss  the  strategic  issues facing the Group with the Chief Executive Officer, who sits on the Board, and to make decisions independently.\n\nThe  Board  considers  that  the  procedure  for  onboarding new Directors is  satisfactory  (in  particular  in  relation  to  the  transfer of  all  necessary  information  documents,  meetings  with  the Board  Secretary,  and  the  organisation  of  interviews  with members of the Group's Executive Committee). It allows new members  to  rapidly  familiarise  themselves  with  the  strategic issues of the Company. At the Board's request, a meeting with the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer  will  be systematically included in the onboarding process.",

        "page_content": "The Directors who represent employees play an active role on the Board and committees on which they are members. They have  proposed  the  creation  of  an  in-house  guide  for  new L'Or\u00e9al Directors representing employees to enable these new Board members to benefit from the experience and skills they have gained from eight years in office.\n\nThe composition of the Committees is considered appropriate, with the appropriate Directors serving on each committee.\n\nWith regard to the functioning of the Board ,  it  was noted that all Directors are diligent, active and committed and that each Board  member  contributes  fully.  It  operates  as  a  collegial body. Independent Directors are deeply committed and fully assume  their  role  by  questioning  General  Management. Discussions  are  free  and  frank.  and  Directors  can  express themselves  in  a  positive  environment  of  mutual  trust.  The Chairman is open and transparent and encourages discussion and in-depth debate. The Chief Executive Officer communicates transparently, keeps Directors informed of the Company's  performance  and  provides  in-depth  answers  to their  questions.  He  highlights  the  accomplishment  of  his management  team,  which  appears  regularly  at  Board meetings,  giving  Directors  the  opportunity  to  get  to  know L'Or\u00e9al's  senior  managers  and  appreciate  their  expertise  in their areas of responsibility.  The Board dynamic is positive and there  is  excellent  interaction  between  the  Directors,  the Chairman  of  the  Board  and  the  Chief  Executive  Officer. Directors  expressed  a  high  level  of  confidence  in  the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe Board Committees work well and produce well thought-out documents.  The  Directors  believe  that  issues  are  handled  by these committees in a serious and sound manner. The reports to the  Board  are  comprehensive  and  detailed.  As  a  result,  the Board is  able  to  make  its  decisions  with  complete  confidence on the basis of Committee recommendations.\n\nThe Strategy and Sustainability Committee works smoothly with good discussions. It is chaired by the Chairman of the Board, who  conducts  the  work  competently  and  objectively.  The Chief Executive Officer is invited to each of its meetings and contributes actively to the quality of discussions. The Directors considered  that  they  had  all  the  necessary  information  to make  the  proper  recommendations  to  the  Board  regarding strategy  and  the  monitoring  of  its  implementation.  For example,  the  Group's  business  activities, any  planned acquisitions and  the  Group's  results  and  those  of  its competitors were examined in depth. CSR issues, which are an integral  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  strategy,  are  systematically discussed  at  each  meeting  with  the  Chief  Corporate Responsibility Officer. These discussions are considered essential by the Committee members.\n\nThe Audit Committee is  managed very well, with work that is unanimously  praised.  Directors  understand  the  balance between  compliance  and  business  matters.  Performance  in relation to CSR topics and the monitoring of non-financial data is  good  but  there  is  room  for  further  improvement.  The  high level of professionalism and transparency of management was highlighted.\n\nThe Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee is  well prepared,  and  the  work  is  anticipated  sufficiently  well  in advance.  Committee  members  receive  the  right  level  of information to enable them to make the correct recommendations, particularly regarding the remuneration of directors  and  corporate  officers.  They  were  pleased  that  HR policy  topics  were  regularly  discussed  at  the  Committee meetings  and  would  like  to  further  explore  issues  relating  to diversity and upcoming changes in working practices.\n\nThe  quality  of  the  work  undertaken  by  the Nominations  and Governance  Committee was  recognised,  particularly  with regard  to  the  selection  of  new  Directors,  which  was anticipated  sufficiently  in  advance.  The  separation  between the  functions  of  Chairman  of  the  Board  and  Chief  Executive Officer was implemented very smoothly. Emergency plans are reviewed  and  updated  regularly.  Annual  information  on  the 'Top 100' executives is a good idea.\n\nThe  organisation,  duration  and  frequency  of  Board  meetings are considered  satisfactory.  The  confidential  nature  of discussions and decisions - of which attendees are reminded at  the  start  of  each  meeting  -  is  fully  respected.  Directors believe  that  an  effort  has  been  made  to  respect  their schedules, but draw attention to the fact that this should not have  a  negative  impact  on  presentations.  Respecting  the balance  of  agendas  is  considered  to  be  essential.  Meetings organised via videoconference (up to and including July 2021) due  to  the  Covid-19  health  crisis  were  a  success.  However, face-to-face meetings - if the health situation allows - remain the preferred option.\n\nThe Directors considered that the information provided by the Board was  satisfactory, comprehensive,  and  sufficiently detailed.  Making  documentation  available  prior  to  Board  or Committee meetings boosts the quality of the debates. Some Directors  would  like  to  receive  presentations  much  earlier before the meetings to improve discussions and the decisionmaking  process.  Subject  to  the  confidentiality  requirements and deadline constraints to which the Company is subject, this wish will be taken into account in 2022. Expanding the use of the Nasdaq Boardvantage secure digital platform could assist in this area.\n\nThe agendas for  the  Board  meetings  are  appropriate  and cover all issues.\n\nThe Directors appreciate the Chief Executive Officer's detailed presentation  on  sales,  the  markets  and  competition,  ecommerce  and Travel  Retail at  each  Board  meeting,  as  it enables Directors to be immersed in the operational business of the Company and monitor performance.\n\nPresentations from L'Or\u00e9al managers were organised in order to  meet  the  needs  of  Directors,  as  expressed  during  the self-evaluation  of  the  modus  operandi  of  the  Board  in  2020. Their  presentations  were  of  high  quality,  well  prepared, comprehensive and transparent.  They  provided  an  excellent insight  into  the  vision  and  strategy  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  facilitated discussions  with  the  General  Management.  Directors  stressed the  importance  of  allowing  sufficient  time  for  questions  and discussions.\n\nThe Board meeting dedicated to the strategic seminar in June 2021 was  greatly  appreciated  and  deemed  extremely rewarding, as considerable information was shared during the process.  Its  agenda  was  drawn  up  in  accordance  with  the wishes  expressed  by  the  Directors:  presentations  on  the activities of three countries, China, India and the United States, and  one  geographic  zone,  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  There  were also  presentations  on  long-term  transformations,  particularly those  brought  about  by  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  to  be achieved by 2030.\n\nConcerning acquisitions ,  the  Directors  are  satisfied  with  the way in which projects are presented and discussed. They are in line with the Group's strategy. General Management listens to the opinions of the Directors. The monitoring of acquisitions by the Board  and  the  Audit  Committee  was  highly appreciated  this  year.  Directors  believe  that  this  should become a regular occurrence.\n\nThe now-annual presentation of Digital issues by the Chief Digital and Marketing Officer is considered to be essential to obtain a better understanding of the Group's strategic challenges.\n\n2",

        "page_content": ".\n\n- Organisation and modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  appreciates  that  its  agendas  and  those  of  the Committee  meetings  cover  all  of  the  Group's  business activities - relating not only to business but also to Ethics, CSR, and Human  Resources ,  which  give  an  extremely  complete picture  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  these  issues  that  are deemed  to  be  strategic.  The  aim  is  for  these  topics  to  be included on the Board's agenda at least once a year, as was the case in 2021.\n\nThus,  in  2021,  the  Board  reviewed  the  Ethics  Policy  with  the Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer,  specifically  in  the area of Human Rights and corruption risks. The intervention of the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer was considered very useful.  Her  presentation  acted  as  a  final  review,  as  at  31 December 2020,  of  the  Group's  Sharing  Beauty  with  All  CSR programme, while providing details of the commitments of the new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme over the next decade. Directors welcomed the suggestion to organise CSR training in 2022, and noted that it could be an opportunity to involve an external expert. The Board was also able to listen to the Chief Human  Relations  Officer  and  learn  more  about  the  issues related  to  professional  equality  between  women  and  men and the targets established for gender balance in management  bodies.  The  Directors  appreciate  that  these issues  are  discussed  in  detail  with  a  constant  concern  for promoting best practices.\n\nThe  Directors  appreciate  receiving analysts'  reports after  the publication  of  the  annual  and  half-yearly  results  and  sales figures.  The  July  2021  presentation  of  the  Chief  Financial Officer  on feedback  from  roadshows was  considered  very interesting.  This  subject  should  appear  regularly  on  the agenda.\n\nDuring  the  period  between  meetings  of  the  Board  and  the Committees, the monthly press briefing, 'L'Or\u00e9al This Month'  covering  business  activities  in  general  and  the  main events  in  the  life  of  the  Group,  is  considered  very  useful. Information, including press releases, that is systematically sent between Board meetings enables Directors to be continually in line with L'Or\u00e9al's business activity.\n\nOverall,  Directors  think  that  the  Board  performs  its  various duties  satisfactorily,  in  particular,  its  role  as  a think-tank  and driver  of  Group  strategy .  Strategic  issues  are  shared  properly, at  the  right  level,  and  without  going  into  operational  detail. The  'Strategic  guidelines'  document  is  very  well  written.  The Board  and  the  Committees  regularly  address  CRS  topics. Decisions are taken after consideration of L'Or\u00e9al's corporate social challenges.\n\nDirectors  also  expressed  their  opinions  on  the  following governance-related issues:\n\nThe separation  of  the  functions  of  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer : Directors believe that the separation of the functions  in  place  since  1  May  2021  is  the  governance structure  best  suited  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  current  situation.  The change in governance occurred in the best possible manner. This  new governance structure functions in a balanced and satisfactory  manner.  These  changes  were  made  smoothly. The  Directors  highlighted  the  complementary  relationship between the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chairman  fully  fulfils  the  role  defined  by  the  Board  and stimulates  debate. The Chief Executive Officer is allowed to focus entirely on business and management. The balance of power  is  assured,  given  the  composition  of  the  Board\n\n(particularly the presence of two long-standing shareholders, and  the  number  and  background  of  the  independent Directors)  and  the  freedom  of  speech  available  for  all Directors. The Directors expressed their high confidence in the new governance structure.\n\nAppointment of a Lead Director : the Directors do not consider it  necessary to appoint a Lead Director. There would be little interest  for  L'Or\u00e9al  in  doing  so,  given  the  Board's  current composition and modus operandi, as well as the freedom of speech enjoyed by the Directors.\n\nExecutive  sessions : since  2016,  the  Directors  meet  at  least once a year without the presence of any corporate officers, Directors  representing  employees  or  other  Group  employee. These meetings work well and there are no specific comments in this regard. The Board made changes to the organisation of these meetings as part of the separation of the functions of the Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer. They now involve two stages: the Chairman of the Board introduces the meeting by presenting a review of his work. After this, he leaves the meeting and it is chaired by the Chairwoman of the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\nThere is a special emphasis on conflicts of interest since strategy themes  are  discussed  openly  at  Board  meetings.  The  Directors believe that the rules in force are satisfactory: non-participation in debates and  decisions, and  an  annual  declaration  of independence. They attach great importance to the analysis of the  independence  of  Directors,  which  is  carried  out  in  depth each  year,  and  deem  appropriate  the  procedure  for  regular evaluation  of  agreements  concluded  in  the  ordinary  course  of business  under  normal  conditions,  which  was  implemented in 2021.\n\nDirectors  consider  that  the  current  procedure  for  organising meetings  with  shareholders ,  investors,  and  proxy  advisors  on issues  of  corporate  governance  (meetings  organised  by  the department  in  charge  of  financial  communication  and shareholder  relations  that  are  attended  by  the  Secretary  of the Board and Legal Corporate and Securities) is satisfactory. They  appreciate  that  their  expectations  are  detailed  in  the minutes taken in the Committee and Board meetings.\n\nRegarding the self-evaluation of the Board in 2022, the Board considers  that  the  current  procedure  does  not  need  to  be reviewed. The Interview Guide will be examined again by the Nominations and Governance Committee, after having been reviewed, where applicable, by an external firm consulted on the  best  operating  practices  for  Boards  of  directors.  The Nominations  and  Governance  Committee  will  supervise  the process in liaison with the Secretary of the Board. The summary of  the  interviews  with  the  Directors  has  been  discussed  at  a Board meeting as is the case every year.\n\nFor 2022 ,  various decisions with regard to improvements were made.  They  mainly concern the earlier provision of management  information and presentations and the optimisation of the use of the Nasdaq Boardvantage digital platform. The Directors also stated their desire to go into further detail  about  certain  strategic  points.  The  Directors  made proposals for topics to be included on the Board's agenda in 2022 and the organisation of the 2022 strategy seminar. After discussion and review, a list of priority subjects was drawn up by the Board meeting of 7 December 2021. These topics will be included on the agenda of Board meetings in 2022.",

Appendix: Complete text of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors\n\nThese Rules are applicable to all present and future Directors, whether they are appointed by the General Meeting or by the employees,  and  are  intended  to  complement  the  legal, regulatory  and  statutory  rules  and  those  under  the  Articles of Association in order to state accurately the modus operandi of  the  Board  of  Directors  and  its  committees,  in  the  interests of the Company and its shareholders.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  refers  to  the  principles  of corporate  governance  as  presented  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code.  The  Internal  Rules  specify  the  modus  operandi  of  the Board,  in  the  interests  of  the  Company  and  of  all  its shareholders,  and  those  of  its  Committees,  whose  members\n\n## PREAMBLE\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al  ('the  Company')  is  a collegial  body  which  is  mandated  by  all  the  shareholders. It has the authority given to it by law to act in all circumstances in the best interests of the Company.\n\nBy  exercising  its  legal  prerogatives,  the  Board  of  Directors ('the Board') fulfils the following main duties: it validates the Company's strategic orientations, appoints the directors and corporate  officers  given  responsibility  for  managing  the Company  within  the  scope  of  this  strategy,  chooses  the method of organisation of General Management (combination  or  separation  of  the  roles  of  Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer), oversees management and ensures the  quality  of  the  financial  and  non-financial  information provided to the shareholders and to the markets.\n\nThe  organisation  of  the  Board's  work  and  its  composition  is adapted to the specificities of L'Or\u00e9al and is in line with an approach of constant progress. The Board's main responsibility is to adopt the method of organisation and the modus operandi which enable it to perform its duties to the best  of  its  ability.  Its  organisation  and  modus  operandi  are described  in  these  Internal  Rules  which  it  draws  up,  and which  are  published  in  full  on  L'Or\u00e9al's  website  and  in  the Universal Registration Document.\n\nThe Board's actions are carried out within the framework of the AFEP-MEDEF Code. The Corporate Governance Report provides more detail on the Board's composition and on the way in which the Board's work is prepared and organised, and explains, where applicable, the recommendations that have  not  been  adopted  in  light  of  the  Company's specificities.\n\nThese  Rules  apply  to  all  the  Directors,  both  current  and future, whether they are appointed by the Annual General Meeting or the employees, and are intended to complement  the  legal,  regulatory  and  statutory  rules  and those  under  the  Articles  of  Association  in  order  to  state accurately  the  modus  operandi  of  the  Board  of  Directors and its committees.\n\nare Directors to whom it gives preparatory assignments for its work. The latest updates to the Internal Rules were made on 20 April 2021 and 9 February 2022. These updates provide the option  for  Directors  to  be  consulted  in  writing  under  the conditions  set  out  in  the  regulations,  following  the  approval (100%  of  the  votes  cast)  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of 20 April 2021 of the amendment to Article 9 of the Articles of Association, and change the minimum number of shares that Directors  are  required  to  own.  As  was  the  case  for  previous versions,  the  Internal  Rules  are  made  public  in  full  in  this section.\n\n## 1. Remit and authority of the Board of Directors\n\n## 1.1. General powers of the Board\n\nThe  Board  defines  the  business  strategy  of  the  Company and  monitors  its  implementation,  in  accordance  with  its corporate interest, taking social and environmental challenges into consideration.\n\nSubject  to  the  powers  expressly  conferred  to  Annual General  Meetings  and  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose,  the  Board  deals  with  all  matters  regarding  the smooth  running  of  the  Company  and  settles  issues concerning the Company by virtue of its decisions. At any time  in  the  year,  the  Board  carries  out  the  controls  and verifications it deems appropriate.\n\nThe  Board  ensures,  as  appropriate,  that  a  mechanism  for the prevention and detection of corruption and influencepeddling is in place.\n\nThe Board also ensures that the executive corporate officers implement  a  policy  of  non-discrimination  and  diversity  as regards the balance of women and men in management bodies.\n\nThe  Corporate  Governance  Report  relays  the  Board's activity.\n\nThe  Board  prepares  for  and  convenes  Annual  General Meetings and sets the agenda. It puts the parent company and  consolidated  financial  statements  to  the  vote  and presents  to  the  meeting  its  Management  Report  to  which the Corporate Governance Report is appended.\n\nThe Board sets the remuneration of directors and corporate officers. It reports  on  its  policy  and  decisions  in  its Management  Report  and  in  the  Corporate  Governance Report. The Annual General Meeting is consulted every year on  the  components  of  remuneration  due  or  allocated  to each executive corporate officer for the past financial year. The  Board  is  a  collegial  body  which  is  legally  unable  to delegate its authority, except to the General Management in  those  cases  expressly  provided  for  by  law.  Within  the scope of its work, it may decide to set up Committees which do not have decision-making powers but have the task of providing  all  useful  information  for  the  discussions  and decisions  which  it  is  called  upon  to  make.  The  Board decides  on  the  composition  of  the  Committees  and  the rules with regard to their modus operandi.\n\nThe  Board  may  ask  one  or  more  of  its  members  or  third parties to carry out special assignments or projects aimed in particular at studying one of more specific topics.\n\n2",

Forms of General Management\n\nGeneral Management of the Company is carried out, under the  responsibility  of  either  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) or by another  individual  with  the  position  of  Chief  Executive Officer.  Leaving  the  possibility  to  choose  between  the separation  or  combination  of  roles,  French  law  does  not give preference to any form and gives the Board authority to choose between the two methods of organisation of the General  Management  in  light  of  the  specificities  of  the Company.\n\nWhether  the  General  Management  is  carried  out  by  a Chairman and Chief Executive Officer or a Chief Executive Officer,  the  Board  has  the  same  prerogatives.  It  may  in particular take all specific measures aimed at ensuring the continued balance of powers.\n\n## 1.2.2. Powers of General Management\n\nThe  General  Management,  which  may  be  carried  out  by the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Directors  or  by  a  Chief Executive Officer, is vested with the broadest powers to act in  all  circumstances  in  the  name  of  the  Company.  It  must exercise  these  powers  within  the  limit  of  the  Company's purpose subject to the powers expressly granted by French law  to  General  Shareholders'  Meetings  and  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe Board has the possibility to provide for limitations on the powers  of  the  General  Management.  Thus,  transactions which may materially impact the scope of consolidation of the  Company,  in  particular,  transactions  involving  an amount in excess of \u20ac250,000,000 and all new transactions which  are  outside  the  normal  course  of  business  for  an amount in excess of \u20ac50,000,000, must be submitted to the Board.  In  any  event,  the  Board  of  Directors  must  be informed  of  the  conclusion  and  implementation  of  all transactions.\n\nThe  General  Management  represents  the  Company  in  its dealings with third parties.\n\nUpon a proposal by the Chief Executive Officer, the Board may appoint one or more individuals responsible for assisting the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  will  hold  the  corporate office of Deputy Chief Executive Officer(s).\n\n## 1.2.3. Duties of General Management\n\nWhatever the form of organisation chosen (Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer  or  Chief  Executive  Officer),  the General Management is required to provide each Director with  all  the  documents  and  information  required  to  carry out their duties.\n\nMore  specifically,  the  General  Management  provides  the Board members with useful information in connection with the preparation of meetings, or at any time during the life of the  Company  if  the  importance  or  urgency  of  the information so requires. This provision of ongoing information also  includes  any  relevant  information  concerning  the Company,  and  in  particular  press  articles  and  reports containing financial analysis.\n\nThe  General  Management  gives  the  Board  and  its Committees the possibility to meet with the senior managers of  L'Or\u00e9al  within  the  strict  framework  of  their  remits  and duties.  In  consultation  with  the  General  Management,  the Board and the Committees may use external consultants if they consider it necessary.\n\nThe Board is informed, at the time of closing of the annual financial statements and the review of the interim financial statements  or  at  any  other  time  if  necessary,  of  the Company's financial position and cash position.\n\n## 2. Composition of the Board\n\n## 2.1. Directors\n\nThe Directors of the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 provide their expertise and professional experience;\n- \u00b7 are  required  to  act  with  due  care  and  attention  and participate  actively  in  the  work  and  discussions  of the Board;\n- \u00b7 have complete freedom of judgement.\n\nThis  freedom  of  judgement  enables  them  in  particular  to participate, in total independence, in the decisions and work of the Board, and, where appropriate, of its Committees.\n\n## 2.1.1. Independence\n\nThe  Board  reviews  the  independence  of  each  of  its members  every  year,  after  obtaining  the  opinion  of  the Nominations  and  Governance  Committee,  in  particular  in light of the independence criteria in the AFEP-MEDEF Code and  taking  account  of  the  specific  needs  of  L'Or\u00e9al. The  findings  of  this  evaluation  are  reported  to  the shareholders and made available to the general public.\n\n## 2.1.2. Diversity\n\nThe Board considers the issue of the desirable balance of its composition  and  that  of  its  Committees,  notably  in  the representation  of  men  and  women,  nationalities  and diversity  of  skills.  The  objectives,  terms  and  conditions,  and results  of  its  policy  in  this  area  are  made  public  in  the Corporate  Governance  Report  and  included  in  the Registration Document.\n\n## 2.1.3. Terms of office\n\nThe  length  of  the  term  of  office  of  Directors  is  four  years. However, the staggering of the terms of office is organised in order to avoid renewing too many Directors at once and favour renewing Directors harmoniously.\n\nIn  principle,  it  is  agreed  by  the  Board  members  that  all Directors  will  tender  their  resignation  to  the  Board  prior  to the  Annual  General  Meeting  following  their  73rd  birthday and that they will no longer apply for renewal of their term of  office  if  this  rule  does  not  enable  them  to  perform  their office for at least two years.\n\nIn  any  event,  in  accordance  with  French  law  and  the Articles  of  Association,  the  total  number  of  Directors  who are over 70 years of age may not exceed one third of the Directors in office.",

Chairman of the Board\n\nThe Board of Directors must elect a Chairman from among its members.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  organises  and  oversees  the Board's  work  and  reports  thereon  to  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\nThe  Chairman  sets  the  dates  and  the  agenda  for  Board meetings and leads the discussions.\n\nThe Chairman is actively involved in defining the Company's growth strategy and encourages and strengthens, inter alia, links between the Company and the main market players.\n\nThe Chairman oversees the work of the Company's bodies responsible  for  corporate  governance  and  ensures,  in particular, that the Directors are able to perform their duties. He  may  ask  for  the  communication  of  any  document  or information  that  is  likely  to  assist  the  Board  of  Directors  in preparing for its meetings.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  must  use  his  best  efforts  to promote the values and image of the Company at all times. He expresses his views in that capacity.\n\nHe  is  provided  with  the  material  resources  required  to  perform his duties.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  takes  care,  particularly  in  the event  of  separation  of  roles,  to  develop  and  maintain  a trustful and regular relationship between the Board and the General  Management,  in  order  to  guarantee  continuous, ongoing  implementation  by  the  General  Management  of the strategies defined by the Board.\n\n## 3. Rights and obligations of the Directors\n\n## 3.1. Knowledge of and compliance with regulatory texts,\n\n## recommendations and obligations\n\nEach of the members of the Board declares that they have read the following documents:\n\n- \u00b7 the Company's Articles of Association;\n- \u00b7 the  legal  and  regulatory  texts  that  govern  French 'soci\u00e9t\u00e9s  anonymes'  (public  limited  companies)  within the framework of the functioning of a Board of Directors and, in particular, the rules relating to:\n- \u00b7 the number of offices that may be held simultaneously,\n- \u00b7 the agreements and transactions concluded between the Director and the Company,\n- \u00b7 the definition of the powers of the Board of Directors,\n- \u00b7 the  holding  and  use  of  inside  information,  which  are discussed in section 4.6. ;\n- \u00b7 the recommendations defined in the AFEP-MEDEF Code;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's Stock Market Code of Ethics;\n- \u00b7 and the provisions of these Rules.\n\n## 3.2. Respect for the interests of the Company\n\nThe Directors are required to act in all circumstances in the interest of the Company and all its shareholders.\n\nThe Directors are obliged to notify the Board of any situation that  may  constitute  a  conflict  of  interest,  even  if  such conflict is only potential, and must refrain from participating in the corresponding deliberations.\n\nThe Directors must inform the Board every year of the offices and  positions  they  hold  in  other  companies  and  of  any conflicts of interest, even if they are only potential, that they have  identified  (see  Annual  Report  on  independence under Article 4.4).\n\nThe Board furthermore discusses every year the assessment of whether  or  not  the  business  relationships maintained between  the  companies  in  which  the  Directors  hold  their offices  and  the  Company  are  significant.  It  reports  on  its evaluation in the Registration Document.\n\n## 3.3. Obligations of due diligence and provision of information\n\nThe Director must devote the necessary time and attention to his/her duties.\n\nHe/she must limit the number of offices held so as to ensure his/her availability.\n\nA  Director  must  not  hold  more  than  four  other  terms  of office  in  listed  companies  outside  the  Group,  including foreign companies. The Director concerned is given enough time to bring his/her situation into compliance with this rule, where required.\n\nThe Director must keep the Board informed of the terms of office held in other companies, including his/her participation  on  the  Board  Committees  of  such  French  or foreign companies.\n\nA corporate officer must not hold more than two offices as Director  in  listed  companies  outside  the  Group,  including foreign  companies.  The  Director  must  ask  for  the  Board's opinion before accepting a new corporate office in a listed company.\n\nEach Board member undertakes to be diligent:\n\n- \u00b7 by  attending  all  Board  meetings,  where  necessary  by means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities, except in the case of a major impediment;\n- \u00b7 by attending, whenever possible, all General Shareholders' Meetings;\n- \u00b7 by attending the meetings of the Board Committees of which he/she is a member.\n\nThe  Corporate  Governance  Report  gives  shareholders  all useful  information  on  the  Directors'  individual  participation in these sessions and meetings.\n\nIn connection with decisions to be made, the Director must ensure that he/she has all the information he/she considers essential for the smooth conduct of the work of the Board or the Committees. If this information is not made available to him/her,  or  he/she  considers  that  it  has  not  been  made available,  he/she  must  request  such  information  from  the Chairman of the Board who is required to ensure that the Directors are in a position to perform their duties.\n\n## 3.4. Training for Directors\n\nAll  the  Directors,  and  in  particular  those  representing  the employees, may  benefit, on their appointment or throughout their directorship, from the appropriate training programmes for the performance of the office.\n\nThese training programmes are organised and proposed by the Company and are provided at its expense.\n\n2",

Obligation of reserve and confidentiality\n\nThe Directors undertake not to express themselves individually  other  than  in  the  internal  deliberations  of  the Board on questions raised at Board meetings.\n\nOutside the Company, only collegial expression is possible, particularly in the form of releases intended to provide the markets with information.\n\nWith  regard  to  information  not  in  the  public  domain  to which the Director has access as a result of his duties, the Director  must  consider  him/herself  to  be  bound  by  strict professional confidentiality, which is more demanding than the  mere  legal  obligation  of  discretion.  This  obligation applies to all persons called on to attend Board meetings, and covers all information of a confidential nature and all information  presented  as  confidential  by  the  Chairman  of the Board.\n\nBeyond this legal obligation and to ensure the quality of the discussions  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  all  the  information given to Board members and the opinions they express must be kept strictly confidential.\n\nThis  obligation  applies  to  any  person  invited  to  attend  a Board meeting.\n\n## 3.6. Stock market ethics\n\n## 3.6.1. Principles\n\nThe  Company  has  put  in  place  a  'Stock  Market  Code  of Ethics'  that  is  regularly  updated,  in  particular  to  take  into account changes in the regulations in force. This Code was updated  following  the  applicability,  as  from  3  July  2016, of European Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 on market abuse ('Market  Abuse  Regulation').  The  Board  members  comply with the Principles of Stock Market Ethics 'related to inside information' provided for by this code.\n\nInside information must only be used by the Director in the exercise of his office. Such information must in no case be communicated to a third party other than in the exercise of the Director's duties, and for any other purpose or any other activity than those for which it is held.\n\nIt is the duty of all Directors to refrain from trading in, having others  trade  in,  or  enabling  others  (including  through recommendations  or  encouragements)  to  trade  in  the securities  of  the  Company  on  the  basis  of  this  information, until such time as the information has been made public.\n\nIt is the personal responsibility of each Director to determine whether the information he/she holds is inside information or not, and accordingly whether he/she may or may not use or transmit any of the information, and whether he/she may or  may  not  trade  or  have  others  trade  in  the  Company's securities.\n\n## 3.6.2. Abstention periods\n\nDuring  the  period  preceding  the  publication  of  any  inside information  to  which  Directors  have  access,  in  their capacity of insiders, the members of the Board must by law refrain from all trading in the Company's securities.\n\nFurthermore,  in accordance  with  the  Market  Abuse Regulation  and  the  recommendations  of  the  French Financial Markets Authority - AMF, they are prohibited from trading in the Company's shares over the following periods:\n\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  30  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication of the press release on the annual and halfyear results;\n- \u00b7 a  minimum  of  15  calendar  days  before  the  date  of publication  of  the  press  release  on  quarterly  financial information.\n\nThe Directors are only authorised to trade in L'Or\u00e9al shares on the day after publishing the press release.\n\n## 3.6.3. Insider trading\n\nThe  Director  has  been  informed  of  the  provisions  in  force relating to the holding of inside information, insider trading and the unlawful disclosure of inside information: Articles  465-1  et  seq.,  L.  621-14  and  L.  621-15,  III  c  of  the French Monetary and Financial Code and Articles 7 et seq. of the Market Abuse Regulation.\n\n## 3.6.4. Obligation to declare trading in the securities of the Company\n\nIn accordance  with  the  applicable  regulations,  the Directors  and  closely  associated  persons,  as  defined  by Article  3.1.26  of  the  Market  Abuse  Regulation,  must  inform the AMF (1) of all acquisitions, sales, subscriptions or trades of the  Company's  shares  and  transactions  involving  related instruments where the cumulative amount  of  such transactions is higher than \u20ac20,000 for the current calendar year.\n\nThe  Directors  and  closely  associated  persons  must  submit their declarations to the AMF by email within three trading days following completion of the transaction.\n\nThese individuals must simultaneously provide a copy of this declaration  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Company's  Board  of Directors.\n\nThe declarations are then posted on the AMF's website and are  mentioned  in  an  annual  summary  set  out  in  the Company's Management Report.\n\n## 3.6.5. Appointment of an Internal Stock Market Ethics Advisor\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  appointed  an  'Internal  Stock  Market  Ethics Advisor',\n\nwho  is  responsible  for  assisting,  in  confidence,  any  person who so requests,  with  the  analysis  and  assessment  of  their situation,  without  prejudice  to  the  principle  of  personal accountability.",

Holding of a minimum number of shares\n\nIn accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF Code and independently  of  any  obligation  to  hold  shares  under  the Articles  of  Association,  the  Directors  must  personally  be shareholders  of  the  Company  and  hold  a  significant number of shares.\n\nEach Director shall own at least 250 shares in the Company: at  least  125  shares  on  the  date  of  his/her  election  by  the Annual  General  Meeting,  and  the  balance  no  later  than 24 months after this election.\n\nThe decision as to whether the shares held by the Director should  be  registered  or  deposited,  in  full  or  in  part,  is  the responsibility of the Director.\n\nThis  stock  ownership  obligation  is  not  applicable  to  the Directors representing the employees.\n\n## 4. Modus operandi of the Board of Directors\n\n## 4.1. Convening the Board\n\nThe Board is convened by any appropriate means. Notices convening a meeting may be transmitted by the Secretary of  the  Board  of  Directors.  They  are  sent  in  writing  at  least eight  days  prior  to  each  meeting,  except  in  particular circumstances.  The  notices  specify  the  venue  of  the meeting,  which  may  be  the  headquarters  or  any  other venue.\n\nAll the documents that are necessary to inform the Directors about the agenda and about any questions submitted to the Board for review are enclosed with the notice convening the meeting or are sent or provided to them within a reasonable period of time, prior to the meeting.\n\nThese  documents  may  be  provided  to  them  on  a  secure digital platform, within a reasonable period of time prior to the meeting. They may in exceptional cases be provided at the meeting.\n\n## 4.2. Board meetings and method of participation\n\nThe  Board  meets  as  often  as  required  in  the  best  interest of the Company, and at least five times per year.\n\nThe dates of the Board meetings for the following year are set  no  later  than  the  beginning  of  the  summer,  except  in the case of Extraordinary Meetings.\n\nThe frequency and length of Board meetings must be such that they allow for an in-depth review and discussion of the matters  that  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  remits  of  the Committees.\n\nThe Directors meet once a year without the presence of the executive  corporate  officer,  the  Directors  representing  the employees or any other Group employee.\n\nIn accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions and with  Article  9  section  2  of  the  Articles  of  Association, Directors  who  take  part  in  Board  meetings  by  means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities are deemed to be present for  the  purpose  of  calculating  the quorum and the majority.\n\nThese  means  must  guarantee  simultaneous,  continuous retransmission of the debates.\n\nHowever, these means of participation are excluded when the Board so decides and in any event when it decides with regard to closing of the Company's parent company and consolidated  financial  statements  and  on  the  preparation of the Management Report.\n\nA  Director  who  participates  by  means  of  videoconference  or teletransmission  must  ensure  that  the  confidentiality  of  the debates is preserved.\n\nThe attendance register mentions the Board members who attend  Board  meetings  by  means  of  videoconference  or telecommunication  facilities,  with  the  Secretary  of  the meeting having the task of initialling the register for them.\n\nThe  Board  may  take  the  following  decisions  by  written consultation  with  the  Directors,  electronically  if  necessary: (i)  co-optation of Directors, (ii) authorisations related to the sureties, endorsements and warranties referred to in Article L. 225-35 of the French Commercial Code, (iii) amendments to the Articles of Association to ensure compliance with the legislative  and  regulatory  provisions,  when  the  Annual General  Meeting  has  approved  a  delegation  for  this purpose, (iv) the convening of the Annual General Meeting and (v) decisions to transfer the registered office within the same department.\n\nAt  the  request  of  the  Chairman  of  the  Board,  the  Board Secretary  will  send  the  consultation  to  each  Director,  with an  indication  of  the  appropriate  deadline  by  which  to respond,  as  determined  by  the  Chairman  based  on  the decision  to  be  taken,  the  urgency  or  the  time  required  to reflect on the vote to be made. The document provided for this  purpose  details  the  procedures  of  the  consultation, its purpose,  a  presentation  and  the  reasons  for  the proposed  decision,  as  well  as  the  draft  deliberation. Directors  who  have  not  responded  by  the  end  of  the specified deadline will not be considered to form part of the quorum for the purposes of taking the decisions set out in the  consultation,  unless  the  Chairman  has  extended  the said deadline. The Secretary of the Board counts the votes of the Directors on the proposed resolution and informs the Board of the result of the vote.\n\n## 4.3. Minutes of Board meetings\n\nMinutes are prepared for each Board meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the meeting mention the use of videoconference  or  telecommunication  facilities  and  the name of each person who participated in the Board by such means.  The  minutes  also  indicate  whether  any  technical incidents  occurred  during  a  meeting  held  by  means  of videoconference or telecommunication facilities, and if such incidents disrupted the course of the meeting.\n\nThe minutes of the deliberations include a summary of the debates  and  specify  the  decisions  that  were  made.  They mention the questions raised or the reservations expressed by participants.\n\nThe draft minutes of the last Board meeting are sent or given to all the Directors at the latest on the date when the next meeting is convened.\n\nThe  Secretary  of  the  Board  is  empowered  to  issue  and certify copies or extracts of the minutes of Board meetings.\n\nDecisions  taken  by  means  of  written  consultation  with  the Directors are recorded in minutes that are stored under the same conditions  as  other  decisions  taken  by  the  Board  of Directors.\n\n2",

Annual evaluation of the modus operandi of the Board\n\nEvery year, the Board carries out an evaluation of its ability to respond to the expectations of shareholders by reviewing its composition, its organisation and its modus operandi.\n\nAt  its  last  meeting  for  the  year  and  on  the  basis  of  a summary of the interviews that are previously organised and conducted  with  each  Director,  on  the  basis  of  a  guide which  includes  the  recommendations  adopted  by  the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board discusses points of view and opinions  expressed.  It  draws  the  conclusions  from  this  with the aim of improving the conditions for the preparation and organisation of its work and that of its Committees.\n\nThe results  of  the  evaluation,  with  the  avenues  of  progress that remain open, are passed on to the shareholders in the Annual  Report  and  at  the  time  of  the  Annual  General Meeting.\n\n## 5. Board Committees\n\nWhen the Board sets up Committees, it appoints the members of these  Committees  and  determines  their  duties  and responsibilities.\n\nThese Committees act within the remit granted to them by the  Board  and  therefore  have  no  decision-making  power. The Committees may not at any time take over the powers of the General Management as set out in chapter 1.2.2. of these Rules.\n\nThe Committee members are Directors. They are appointed by  the  Board  in  person  and  may  not  be  represented. All  Board  members  have  the  necessary  qualifications  due to  their  professional  experience.  They  actively  take  part  in Committee meetings with complete freedom of judgement and in the interest of the Company.\n\nThe task of secretary of each Committee is carried out by a  person  appointed  in  agreement  with  the  Chairman/ Chairwoman of the Committee. It may also be performed by the Secretary of the Board.\n\nEach  Committee  defines  the  frequency  of  its  meetings. These meetings are held at the Company's headquarters or at any other place decided by the Chairman/Chairwoman of the Committee.\n\nThe  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  each  Committee  prepares the agenda for each meeting.\n\nThe Committees may make contact, in the performance of their  duties,  with  the  Company's  main  senior  managers,  in agreement  with  the  Chairman/Chairwoman  of  the  Board and  after  informing  the  General  Management  and  will report on such contacts to the Board.\n\nThe Board may entrust a Committee Chair, or one or more of its members, with a special assignment or project to carry out specific research or study future possibilities. The designated individual will report  on  this  work  to  the  Committee concerned such that the Committee may deliberate on this work and in turn report thereon to the Board.\n\nFor  each  Committee  meeting,  its  members  may  decide  to invite any other person of their choice to attend as needs be and on an advisory basis, when they consider it appropriate.\n\nIn its field of competence,  each  Committee  makes proposals and recommendations and expresses opinions as the case may be. For this purpose, it may carry out or have carried  out  any  studies  that  may  assist  the  Board's deliberations.  When  they  use  the  services  of  external consultants,  the  Committees must ensure that their service is objective.\n\n## 5.1. Strategy and Sustainability Committee\n\n## 5.1.1. Remits\n\nThe remit of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee is to throw light, through its analyses and debates, on the Group's strategic  orientations  as  submitted  to  the  Board  of  Directors and  to  monitor  the  implementation  and  advancement  of significant operations in progress.\n\nThe Committee examines:\n\n- \u00b7 the  main  strategic  lines  of  development,  options  and projects  presented  by  the  General  Management,  and their  economic,  financial,  societal  and  environmental consequences;\n- \u00b7 opportunities  for  acquisitions  or  investments  that  involve significant  amounts  or  represent  a  departure  from  the Group's  usual  business  operations,  and  the  conditions relating to their implementation;\n- \u00b7 financial transactions that could significantly change the balance sheet structure;\n- \u00b7 the Company's commitments with regard to Sustainable Development, in light of the issues specific to the Group's business activities and its objectives, and the means and resources put in place;\n- \u00b7 the proposed strategic orientations to be defined by the Board  with  a  view  to  consultation  of  the  Central  Works Council.\n\nMore  generally,  the  Committee  debates  all  questions considered  essential  for  the  future  strategy  of  the  Group and for preserving its main financial balances.",

Remuneration policy for corporate officers\n\nThe  Board  refers,  in  particular,  to  the  recommendations  of  the AFEP-MEDEF  Code  for  the  determination  of  the  remuneration and benefits granted to corporate officers.\n\nAccording to this Code, corporate officers (' dirigeants mandataires sociaux ')  of  a  French  ' soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme \u00e0 conseil d'administration '  (public  limited  company  with  a  Board  of Directors)  are:  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer ( Pr\u00e9sident-Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral ), the CEO, and Directeurs G\u00e9n\u00e9raux D\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9s (executive  corporate  officers),  and  the  Chairman  of the Board without assuming the office of Chief Executive Officer (non-executive corporate officers).\n\nFollowing  the  dissociation  of  the  functions  of  Chairman  of  the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer from 1 May 2021, the remuneration policies are intended to apply to:\n\n- \u00b7 Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  in  his  position  as  Chief  Executive Officer; and\n- \u00b7 Mr Jean-Paul Agon, in his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  recommendations  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF Code, the Board ensures that the remuneration policy complies with the principles of comprehensiveness, balance, comparability,  consistency,  transparency  and  proportionality, and takes into account market practices.\n\n## 2.4.1.2.1. Remuneration policy applicable to the executive corporate officer\n\n## A/ Fundamental principles for determination of the remuneration of executive corporate officer\n\nSpecific requirements for appointments as executive corporate officers for employees who have completely succeeded in the various stages of their careers in the Group\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  constant  practice  has  been  to  appoint  senior managers  who  have  completely  succeeded  in  the  various stages  of  their  careers  in  the  Group  as  executive  corporate officers.\n\nThe remuneration policy applicable to the executive corporate officer is the logical result of this choice.\n\n- It must  make  it  possible  to  attract  the  most  talented employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  to  the  very  top  positions  in  General Management, without them being deprived for all that, after a long career in the Group, of the benefits to which they would have  continued  to  be  entitled  if  they  had  remained employees.\n\nTo  achieve  this  objective,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to maintain the employment  contract of the executive corporate officer with at least 15 years' service at the time of their appointment in the Group and ensured that the benefits under the suspended employment contract are not combined with those in respect of the corporate office.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  considered  that  the  objective pursued  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  and  intended  to  avoid  the combination  of  benefits  drawn  from  both  an  employment contract and a corporate office, could be fully achieved by maintaining the suspended employment contract and clearly separating  the  benefits  related  to  the  corporate  office  from those relating to the employment contract.\n\nThis is why the Board of Directors has decided to make a clear distinction between:\n\n- \u00b7 on the one hand, the remuneration components related to the corporate office: fixed and variable remuneration and grant of performance shares; and\n- \u00b7 on  the  other  hand,  the  other  benefits  that  may  be  due pursuant to the suspended employment contract: termination  indemnities,  retirement  indemnities  in  the  event of  voluntary  retirement  or  retirement  at  the  Company's request, financial consideration for the non-compete clause and the defined benefit pension scheme.\n\nRemuneration  in  respect  of  the  corporate  office  will  in  no event  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  calculation  of  all benefits  that  may  be  due  under  the  employment  contract described above.\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for  the  calculation  of  the  aforementioned  pension  scheme, will  be  based on the amount of remuneration at the date of suspension  of  the  employment  contract.  This  reference remuneration  is  revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund ( Caisse Nationale d'Assurance  Vieillesse ).  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire career, including the years spent as a corporate officer.\n\nInformation  on  the  benefits  that  could  be  owed  under  the suspended employment contract are discussed in section  2.4.3.  'Termination  indemnities  and  supplementary pension  scheme  applicable  to  executive  corporate  officers' of this document.\n\nThe executive corporate officer is also considered in the same way as a senior manager during the term of their corporate office,  which  allows  them  to  continue  to  benefit  from  the additional  social  protection  schemes  and,  in  particular,  from the defined contribution pension scheme, and the employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\n## Remuneration that is consistent with that of the Company's senior managers\n\nThe remuneration policy for the executive corporate officer is in line, where applicable, with the policy which was applied to them as senior managers.\n\nTheir level of remuneration as an executive corporate officer is set on the basis of the level of responsibilities they exercised in the company at the time of their appointment.\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  is  based  on  the  same  foundations and  instruments  as  those  applied  to  the  Company's  senior managers.  The  remuneration  principles  are  therefore  stable and durable.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  informed  every  year  of  the  Group's Human  Resources  policy.  It  is  in  a  position  to  verify  the consistency  between  the  remuneration  of  the  executive corporate officer and the procedures in place, particularly for the  members  of  the  Group's  Executive  Committee,  on  the basis of the work by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee and the Nominations and Governance Committee.\n\n## Competitive remuneration in comparison to a coherent and stable reference panel\n\nThe remuneration of the executive corporate officer must be competitive in order to attract, motivate and retain the best talents in the Company's top positions.\n\n2",

        "page_content": ".\n\nThis  remuneration  is  assessed  overall,  namely  by  taking  into account all the components that make it up.\n\nTo assess the competitiveness of this remuneration, a coherent and stable  reference  panel  is  defined  with  the  assistance  of an external consulting firm.\n\nThe panel consists of French and international companies that have  leading  global  positions.  These  companies  operate  on similar  markets  and  are,  in  the  cosmetics  sector,  direct competitors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  or  operate  on  the  wider  everyday consumer goods market, as regards all or part of their business activities.\n\nThis  panel  is  composed  of  the  remuneration  of  executives  in the following companies:\n\n| Coty          | Kimberly  Clark    | Reckitt  Benckiser   | Beiersdorf   | Danone             |\n|---------------|--------------------|----------------------|--------------|--------------------|\n| GSK           | Henkel             | LVMH                 | Unilever     | Colgate  Palmolive |\n| Est\u00e9e  Lauder | Johnson &  Johnson | Procter &  Gamble    | Kering       | Colgate  Palmolive |\n\nThis panel is re-examined every year by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee in order to check its relevance. It may evolve, particularly to take into account the changes in the structure  or  business  activities  of  selected  companies,  on the basis of the proposals made by the external firm.\n\n## Remuneration that is aligned to the Company's interests and directly linked to the Company's strategy\n\nThe Board of Directors has aligned the remuneration policy for an  executive  corporate  officer  in  the  interests  of  the Company, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability and development of the Company, taking into consideration the social  and  environmental  challenges  of  its  business  activity and the sense of purpose ( raison d'\u00eatre ) of L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## a) Close links with strategy\n\nThe  remuneration  policy  applied  to  the  executive  corporate officer is directly linked to the Group's strategy.\n\nIt  supports  its  development  model.  It  promotes  harmonious, regular, durable growth, both over the short and long term.\n\nThe Board of Directors' constant desire is indeed to incite the General  Management  both  to  maximise  performance  for each  financial  year  and  to  ensure  that  it  is  repeated  and regular year-on-year.\n\n## b) Performance targets that are directly correlated with those of the Company and create value\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  chooses  to  correlate  the  executive corporate officer's performance directly with the Company's performance  by  using  the  same  performance  indicators, financial indicators in particular.\n\nThe  choice  of  correlating  the  performance  criteria  for  the executive corporate officer's remuneration with the Company's  performance  indicators,  particularly  those  of  a financial  nature,  is  the  guarantee  of  a  clear  and  relevant remuneration policy.\n\nThese  criteria  make  it  possible  to  assess  L'Or\u00e9al's  intrinsic performance,  namely  its  progress  year-on-year  via  internal performance  indicators  and  also  its  relative  performance  as compared  to  its  market  and  its  competitors  via  external growth indicators.\n\nThe objectives adopted generate long-term value creation. In particular, the choice of varied operational financial criteria aims  at  encouraging  durable,  balanced  growth.  Overall long-term performance results from the convergence of these criteria.\n\nThese objectives must also be an incentive for the executive corporate  officer  to  adapt  the  Group's  strategy  to  the profound  transformations  in  the  world  of  beauty,  and  the digital revolution in particular.\n\n## c) Preponderant portion of the remuneration subject to performance conditions\n\nThe executive corporate officer's remuneration must include a predominant portion subject to performance conditions, with annual and multi-annual assessment periods adapted to the time horizon of each of these objectives.\n\n## Remuneration that is directly in line with the Group's ambitious social, societal and environmental commitments\n\nThe remuneration must be designed to favour a regular and sustainable development, in line with the Group's commitments  with  regard  to  ethics,  and  respectful  of  the environment in which L'Or\u00e9al operates.\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al announced its Corporate Social Responsibility vision  by  2030  in  the  context  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme,  which  has  a  set  of  objectives  for  climate, biodiversity, water and the use of natural resources.\n\nThe social and societal commitment is just as important since no  environmental  transition  is  possible  without  an  inclusive society.\n\nThe annual variable portion of the executive corporate officer's remuneration includes non-financial criteria related to L'Or\u00e9al's sense  of  purpose  and  the  commitments  made  by  the  Group, particularly  in  the  context  of  its  corporate  social,  societal  and environmental responsibility programmes.\n\nThese  criteria  will  be  assessed  year-on-year  with  a  long-term perspective.\n\n## Remuneration that creates medium and long-term value for the shareholders\n\nThe executive corporate officer's remuneration must be linked to the  changes  over  the  medium-to  long-term  in  the Company's intrinsic value and share performance.\n\nA  significant  portion  of  the  executive  corporate  officer's remuneration thus consists of performance shares, a significant percentage  of  which  is  retained  until  the  end  of  his/her corporate  office,  with  the  undertaking  not  to  carry  out  risk hedging transactions.\n\nThis leads  to  alignment  with  the  shareholders'  interests, understood as long-term value creation.",

It  serves  as  a  basis  to determine  the  maximum  percentage  of  the  target  annual variable remuneration.\n\n## Annual variable remuneration\n\nThe  target  annual  variable  remuneration  may  amount  to  a maximum of 100% of the fixed remuneration.\n\nThe  annual  variable  remuneration  may  exceed  100%  of  the fixed  remuneration  and  up  to  a  maximum  of  120%  of  this remuneration in order to be able to remunerate outperformance.  This  outperformance  is  assessed  on  a criterion-by-criterion basis.\n\nThe aim is not to encourage inappropriate and excessive risk taking.  For  this  purpose,  the  annual  variable  remuneration remains reasonable in comparison with the fixed portion.\n\nThe variable remuneration is designed to align the executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  with  the  Group's  annual\n\nperformance  and  to  promote  the  implementation  of  its strategy year after year.\n\nThe  variable  remuneration  is  based  on  precise  performance appraisal criteria determined at the beginning of the year by the Board of Directors.\n\nThese criteria are financial, non-financial and qualitative.\n\nThe  financial  and  non-financial  criteria  are  simple  and quantifiable.  They  represent  a  predominant  portion  of  the annual variable remuneration.\n\nA limit is set on the qualitative portion.\n\nThe weighting of each of the criteria and the objectives to be met  are  set  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  in  question  and communicated to the executive corporate officer.\n\nThese criteria are the following:\n\n- \u00b7 for 60% of the annual variable remuneration:\n- \u00b7 financial  criteria  directly  correlated  with  the  Company's performance indicators:\n- -evolution  in  comparable  sales  as  compared  to  the budget (15%),\n- -evolution  in  market  share  compared  to  that  of  key competitors (15%),\n- -evolution  in  operating  profit  as  compared  to  the budget (10%),\n\n2",

This  potential grant to the executive corporate officer, duly documented by the Board of Directors, may not exceed a total annual ceiling (taking into account any grants already awarded in the year) of  5%  of  the  total  number  of  free  shares  granted  during  that same financial year.",

Below  this  level,  the  number  of  finally  vested shares  is  in  decline.  If  the  L'Or\u00e9al's  comparable  growth  in net sales is lower than the average growth in net sales of the panel of competitors, no shares will be finally vested under this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to operating profit , a level of growth,  defined  by  the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  met  or  exceeded in order for  all  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period.  Below  this level, the number of finally vested shares is in decline. If the operating  profit  does  not  increase  in  absolute  value  over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nfor  the  Future  programme  (hereinafter  \"L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future Committements\"):\n\n- -% of sites that are 'carbon neutral';\n- -% of formula ingredients that are bio-sourced, traceable and come from sustainable sources;\n- -% of plastic packaging that comes from either recycled or biobased sources;\n- -number of people benefitting from the Group's brands' social commitment programmes; and\n- \u00b7 gender  balance  within  management  bodies  (strategic positions such as on the Executive Committee, hereinafter the 'Management Bodies').\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  considers  that  both  these  types  of criteria, assessed over a long period of three full financial years and  reapplied  to  several  plans,  are  complementary,  in  line with the objectives and specificities of the Group and likely to promote  continuous,  balanced  and  sustainable  long-term growth. They are exacting but remain a source of motivation for the beneficiaries.\n\nThe shares are only finally vested at the end of a 4-year period, allowing sufficient time to be able to assess the performance achieved over three full financial years.\n\nWith regard to the criterion of fulfilling  commitments made under the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme ,  in  order for all the  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  a  certain average level of achievement of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Committements,  defined  by  the  Board  and  made  public, must be reached over the period. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest if  the  average  of  the  results for the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Committements falls below the minimum level defined by the Board and made public.\n\nWith  regard  to  the  criterion  of  gender  balance  within  the Management Bodies , in order for all the free shares granted to  be  finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the vesting  period,  the  average  representation  of  one  of  the sexes  must  account  for  at  least  40%  of  employees  on  the Management Bodies. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest in relation to this criterion if the average representation of one of the sexes is less than 35% over the vesting period.\n\nThe  results  recorded  each  year  to  determine  the  levels  of performance achieved are published in  Chapter  7  'Stock Market Information Share Capital' of this document.\n\n2",

In  the  event  of  dismissal  of  an  executive corporate officer, the Board will decide, pursuant to the AFEPMEDEF Code, on the outcome of performance shares granted as from the appointment as executive corporate officer.\n\nWhen  the  benefit  of  performance  share  grants  to  the executive corporate officer is maintained in the event of his or her  departure  prior  to  expiry  of  the  vesting  period,  it  is motivated by the following considerations:\n\n- \u00b7 the performance shares represent a predominant component  of  the  executive  corporate  officer's  annual remuneration assessed during the year of the grant;\n- \u00b7 they  are  the  consideration  for  the  execution  of  his  or  her corporate office  subject  to  the  achievement  of  long-term performance;\n- \u00b7 the maintenance  thereof  encourages  the  executive corporate officer to take a long-term view; and\n- \u00b7 the final vesting of the shares remains  subject  to achievement of the performance conditions.\n\n## ACHIEVEMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS OF THE LAST THREE PERFORMANCE SHARE PLANS\n\n| Performance share plan dated:                                               | 20/04/2016         | 20/04/2017         | 17/04/2018         |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Arithmetic average of performances across the 3 financial years  concerned  | 2017 - 2018 - 2019 | 2018 - 2019 - 2020 | 2019 - 2020 - 2021 |\n| For 50%: Growth in comparable sales as compared to a panel  of competitors* | +1.47 points       | +2.7 points        | +4.6 points        |\n| For 50%: Growth in the Group's operating profit                             | +6.99%             | +3.95%             | +8.3%              |\n| Level of achievement of the performance conditions                          | 100%               | 82.95%             | 100%               |\n\n- * Panel of competitors: Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Shiseido, Beiersdorf, Johnson & Johnson, Henkel, LVMH, Kao and Coty.\n\n## Other benefits\n\n## a) Remuneration for term of office as Director\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer  does  not  benefit  from  the payment of a remuneration for his/her position as Director.\n\n## b) Benefits in addition to remuneration\n\n## \u00b7 Benefits in kind\n\nThere  are  no  plans  to  supplement  the  executive  corporate officer's fixed remuneration by granting benefits in kind.\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer  benefits  from  the  necessary material resources for performance of his or her office such as, for  example,  the  provision  of  a  car  with  a  driver.  These arrangements,  which  are  strictly  limited  to  professional  use, are not benefits in kind.\n\n## \u00b7 Additional social protection schemes\n\nThe executive corporate officer continues to be treated in the same  way  as  a  senior  manager  during  the  term  of  his corporate office which allows him to continue to benefit from the additional social protection schemes and, in particular, the defined  contribution  pension  scheme,  and  the  employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.",

Remuneration policy applicable to the Chairman of the Board who does not assume the office of Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Fixed annual remuneration only\n\nThe Board of Directors, in accordance with the recommendation  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  (Article  25-2),  is proposing to the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2022 that the exercise of the office of Chairman of the Board of Directors without assuming the office of Chief Executive Officer, would be  remunerated  only  by  fixed  remuneration,  excluding  any variable remuneration, grant of performance shares and any indemnity related to departure or any consideration for a noncompete agreement.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that the tenure as Director held by the Chairman  of  the  Board  would  not  be remunerated.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  will  benefit  from  the  necessary material resources for the performance of his office such as, for example,  the  provision  of  a  car  with  a  driver.  These arrangements, which are strictly limited to professional use, are not benefits in kind.\n\nThe  Chairman  of  the  Board  will  benefit  from  the  same employee  benefit  scheme  as  the  senior  managers  of  the Company.\n\n## Principles for determining the fixed annual remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Directors is determined based on the following components:\n\n- \u00b7 goals of L'Or\u00e9al's Board of Directors for the performance of the Chairman's legal duties without assuming the office of Chief Executive Officer;\n- \u00b7 experience,  expertise  and  reputation  of  the  Chairman  in Corporate Governance and Sustainable Governance;\n- \u00b7 specific  duties  assigned  to  the  Chairman  by  the  Board  of Directors;\n- \u00b7 competitiveness and level of the remuneration compared to  that  of  a  relevant  reference  panel:  17  international companies, including 6 companies already selected in the remuneration panel for the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, prepared by the Mercer firm; and\n- \u00b7 appeal  of  the  remuneration  compared  with  the  prior remuneration  of  the  corporate  officer  and  the  pension amount they are likely to receive.\n\n## Application to Mr Jean-Paul Agon\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  fully  aware  of  the  challenges  of sustainable Governance,  notably  in  light of European legislative initiatives and  the  growing  expectations of authorities and stakeholders.\n\nIt is essential for the Board to count on a committed, experienced and  competent  Chairman,  like  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  who  is recognised  for  his  involvement  in  governance  issues  and  in relations with stakeholders.\n\nMr  Jean-Paul  Agon,  who  organises  the  work  of  the  Board  of Directors,  which  he  has  chaired  since  2011,  has  already brought  the  Governance  of  L'Or\u00e9al  to  an  exemplary  level, while  successfully  assuming  the  General  Management of the Company.  His  full-time  commitment  to  the  benefit  of  the Company's  Governance  is  an  importance  source  of  added value for the Board, which wants to highlight the expertise of Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  whose  in-depth  knowledge  of  the company,  its  environment  and  its  strategic  challenges  is  a major asset.\n\nThe  Chairman's  remuneration  matches  the  Board's  goal  of ensuring the continuity of its work and to allow development in light of the increasingly important duties expected from a Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board has also taken into consideration the extensive duties it has  decided  to  entrust  to  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  in  his  position  as Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nFinally,  the  Board  took  account  of  the  expectations  of  the stakeholders, by placing this remuneration in perspective with the remuneration offered by an international reference panel that was  defined  with  the  assistance  of  an  external independent consultancy firm.\n\nThe analysis of remunerations of Chairs of Boards of Directors of companies  in  the  reference  panel  used,  which  includes  6 companies  with  a  dissociated  governance  structure  already used in the reference panel for the remuneration of executive corporate  officers,  reports  an  average  remuneration  of \u20ac1,521,200 and a median remuneration of \u20ac695,200 with large standard deviations.\n\nAs a result of this analysis and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors  at  its  meeting  of  9  February  2022  propose  to  the Annual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2022  to  set  the  fixed annual remuneration of Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman of the Board, at \u20ac1,600,000.\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon notified the Company of the termination of his employment contract on 30 April 2021, in order to be able to  benefit  from  his  mandatory  retirement  rights  as  from 1  May  2021.  Under  his  employment  contract,  he  is  able  to benefit  from  a  gross  annual  pension  benefit  of  \u20ac1.59  million under L'Or\u00e9al's supplementary defined benefit pension scheme ' Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture ' (Pension  Cover  of  Members  of  the Comit\u00e9  de  Conjoncture ) which has been closed since 31 December 2000 (1) . The Board of Directors  agreed  to  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  wish  to  waive  the benefit  of  this  supplementary  pension  so  as  not  to  combine  it with a fair remuneration for the duties of Chairman as expressed by the Board in this policy.\n\n2",

Decision-making, review and implementation process for the remuneration of corporate officers\n\nRemuneration is established in such a way as to guarantee the due and proper application of the policy and rules set by the Board  of  Directors.  The  Board  relies  on  the  work  and recommendations of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  composed  of  six  Directors,  60%  of  whom  are independent  Directors,  including  its  Chairwoman,  and  one member  of  whom  is  a  Director  representing  the  employees.

These  companies operate  on  similar  markets  and  are,  in  the  cosmetics  sector, direct  competitors  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  or  operate  on  the  wider everyday  consumer  goods  market,  as  regards  all  or  part  of their business activities.\n\nThe  panel  applicable  for  2021  comprised  Directors  of  the following 14 companies:\n\n## PANEL SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS OF THE POSITIONING OF THE REMUNERATION FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n| Beiersdorf     | Colgate  Palmolive   | Coty   | Danone             |\n|----------------|----------------------|--------|--------------------|\n| Est\u00e9e Lauder   | GSK                  | Henkel | Johnson  & Johnson |\n| Kimberly Clark | Kering               | LVMH   | Procter  & Gamble  |\n\nIt  is  used  to  assess  the  competitiveness  of  the  executive corporate officer's total remuneration.\n\nThis  panel  reports  an  average  remuneration  of  \u20ac12,384,400 and a median remuneration of \u20ac9,140,600.\n\nIn  terms  of  market  capitalisation,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  above  the  third quartile of companies on this panel.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  the  Company's  remuneration  policy, specifically  that  in  place  for  senior  management  executives, aims to position their remuneration between the median and the third quartile.\n\nThe  studies  conducted  with  the  independent  consulting  firm also enable the Committee to measure:\n\n- \u00b7 the  competitiveness  and  comparability  of  the  overall remuneration in relation to this reference panel, taking into account  the  experience  and  skills  acquired  by  the  Chief Executive Officer after a 34-year career in the Group;\n- \u00b7 the  relevance  over  time  of  the  overall  remuneration structure and the objectives assigned to him/her;\n- \u00b7 the  comparative  results  of  L'Or\u00e9al  in  light  of  the  criteria adopted by the Group to assess the executive corporate officer's performance; and\n- \u00b7 the link between  the  executive  corporate  officer's remuneration and his or her performance.\n\n## Non-executive corporate officer\n\nTo  determine  the  positioning  of  the  Chairman's  remuneration, a  panel  was  defined  with  the  help  of  an  independent consultancy firm.  It  is  composed  of  17  international  companies, selected  on  the  basis  of  governance,  industry,  size  and nationality.\n\nThey are the following dual governance companies:\n\n## PANEL SELECTED FOR ANALYSIS OF THE POSITIONING OF THE REMUNERATION FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n| AstraZeneca   | AB In Bev          | BASF   | Bayer       | Coty     | Diageo   |\n|---------------|--------------------|--------|-------------|----------|----------|\n| Est\u00e9e Lauder  | GSK                | Henkel | Kraft Heinz | Linde    | Nestl\u00e9   |\n| Novartis      | Reckitt  Benckiser | Roche  | Starbucks   | Unilever |          |\n\nThe analysis of remunerations of Chairs of Boards of Directors of companies  in  the  reference  panel  used,  which  includes  six companies  with  a  dissociated  governance  structure  already used  in  the  reference  panel  for  the  remuneration  of  the executive corporate officer, reports an average remuneration of  \u20ac1,521,200  and  a  median  remuneration  of  \u20ac695,200  with large standard deviations.\n\n## The Human Resources and Remuneration Committee has all the useful internal information in its possession\n\nThis  information  enables  it  to  assess  the  performance  of  the Company  and  that  of  its  executive  corporate  officer  both from a financial standpoint and in non-financial areas.\n\nThe  Group's  annual  economic  and  financial  results  are presented  every  year  completely  and  exhaustively  to  the members  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee  at  its  Committee  meeting  in  February,  and  are used  as  a  basis  for  the  assessment  of  the  financial performance  criteria  for  the  executive  corporate  officer's variable remuneration.\n\nThe  principles  of  the  Human  Resources  policy  are  regularly presented  to  the  Committee  members  or  at  a  Board  of Directors  meeting  by  the  Chief  Human  Relations  Officer.  The Directors are therefore able to verify the consistency between the remuneration of the executive corporate officer and the remuneration and employment conditions of the Company's employees.\n\nSimilarly,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Officer  also regularly explains the policy and the actions taken in this field.\n\n2",

She  is  also Chairwoman of the Nominations and Governance Committee,  which  offers  her  a  Company-wide  vision  of  the various performance assessment criteria.\n\nThe Committee can also carry out a more in-depth evaluation of the Company's performance by contacting the Company's main  senior  managers,  after  having  informed  the  General Management.\n\nThis  information  enriches  their  vision  of  the  strategy  and performances  of  the  Company  and  its  executive  corporate officer.\n\nRecommendations are made on these bases to the Board of Directors,  which  then  makes  its  decisions  on  the  executive corporate  officer's  remuneration  collectively,  in  accordance with the remuneration policy approved by the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe  organisation  of  the  work  of  the  Committee  on  the remuneration of the executive corporate officer is shown in the chart below.\n\n## The Committee examines the expectations of investors and proxy advisors, and the rules and recommendations of the regulatory authorities\n\nThe Human Resources and Remuneration Committee carefully analyses the law and reports concerning executive remuneration, notably the French financial markets authority's (AMF) report on corporate governance and the remuneration of executives of listed companies, and the report of the High Committee on Corporate Governance.\n\nIt  is  mindful  of  the  observations and requests of investors and strives to accommodate them while preserving consistency in the  remuneration  policy  adopted  by  the  Board  and  subject to constraints  relating  to  the  disclosure  of  confidential information.\n\n## Conditions for derogation from the remuneration policy in the event of exceptional circumstances\n\nFrench Order no. 2019-1234 of 27 November 2019 encourages companies  to  provide  for  any  exceptions  in  the  event  of extraordinary  circumstances  in  their  remuneration  policy. Failing this, the Board of Directors would be unable to grant an element of remuneration not provided for in the remuneration policy  previously  approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting, even though this decision would be necessary in view of these exceptional  circumstances.  It  is  stated  that  this  derogation may  only  be  temporary,  pending  the  approval  of  the amended  remuneration  policy  by  the  next  Annual  General Meeting, and should be duly substantiated.\n\nIf applicable,  the  adaptation  of  the  remuneration  policy  to exceptional  circumstances  would  be  decided  by  the  Board  of Directors on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration  Committee,  after  seeking the opinion, as necessary, of an independent consulting firm. Thus, for example, the  recruitment  of  a  new  corporate  officer  under  unforeseen conditions  might  require  the  temporary  adaptation  of  some existing remuneration  elements  or  the  proposal  of  new remuneration  elements.  In  this  case,  the  Board  of  Directors would  take  into  account  the  experience,  expertise  and remuneration of the executive concerned in order to propose exceptional remuneration that could not exceed the amount of  the  benefits  he  or  she  would  have  had  to  relinquish  by leaving his or her previous role.\n\nIt  might  also  be  necessary  to  amend, subject to compliance with  the  caps  determined  in  the  remuneration  policy,  the performance  conditions  governing  the  acquisition  of  all  or some  of  the  existing  remuneration  elements  in  the  event  of exceptional circumstances resulting from a significant change in the  Group's  scope  following  a  merger  or  sale,  the acquisition or creation of a significant new business activity or the  elimination  of  a  significant  business  activity,  a  change  in accounting  policy  or  a  major  event  affecting  the  markets and/or L'Or\u00e9al's major competitors.",

Remuneration paid during the 2021 financial year or allocated for that year to Mr Jean-Paul Agon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, over the period from 1 January to 30 April 2021\n\n## 2.4.2.2.1. Fixed remuneration\n\nAt its meeting of 11 February 2021, and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  maintain Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  fixed  annual  remuneration  at  the  gross amount  of  \u20ac2,200,000,  paid  on  a  proportional  basis  for  the period from 1 January to 30 April 2021.\n\nThis has remained unchanged since 2014.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.2. Annual variable remuneration\n\nConcerning Mr Jean-Paul Agon's annual variable remuneration for 2021, the objective had been set at a gross amount of \u20ac2,200,000 on an annual basis, representing 100% of the  fixed  remuneration.  This  sum  represents  the  maximum amount of variable remuneration that may be paid to him.\n\nAt its meeting on 11 February 2021, the Board of Directors had set the variable remuneration criteria applicable for 2021 and the respective weighting of such criteria. The financial criteria represent  60%  of  the  variable  remuneration  while  the  nonfinancial  criteria  represent  40%.  These  financial  criteria  are directly correlated with the Company's economic\n\nperformance indicators: growth in sales and market share as compared to its main competitors, in operating profit, earnings per share (EPS) and cash-flow.\n\nOn 9 February 2022, the Board of Directors, on the basis of the recommendations of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, assessed the performance of Mr Jean-Paul Agon. The rate of achievement was 99.6% of objectives. It was thus decided  that  in  respect  of  annual  variable  remuneration  for 2021,  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  would  be  awarded  an  amount  of \u20ac730,400 for the first four months of the year.\n\nFulfilment  of  the  quantitative  financial  and  non-financial criteria  was  assessed  for  the  whole  of  2021.  On  this  basis, annual  variable  remuneration  was  calculated pro  rata temporis .\n\nFor  information,  following  the  approval  by  the  Annual  General Meeting  of  20  April  2021  (Resolution  10),  an  annual  variable remuneration  was  paid  for  the  2020  financial  year  in  the  total amount  of  \u20ac859,831,  since  the  Board  of  Directors  decided  on 11  February  2021,  as  recommended  by  the  Human  Resources and  Remuneration  Committee,  that  97.71%  of  the  maximum objective had been achieved, solely on the basis of non-financial and qualitative criteria.\n\n## FINANCIAL TARGETS 2021 (60% OF TOTAL ANNUAL VARIABLE REMUNERATION)\n\n| Financial criteria                                          | Weighting   | 2021 Results      | Target and  maximum  payment rate:  100% of the  fixed amount   | Board appraisal                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Like-for-like sales as compared to the budget (1)           | 15%         | \u20ac32,287.6 million | 100%                                                            | Performance well above the budget. |\n| Sales growth differential compared to main  competitors (2) | 15%         | +6.9 points       | 100%                                                            | Maximum objective reached.         |\n| Operating profit as compared to the budget (1)              | 10%         | \u20ac6,160.3 million  | 100%                                                            | Maximum objective reached.         |\n| Earnings per share (3)  as compared to the budget (1)       | 10%         | \u20ac8.82             | 100%                                                            | Maximum objective reached.         |\n| Cash flow (4)  as compared to the budget (1)                | 10%         | \u20ac5,653.3 million  | 100%                                                            | Performance well above the budget. |\n| RATE OF ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL TARGETS                    |             |                   | 100%                                                            |                                    |\n\n- (1) Budget not provided for reasons of confidentiality.\n- (2) Panel of competitors: Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Shiseido, Beiersdorf, Johnson & Johnson, Henkel, LVMH, Kao and Coty.\n- (3) Diluted share attributable to owners of the company per share excluding non-recurring items.\n- (4) Cumulative operating cash flow = Cash flow generated by operating activities - purchases of tangible and intangible assets.\n\n## 2021 NON-FINANCIAL AND QUALITATIVE TARGETS (40% OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL VARIABLE REMUNERATION)\n\n| Non-financial and qualitative criteria                                          | Weighting                                                    | 2021 performance  indicators                                 | Target and  maximum  payment rate:  100% of the  fixed amount   | Board appraisal                                       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| CSR criteria: L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme                                  | 10%                                                          | See indicators page 112                                      | 96%                                                             | Performance in line with the  programme's trajectory. |\n| Human Resources criterion                                                       | 7.5%                                                         | See indicators page 112                                      | 100%                                                            | Outperformance.

Granting of performance shares\n\nMr  Jean-Paul  Agon  did  not  receive  any  performance  shares in 2021.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.4. Remuneration as Director\n\nMr  Jean-Paul  Agon  does  not  receive  any  remuneration  as  a Director.\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon does not receive any remuneration as a Director of Group companies.\n\n## 2.4.2.2.5. Additional social protection schemes\n\nMr  Jean-Paul  Agon  continued  to  benefit,  because  of  his classification as a senior manager during his term of corporate office  and  until  the  termination  of  his  employment  contract, from  the  additional  social  protection  schemes  and,  in particular, the defined contribution pension scheme, and the\n\nemployee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.\n\nThe amount of the employer's contributions to the employee benefit and healthcare schemes for the period from 1 January to 30 April 2021 amounted to \u20ac1,392, and the amount of the employer's  contribution  to  the  Defined  Contribution  Pension scheme amounted to \u20ac2,125.\n\nAs  for  all  other  senior  managers  of  the  Group,  the  pension amount  resulting  from  the  employer  contributions  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  RCD  must  be  deducted  from  the  amount  of  the Pension Cover for the calculation of the life annuity potentially due under this plan so that these benefits are not combined (see section 2.4.3.4. 'Application of the related-party agreements scheme' of this document).\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  lifetime  risk  related  to  the  plans  resulting from Article 83, 2\u00b0 of the French General Tax Code is borne by the insurer.\n\n## 2.4.2.3. Remuneration paid during the 2021 financial year or allocated for that year to Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer, over the period from 1 May to 31 December 2021\n\n## 2.4.2.3.1. Fixed remuneration\n\nAt its meeting of 11 February 2021, and on the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided to set Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' fixed annual remuneration at the gross amount of \u20ac2,000,000,  paid  on  a  proportional  basis  for  the  period  from 1 May to 31 December 2021.\n\n## 2.4.2.3.2. Annual variable remuneration\n\nWith regard to Nicolas Hieronimus' annual variable remuneration for 2021, the target was set at \u20ac2,000,000 gross on an annual basis, or 100% of his fixed remuneration, with a maximum  of  120%  of  fixed  remuneration  in  the  event  of outperformance,  or  \u20ac2,400,000  gross.  This  sum  represents  the maximum amount of variable remuneration that may be paid to him.\n\nAt its meeting on 11 February 2021, the Board of Directors had set the variable remuneration criteria applicable for 2021 and the respective weighting of such criteria. The financial criteria represent  60%  of  the  variable  remuneration  while  the  nonfinancial  criteria  represent  40%.  These  financial  criteria  are directly correlated with the Company's economic performance indicators: growth in sales and market share as compared to its main competitors, in operating profit, earnings per share (EPS) and cash-flow.\n\nOn 9 February 2022, the Board of Directors, on the basis of the recommendations of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee, assessed the performance of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus. The rate of achievement  was  116.45%  of objectives.  It  was  thus  decided  that,  in  respect  of  annual variable  remuneration  for  2021,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  would be awarded an amount of \u20ac1,552,667 for the period between 1 May and 31 December 2021.\n\n## FINANCIAL TARGETS 2021 (60% OF TOTAL ANNUAL VARIABLE REMUNERATION)\n\n| Financial criteria                                         | Weighting   | 2021 Results      | Payment rate  Target 100% of the  fixed amount   Maximum 120%   | Board appraisal                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Like-for-like sales as compared to the budget (1)          | 15%         | \u20ac32,287.6 million | 118%                                                            | Performance well  above the budget. |\n| Sales growth differential compared to main competitors (2) | 15%         | +6.9 points       | 120%                                                            | Maximum objective reached.          |\n| Operating profit as compared to the budget (1)             | 10%         | \u20ac6,160.3 million  | 120%                                                            | Maximum objective reached.          |\n| Earnings per share (3)  as compared to the budget (1)      | 10%         | \u20ac8.82             | 120%                                                            | Maximum objective reached.          |\n| Cash flow (4)  as compared to the budget (1)               | 10%         | \u20ac5,653.3 million  | 119%                                                            | Performance well  above the budget. |\n| RATE OF ACHIEVEMENT OF 2021 FINANCIAL TARGETS              |             |                   | 119.3%                                                          |                                     |\n\n- (1) Budget not provided for reasons of confidentiality.\n- (2) Panel of competitors: Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Shiseido, Beiersdorf, Johnson & Johnson, Henkel, LVMH, Kao and Coty.\n- (3) Diluted share attributable to owners of the company per share excluding non-recurring items.\n- (4) Cumulative operating cash flow = Cash flow generated by operating activities - purchases of tangible and intangible assets.",

Below  this  level, the grant decreases. If the L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales  is  lower  than  the  average  growth  in  net  sales  of  the panel of competitors, no shares will be finally vested under this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all  the  free  shares  granted  to  finally  vest  at  the  end  of  the vesting period, a level of growth defined by the Board but not made public for confidentiality reasons, must be achieved or exceeded.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases.  If  the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nThe figures recorded year on year to determine the levels of performance achieved are published in the Annual Financial Report.\n\n## Main features of the grant\n\nThis  Plan  enabled  588,750  performance  shares  (ACAs)  to  be granted to 2,408 beneficiaries, i.e. 0.1% of the share capital.\n\nThe  conditional  grant  of  performance  shares  benefiting Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  in  2021  represents  2.89%  of  the  total number  of  performance  shares  granted  and  0.003%  of  the share capital as at 31 July 2021.\n\nIn  addition,  as  a  corporate  officer,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  will retain 50% of the shares that will finally vest at the end of the vesting  period  in  registered  form  until  the  end  of  his  term  of corporate office.\n\nFurthermore, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus has undertaken not to use risk hedging instruments.\n\nTo recap, Mr Nicolas Hieronimus was not awarded any other long-term incentives in 2021.\n\n## 2.4.2.3.4.

'Application  of  the  related-party  agreements scheme' of this document).\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  lifetime  risk  related  to  the  plans  resulting from Article 83, 2\u00b0 of the French General Tax Code is borne by the insurer.\n\n## 2.4.2.4.

Mr Agon did not receive any performance shares in 2021.\n- (3) The remuneration of Nicolas Hieronimus, Chief Executive Officer from 1 May 2021, comprises a fixed remuneration component expressed on an annual basis and a performance share award.\n\n## Methodology used for calculating ratios\n\nThe ratios presented above take into account the separation of  the  functions  of  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer, which  took  place  on  1  May  2021,  as  the  Board  of  Directors decided  to  renew  the  position  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  as Chairman  of  the  Board  and  appoint  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nPursuant to Article L. 22-10-9 of the French Commercial Code, for the calculation of average and median remuneration, the scope  used  is  that  of  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.,  which  comprises  9,183 employees as at 31 December 2021 (i.e. 64% of the workforce at  L'Or\u00e9al  France)  of  whom  6,641  are  managers  and  sales representatives, 2,080 are technicians and supervisors and 462 employees and manual workers. This scope is representative of the  various  business  lines  of  L'Or\u00e9al:  Operations  (plants  and distribution  centres),  Sales,  Marketing,  Digital,  Research,  Support functions, etc.\n\nFor  reasons  of  comparability,  and  in  accordance  with  the recommendations  of  the  AFEP,  the  number  of  employees selected for the calculation of average  and  median remuneration  corresponds  to  a  full-time  equivalent  workforce continuously  present  over  24  months,  excluding  corporate\n\nofficers. Remuneration is calculated on the basis of all amounts paid and performance shares granted during the financial year in question.\n\nThe  elements  composing  the  executives'  remuneration  used in the calculation are:\n\n- \u25cf the annual fixed remuneration paid in 2021 (on an annual basis);\n- \u25cf the annual variable remuneration paid in 2021 (on an annual basis); and\n- \u25cf the performance shares valued on the grant date in 2021 in  accordance  with  the  IFRS  applied  for  the  preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe elements composing employee remuneration used in the calculation are:\n\n- \u25cf annual fixed remuneration paid in 2021;\n- \u25cf annual variable remuneration paid in 2021;\n- \u25cf other  elements  of  annual  remuneration  paid  in  2021 (excluding exceptional factors);\n- \u25cf the performance  shares  granted  in  2021  valued  in accordance  with  the  IFRS  applied  for  the  preparation of the consolidated financial statements; and\n- \u25cf the gross Profit-sharing and Incentives paid in 2021.\n\n2",

Termination indemnities and supplementary pension scheme applicable to executive corporate officers\n\nThe  termination  indemnities  and  supplementary  pension scheme  for  which  the  corporate  officers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  may  be eligible,  as  long  as  they  are  former  senior  managers  of  the company with more than 15 years of service, are not related to  performance  of  the  corporate  office,  but  could  be  due under the suspended employment contract.\n\nTherefore,  they  are  not  subject  to  the  approval  of  the  Annual General  Meeting  of  21  April  2022  under  resolution  no.  15 'Approval  of  the  remuneration  policy  for  the  Chief  Executive Officer'.\n\nShareholders  approved  these  schemes  in  the  context  of approving the agreement suspending the executive corporate officer's employment contract.\n\nThis  was  the  case  for  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  by  the  vote  of  the Annual General Meetings of 27 April 2010 and 17 April 2018, ruling on the Special Report prepared by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nShareholders  approved these schemes for Nicolas Hieronimus by means of the vote of the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\n## 2.4.3.1. Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe AFEP-MEDEF Code to which L'Or\u00e9al refers, recommends, but  does  not  require,  that  companies  should  put  an  end  to combining an employment contract with a corporate office.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  shares  the  objectives  of  this recommendation  which  aims  at  avoiding  the  possibility  of concurrently  obtaining  benefits  both  from  the  employment contract  and  the  corporate  office  and  at  prohibiting  any interference with the possibility of removing  executive corporate  officers ad  nutum . The  Board  of  Directors  has formally  provided  for  the  methods  of  application  of  the objectives of the recommendation, as adapted to the context in the L'Or\u00e9al Group.\n\nThe Board's intention is to use the treatment set out below for any new corporate officer appointed who has over 15 years' length  of  service  in  the  Group  at  the  time  of  his  or  her appointment.\n\nAs  L'Or\u00e9al's  ongoing  policy  is  to  appoint  employees  who  have completely  succeeded  in  the  various  stages  of  their  careers  in the  Group  as  executive  corporate  officers,  the  Board  does  not want these executives to  be  deprived  of  the  benefits  to  which they  would  have  continued  to  be  entitled  had  they  remained employees, after spending many years of their career at L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  considered  that  the  objective pursued  by  the  AFEP-MEDEF  recommendation  could  be  fully achieved  by  maintaining  the  suspension  of  the  employment contract  and  clearly  separating  the  benefits  related  to  the corporate  office  from  those  relating  to  the  employment contract.\n\nRemuneration  in  respect  of  the  corporate  office  will  in  no event  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  calculation  of  all benefits that may be due under the employment contract.\n\nThe  reference  remuneration  to  be  taken  into  account  for  all rights attached to the employment contract and, in particular, for  the  calculation  of  the  pension  under  the  defined  benefit scheme is based on the amount of remuneration at the date of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract.  This  reference remuneration  is  revised  annually  by  applying  the  revaluation\n\ncoefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published by the French state pension fund (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance  Vieillesse).  The  seniority  applied  will  cover  the entire career within the Group, including the years spent as an executive corporate officer.\n\n## 2.4.3.2. Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  the  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on the reasons for such termination, the executive corporate officer would only be paid termination indemnities, except in the  event  of  gross  misconduct  or  gross  negligence,  or retirement indemnities in the event of voluntary retirement or retirement  at  the  Company's  request  pursuant  to  the suspended  employment  contract  excluding  any  indemnity due in respect of the corporate office.\n\nThese indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the  employment  contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries  (Convention  Collective  Nationale  des  Industries Chimiques) and the company-level agreements applicable to all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers,  are  automatically  due  pursuant  to  the public policy rules of French labour law. They are not subject to any  condition  other  than  those  provided  for  by  the  National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries or the above-mentioned company-level agreements.\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  the  employment  contract, financial  consideration  for  the  non-compete  clause  would  be paid under the terms of said contract, pursuant to the provisions of  the  National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the Chemical Industries, unless the executive corporate officer were to be released from application of the clause. This clause does not  apply  in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  compulsory retirement  on  the  Company's  initiative:  no  consideration  for non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\n## 2.4.3.3. Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nThe  executive  corporate  officer,  subject  to  ending  his  or  her career in the Company, will benefit from one of the defined benefit  schemes  currently  applicable  to  the  Group's  senior managers. This is the scheme to which he or she was subject as an employee.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  rights  to  the  defined  benefit  pension  are uncertain and  conditional  on  the  completion  of  the beneficiary's  career  in  the  Company.  These  schemes  were established by L'Or\u00e9al primarily with the goal of attracting and retaining  the  Company's  senior  managers  by  guaranteeing them a certain level of resources in retirement.\n\nThese schemes falling under Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code, are now closed to any new beneficiaries and no longer  create  rights  as  from  31  December  2019  pursuant  to French  Order  no.  2019-697  of  3  July  2019  on  professional supplementary  pension  schemes  that  transposes  the  European Directive of 16 April 2014.\n\nThe main features of these schemes are explained in detail in section  4.3.2.5.

These contributions are deductible from  the  corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the employer's  contribution  as  provided  by  Article  L.  137-11,  2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nIn  the  light  of  the  legal  characteristics  of  defined  benefit pension  schemes  (the  rights  only  accrue  if  the  beneficiary ends  his  career  in  the  Company  and  the  funding  of  this scheme  cannot  be  broken  down  individually  by  employee) and on account of the characteristics specific to the L'Or\u00e9al schemes, known as 'differential' schemes since they take into account, in order to supplement them, all the other pensions such as those resulting,  inter  alia,  from  the  French  basic  and supplementary  pension  schemes,  the  precise  amount  of  the pension  annuity  will  in  fact  only  be  calculated  on  the  date when the beneficiary applies for all his pensions.\n\n## 2.4.3.4. Application of the related-party agreements scheme\n\nThe  above  provisions  are  subject  to  the  procedure  for related-party agreements.\n\nThe  benefits  that  may  be  due  under  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's suspended  employment  contract  were  approved  by  the Annual  General  Meeting  of  27  April  2010  pursuant  to  Article L. 225-38 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe  Annual  General  Meeting  of  17  April  2018  approved  the implementation  of  the  provisions  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's employment  contract  regarding  defined  benefit  pension scheme  commitments  for  the  duration  of  his  renewed corporate office.\n\nFor  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  an  agreement  suspending  his employment contract was approved by the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 (resolution no. 15). This mechanism is restated  every  year  in  the  chapter  on  the  remuneration  of corporate officers and in the Statutory Auditors' special report on related-party agreements.\n\n## 2.4.3.5. Situation of Mr Jean-Paul Agon for the period from 1 January 2021 to 30 April 2021\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon was appointed as Chief Executive Officer in April 2006, following a brilliant career spanning 27 years with L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe Board of Directors did not wish for Mr Jean-Paul Agon, who accepted the office of Chief Executive Officer after 27 years within  L'Or\u00e9al,  to  be  deprived  of  the  benefits  to  which  he would  have  continued  to  be  entitled  had  he  remained  an employee, and adopted the following measures:\n\n## 1) Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe remuneration under the suspended employment contract to be taken into account for all the rights attached thereto, and in particular  for  the  calculation  of  the  defined  benefit  pension referred to below, is based on the amount of remuneration at the date  of  suspension  of  the  contract  in  2006,  namely  fixed remuneration of \u20ac1,500,000 and  variable remuneration of \u20ac1,250,000.  This  reference  remuneration  is  revised  annually  by applying  the  revaluation  coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and pension contributions published by the French state pension fund ( Caisse  nationale  d'assurance  vieillesse ).  As  of  1  January  2021,\n\nthe  fixed  remuneration  amounted  to  \u20ac1,731,000  and  the variable remuneration to \u20ac1,442,500.\n\nThe seniority applied covers his entire career within the Group, including  the  years  he  was  Chief  Executive  Officer  and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 2) Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nPayment  of  the  indemnities  due  under  the  suspended employment  contract  had  been  approved  by  the  Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2010.\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  his  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on  the  reasons  for  such  termination,  it  was  foreseen  that  Mr Jean-Paul  Agon would only be paid termination indemnities, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, or  retirement  indemnities  in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement or  at  the  Company's  request  pursuant  to  the  suspended employment contract.\n\nThese indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the  employment  contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the National  Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical Industries  (Convention  Collective  Nationale  des  Industries Chimiques) and the company-level agreements applicable to all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers,  are  automatically  due  pursuant  to  the public policy rules of French labour law. They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the National Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries or  the  above-mentioned  company-level  agreements.  The same  applies  to  the  non-compete  clause  and  the  related financial consideration.\n\nPursuant  to  the  schedule  of  indemnities  under  the  National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries, in the event of dismissal, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross  negligence,  the  indemnity  could  be  capped,  in  light  of Mr Jean-Paul Agon's  length of service, at 20 months' remuneration under the suspended employment contract.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  employment  contract,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the  Chemical  Industries,  in  the  event  of  termination  of  the employment  contract,  provided  that  the  indemnity  due  in consideration of the non-compete clause would be payable every  month  for  two  years  on  the  basis  of  two-thirds  of  the monthly  fixed  remuneration  attached  to  the  suspended employment contract  unless  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  were  to  be released from application of the clause. This clause does not apply  in  the  event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  compulsory retirement  on  the  Company's  initiative:  no  consideration  for non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\n## 3) Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon benefits, under his suspended employment contract,  from  the  'Garantie  de  Retraite  des  Membres  du Comit\u00e9  de  Conjoncture'  (Pension  Cover  of  Members  of  the Comit\u00e9  de  Conjoncture)  scheme  closed  to  new  members effective from 31 December 2000.\n\nThe main features of this scheme, which falls under Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code, are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 around  120  senior  managers  (active  or  retired)  are concerned;\n- \u00b7 the minimum length of service requirement was 10 years at the  time  of  closure  of  the  scheme  on  31  December  2000; and\n\n2",

The  premiums  paid  are  deductible  from the corporate income tax and are subject to the employer's contribution as provided by Article L. 137-11, 2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nThe above provisions are subject to the procedure for relatedparty agreements. The corresponding agreement was approved  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  on  27  April  2010 making a decision with regard to the Special Report prepared by the Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe provisions of this agreement remained unchanged within the  scope  of  the  appointment  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon  as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer as from 18 March 2011 and  the  renewal  of  his  term  of  office  on  17  April  2014  and 17  April  2018.  Pursuant  to  Article  L.  225-40-1  of  the  French Commercial  Code,  this  agreement  was  examined  by  the Board of Directors on 11 February 2021, which confirmed the relevance and terms thereof. The Annual General Meeting of 17 April 2018 approved, pursuant to the old Article L 225-42-1 of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  the  implementation  of  the provisions  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  employment  contract  for the duration of the renewed corporate office, as approved by the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2010, corresponding to  defined  benefit  pension  scheme  commitments. The Board of Directors subordinated the increase in conditional rights for the period to the achievement of the performance conditions, assessed in light of the Company's performance.\n\nThe  increase  for  a  financial  year  therefore  depends  on  the achievement of at least 80% of the performance targets taken into  account to determine the annual variable remuneration of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon.  If  the  80%  threshold  is  not  met,  no increase will be granted for the financial year in question.\n\nPursuant  to  the  provisions  of  the  agreement  to  suspend  the employment contract on defined benefit pension commitments  for  the  tenure  of  his  new  term  of  office,  the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer benefits from:\n\n- \u00b7 the calculation basis of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's pension will be revalued according to the salaries and  contributions  revaluation  coefficient  for  pensions published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund  (Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse), as set out above; and\n- \u00b7 secondly,  the  Chairman  and  Chief  Executive  Officer  will continue  to  accrue  seniority  during  the  renewed  term  of  his corporate  office,  up  to  the  date  on  which  he  reaches  the upper limit of 40 years of service required under the scheme, namely,  on  1  September  2018.  As  a  result,  no  other supplementary annuity could subsequently be granted to him.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  11  February  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors noted  that  the  performance  conditions  were  fully  met. Therefore,  the  Board  decided  that  the  Chairman  and  Chief Executive Officer benefits from the principle of the revaluation of  his  pension  on  the  basis  of  the  salaries  and  contributions\n\nrevaluation coefficient published by the French State pension system  ( Caisse  Nationale  d'Assurance  Vieillesse )  (coefficient equal to 1.004 for 2020).\n\n## 2.4.3.6. Situation of Mr Jean-Paul Agon as from 1 May 2021\n\nMr Jean-Paul Agon notified the company of the termination of his  employment contract on 30 April 2021, in order to benefit from his retirement rights as from 1 May 2021, at the end of a 42-year career in the Company.\n\nAll  provisions  relating  to  the  retirement  of  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon were approved by the Annual General Meeting on 27 April 2010.\n\n- \u00b7 Payment of a retirement indemnity stipulated by the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries\n\nA retirement indemnity, attached solely to the termination of the  employment  contract,  was  paid  to  Mr  Agon  over  the month of May 2021 in strict application of the public order rules of  French  Labour  law,  the  National  Collective  Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries ( Convention Collective Nationale  des  Industries  Chimiques ) and  the  collective agreements applicable to all L'Or\u00e9al's senior managers.\n\nThis  indemnity  was  based on the amount of remuneration at the  date  of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract  in  2006, after applying the revaluation coefficient in respect of salaries and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state pension  fund  ( Caisse  Nationale  d'Assurance  Vieillesse ).  As  of 1  January  2021,  this  revalued  remuneration  amounted  to \u20ac1,731,000  for  fixed  remuneration  and  \u20ac1,442,500  for  variable remuneration.\n\nThe retirement indemnity was a gross amount of \u20ac2.12 million, representing  eight  months  of  the  aforementioned  revalued remuneration.\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  non-compete  clause  is  not applicable  in  the  event  of  retirement:  no  non-compete indemnity will be paid to Mr Jean-Paul Agon.\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidation without payment of pension under the 'Garantie de  Retraite  des  Membres  du  Comit\u00e9  de  Conjoncture' (Pension Cover of Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) scheme\n\nThe  gross  amount  of  the  pension  that  would  be  paid  to Mr Jean-Paul Agon, under L'Or\u00e9al's 'Garantie de Retraite des Membres  du  Comit\u00e9  de  Conjoncture'  (Pension  Cover  of Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) scheme, represents \u20ac1.59  million, i.e. around  36%  of  the  fixed  and  variable remuneration he received as corporate officer.\n\nThe Board of Directors agreed to Mr Jean-Paul Agon's wish to waive this supplementary pension during his term of office as Chairman of the Board of Directors so as not to combine it with the  remuneration  of  \u20ac1,600,000  proposed  by  the  Board  of Directors  on  11  February  2021,  approved  by  the  Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 in the context of the vote on the 14th resolution.\n\nThe pensions that could have been paid for the period of his office  as  Chairman  will  be  definitively  lost  for  Mr  Jean-Paul Agon without any increase in pension or any other subsequent compensation.",

        "page_content": "## 2.4.3.7. Situation of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus\n\nThe Board of Directors at its meeting of 20 April 2021 appointed Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  the  then  Deputy  Chief  Executive Officer in charge of Divisions, and an employee of L'Or\u00e9al, as Chief  Executive  Officer  following  a  brilliant  career  spanning 34 years within L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe Board of Directors did not wish for Mr Nicolas Hieronimus, by  accepting  the  role  of  Chief  Executive  Officer,  to  be deprived (at the age of 57 and after 34 years with L'Or\u00e9al) of the benefits to which he would have continued to be entitled had he remained an employee. Therefore, the Board adopted the following measures, which were approved by the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021 as part of the procedure for related-party agreements:\n\n## 1) Maintenance of the employment contract and separation of the benefits attached to the corporate office and the employment contract\n\nThe reference remuneration of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus to be taken into account for all rights attached to the employment contract and,  in  particular,  for  the  calculation  of  the  pension  under  the defined-benefit  scheme  described  below,  is  based  on  his remuneration  at  the  date  of  suspension  of  his  employment contract.  This  reference  remuneration  is  \u20ac1,750,000  of  fixed remuneration  and  \u20ac1,850,000  of  variable  remuneration.  This remuneration will be revised annually by applying the revaluation coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund  (Caisse  Nationale d'Assurance Vieillesse). As at 1 January 2022, it was \u20ac1,769,250 for fixed remuneration and \u20ac1,870,350 for variable remuneration.\n\nThe seniority applied covers his entire career within the Group, including the years spent as an executive corporate officer.\n\n## 2) Dismissal, termination or retirement indemnities, financial consideration for the non-competition clause\n\nIn  the  event  of  termination  of  his  suspended  employment contract during the term of corporate office, and depending on the  reasons  for  such  termination,  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  would only be paid termination indemnities, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, or retirement indemnities in the event  of  voluntary  retirement  or  at  the  Company's  request pursuant to the suspended employment contract.\n\nThese  indemnities,  which  are  attached  solely  to  termination  of the employment contract and in strict application of the National Collective  Bargaining  Agreement  for  the  Chemical  Industries (Convention Collective Nationale des Industries Chimiques) and the company-level  agreements  applicable  to  all  L'Or\u00e9al managers, are automatically due pursuant to the public policy rules of French labour law. They are not subject to any condition other  than  those  provided  for  by  the  National  Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries or the abovementioned Company-level agreements. The same applies to the non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nPursuant  to  the  schedule  of  indemnities  under  the  National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the Chemical Industries, in the event of dismissal, except in the event of gross misconduct or gross negligence, the indemnity would be capped, in light of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus' length of service, at 20 months' remuneration under the suspended employment contract.\n\nIn  respect  of  the  employment  contract,  pursuant  to  the provisions of the National Collective Bargaining Agreement for the  Chemical  Industries,  in  the  event  of  termination  of  the employment  contract,  the  indemnity  due  in  consideration  of\n\nthe  non-compete  clause  would  be  payable  monthly  for  two years on  the  basis  of  two-thirds  of  the  monthly  fixed remuneration attached to the suspended employment contract  unless  Mr  Hieronimus  were  to  be  released  from application  of  the  clause.  This  clause  does  not  apply  in  the event of voluntary retirement or compulsory retirement on the Company's  initiative:  no  consideration  for  non-competition would be paid in such a situation.\n\n## 3) Defined benefit pension scheme\n\nMr Nicolas Hieronimus will continue to benefit, under his suspended employment  contract,  from  the  'Garantie  de  Ressources  des Retraites Anciens Cadres Dirigeants' (Retirement Income Guarantee  for  Former  Senior  Managers)  scheme  closed  to  new members  effective  from  31  December  2015.  The  income guarantee  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  number  of  years  of professional service in the Company up to 31 December 2019, up to a limit of 25 years. Generally, after 31 December 2019, no new rights will be granted under this scheme pursuant to French Order no. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 concerning supplementary professional retirement  schemes,  which  stipulated  the  closure  of  all  defined benefit schemes governed by Article L. 137-11 of the French Social Security Code.\n\nThe main features of this scheme are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 around  340  senior  managers  (active  or  retired)  are concerned;\n- \u00b7 the minimum length of service requirement was 10 years at the time of closure of the scheme on 31 December 2015;\n- \u00b7 the  income  guarantee  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the number  of  years  of  professional  service  in  the  Company until  31  December  2019,  capped  at  25  years,  each  year leading to a progressive and regular increase of 1.8% in the level  of  the  guarantee.  The  income  guarantee  may  not exceed 50% of the calculation base or exceed the average of the fixed portion of salaries; and\n- \u00b7 the  guarantee  is  financed  by  contributions  paid  to  an insurance  institution.  These  contributions  are  deductible from  corporate  income  tax  and  are  subject  to  the employer's contribution as provided by Article L. 137-11, 2a) of the French Social Security Code at a rate of 24%.\n\nThe pension rights of Mr Nicolas Hieronimus are no longer likely to change insofar as he has more than 25 years of service, the ceiling  above  which  no  additional  annuity  is  granted  under this scheme.\n\nFor  information  purposes,  the  gross  estimated  amount  of  the pension  that  would  be  paid  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus,  under L'Or\u00e9al's  'Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens Cadres Dirigeants' (Retirement Income Guarantee for Former Senior Managers) scheme, had he been able liquidate on 31 December 2021 his full-rate pension rights under French Social Security,  after  34  years  of  service  within  L'Or\u00e9al,  would represent \u20ac1.56 million.\n\nThis  information  is  given  as  an  indication  after  estimating  the main  pension  rights  accrued  by  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus  as  a result  of  his  professional  activities,  according  to  the  rules  for payment  of  such  pensions  in  force  at  31  December  2021, which may be subject to change.\n\nThe  amount  of  the  pension  paid  to  Mr  Nicolas  Hieronimus under L'Or\u00e9al's 'Garantie de Ressources Dirigeants' (income guarantee for senior managers) will only be calculated on the date when he applies for all his pensions.\n\nAs  a  reminder,  the  rights  to  the  defined  benefit  pension  are uncertain and conditional on the completion of the beneficiary's career in  the  Company. The funding of this  scheme by L'Or\u00e9al cannot be broken down individually by employee.\n\n2",

The special committee reported on the expert's work and submitted its recommendations to the Board.\n\nOn 7 December 2021, your Board of Directors, having familiarized itself with the conclusions of the independent expert's report and the  special  committee's  recommendations,  unanimously  authorized  the  conclusion,  between  your  Company  and  Nestl\u00e9,  of  a L'Or\u00e9al share buyback agreement. The directors concerned did not take part in either the deliberations or the vote (1) .\n\n## Terms and conditions\n\nThis agreement, concluded at the close of the Board of Directors' meeting of 7 December 2021, involved the buyback from Nestl\u00e9 of 22,260,000 L'Or\u00e9al shares representing 4% of its share capital and voting rights as of 30 November 2021. The unit price of each repurchased L'Or\u00e9al share was \u20ac400, representing a total price paid of \u20ac8,904,000,000.\n\nThe  share  buyback  transaction  was  performed  under  the  16th  resolution  voted  by  the  Combined  Annual  General  Meeting  of 20 April 2021, via an off-market block purchase, financed by L'Or\u00e9al's available cash in the amount of \u20ac4.5 billion and bank loans for the remainder.\n\nOn 15 December 2021, the repurchased shares were earmarked for cancellation. On 9 February 2022, your Board of Directors canceled,  with  effect  as  of  10  February  2022,  the  22,260,000  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  pursuant  to  the  Board  of  Directors'  decisions  of 7 December 2021.\n\n## Reasons justifying the agreement is in the Company's interest:\n\nYour Board of Directors considered that this transaction with Nestl\u00e9 represented a new strategic phase in boosting the stability of L'Or\u00e9al's shareholding structure, in the interest of your Company and all its shareholders, since it will help optimize your Company's balance  sheet  by  benefiting  from  excellent  financing  conditions  and  maintaining  substantial  financial  leeway  to  secure  the Group's future development. Furthermore, your Board of Directors deemed that the transaction will also have a full-year accretive impact of over 4% on L'Or\u00e9al net earnings per share.\n\n## Agreements previously approved by the Annual General Meeting\n\n## Previously approved agreements that remained in force during the year\n\nPursuant to Article R.225-30 of the French Commercial Code, we have been informed that the following agreement, previously approved by Annual General Meetings of prior years, has remained in force during the year.\n\n2",

They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the collective bargaining agreement or the  above-mentioned  company-level  agreements.  The  same  applies  to  the  non-compete  clause  and  the  related  financial consideration.\n- Jean-Paul Agon should also continue benefiting from the defined-benefit pension scheme currently applicable to the Group's senior managers, as described in chapter 2 of the management report.\n- \u00b7 Jean-Paul Agon will continue to be treated in the same way as a senior manager throughout the term of his corporate office, which allows him to benefit from the additional social protection schemes, including the defined-contribution pension scheme and  employee  benefit  and  healthcare  scheme  applicable  to  the  Company's  employees,  as  set  out  in  chapter  2  of  the management report.\n\n## Terms and conditions\n\nOn 30 April 2021, Jean-Paul Agon informed the Company of the termination of his employment contract as of such date in order to collect his pension as of 1 May 2021 following his 42 year career in the Company.\n\nPursuant to the agreement approved by the Annual General Meeting of 27 April 2010, the provisions relating to the retirement of Jean-Paul Agon were applied:\n\nPayment of a retirement benefit as provided by the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry\n\nA retirement benefit, attached solely to termination of the employment contract, was paid to Jean-Paul Agon in May 2021 in strict accordance with the public policy rules of French labor law, the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry  and  the  company-level  agreements  applicable  to  all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers.  This  benefit  was  determined  based  on  the remuneration  at  the  contract  suspension  date  in  2006  after  applying  the  revaluation  coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and pension contributions published by the French state pension fund (Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse).\n\nAs of 1 January 2021, this revalued remuneration comprised a fixed portion of \u20ac1,731,000 and a variable portion of \u20ac1,442,500. The gross retirement benefit totaled \u20ac2.12 million, i.e. 8 months of the aforementioned revalued remuneration.\n\nNo non-compete compensation was paid to Jean-Paul Agon as the non-compete clause was not applicable in the event of retirement.\n\n- \u00b7 Liquidation without payment of pension under the 'Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture' (Pension Cover for Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) scheme\n- The gross amount of the pension paid to Jean-Paul Agon, under L'Or\u00e9al's 'Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture'  scheme,  represents  \u20ac1.59  million,  i.e.  around  36%  of  the  target  fixed  and  variable  remuneration  he  received as corporate officer.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  agreed  to  Jean-Paul  Agon's  wish  to  waive  this  supplementary  pension  so  as  not  to  combine  it  with  the remuneration  of  \u20ac1,600,000  proposed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  11  February  2021  and  approved  by  the  Combined  Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\n## Agreements approved during the year\n\nWe  have  been  informed  that  the  following  agreement,  previously  approved  by  the  Combined  Annual  General  Meeting  of 20 April 2021, based on the Statutory Auditors' special report of 17 February 2021, remained in force during the year.\n\n## Agreement concerning the position of Nicolas Hieronimus whose employment contract was suspended upon his appointment as Chief Executive Officer on 1 May 2021\n\n## Nature and purpose\n\nOn  11  February  2021,  your  Board  of  Directors  authorized  an  agreement  to  suspend  the  employment  contract  between  your company and Nicolas  Hieronimus,  former  Deputy  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  employee  of  your  company,  who  became  the Company's Chief Executive Officer as of 1 May 2021, following the decision of the Board of Directors' meeting held at the close of the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021.\n\nThis agreement was entered into following the Board of Directors' meeting and became effective as of 1 May 2021.",

These indemnities, which are attached solely to termination of the employment contract  and  in  strict  application  of  the  French  collective  bargaining  agreement  for  the  chemicals  industry  (Convention collective  nationale  des  industries  chimiques)  and  the  company-level  agreements  applicable  to  all  L'Or\u00e9al  managers,  are automatically due pursuant to the public policy rules of French labor law. They are not subject to any condition other than those provided for by the collective bargaining agreement or the above-mentioned company-level agreements. The same applies to the non-compete clause and the related financial consideration.\n\nNicolas Hieronimus will continue to benefit, under his employment contract suspended for the term of his corporate office, from the  'Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres  Dirigeants'  (Retirement  Income  Guarantee  for  former  senior managers) scheme, closed to new entrants as from 31 December 2015. Indemnities are calculated according to the number of years of professional activity within the company as of 31 December 2019, up to a maximum of 25 years. In general, subsequent to  31  December  2019,  no  new  entitlement  is  granted  under  this  scheme  pursuant  to  Order  2019-697  of  3  July  2019  on supplementary pension schemes, which provides for the closure of all defined-benefit schemes governed by Article L.137-11 of the French Social Security Code (Code la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale). The main features of this scheme are described in Note 4.3.2.5 to the 2020 L'Or\u00e9al Universal Registration Document. In this specific case, Nicolas Hieronimus reached the limit of 25 years' professional activity  in  the  Group  provided  under  the  scheme  in  2012  and  therefore  has  not  benefited  from  any  new  entitlement  to supplementary annuities since such date.\n\nUnder his employment contract and in accordance with the French collective bargaining agreement for the chemicals industry, in the event of termination of the employment contract, the compensation under the non-compete clause would be payable monthly  over  two  years  based  on  two-thirds  of  the  monthly  fixed  remuneration  provided  for  in  the  suspended  employment contract, unless Nicolas Hieronimus was released from the application of this clause.  This clause is not applicable in the event of voluntary retirement or retirement at the Company's request and no non-compete compensation would be paid in this situation.\n\nUnder no circumstances shall the  remuneration  received  for  the  corporate  office  be  taken  into  consideration  in  calculating benefits likely to be payable under the above-mentioned employment contract.\n\n- \u00b7 Terms and conditions relating to the suspension of Nicolas Hieronimus' employment contract\n- \u00b7 The reference remuneration to be taken into account for all entitlements attached to the employment contract will be based on  the  amount  of  remuneration  at  the  date  of  suspension  of  the  employment  contract,  namely,  fixed  remuneration  of \u20ac1,750,000  and  variable  remuneration  of  \u20ac1,850,000.  This  reference  remuneration  will  be  revised  annually  by  applying  the revaluation  coefficient  in  respect  of  salaries  and  pension  contributions  published  by  the  French  state  pension  fund  (Caisse nationale d'assurance vieillesse). As of 1 January 2022 it comprised a fixed portion of \u20ac1,769,250 and a variable portion of \u20ac1,870,350.\n- \u00b7 The length of service applied will cover his entire career within the Group, including his years as corporate officer.\n- \u00b7 Nicolas Hieronimus will continue to be treated in the same way as a senior manager throughout the term of his corporate office, which allows him to benefit from the additional social protection schemes, including the defined-contribution pension scheme and employee benefit and healthcare schemes applicable to the Company's employees.

It includes the description of risk factors pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of 14 June 2017 ('Prospectus Directive III'),  as  well  as  the  associated  risk  management  policy.  These  risks  are presented in four categories: (i) business risks, (ii) industrial and environmental risks, (iii) legal and regulatory risks, (iv) financial and market risks. The main non-financial risks within the meaning of the Non-Financial Performance Statement, as defined by Articles L. 225-102-1 and L. 22-10-36 of the French Commercial Code, are described in Chapter 4 of this document (see section 4.2.). This Chapter also includes the Vigilance Plan drawn up pursuant to Article L. 225-102-4 of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## 3.1. DEFINITION AND OBJECTIVES OF INTERNAL CONTROL\n\n## 3.1.1. Reference work\n\nFor  the  preparation  and  drafting  of  this  Document  and  the definition  of  Internal  Control,  L'Or\u00e9al  used  the  Reference Framework  and  its  application  guide  initially  published  in January  2007,  and  updated  on  22  July  2010  by  the  Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers (AMF).\n\n## 3.1.2. Internal Control objectives\n\nAt  L'Or\u00e9al,  Internal  Control  is  a  system  that  applies  to  the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group') and aims at ensuring that:\n\n- \u00b7 economic and financial targets are achieved in compliance with the laws and regulations in force and the Group's Ethical Principles and standards;\n- \u00b7 the orientations set by General Management are followed;\n- \u00b7 the  Group's  assets  and  reputation  are  valued  and protected; and\n- \u00b7 the Group's financial and accounting information is reliable and provides true and fair statements.\n\nBy contributing to preventing and managing the risks to which the  Group  is  exposed,  the  purpose  of  the  Internal  Control system is to enable the Group's manufacturing and economic development  to  take  place  in  a  steady  and  sustainable manner in a control environment appropriate for the Group's businesses. There are however limits inherent in any system and process.  These  limits  result  from  a  number  of  factors,  in particular the uncertainties of the outside world or malfunctions  that  may  occur  due  to  technical  or  human failures.\n\nThe  handling  of  a  risk  relies  in  particular  on  a  reasonable informed choice between the challenges to be controlled, the opportunities to be  seized  and  the  cost  of  the  risk management  measures,  taking  into  account  the  effects  of these measures on the occurrence and impact of the risk.\n\n## 3.1.3. Continuous improvement of the Internal Control system\n\nWithin a continuous improvement  process,  the  Group continued its efforts to improve the system of Internal Control in 2021 by taking the following actions:\n\n- \u25cf review of the Group matrix for segregation of duties and the associated control environment;\n- \u00b7 new  operational  guides  made  available  to  remind  the Group's principles and enable the sharing of best practices (e.g. philanthropy policy);\n- \u00b7 establishment  of  the  'Fundamentals  of  Internal  Control' digital  library,  with  new  areas  covered  (prevention  of corruption, vigilance points on competition);\n- \u00b7 regular  update  of  existing  reference  frameworks  to  be adapted to new challenges;\n- \u00b7 updated version of the Group's digital referential (see  section  'Communication  of  information  inside  the Group' in section 3.2.1. 'Organisation and environment' of this document); and\n- \u00b7 revamping of the programme to raise awareness of the risks of fraud.\n\nThe  deployment  of  online  training  (prevention  of  corruption, data  security,  competition,  cyber  security,  personal  data protection) is ongoing.\n\nThe  network  of  Internal  Control  managers  continued  to  be built up worldwide through:\n\n- \u00b7 specific training courses;\n- \u00b7 informative  webchats  for  sharing  updates  on  Group projects and business standards; and\n- \u00b7 a special-purpose communication platform that encourages and facilitates the sharing of best practices.",

COMPONENTS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM\n\n## 3.2.1. Organisation and environment\n\nThe control environment, which is critical to the Internal Control system,  good  risk  management  and  the  application  of procedures,  is  based  on  behaviour,  the  organisational structure and employees. At L'Or\u00e9al, it forms part of a culture of rigour and commitment  communicated  by  senior management  and  is  also  in  line  with  the  Group's  strategic choices.\n\n## The Group's Ethical Principles\n\n## Ethical Principles\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has built up its business on the basis of strong ethical principles  that  guide  its  development  and  contribute  to establishing  its  reputation:  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and Transparency. The Group's policies on sustainable development,  social  and  societal  responsibility,  compliance and philanthropy are based on the Ethical Principles.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Code  of  Ethics  is  available  in  45  languages  and  in Braille  in  English  and  French.  It  is  distributed  to  all  employees around  the  world.  It  enables  employees  to  understand  how these Ethical Principles need to be reflected in their behaviour and  actions  by  providing  simple  rules  and  a  description  of concrete  situations  they  may  encounter.  The  Code  of  Ethics applies to all employees, directors and corporate officers and members of the Executive and Management Committees of the  Group  and  its  subsidiaries  worldwide.  Since  2010,  16 supplements  to  the  Code  of  Ethics  have  covered  certain aspects of the Code in more detail.\n\n## The Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer\n\nThe Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer reports directly to  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  keeps  him  informed  on  a regular basis.\n\nHis mission on Ethics is to:\n\n- \u00b7 ensure  the  promotion  and  integration  of  best  practices within  the  Group,  providing  guidance  in  ethical  decisionmaking;\n- \u00b7 oversee employee training;\n- \u00b7 oversee  the  management  of  complaints  and  directly manage  those  related  to  senior  management  positions; and\n- \u00b7 measure and assess the Company's ethical performance.\n\nThe Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer regularly informs the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee.\n\nHe  has  a  dedicated  budget  and  team,  unrestricted  and  on first demand  access  to  all  information  and  documents concerning the Group's business activities and can call upon all  the  Group's  teams  and  resources  to  carry  out  his/her mission.\n\n## Implementation of L'Or\u00e9al's Ethics and Human Rights approach\n\nCountry  Managers  (or  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report) are responsible for ensuring compliance with the Code of Ethics. The  Chief  Ethics, Risk and  Compliance  Officer systematically  meets  each  new  Country  Manager  and  the Group's  senior  managers  to  provide  guidance  about  their  role. Senior  managers  also  benefit  from  a  tool  to  help  develop  their ethics leadership as well as specific training.\n\nThe role of the 77 Ethics Correspondents throughout the world is  to assist members of the Executive Committee and Country Managers  in  implementing  the  Ethics  programme  and  to provide  all  employees  with  a  local  point  of  contact,  whilst promoting  the  normal  routes  for  handling  concerns  by management and Human Resources. The Ethics Correspondents  benefit  every  year  from  a  specific  support and training programme.\n\n3",

'General framework of risk analysis' of this document).  A  practical  tool  has  been  created  to  enable Country Managers to assess and analyse possible local ethical risks  and  to  take  the  necessary  prevention  measures.  An annual reporting system is used to monitor the implementation of  the  Ethics  and  Human  Rights  programme.  The  subsidiaries are informed of their potential areas for improvement by the Department  of  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance.  Ethics  risks  are systematically  reviewed  during  audit  assignments,  through individual interviews. These interviews are conducted separately with the Country Manager and the Administrative and Financial Director.\n\nFor  prospective  acquisitions,  the  responses  to  the  Ethics  and Human  Rights  questionnaire  submitted  to  target  companies serve to identify whether such companies take account of the risks related to business ethics, among others.\n\nA  specific  and  compulsory  e-learning  course  on  ethics  is available  in  all  subsidiaries.  As  of  31  December  2021,  76%  of employees with access to the online module had completed this course. The Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department also provides face-to-face training as part of the ongoing training of managers  and  certain  business functions (Country Managers, Buyers, Human Resources).\n\nCompliance  with  the  Ethical  Principles  is  integrated  in  the annual  appraisal  system  for  all  employees  through  three ethical  competences:  'Takes  initiatives  with  courage  and transparency', 'Achieves results with integrity' and 'Acts with integrity and respects others'.\n\nRegular  communication  with  stakeholders  and  establishment of  internal  working  groups  facilitate  the  inclusion  of  Ethics  in the Group's new policies and strategic decisions (for example, the Ethical and Responsible Sponsorship Policy in 2021).\n\nRegular  audits  of  the  Group's  sites  and  those  of  its  suppliers and  subcontractors,  the  Group's  secure  whistleblowing  line (www.lorealspeakup.com) accessible to all Group stakeholders,  as  well  as  a  procedure  to  collect  and  process reports to manage any violations.\n\nIn  2021,  379  possible  ethical  violations  were  identified  either  via the  secure  website,  the  Ethics  Correspondents,  or  local  or international  management.  The  cases  reported  are  thoroughly examined  and  appropriate  measures  are  taken,  where applicable. Employees are regularly informed of the number of reports  discrimination,  sexual  and  other  types  of  harassment  at Group  level  worldwide,  the  number  of  fully  or  partially substantiated cases and the corrective measures taken.\n\n## Ethics Day : an annual day on ethics\n\nEthics  Day has  been  held  since  2009:  a  live  stream  with  the Chief Executive Officer enables all of the Group's employees to  ask  questions  and  discuss  the  day-to-day  application  of L'Or\u00e9al's  Ethical  Principles.  Each  member  of  the  Executive Committee and each Country Manager also organises local ethics  discussions.  In  2021,  close  to  40,000  connections  were made across all sessions. Employees were heavily involved in this dialogue on Ethics, asking more than 8,000 questions.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  Ethics  Day,  employees  receive  regular information about the Group's Ethical policy and have access to a dedicated Intranet site.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility\n\nFor many years, L'Or\u00e9al has begun a profound transformation of  its  model,  in  all  areas,  in  order  to  adapt  to  the  great changes  in  the  world.  In  the  firm  belief  that  sustainable development  is  an  essential  factor  for  success  and  durability, L'Or\u00e9al  is  deploying  an  ambitious  corporate  social  responsibility policy,  which  is  shared  by  its  management  and  teams  (see section 4.3.  'Policies,  performance indicators and results' of this document).\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the  second  generation  of  its commitments to sustainable development, under the umbrella of a programme called L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, with a new set of particularly ambitious targets for 2030, in order to cover all the  impacts  associated  with  the  Group's  value  chain:  its production and distribution sites as well as its supply chains and the impacts  associated  with  the  use  of  products  by consumers. L'Or\u00e9al for the Future thus marks a new ambition for  the  sustainable development of L'Or\u00e9al with the intention to capitalise on previous achievements: the commitment from 2009  to  reduce  the  environmental  footprint  of  factories  and distribution  centres  by  50%  compared  to  2005,  then  the Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme  launched  in  2013  with sustainable  production,  sustainable  innovation,  sustainable consumption  and  shared  growth  targets  for  2020,  which  has made  sustainable  development  one  of  the  Group's  key strategic pillars.\n\nIn  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  undertook  to  define  Science-Based Targets (SBT) to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain over the long term, in accordance with the Paris Climate Change Agreements. In December 2017, the SBT initiative validated the Group's proposal: L'Or\u00e9al is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions on its Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by  25%  in  absolute  value  by  2030,  compared  with  the  2016 baseline.\n\nThe  sustainable  development  Coordinators  worldwide  are tasked  with  helping  the  Country  Managers/Area  Managers/ Division  Managers/Brand  Managers  in  the  implementation  of the  programme  within  their  entity.  The  progress  in  local implementation of the Group's commitments is monitored by means of an annual reporting system.\n\nThe  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  risks,  and  the  progress  of the policies put in place to deal with these risks, are reviewed regularly as part of the Internal Audit process and reported to the Audit Committee.",

        "page_content": "Components of the Internal Control and Risk Management system\n\nSince  2019,  in  collaboration  with  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance Department, L'Or\u00e9al's Corporate Social Responsibility Department has conducted a deeper assessment  of  the  risks  related  to  climate  change  on  the Group's  operations,  using  in  particular  the  scenario  analysis method,  in  order  to  improve  its  ability  to  anticipate  and mitigate the impact of these risks.\n\nIt should be noted that the financial risks related to the effects of climate change and the measures taken by the Group to reduce them  are  described  in  Chapter  4  'L'Or\u00e9al's  Social, Environmental and Societal Responsibility'.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer is L'Or\u00e9al's representative for the United Nations Global Compact and the NGOs linked to its activity.\n\n## Human Resources policy\n\nThe quality and skills of male and female employees are key components of the Internal Control system.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's Human Resources (HR) Department has always had the mission of supporting the Group's growth and supporting its transformation  initiatives.  In  order  to  be  sustainable, L'Or\u00e9al's  growth  relies  first  and  foremost  on  the  men  and women  in  the  Company,  who  are  the  key  drivers  of  the Group's  success.  Built  on  this  conviction,  the  Group's  human and social project is based on highly individualised management of employees and on collective strength.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  HR  policy  focuses  on  the  identification,  recruitment and development of employees throughout their career, and on  the  rewarding  and  commitment  of  all,  as  well  as  on  an active policy on diversity and inclusion. Dedicated policies are developed  within  the  Group  in  each  of  these  areas  (see section 4.3.2. 'Human Resources policy' of this document).\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe  information  systems,  chosen  in  accordance  with  the strategic orientations given by the Group's  Global  IT Department,  integrate,  in  particular,  implementation  of  a single  'ERP'  (Enterprise  Resource  Planning)  management software application used by the vast majority of commercial subsidiaries,  and  which  issues  instructions  regarding  systems security.  The  worldwide  roll-out  of  this  integrated  software package also contributes  to  strengthening  the  reliability  and security  of  the  process  of  producing  information,  notably accounting  and  financial  information.  In  pursuit  of  the  same objective,  the  deployment  of  an  integrated  production  and management solution in the Group's manufacturing entities is continuing.\n\n## The procedures and standards governing the activities\n\nEach  Support  Department  is  responsible,  in  its  own  specific field, for defining the principles and standards applicable to all the entities. In order to make it easier for employees to make these principles and standards their own, the key principles are summarised in the 'Fundamentals of Internal Control', which are regularly updated under the responsibility of the Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department.\n\nThis guide  is a reference  framework  for  the  Group's operational  activities,  and  is  presented  in  the  form  of  an\n\ninformation sheet for each area. Each information sheet refers to  the  detailed  charters,  codes  and  standards  of  the  Group. The sheets are regularly updated, expanded and validated by the Support Departments.\n\nA  management  segregation  of  duties  standard  is  regularly updated and distributed to all entities. It defines the main rules to  be  observed  in  the  fields  of  sales,  purchasing,  logistics, finance, human resources and information systems management. The application of these rules is aimed at better preventing of the risks of fraud and reducing the probability that errors (whether intentional or not) may remain undetected.\n\n## Communication of information inside the Group\n\nThe 'Fundamentals of Internal Control' guide is circulated to the  Managing  Directors,  Finance  Directors,  and  Internal Control managers  of  all  the  consolidated  subsidiaries, including manufacturing entities. Furthermore, the Fundamentals,  codes,  charters  and  standards,  together  with the  information  related  to  the  organisation,  changes  and instructions from the Support Departments are made permanently  available  to  the  subsidiaries  on  the  Group's Intranet sites.\n\nA Group digital standard provides all employees with guides, charters  and  expert  contacts  organised  by  function  and  by subject.\n\nMeetings  are  regularly  organised  aimed  at  passing  on information about orientations of the General Management to managers  of  the  subsidiaries.  The  Support  Departments  also coordinate  their  networks  of  experts  through  seminars  and training sessions. News  published  on  the  Intranet  gives employees  news  updates  and  meaningful  messages  on Internal Control.\n\nLastly, communication within the Group on the main priorities of  Internal  Control  is  promoted  by  the  'Internal  Control Awards',  which  every  two  years  reward  the  best  global initiatives,  and  through  the  Internal  Control  Department's intranet, which makes it possible to communicate all over the world on Internal Control initiatives, tools and events.\n\n## 3.2.2. Control and supervision activities: those involved and their roles\n\nRisk  management  and  Internal  Control  is  the  business  of everyone, from governance bodies to all employees.\n\nThis  system  is  the  subject  of  ongoing  supervision  in  order  to verify  its  relevance  and  meets  the  Group's  objectives  and addresses its issues.\n\nThe  main  players  involved  in  monitoring  Internal  Control  and risk management are:\n\n- \u00b7 the General Management and its Management Committee (Executive Committee);\n- \u00b7 the  Board  of  Directors  and  the  Audit  Committee  in particular;\n- \u00b7 the  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Department,  the  Internal Control Department and the Internal Audit Department;\n- \u00b7 the Support Departments; and\n- \u00b7 the Operational Divisions and Geographic Zones.\n\n3",

In the context of their global Internal Control responsibilities, the members  of  the  Executive Committee  rely  on  operational  and  functional  managers, according  to  their  respective  areas  of  expertise.  These managers  must  ensure  implementation  of  these  general principles  and  the  correct  functioning  of  the  procedures enabling  the  level  of  Internal  Control  required  by  General Management to be attained.\n\n## The Board of Directors and Audit Committee\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  always  asserted  the  importance that  it  attributes,  together  with  General  Management,  to Internal  Control  and  to  its  main  areas  of  application.  The activities of the Board of Directors are reported in section 2.3.2 'Activities of the Board of Directors' of this document, and the duties entrusted to its Chairman in section 2.1.3.2. 'Relationships between the Board and General Management' of this document.\n\nSince its creation, the Audit Committee has been responsible for  monitoring  actions  undertaken  in  the  area  of  Internal Control  and  it  reports  thereon  to  the  Board  of  Directors.  Its remits  are  defined  in  the  Internal  Rules  of  the  Board  of Directors.\n\nEach  year,  the  Committee  performs  a  review  of  the  Internal Audit  plan,  its  objectives  and  the  general  conclusions  of Internal Audit assignments. Major Internal Control projects and initiatives  are  also  presented  to  it.  The  Committee  then prepares  a  report  with  its  own  remarks  for  the  Board  of Directors.\n\n## The Operational Divisions and Geographic Zones\n\nThe Group  is organised into worldwide  Divisions and geographical  zones  which  are  fully  responsible,  with  the management  of  each  country,  business  or  manufacturing entity,  for  the  achievement  of  the  objectives  for  Internal Control defined by General Management.\n\nWorldwide  responsibilities  for  Internal  Control  of  the  activities within the scope of their responsibilities are entrusted to each of  the  members  of  the  Executive  Committee.  A  system  of delegating  authorities  is  in  place  and  continues  to  be reinforced.  The  powers  of  the  legal  representatives  of  Group companies and of those to whom they delegate are limited and controlled in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Charter.\n\nSpecialists in management,  information  systems,  Human Resources,  digital,  retail,  purchasing,  logistics  and  production provide support to operational employees at all levels of the organisation and contribute in this way to the achievement of the Internal Control objectives.\n\n## The Support Departments\n\nWorldwide  responsibilities  for  Internal  Control  of  the  activities within the scope of their responsibilities are entrusted to each of the members of the Executive Committee.\n\nThe  Support  Departments  define,  in  their  own  areas,  the strategies, policies and procedures which they communicate to  the  countries  and  entities.  Through  their  network  of specialists or by regular audits, they bring their expertise to the operational divisions and review the correct operation of their respective areas of responsibility.\n\nThe main Departments concerned are:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Research,  Innovation  and  Technology  Department, which is particularly responsible for cosmeto-vigilance and the  quality  of  the  formulas  used  in  the  composition  of  the products  (see  'Product  quality  and  safety:  a  priority'  in section 4.3.1.3.2. of this document);\n- \u00b7 the Purchasing Department with suppliers and their working conditions;\n- \u00b7 the  Environment,  Health  &  Safety  Department,  for  checks related to site safety, employee health and environmental compliance;\n- \u00b7 the Quality Department to measure performance and the progress made by manufacturing entities with regard to the quality of production;\n- \u00b7 the  Global  IT  Department,  primarily  to  assess  compliance with the Cyber Security Policy;\n- \u00b7 the Administration and Finance Department;\n- \u00b7 the  Human  Resources  Department,  which  monitors  and supervises all obligations related to personnel management, specifies the documents to be provided to employees,  the  remuneration  of  the  workforce  and personnel expenses, the recruitment, training and evaluation  procedures,  the  rules  to  be  followed  in  payroll management and the implementation of the Share & Care programme;\n- \u00b7 the  Engagement  and  Public  Affairs  Department,  which coordinates  communications  operations,  establishes  crisis management principles and ensures that they are applied (see section 3.5.3.1. 'Crisis Management' of this document);\n- \u00b7 the Digital and Marketing Department, the mission of which is to  secure  the  digital  transformation  of  the  Group (e-commerce, consumer relations, influencers, digital media, etc.) by defining the policies, tools,  and  processes and ensuring that they are deployed; and\n- \u00b7 the Security Department, which has defined a security and safety  policy  for  people,  travel,  property,  information  and data confidentiality (see section 3.5.3.1. 'Safety of people and property' of this document).\n\nIndicators and reporting procedures enable regular monitoring of the local activities of most of these Support Departments.",

In order to do  so,  it  sets  the  operating  rules  that  apply  to  all  entities, defines  and  deploys  tools,  procedures  and  best  practices, particularly  in  the  following  areas:  management,  accounting and  consolidation,  investments  (via  the  BOLD  corporate venture  fund)  and  holdings,  financing  and  cash,  taxes,  legal issues  and  data  governance  (including  the  protection  of personal  data),  financial  communication,  strategic  planning, and insurance.\n\nAn  Internal  Control  Committee  has  the  task  of  taking  all measures  to  promote  the  proper  understanding  and  the proper  application  of  the  Group's  Internal  Control  rules  and also to monitor progress on important Internal Control projects. It is composed of the Chief Financial Officer, and the Directors of  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance,  Internal  Control,  Operational Finance, Internal Audit and Information Systems (Global IT).\n\n## Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department\n\nThe objective of this department is primarily to coordinate the processes designed to identify, assess and prioritise risks with all those concerned, and keep the Group's risk mapping analysis up-to-date.  Its  aim  is  to  promote  optimal  use  of  resources  to minimise  and  control  the  impact  of  negative  events  and maximise the performance of opportunities.\n\nThe Chief Ethics, Risk & Compliance Officer reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## The Internal Control Department\n\nThis Department, which is separate from Internal Audit, is under the responsibility of the Ethics, Risk and  Compliance Department.\n\nIt works with the experts in each of the Group's business lines to define  and  regularly  update  the  internal  control  framework relating to their area of activity. This internal control framework is summarised  in  the  'Fundamentals  of  Internal  Control' reference document  and  detailed in standards and procedures that are listed in the Group's 'digital referential'.\n\nIt  also  manages  and  develops  a  network  of  around  150 regional  and  local  internal  control  managers  covering  all Group  entities,  whose  mission  is  to  apply  the  internal  control framework  and  support  employees  in  ensuring  compliance with this framework.\n\nFrequent  participation  in  seminars,  training  cycles,  webinars with business lines and  the publication of notes of engagement  help  to  strengthen  knowledge  of  the  internal control framework within the organisation.\n\nWithin  a  continuous  improvement  process,  the  Internal  Control Department develops, disseminates and coordinates self-evaluation campaigns  focusing  on  the  main  risks  and  issues  identified, gradually  being  rolled  out  in  each  of  the  business  lines.  The  selfevaluation  of  Internal  Control  makes  it  possible  for  the  Group's entities to ensure the due and proper functioning of the system and to reinforce it with operational actions.\n\nThe  Internal  Control  Committee  is  driven  by  the  Internal Control  Department,  which  validates  directions  and  priorities with  regard  to  improving  the  internal  control  framework, developing the network of internal control managers and the tools used to perform internal control tasks.\n\nIn  addition,  this  Department  monitors  changes  related  to Internal Control relating to expectations and market practices.\n\nIn  addition  to  its  role  of  monitoring  the  application  of  the Internal Control system, the Internal Audit Department carries out  cross-functional  analyses  with  regard  to  possible  Internal Control  weaknesses  based  on  findings  noted  during  its assignments. These analyses make it possible to direct the work of  the  Internal  Control  Committee  and  to  identify  the  priority areas for improvement and strengthening of procedures.\n\nInternal  Audit  is  carried  out  by  a  central  team  that  reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. This department carries out  regular  assignments  to  audit  major  processes  and  check on the application of Group principles and standards.\n\nInternal  Audit  assignments  are  submitted  to  the  General Management and the Audit Committee for their approval and give  rise,  with  their  agreement,  to  the  preparation  of  an annual  audit  plan.  The  Group's  risk  mapping,  the  entities' contribution  to  the  Group's  key  economic  indicators,  their historical  precedence  and  the  results  of  previous  audits  are factors that are taken into account when defining remits. The risk level assessment carried out by the area departments and experts  in  the  different  business  lines  is  also  a  determining factor in the elaboration of the annual audit plan. Finally, the remarks made by the external auditors as part of their annual audit  are  also  taken  into  consideration  by  the  Internal  Audit Department when defining its assignments.\n\nIn 2021,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  carried  out  50 assignments,  19  of  which  involved  commercial  entities,  9  of which  were  factory  reviews,  3  of  which  were  carried  out  on International Marketing Departments and 12 of which were on targeted processes at Group, Zone or Country level. Of these, 6  were  specifically  dedicated  to  digital  and  e-commerce activities.  On  the  other  hand,  2  specific  assignments  were devoted  to  certain  objectives  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme, 2 were dedicated to project management and three  were  carried  out  on  topics  relating  to  information systems and cyber security.\n\nAudits  systematically  result  in  a  report  that  describes  the findings and corresponding risks, and provides an action plan covering  all  recommendations  to  be  implemented  by  the audited entity. These action plans are followed up regularly by the Internal Audit Department which measures, and communicates  to  the  relevant  departments,  the  rate  of progress made in acting on the recommendations.\n\nThe  Internal  Audit  Department  uses  the  Group's  integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software and has developed  a  number  of  specific  transactions  that  help  it better  identify  potential  weaknesses  in  the  most  sensitive processes.  The  latter  were  enhanced  with  Data  analytics capacities  that  are  strengthened  every  year  with  new standard analyses developed by Internal Audit and by the use of  dashboards  and  analysis  tools  that  the  businesses  are continually  developing  for  their  own  management  needs. Finally, the Internal Audit Department has a Governance, Risk, Compliance (GRC) tool, which enables it to carry out its tasks using  an  integrated  tool  and  to  consolidate  in  real-time  the progress made in the action plans of the audited entities. This tool  is  shared  with  the  Internal  Control  function  and  thus represents  an  integrated  collaborative  platform  for  the implementation of action plans.\n\nThe achievement of the audit plan, the results of assignments and the progress of the action plans are presented to General Management  on  a  regular  basis  and  shared  with  the  Audit Committee and the Group's Statutory Auditors each year.\n\n3",

It also supports the digital transformation of  the  Group  by  developing  the  use  of  Cloud  services (SaaS, Iaas, PaaS) and connected objects.\n\nWithin the Department,  the  Information  Systems  Security Department  is  responsible  for  the  Information  Systems  Security Policy. Based on the international ISO 27001 standard, this policy covers the main topics of Information Systems security, including the  protection  of  personal  data,  and  describes  the  general principles  to  be  applied  for  each  of  them.  It  enables  all  the Group's  Information  Systems  teams,  and  by  extension,  all employees, to share clear objectives, best practices and levels of control  adapted  to  the  risks  incurred,  notably,  the  risk  of  cyber attack.  This  policy  is  accompanied  by  an  information  systems security audit programme conducted by an outside firm. It is also supplemented by an Information and Communication Technologies Code of Practice, and a Code of Good Practice for the use of Social Media.\n\n## The Operations Department\n\nThis  division  comprises  the  Innovation,  Product  Packaging  and Development, Quality, EHS (Environment, Health, Safety), Production management and operational excellence, Purchasing, Supply Chain, Information Systems (production) and industrial  strategy departments. It defines the overall Operations strategy  worldwide  and  defines  the  standards  and  methods applicable in the areas of quality, safety and the environment for deployment  in  all  the  countries  in  which  the  Group  operates. It manages the Group's comprehensive strategy to enable the teams in  the  Operational  Divisions  and  regions  to  implement innovation,  manufacturing  and  logistics  policies  suited  to  the markets.\n\nIn line with the Group's Code of Ethics, since 2011, buyers have access  to  a  practical  and  ethical  'The  Way  We  Buy'  guide which aims at helping all employees in their relationships with the Group's suppliers. Buyers also have the Group's The Way We Compete and The Way We Prevent Corruption guides for which e-learning is provided.\n\nThe  standard  for  managing  suppliers  and  tender  procedures specify  the  conditions  for  competitive  tendering  and  for  the registration  of  the  main  suppliers.  The  general  terms  of purchase  form  the  framework  for  transactions  with  the suppliers. The 'Purchase Commitments and Order Management'  standard is aimed at facilitating and strengthening  control  of  the  spending  and  investments  of Group entities.\n\nIn the area of the supply chain, the main assignments consist of defining  and  applying  the  sales  planning,  customer demand management, development and control of customer service  processes,  including  through  the  management  of physical  order  fulfilment,  application  of  the  general  terms  of sale,  follow-up  of  orders,  management  of  customer  returns and  customer  disputes  as  well  as  accounts  receivable collection  procedures.  Measures  are  also  recommended  for the  management  of  distribution  centres  and  inventories, subcontracting, product traceability, business continuity plans and transportation.",

        "page_content": "## 3.3. SYSTEMS RELATING TO THE PREPARATION AND PROCESSING OF FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION\n\nFor the preparation of this section, L'Or\u00e9al based its work on the 'Application  Guide  for  Internal  Control  of  accounting  and financial  information  published by issuers', from the Reference Framework published by the French Financial Markets Authority -  AMF  on  22  July  2010.  This  approach  is  part  of  an  overall process aimed at making continual progress and improving the Internal Control system that is already in place.\n\n## 3.3.1. Definition, scope and objectives\n\nInternal  Control  for  accounting  and  finance  covers  the processes  that  provide  accounting  data:  the  process  of producing financial information, the accounts closing process and financial communication actions.\n\nThe  accounting  and  financial  Internal  Control  process  is designed to ensure:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance  with  accounting  regulations  and  the  correct application  of  the  principles  on  which  the  financial statements are based;\n- \u00b7 application of the guidelines set by the General Management for financial information;\n- \u00b7 protection of assets;\n- \u00b7 quality of the reporting that contributes to the preparation of published financial statements and the reliability of their centralised processes for the Group for their distribution and use for monitoring purposes; and\n- \u00b7 control  of  the  production  of  financial,  accounting  and management information including fraud prevention.\n\nThe  scope  of  application  of  the  Internal  Control  procedures relating  to  the  preparation  and  processing  of  financial  and accounting  information  encompasses  the  parent  company and  all  subsidiaries  included  in  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\n## 3.3.2. Monitoring process for the organisation of accounting and finance functions\n\n## Organisation of the Finance Departments\n\nDedicated teams of specialists ensure the implementation of accounting and financial monitoring, under the supervision of General  Management,  in  the  following  areas:  accounting, consolidation,  tax  matters,  management,  financial  services and treasury.\n\nIn the Administration and Finance Department, the Operational  Finance  Department  prepares  the  Group's consolidated  financial  results:  the  latter  coordinates  the Business Service Centre and a global network of management controllers  who  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with the  Group's  accounting  and  management  standards  to ensure  appropriate  management  of  the  result.  Worldwide accounting management is executed by a team of specialists that  ensure  the  application  of  IFRS  and  the  implementation and harmonisation of the Group's accounting processes in the accounting  Business  Service  Centre  and  in  the  countries. Finally, the Operational Finance Department runs the Group's Tax Department which comprises a network of tax lawyers at corporate  level,  in  the  regions  and  in  the  Group's  most\n\nvulnerable countries, monitors changes in regulations, ensures compliance with local rules, and oversees the implementation of the  Group's  tax  policy,  and  in  particular  the  strict application of the transfer pricing policy and customs rules.\n\nIn the Administration and Finance Department, the Corporate Finance  Department  ensures  the  protection  of  the  Group's financial  assets.  The  Treasury  and  Financing  Department centralises  cash  flows  and  the  hedging  of  currency  and interest rate risks. The department leads a network of treasurers in  the  Zones  and  countries,  and  implements  the  Group's financing policy. The Financial Structure Department undertakes  external  growth  transactions  and  monitors  the financial  structures  of  L'Or\u00e9al  (S.A.)  and  its  subsidiaries.  The Business Opportunities for L'Or\u00e9al Development  (BOLD) corporate  venture  fund,  which  makes  minority  investments in  innovative  products  and  companies,  is  also  managed by the Corporate Finance Department.\n\n## Group standards\n\nThe Group has put in place a set of accounting policies and standards  consistent  with  IFRS,  the  consolidated  accounting standards.\n\nThe  application  of  these  standards  is  compulsory  for  all consolidated  subsidiaries  in  order  to  provide  uniform  and reliable financial information.\n\nThe  Operational  Finance  Department  oversees  the  regular update  of  these  Group  standards,  taking  into  account  the changes in regulations and accounting principles:\n\n- \u00b7 they define the principles required for harmonised accounting  treatment  of  transactions.  They  specify  in particular  the  methods  of  recording  balance  sheet  items and  of  identification  and  valuation  of  off-balance  sheet commitments. The Group's Accounting Department monitors, on an ongoing basis, new accounting standards currently  under  preparation,  in  order  to  alert  the  General Management and anticipate their  effects  on  the  Group's financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 the chart of accounts, common to all subsidiaries, and the key  accounting  processes  provide  the  definitions  and methodology  for  preparing  the  reporting  necessary  to establish the financial statements.\n\nThe management standards describe how the rules should be applied operationally. They give the valuation rules for some of the key balance sheet and income statement accounts and also  stipulate  the  controls  and  checks  applicable  to  the key processes.\n\nThe management standards are regularly supplemented and are  thus  part  of  the  continuous  improvement  process.  The purpose of this work is both to take action in response to the findings  of  the  Internal  Audit  Department  and  to  cover  the areas  corresponding  to  the  accounting  and  financial  risks  of subsidiaries.  This  work  has  made  it  possible  to  bring  our approach more closely in line with the recommendations set out in the 'Application  Guide  for  Internal  Control  of accounting and financial information' of the French Financial Markets Authority - AMF Reference Framework.\n\n3",

Tools  have  been  made available to enable them to ensure that access rights comply with the Group's rules.\n\n## Management tools\n\nThe  system  for  monthly  reporting  of  the  various  economic indicators  enables  continuous,  homogenous  monitoring  of changes in the performance of each subsidiary and ensures they are in line with the objectives set.\n\nThe  reporting  and  consolidation  system,  used  by  all  entities, ensures the consistency and reliability of figures at the level of each subsidiary through blocking controls that operate before the financial data is uploaded to Group level. In this regard, the operating  profit  and  loss  account  by  destination,  which  is common  to  both  management  and  general  accounting, contributes  to  strengthening  the  control  of  accounts  in  the financial  statements  through  the  use  of  a  single  reference framework.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group's  organisation,  which  is  based  on reporting from each subsidiary that is provided directly by the countries  to  the  parent  company,  without  any  intermediate aggregates for the vast majority of the subsidiaries, optimises data  transfer  and  the  completeness  of  information  and,  in particular, verification of data accuracy.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of each subsidiary  make  a  joint  commitment  with  regard  to  the quality,  reliability  and  completeness  of  the  accounting  and financial  information  they  have  prepared  and  sent  to  the Group's Operational Finance Department, through a representation letter that they jointly sign.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe  role  and  tasks  of  the  Audit  Committee  are  described above.  These  tasks  are  in  compliance  with  European regulations  and,  in  particular,  Directive  2014/56/EU  and EU regulation 537/2014 on statutory audits, and are based on the  report  by  the  working  group  on  the  Audit  Committee published by the AMF on 22 July 2010.\n\n## 3.3.3. Processes used to prepare accounting and financial information\n\n## Operational processes contributing to accounting figures\n\nAll  of  the  processes  that  contribute  to  accounting  figures, particularly  sales  and  purchases,  and  inventory,  fixed  asset, payroll  and  treasury  management  are  covered  by  specific procedures,  follow-up checks  and  rules  for  validation, authorisation and booking operations.\n\n## Closing of accounts, consolidation and management reporting information\n\nThe accounts closing process is governed by precise instructions and  is  based  on  a  detailed  time  schedule  circulated  to  all subsidiaries to make sure that deadlines are met and financial statements are prepared in a consistent manner. In this regard, the Group has introduced two hard closings (anticipating the work  involved  in  the  closure  of  financial  statements)  in  May and  November  which  make  it  possible  to  better  anticipate and  speed  up  closing  times.  For  the  preparation  of consolidated financial statements, validation procedures apply at  each  stage  of  the  process  of  reporting  and  processing information. Their purpose is to verify in particular that:\n\n- \u00b7 inter-company  transactions  are  correctly  adjusted  and eliminated (these are reported on a monthly basis);\n- \u00b7 consolidation transactions are checked;\n- \u00b7 accounting standards are correctly applied; and\n- \u00b7 the consolidated published accounting and financial data are  harmonised  and  properly  determined  and  general accounting  data  and  management  data  used  in  the preparation of the financial information are consistent.\n\n## Financial communication\n\nManagers  in  charge  of  Financial  Communication  prepare  a precise timetable for publication of up-to-date information on the  Group  to  the  financial  markets.  This  timetable  complies with  the  requirements  of  market  authorities.  These  managers ensure,  with  the  assistance  of  the  Legal  Department,  that communications are made within the required deadlines and in accordance  with  laws  and  regulations,  which  they constantly monitor.\n\nTheir  role  is  also  to  publish,  precisely  and  accurately,  the information provided by the Operational Finance Department. All  material  information  provided  to  the  financial  community reflects with truth and transparency the situation and activities of  the  Group  and  the  process  is  carried  out  in  accordance with  the  principle  of  equal  provision  of  information  to  all shareholders.\n\n## Statutory Auditors\n\nAll accounting  and  financial  information  prepared  by consolidated subsidiaries is  subject  to  a  limited  review  at  the time of the half-year closing process and to a full audit at yearend by the external auditors. Twice a year, the Chief Executive Officer  and  the  Chief  Financial  Officer  of  the  consolidated subsidiary make a joint commitment as to the fair presentation, reliability  and  completeness  of  the  financial  information  by jointly signing a representation letter.\n\nAudit assignments in the countries are almost all entrusted to members of the networks of  the  two  Statutory  Auditors  who, after  having  jointly  performed  the  review  of  all  the  Group's accounts and the manner in which they were prepared, are responsible for issuing an opinion on the Group's consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditors issue an opinion as to  whether  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  the parent  company  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair view.  They  are  kept  informed  from  the  early  stages  of preparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  present  an overview of their work to the Group's accounting and finance managers  and  to  the  Audit  Committee  at  the  time  of  the half-year and annual closings.",

Insurance policy\n\n## The Group's general insurance policy\n\nThe objective of the Group's insurance policy is to provide the best  protection  of  Group  assets  and  people  from  the occurrence of major and insurable risks that could adversely affect it.\n\nFor that purpose,  the  Group  has  implemented  global insurance  programmes  (in  particular  for  Property  Damages &  Operating  Losses,  Third-Party  Liability,  Cyber,  Transport, Credit Insurance and Construction) that harmonise coverage and optimise insurance cover for all its subsidiaries throughout the world, except in countries where regulations do not allow this  type  of  arrangement  (see  'Restrictions'  below).  National programmes have been set up in the countries in which global programmes cannot be deployed.\n\nThis policy is applied as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 at  a  central  level,  according  to  the  offering  available  on the  insurance  market,  the  Group  negotiates  the  structure and  warranties  of  the  global  insurance  programmes  to cover its main exposures;\n- \u00b7 at  a  local  level,  local  policies  not  re-insured  by  a  Group programme are deployed in coordination with the Group; and\n- \u00b7 in all cases,  the  subsidiaries  must  obtain  mandatory insurance  cover  in  order  to  meet  their  local  regulatory obligations.\n\nThe  financial  solvency  of  insurers  chosen  is  an  important criterion  in  the  Group's  insurer  selection  process.  Most  of  the insurance  programmes  subscribed  by  the  Group  involve  coinsurance between  the  various major players in the international insurance market.\n\n## Integrated global programmes\n\n## General civil liability\n\nThis  global  programme  subscribed  for  the  benefit  of  all  Group subsidiaries  (except  where  local  Restrictions  apply)  includes,  in particular,  civil operational  liability,  product  liability  and damage to the environment that is sudden and accidental.\n\nIt  covers  the  financial  consequences  of  the  civil  liability  of Group entities, to the extent that they are liable.\n\n## Property damages and operating losses\n\nFire, lightning, explosion, theft and natural disasters are insured within  the  limits  of  the  products  available  on  the  insurance market.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  up  a  global  programme  to  cover  all  its property,  chiefly  fixed  assets  and  inventories  (except  where Restrictions  apply).  This  cover  also  includes  a  portion  on operating  losses  directly  resulting  from  covered  property  loss or damage.\n\nAs the capacity of the insurance market is limited for certain risks,  this  programme includes sublimits, particularly as regards natural disasters.\n\nThrough  its  reinsurance  subsidiary,  the  Group  carries  risk retention  levels  that  are  not  material  at  consolidated  level, and  these  are  applicable  over  and  above  local  deductible amounts.\n\nFinally,  the  insurance  offering  includes  prevention  inspections for  the  Group's  sites  conducted  by  specialist  departments  of the leading insurer.\n\n## Cyber\n\nA  Cyber  insurance  policy  provides  financial  cover  for  the consequences  of  IT-related  risks,  subject  to  exclusions  and warranties available on the market.\n\nAs  it  is  a  'multi-risk'  policy,  cyber  risk  insurance  comprises several components.\n\n## Transport\n\nThe Group has set up an insurance programme to cover the transportation  of  all  its  products.  All  subsidiaries  benefit  from the  protection  offered  by  this  global  programme,  which ensures that appropriate and uniform cover for risks related to the  Group's  logistical  operations  is  provided  (except  where Restrictions apply).\n\n## Customer credit risk\n\nGroup subsidiaries must set up credit insurance, assisted by the Group  and  under  the  terms  and  conditions  negotiated,  in addition  to  their  own  credit  management  policy,  provided that  insurance  cover  compatible  with  their  level  of  sales activity is available under financially acceptable conditions.\n\n## Buildings\n\nThe primary aim of the global Buildings insurance programme is to standardise the conditions for covering projects of all sizes in  all  countries,  as  well  as  to  disseminate  a  general  Buildings insurance  policy,  centralised  Corporate  management  and, lastly, warranty optimisation.\n\n3",

These  Principles  -  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage and  Transparency  -  form  the  foundation  of  its  policies  on sustainable  development, corporate social responsibility,  and philanthropy.  L'Or\u00e9al  promotes  respect  for  all  internationally recognised Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nIn  line  with  the  United  Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business and Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al's particular point of reference is the Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  the  International Covenant  on  Civil  and  Political  Rights,  the  International Covenant  on  Economic,  Social  and  Cultural  rights,  and  the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Vigilance  Plan  meets  the  obligations  of  the  French law  of  27  March  2017  on  the  duty  of  vigilance  for  French parent companies and order-givers companies.\n\nIt  contains  reasonable  due  diligence  measures  intended  to prevent  the  risk  of  serious  adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, health, as well as safety and the environment within the framework of a best efforts obligation.\n\nIt  applies  to  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A.,  the  parent  company  of  the  Group, and  to  the  subsidiaries  controlled  directly  or  indirectly  by L'Or\u00e9al  (the  'Subsidiaries'),  as  defined  by  Article  L.  233-16  of the French Commercial  Code,  and  to  suppliers  and subcontractors with which the companies of the Group have an  'permanent  commercial  relationship',  that  is,  a  direct, ongoing  and  stable  commercial  relationship  (based  on  the definition  in  French  case  law),  hereinafter  the  'Suppliers', depending on the risk level as identified in this Vigilance Plan. It is  understood  that  in  its  own  activities,  L'Or\u00e9al  complies  with the rules and diligences contained in this Vigilance Plan, even when L'Or\u00e9al is not expressly mentioned therein.\n\nThe  Vigilance  Plan  contains  the  rules  applied  to  prevent  the risk of serious adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights  and Fundamental Freedoms, the health and safety of people and the  environment  resulting  from  the  activities  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its Subsidiaries and Suppliers (see section 3.4.4. 'Applicable rules resulting  from  the  risk  analysis').  It  also  includes  reasonable measures  for  the  effective  application  of  these  rules  by L'Or\u00e9al,  its  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  as  well  as  regular assessment  procedures  to  evaluate  their  compliance  (see section 3.4.5. 'Effective application and compliance with the Vigilance Plan'). It includes a whistleblowing mechanism and reporting system (see section 3.4.6. 'Whistleblowing mechanism and reporting system') and presents a report on the  plan's  implementation  (see  section  3.4.7.  'Reporting  on the effective implementation of the Vigilance Plan').\n\nThe  actions  to  support,  encourage  and  prevent  serious adverse Human Rights, Fundamental Freedoms, health, safety and  the  environment  contained  in  this  Vigilance  Plan constitute reasonable efforts to be implemented by Suppliers and  Subsidiaries.  Given  the  diversity  of  the  businesses  of  the Subsidiaries and  Suppliers, the Vigilance Plan contains common measures intended for them on these issues.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  common  measures,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  its Subsidiaries  voluntarily  conduct  additional  actions  on  these same issues. These actions are described in other chapters of this document,  particularly  Chapter  4  'L'Or\u00e9al's  Social, Environmental and Societal Responsibility'. Suppliers voluntarily conduct  additional  actions  on  these  issues  and  L'Or\u00e9al encourages them to do so.\n\n## 3.4.2. A continuous improvement process\n\nAs  part  of  a  continuous  improvement  process,  this  Plan  is regularly reviewed by a committee composed of representatives of the Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department, the Operations Division (EHS, Purchasing), the Human Resources Department,  the  Corporate  Social  Responsibility  Department and  the  Legal  Department.  It  meets  three  times  a  year. Each  of  these  representatives  leads  a  local  network  (Ethics Correspondents, Environmental, Health and Safety, Purchasing,  and  Human  Resource  teams,  managers  from Internal  Control,  Sustainability  Leaders)  around  the  world, which  also  means  that  feedback  from  the  field  can  be considered in improving the Plan.\n\nThe Plan was presented to internal stakeholders (such as the employee  representatives  in  the  context  of  the  European Works  Council,  'EWC',  of  the  Group)  and  qualified  outside stakeholders.  Its  updated  contents  are  presented  every  year to the Audit Committee and to the Board of Directors.\n\n## 3.4.3. General framework of risk analysis\n\nThe risks of serious impacts on Human Rights, the environment, health  and  safety,  have  been  analysed  on  the  basis  of  the business  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  Subsidiaries  and  its  Suppliers.  The  risk analysis was used, first, in the definition of the applicable Rules and,  second,  to  the  measures  for  effective  application  and monitoring of these Rules.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  activity  consists  of  production  of  cosmetic  products and distribution of these products to the Group's clients.\n\n## A/ Manufacturing of finished products\n\nL'Or\u00e9al manufactures the vast majority of the finished products that  it  sells  in  its  own  factories,  with  a  presence  in  the  major growth markets through its  network  of  39  factories  equipped with the very latest technologies and advances in automation. This network  of  plants  adapts  constantly  with  agility  to incorporate acquisitions and embrace external innovations.\n\nThis  network  is  completed  by  production  subcontracting, to  meet  temporary  demand  peaks  in  the  case  of  specific technologies (make-up pencils, soaps, etc.). L'Or\u00e9al's contracts prohibit  cascade  subcontracting.  If,  due  to  manufacturing constraints, some subcontractors must subcontract a portion of the production  intended  for  L'Or\u00e9al,  they  must  obtain authorisation from  L'Or\u00e9al.  When,  in  certain  cases,  the subcontractor  is  authorised  to  subcontract  a  portion  of  its production,  the  same  rules  as  those  defined  in  this  Plan  are applied  to  the  subcontractors  of  the  subcontractors,  and  the same  types  of  controls  and  sanctions  in  the  event  of non-compliance are in place.\n\nIn order  to  execute  their  production,  L'Or\u00e9al's  factories purchase different raw materials, filling and packing components and equipment from third-party suppliers. These suppliers  have  specific  expertise,  develop  their  products  and have  the  infrastructures  necessary  for  their  production.  They act  with  complete  independence  from  L'Or\u00e9al,  without depending on L'Or\u00e9al's instructions or expertise.",

The  filling  and  packing  components used are purchased from companies specialising in this area. The same is true for the production equipment.\n\n## B/ Product distribution\n\nProducts are distributed by the Subsidiaries and independent third-party  distributors  in  the  countries  or  regions  where  the Subsidiaries are not present.\n\nIn order to ensure this distribution, warehouses are operated by the  Subsidiaries  directly,  or  these  services  are  entrusted  to third-party  logistics  service  providers  that  render  services  on the same type of activity: storage and preparation of orders in warehouses that they lease or own.\n\n## 3.4.4. Applicable rules resulting from the risk analysis\n\nThe Subsidiaries and Suppliers must comply with the applicable local  legislation  and  the  minimum  common core of the rules listed  below  (the  'Applicable  Rules')  in  order  to  prevent  the risk of serious adverse  impacts  on  Human  Rights  and fundamental freedoms, health and safety of people and the environment.  When  local  laws  and/or  the  internal  rules  of Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  provide  more  stringent  standards than  the  Applicable  Rules,  such  standards  must  take precedence.  If,  however,  the  Applicable  Rules  provide  for stricter  standards,  the  Applicable  Rules  take  precedence unless  they  result  in  an  unlawful  activity.  In  the  event  of contradictions between local laws and internationally recognised Human Rights, L'Or\u00e9al works to comply with these international standards.\n\n## 3.4.4.1. Risks and Applicable Rules for the prevention of serious violations of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\n## Risk Analysis and risks identified relating to Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nFollowing  an  initial  analysis  conducted  in  2017,  the  Group wanted  to  expand  its  mapping  in  2020  by  identifying  the salient  Human  Rights  risks.  To  do  so,  L'Or\u00e9al  relied  on  the reporting framework of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP Reporting Framework). This identification process takes into consideration the severity, scale, remediability  and  likelihood  of  its  impact  on  people.  The identification  process  at  global  level  and  in  27  markets  was finalised  in  2021.  This  study  was  conducted  with  an  NGO specialising in the area, providing independent analysis.\n\nAs  a  result  of  this  analysis,  the  following  salient  risks  were identified in the context of the application of the French Law on Duty of Vigilance:\n\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  child  labour  among  the  employees  of  the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  forced  labour  among  the  employees  of  the Group's Suppliers;\n- \u00b7 the  risk  of  job  discrimination  because  of  gender,  age, disability,  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation  of  the employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  employees  of  the  Group's Suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 the risk of a lack of decent living wage for the employees of the Group's Suppliers.\n\nAnother  risk identified concerns  the  Human  Rights  of communities  potentially  impacted  by  the  Group's  activities (respect  for  the  environment,  right  of  access  to  water, consideration of Human Rights in the choice of raw materials and, in  particular,  the  right  of  access  of  local  populations  to their  land  and  respect  for  their  traditional  knowledge  under the Nagoya Protocol).\n\n## Applicable rules on Human Rights\n\nSubsidiaries and Suppliers must comply with the minimum core rules,  which  consist  of  the  following  rules  that  result  from  an analysis of the risks related to the activities of the Group and its Suppliers.\n\n## Non-discrimination\n\nActs  of  discrimination  are  serious  violations  of  Human  Rights that  remain  anchored  in  all  regions  of  the  world  in  which L'Or\u00e9al  is  present.  Discrimination  related  to  gender,  sexual orientation  and  gender  identity,  disabilities,  family  situation, age,  political  and  philosophical  opinions,  religious  beliefs, union activities, or related to ethnic, social, cultural or national origins  are  prohibited.  Discrimination related to pregnancy is also  prohibited.  In  this  respect,  L'Or\u00e9al  bans  pregnancy testing  when  employees  are  hired  within  the  Group,  and requires its Suppliers to comply with this standard.\n\n## Bullying and sexual harassment\n\nBullying  and  sexual  harassment  are  also  prohibited  in  the Group.  L'Or\u00e9al  requires  that  its  Suppliers  comply  with  this standard.\n\n## Child labour\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  presence  in  certain  regions  of  the  world  that  are particularly  at  risk  for  child  labour,  including  Asia  and  Latin America, has led the Group to identify this issue as a priority.\n\nTo  take  into  consideration  the  vulnerability  of  young  workers, L'Or\u00e9al has set the minimum hiring age at 16 years old.\n\nThe Subsidiaries and Suppliers are required to check the age of all new employees upon hire.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al prohibits night work and work hazardous to health and safety for employees younger than 18 in its Subsidiaries. L'Or\u00e9al requires that its Suppliers comply with this standard.\n\n3",

Forced labour is defined as 'all work or service which is exacted from any person under the menace of any penalty and for which the said person has not offered himself voluntarily'.\n\nIn certain regions of the world where L'Or\u00e9al operates, certain practices that violate internationally recognised Human Rights, such  as  holding  the  identity  papers  of  migrant  workers,  are common.\n\nAny form of forced labour is prohibited. As a result:\n\n- \u00b7 unless  there  is  a  legal  obligation,  employees'  identity papers,  passports  or  any  other  personal  documents  may not be held from them. In the event of a legal obligation, these  documents  must  be  returned  to  employees  at  their first request;\n- \u00b7 employees may not be asked to pay for recruitment costs or to make cash deposits to obtain employment;\n- \u00b7 if workers from foreign regions are hired, the employer must pay the costs related to these hires;\n- \u00b7 the  use  of  prison  labour  is  possible  only  when  it  is  voluntary within  the  scope  of  a  professional  reinsertion  programme, and  paid  at  the  market  rate.  Suppliers  must  request authorisation from L'Or\u00e9al before they use this type of labour;\n- \u00b7 security  personnel  must  only  ensure  the  safety  of  people and property; and\n- \u00b7 any salary withholding must be strictly authorised by law. It may not under any circumstances be used for the purpose of  confiscation,  for  the  direct  or  indirect  benefit  of  the employer.\n\nEmployees must be free to move around their place of work, with  the  exceptions of areas to which access is restricted for confidentiality  or  safety  reasons,  and  must  have  access  to drinking water and bathrooms.\n\n## Working hours\n\nWhichever the region of the world in which L'Or\u00e9al operates, the  working  hours  in  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers,  including overtime,  may  not  exceed  60  hours  a  week  for  employees whose working time is monitored.\n\nAll employees must also be granted at least one day of rest for every  seven-day  period,  or  two  consecutive  days  of  rest  for every fourteen-day period. They must have reasonable breaks when they work.\n\n## Freedom of association\n\nViolations  of  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to  collective bargaining, such as discrimination against employee representatives,  may  occur  in  all  regions  of  the  world  in  which L'Or\u00e9al operates.\n\nEmployees'  freedom  of  association  and  right  to  collective bargaining must be respected:\n\n- \u00b7 elections  of  employee  representatives  must  take  place without  interference  from  the  employer,  preferably  by secret ballot;\n- \u00b7 employee representatives have access to the work premises subject to safety and/or confidentiality requirements, if any; and\n- \u00b7 discrimination against employees conducting union activities is prohibited.\n\nIn  regions  where  freedom  of  association  and  the  right  to collective  bargaining  are  limited  or  discouraged,  L'Or\u00e9al authorises  its  employees  to  meet  independently  in  order  to discuss  their  professional  concerns.  L'Or\u00e9al  requires  that  its Suppliers do the same.\n\n## Additional actions for Human Rights\n\nIn addition to the actions resulting from the risk analysis on the activities  of  the  Group  and  the  Suppliers,  L'Or\u00e9al  conducts actions on Human Rights in addition to those implemented in the context of the French law on Duty of Vigilance, which are described  in  Chapter  4  'L'Or\u00e9al's  Social,  Environmental  and Societal Responsibility' of this document.\n\nFor  example,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  actions  with  the  aim  to  improve the  working  conditions  of  the  Indian  communities  whose livelihood  depends  on  the  mineral  mica.  Since  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al has been one of the 20 founding members of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI), joined by 74 other organisations that use mica. The RMI has three goals:\n\n\u00b7\n\nimplement standards on the responsible workplace on 100%\n\nof the supply chains of its members for mica from Bihar and\n\nJharkhand (standards on employment, health, safety in the\n\nworkplace, the environment and non-use of child labour);\n\n- \u00b7 support  the  abilities  of  communities  through  an  inclusive programme  that  improves  the  standard  of  living  and generates additional sources of income; and\n- \u00b7 establish  a  legal  framework  and  related  control  systems with  mica  pickers,  processing  units,  and  mica  operators  in Bihar and Jharkhand.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also participates in the development of the RMI audit standard  in  order  to  facilitate  member  collaboration  and effectively deploy the collective actions necessary in cooperation  with  local  authorities.  L'Or\u00e9al  also  supports  the establishment  of  a  price  calculated  using  the  living  wage approach in addition  to  diversified  income  contributing  to  a more resilient living conditions.\n\nTo  complete  this  approach,  L'Or\u00e9al  requires  that  its  suppliers have their own due diligence process in place on their scope of supply of Indian mica. In 2021, 99% of Indian mica used in the  Group's  formulas  came  from  suppliers  committed  to obtaining their supply from verified sources.",

Risks and Applicable Rules to prevent serious adverse impacts on Safety and Health in the workplace and the Environment\n\n## Analysis of Risks to Safety and Health in the workplace and the Environment\n\nThe  analysis  risks  to  Safety  and  Health  in  the  workplace  and the  Environment  covers  generic  risks  related  to  industrial activities and specific risks related to the own activities of the Suppliers and Subsidiaries.\n\n## Generic risk analysis process\n\nAs  is  the  case  for  any  production  (manufacturing  and packing),  distribution,  research  and  general  administration operations, the Group and its Suppliers are exposed to safety and environmental challenges.\n\nBased on the risk prevention work on the Environment, Health and Safety at the workplace carried out by L'Or\u00e9al for many years, the major risks listed below have been identified. On this basis,  the  Subsidiaries  and  Suppliers  must  define  at  each  of their sites, the measures designed to prevent the risks identified in this Vigilance Plan (the 'Prevention System').\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Subsidiaries\n\nThe Subsidiaries  conduct their own risk analysis based on the list of risks below, particularly the fire risk that is framed by very strict fire prevention  standards  (National  Fire  Protection Association standard).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  generic  risks,  the  Subsidiaries  identify  the specific  risks  related  in  particular  to  cosmetics  production. Thus,  for  example,  the  physical  risks  are  the  subject  of  SHAP (Safety Hazards Assessment Procedure) studies, which identify the  dangers,  generally  and  for  each  workstation,  assess  the risks and allow the implementation of the necessary means of control. Similarly, environmental risks are analysed to characterise  the  aspects  and  impacts  of  site  activities  on  its environment  and  to  control  those  that  lead  to  potentially serious  impacts  for  the  air,  soil,  water,  biodiversity  and resources.\n\nThis environmental analysis is updated regularly by each of the Group  Subsidiaries'  sites  and  whenever  a  significant  change occurs. If significant risks are identified or if L'Or\u00e9al's standards or  regulations  impose  specific  requirements,  a  more  detailed evaluation  is  carried  out  for  the  activities  concerned. Appropriate  action  plans  -  with  immediate  action  where necessary - are implemented to reduce significant risks to an acceptable level.\n\nWith  regard  to  water  discharge,  each  industrial  site  has implemented a self-monitoring system that is representative of wastewater discharged (monitoring of regulated and contractual  parameters:  chemical  oxygen  demand  (COD), oxygen biochemistry demand (OBD), etc.). This self-monitoring is  a  tool for detecting risks of exceeding regulatory thresholds that  helps  to  anticipate  any  non-conformities  and  initiate corrective  actions.  Moreover,  31  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  have  their own  wastewater  treatment  plant  and  L'Or\u00e9al  is  continuing with the installation of these plants.\n\nThe  risks  of  process  safety  are  analysed  using  the  HAZOP (HAZard  and  OPerability  analysis)  guide,  which  focuses  on operating  conditions,  or  FMECA  (Failure  Mode,  Effects  and Criticality Analysis), which analyses risks related to failures in the process at the different steps in production.\n\nThe results and means of controlling industrial and specific risks are  summarised  in  the  GHAP  (Global  Hazard  Assessment Procedure) programme.\n\n## Specific risk analysis process for Suppliers\n\nSuppliers,  in  addition  to  their  own  risk  analysis,  rely  at  a minimum on the risks  identified  in  the  audit  grid  provided  by L'Or\u00e9al at the signing of the Letter of Ethical Commitment (see section 4.3.1.2.1. 'Due diligence: selection and assessment of strategic  suppliers'  of  this  document)  in  order  to  implement suitable  preventive  measures  in  each  affected  site.  This  grid was  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  list  of  the  major  risks described below and is applied during referencing and followup audits.\n\nIf the  specific  nature  of  the  Suppliers'  activity  requires identification  of  specific  risks  and/or  additional  prevention measures, the Suppliers are required to roll out these additional measures in accordance with best practices in their industry.\n\nFor  example,  in  the  subcontracting  of  finished  products activity, specific risks may involve:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of certain raw materials;\n- \u00b7 wastewater treatment;\n- \u00b7 the use of machines or electrical equipment in processing or storage areas; and\n- \u00b7 handling that may cause personal injury, in particular.\n\nIn  the  specific  case  of  subcontracting  suppliers  of  aerosol production or storage, bleaching powders, flammable products,  the  sites  are  subject  to  specific  risks  analyses concerning process safety.\n\n## Risks identified in the Environment, Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n## Risks of serious adverse impacts to Health and Safety in the workplace\n\n- (i) Risks associated with buildings and the use of equipment:\n- \u00b7 soundness  of  buildings  (construction  and  interior  fittings, including  the  compliance  of  equipment  with  operating authorisations and  building permits issued by local authorities  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  legislation and, in any event, adaptation to the activity for which the buildings are intended);\n- \u00b7 use  of  motorised  forklift  trucks  and  Automatic  Guided Vehicles (AGV): risks caused by interactions and interference between forklift trucks, AGVs and pedestrians; and\n- \u00b7 injuries caused  by  interactions  between  humans  and machines:  risks  related  to  access  to  the  moving  parts  of work equipment.\n\n3",

The  Group  extends  the  ambition  of moving towards 'zero accidents' by ensuring the sustainability of actions and defining post-incident emergency preparedness requirements.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Sharing  Beauty  with  All  programme  has helped to reduce the environmental footprint of the Group's sites, in particular by defining and disseminating best practices regarding energy efficiency, reducing CO2 emissions, contributing  to  the  preservation  of  water,  biodiversity  and resources, and improving waste treatment.\n\nThe new commitments made by the Group for 2030 as part of its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  are  aimed  at  ensuring compatibility  of  the  Group's  activities  with  a  planet  that  has limited resources (the commitments and achievements of the programme  are  detailed  in  Chapter  4  'L'Or\u00e9al's  Social, Environmental  and  Societal  Responsibility'  of  this  document, specifically  in  section  4.4.  'L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future:  2021 Results'). The main environmental objectives of the programme concerning Subsidiaries are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate:  reaching  carbon  neutrality  for  all  Group  sites  by 2025,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and  using  100% renewable energy. L'Or\u00e9al is also committed to halving the transport footprint of its products by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Water:  in  2030,  100%  of  the  water  used  in  our  industrial processes will be recycled and reused in a loop.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity:  by  2030,  all  of  our  operated  buildings  and  all industrial  sites  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  biodiversity compared to 2019.\n- \u00b7 Natural resources: by 2030, 100% of the waste generated in our operated sites will be recycled or reused. L'Or\u00e9al is also committed to no longer send waste to landfills.",

        "page_content": "These  objectives  are  accompanied  by  monthly  reporting  of detailed indicators used to monitor evolutions in results in each of  these  areas  and  to  identify  potential  anomalies  and incidents.\n\nFurthermore, the Group is engaged in a process of continuous improvement of EHS performance through its operated sites in order  to  sustainably  anchor  the  EHS  policy:  ISO  45001  for  the management of employee health and safety and improvement in  their  working  conditions;  ISO  14001  for  the  management  of environmental  impacts  and  improvement  in  environmental performance;  and  ISO  50001  for  energy  management  and energy performance improvement.\n\nMoreover,  'culture'  audits  are  conducted  by  internal  EHS specialists  in  order  to  assess  the  deployment  level  of  the  EHS culture  with  all  employees  at  Subsidiaries:  the  results  of  these audits  provide  information  on  the  level  of  knowledge  of  EHS management  tools  and  the  maturity  of  audited  sites  with regard to the safety and environment culture at all structural levels.\n\nDetailed  information  on  these  additional  actions  is  available  in Chapter 4 'L'Or\u00e9al's Social, Environmental and Societal Responsibility' of this document.\n\n## (ii) Additional actions intended for Suppliers\n\nThe Purchasing teams select the most competitive suppliers in accordance with  the  responsible  purchasing  policy.  The  EHS performance of Suppliers is managed by monitoring indicators included in the corporate social responsibility criterion, which is one of the five criteria for monitoring supplier performance.\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, launched in 2020  with  targets  for  2030,  the  Group  has  broadened  its environmental  commitments  to  its  supply  chain.  The  main environmental  objectives  of  the  programme  concerning suppliers or those that may be related to their business activity are therefore as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate: by 2030, strategic suppliers will reduce their direct greenhouse  gas  emissions  (scopes  1  and  2)  by  50%  in absolute terms compared to 2016.\n- \u00b7 Water:  by  2030,  all  strategic  suppliers  will  use  water responsibly in the areas where they operate.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity:\n- \u00b7 By 2030, 100% of the biobased ingredients for the Group's formulas and packaging materials will be traceable and will  come  from  sustainable  sources,  with  none  linked  to deforestation.\n- \u00b7 By  2030,  the  footprint  on  the  ecosystems  vital  to  the sourcing  of  its  ingredients  will  be  maintained  at  2019 levels.\n- \u00b7 Sustainable sourcing of raw materials:\n\nFor  the  palm  oil  and  its  by-products  segment,  which  are  the subject  of  a  specific  'Zero  deforestation'  approach  at  yearend 2020, 100% of the supplies were covered by action plans with the suppliers concerned.  L'Or\u00e9al developed  the Sustainable  Palm  Index  (SPI),  a  tool  to  evaluate  and  select suppliers of palm oil and palm kernel derivatives to assess the level of commitment, progress and achievements of its direct suppliers  in  favour  of  sustainable  palm  oil.  This  tool  is  used annually  to  evaluate  suppliers'  progress  towards  the  Zero Deforestation objective and their level of compliance with the Group's requirements.\n\nThe  specific  feature  of  the  SPI  lies  in  its  integration  in  the purchasing decision process. A supplier in compliance with the SPI  will  benefit  from  an  allocation  of  volumes,  long-term contracts, and will be favoured in the context of partnerships in land projects.\n\nIn 2019, L'Or\u00e9al co-founded  the  collective  Action  for Sustainable  Derivatives  initiative  in  order  to  share  knowledge and  methods  with  other  operators  to  encourage  the production and responsible supply of palm oil derivatives.\n\nFor other streams of renewable raw materials, which represent 17% of the portfolio of renewable raw materials in volumes and 74% in number, L'Or\u00e9al, on the basis of environmental, social and economic indicators from external databases (IHDI of the UNDP,  EPI  from  Yale  University,  Verisk  Maplecroft  Country Index), has  defined  indicators  of  'sustainable  sourcing challenges'  to  assess  renewable  raw  material  streams  with regard to their sustainability.\n\nThese indicators are consolidated within the SCAN (Sustainable  Characterisation)  index,  allowing  the  Group  to prioritise the implementation of its sustainable sourcing action plans. The Group updates the information collected regularly. 79% of the volume of raw materials that the SCAN index has identified as representing sustainable sourcing challenges (i.e. 36% of the number of raw materials) are already the subject of plans or improvement initiatives with the relevant suppliers to ensure sustainable supply. The goal is for 100% of the Group's renewable raw materials to come from sustainable sources.\n\nTo  achieve  this,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  support  and  training programme  for  more  than  200  suppliers  on  the  issues  of sustainable sourcing of raw materials in order to guarantee the traceability  of  the  raw  materials  delivered  to  L'Or\u00e9al  and ensure the associated streams are secure. Depending on the level  of  environmental  and/or  social  risk  identified  on  these streams, suppliers are notably asked to deploy the field audit procedure for producers (88 indicators), developed by L'Or\u00e9al with the support of the Rainforest Alliance NGO and reviewed in  2019  by  EcoCert,  The  Biodiversity  Consultancy  and  The Danish Institute for Human Rights. They are also invited to rely on sustainable sourcing certifications adapted  to  the challenges of their streams (Fair Trade, Sustainable Agricultural Network, Organic, etc.).\n\n- \u00b7 Plastics and advertising displays:\n- \u00b7 By  2030,  100%  of  the  Group's  plastic  packaging  will  be recycled or bio-sourced (target of 50% by 2025).\n- \u00b7 By  2025,  100%  of  the  Group's  plastic  packaging  will  be refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable.\n- \u00b7 By 2025, 100% of the Group's advertising displays at points of  sale  will  be  eco-designed,  taking  into  account  the principles of the circular economy for managing their end of life.\n- \u00b7 Commitment of  suppliers  to  self-assess  and  move  forward with action plans through the CDP.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al actively works with its suppliers to help them improve their performance in terms of sustainable development.\n\n3",

In  2014,  participation  in  the  CDP  was  made  compulsory  by L'Or\u00e9al  for  all  strategic  suppliers,  in  order  to  measure  and report their emissions, set targets for reducing these emissions and communicate their action plans to achieve this objective successfully. In 2021, 77%  of these strategic suppliers completed the CDP questionnaires on climate, water and/or forest, thereby providing valuable information and data on the actions of these suppliers and their impacts.\n\n- \u00b7 Supplier  commitment  to  self-assess  and  improve  with corrective actions implemented by EcoVadis:\n\nBy participating in the EcoVadis assessment, L'Or\u00e9al compares its environmental and social policy with the expertise and the recommendations of external auditors qualified in the analysis of  multi-sector  risks.  This  is  a  useful  rating  for  the  continuous improvement  of  suppliers  and  it  also  contributes  to  the transparency  of  industry  practices.  This  assessment  is  used  to select  suppliers  by  taking  their  environmental  and  social performance into consideration.\n\n## 3.4.5. Effective application and compliance with the Vigilance Plan\n\nThe  Vigilance  Plan  includes  effective  application  measures intended  to  ensure  the  correct  implementation  of  the Applicable Rules by the Subsidiaries and Suppliers. Monitoring of compliance with the Plan is carried out through audits and analyses performed by external service providers or by Group teams. In addition, the Subsidiaries and Suppliers are asked to carry out self-assessments.\n\n## 3.4.5.1. Effective application of the Vigilance Plan\n\n## Adoption of Applicable Rules\n\n- (i) Adoption of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries\n\nThe effective implementation of Applicable Rules by Subsidiaries  is  achieved  through  their  incorporation  in  the Group's Internal  Rules.  For  this  purpose,  compliance  with  the effective application of the Plan is based on control activities in accordance with the applicable legislation.\n\nThe communication of Applicable Rules to Group employees is described below.\n\n- (ii) Adoption of Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\nSuppliers  undertake  to  comply  with  the  Applicable  Rules.  In particular,  the  principal  Suppliers  sign  the  Letter  of  Ethical Commitment  that  covers  these  applicable  Rules.  Moreover, the  Suppliers  that  could  present  the  most  significant  risks because  of  their  activity  or  geographic  location  may  be audited on these issues in accordance with the Risk Matrix. The contents  of  the  points  that  will  be  audited  is  set  forth  in  the letter.\n\n## Governance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitment  to  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms, the health and safety of people in the workplace and the environment is supported at the highest level of the Company by its Chief Executive Officer who renews L'Or\u00e9al's commitment  to  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  each year. These commitments are also set out in the Group's Code of Ethics and the Human Rights and Employee Human Rights Policy.\n\n## (i) Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms governance\n\nThe  Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer,  a  member  of  the Executive Committee, is responsible for overseeing the respect of Human Rights and fundamental freedoms in the Group. This mission has been entrusted to her by L'Or\u00e9al's Chief Executive Officer, to whom she reports.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer has a budget and a dedicated team of Human Rights experts. She relies on all the Group's teams and resources to carry out her work.\n\n- A  dedicated  network  of  Human  Rights  Correspondents covering  all  of  the  Group's  markets  allows  the  Group's commitments in terms of Human Rights to be rolled out.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee, chaired by the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer and composed of representatives of the various  activities,  functions  and  geographic  areas  (including Purchasing, HR, CSR, Safety, Security, etc.), allows coordination and exchange on the implementation of the Group's Human Rights policy. Its primary objective is to enable the emergence of a Human Rights culture within the Group.\n\nCountry  Managers  (or,  for  Corporate  or  Zone  staff,  the members of the Group's Executive Committee to whom they report)  are  responsible  for  ensuring  compliance  with  Human Rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Human Resources teams are responsible for ensuring that the  activities  of  the  Subsidiaries  respect  employees'  Human Rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nEmployees may  contact  their manager,  their Human Resources  Director,  their  Legal  Director,  their  Purchasing Director,  their  Human  Rights  Correspondent,  their  Ethics Correspondent  and,  ultimately,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance  Officer  if  they  have  any  questions  about compliance with the Applicable Rules.\n\nThe  Purchasing  teams  ensure  that  Supplier  activities  respect Human Rights and fundamental freedoms. Suppliers included in the Risk Matrix are not listed in L'Or\u00e9al's Supplier database until they  have  contractually  committed  to  comply  with  the Applicable Rules. Purchasing teams discuss, during Management Committee meetings that include representatives from all Zones and purchasing areas, the results of audits, their consequences for commercial relations, and the related  actions  plans  to  achieve  continuous  improvement  of results at the Group's Suppliers.",

The implementation of this policy is the responsibility of the Group's Subsidiaries and Group Sites.\n\nThe  Chief  Operations  Officer  is  supported  by  and  delegates the deployment and monitoring of the policy to:\n\n- \u00b7 factory and distribution centre Directors who, as a result of their  positions,  are  responsible  for  the  deployment  and effective  implementation  of  the  policies  defined  by  the Group. Their remuneration is partly linked to their performance in the areas of the environment, health and safety in the workplace;\n- \u00b7 EHS  managers  are  managers  trained  and  dedicated  to compliance with the EHS policy who  ensure the deployment  of  the  rules,  procedures  and  associated performance  objectives  of  the  Group  in  all  of  its  entities; and\n- \u00b7 country  Operations  Directors  who  are  responsible  for, among other things, compliance with the EHS policy by the distribution  centres,  the  administrative  Sites  and  stores  in their country.\n\nIn addition, the Purchasing teams are responsible for collecting confirmation  of  acceptance  of  Applicable  Rules  from  the Suppliers via the Letter of Ethical Commitment.\n\nThe  Purchasing  teams  are  responsible  for  ensuring  that Suppliers included in the Risk Matrix implement the prevention measures  for  EHS  risks  via  control  audits  carried  out  by  thirdparty companies. As for Human Rights, the Purchasing teams discuss, during Management  Committee  meetings  that include representatives from all  Zones  and  purchasing  areas, the  results  of  audits,  their  consequences  for  commercial relations, and the related actions plans to achieve continuous improvement of results at the Group's Suppliers.\n\n## Communication and training\n\nCommunication  of  the  Applicable  Rules  and  training  of  the teams involved complete and support the effective application  of  the  measures  set  out  in  the  Vigilance  Plan  by L'Or\u00e9al's Subsidiaries and Suppliers.\n\n## (i) Communication on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n\nHuman Resources teams are informed of the Applicable Rules by their line manager.\n\nIn addition, all new Group employees must receive a hard or electronic  copy  of  the  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  and  must confirm that they have read it. Employees must be reminded of the Code of Ethics and its contents on a regular basis.\n\nIn  addition,  any  employee  in  contact  with  Suppliers  must receive the 'The Way We Buy' guide when they are hired. It explains ethical standards which apply to Supplier relations.\n\nAn Ethics Intranet site is available to employees.\n\nAn annual Ethics Day, including Human Rights, has been held since 2009. This day enables employees to discuss matters such\n\nVigilance Plan\n\nas respect for Human Rights and fundamental freedoms via a webchat with L'Or\u00e9al's Chief Executive Officer and the other members  of  the  Executive  Committee.  Discussions  on  ethics are  also  organised  in  the  Subsidiaries  to  let  employees exchange  conversations  with  their  Subsidiary's General Manager.\n\nIn 2021, more than 60% of employees logged on to the Ethics Day  sessions  and  more  than  8,000  questions  were  asked worldwide.\n\nWith respect to Suppliers, in addition to the communication of Applicable  Rules  via  the  letters  of  ethical  commitment,  a website  has  been  provided  to  strategic  Suppliers  (Class  A Suppliers as defined in paragraph  'Risk hierarchy of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules' in section 3.4.5.2. of this document)  of  raw  materials, packaging  and subcontractors  of  finished  products.  The  site  contains  the following documents:\n\n- \u00b7 Code of Ethics; and\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al's policy on Suppliers/subcontractors and child labour.\n\n## (ii) Training on Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nA  specific,  compulsory  e-learning  course  on  ethics  covers Human Rights and fundamental freedoms issues.\n\nIn addition,  new  buyers  receive  compulsory  training  on Responsible Purchasing to learn about how to ensure respect of the Group's Ethical Principles.\n\nAn  e-learning  course  on  Supplier  audits,  detailing  the applicable audit procedure, is also available for all buyers. A Suppliers  version  is  available  on  the  same  website  as  the above information. There is also an e-learning course available called 'Ethics e-learning for business partners'.\n\n## (iii) Communication on the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) in the workplace\n\nEHS  managers  are  informed  of  the  Applicable  Rules  by  their functional hierarchy.\n\nGroup Sites are encouraged to hold a day dedicated to EHS to raise the awareness among all employees about the risks to which they are exposed and suitable prevention, in addition to specific local actions.\n\nIn  addition,  a  Group  awareness-raising  campaign  about  major safety risks, deployed over three years, and the implementation of a  specific  topic  every  four  months,  serve  to  develop  employee awareness of risks over time.\n\nA monthly newsletter for the Group's EHS managers and their team leaders enables performance tracking and the sharing of best EHS practices.\n\n## (iv) Training on the Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) in the workplace\n\nTraining  sessions  dedicated  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  EHS  policy  and practices have been provided at all levels of the Company, as well as for temporary workers and subcontractors working on Group  sites.  They  constitute  one  of  the  cornerstones  in  the implementation  of risk identification and  management systems,  and  the  deployment  of  the  EHS  culture  in  all  Group entities.\n\n3",

Monitoring compliance with the Plan\n\n## Risk hierarchy of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules\n\nThe risk hierarchy is used to enhance controls on compliance with the  Applicable  Rules  by  defining  procedures  for  monitoring compliance with the Rules that are adapted to the risks, including a  policy  of  third-party  audits.  Other  means  of  control  are  also used, such  as  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  Suppliers conducted by third-party companies such as EcoVadis.\n\nWith  respect  to  the  Subsidiaries,  the  risk  hierarchy  of non-compliance with the Applicable Rules was created taking into  account  the  type  of  activity  (administrative,  processing, warehousing, etc.) and, thereafter, the type of Site (administrative offices,  factories,  distribution  centres,  research centres, etc.).\n\nWith  respect  to  the  Suppliers,  the  risk  mapping  of  noncompliance with the Applicable Rules was created for Human Rights,  Fundamental  Freedoms,  the  environment,  and  health and safety in the workplace using a methodology that takes the following parameters into account:\n\n- \u00b7 The  country  in  which  the  Supplier's  sites  are  located: a country is considered vulnerable in terms of Human Rights and  Fundamental  Freedoms,  and  environment,  health and safety, if it meets at least one of the following criteria:\n- 1.  The  country  is  classified  as  'High  risk'  or  'Extreme  risk' according  to  the  criteria  of  the  consultancy  firm  Verisk Maplecroft: 12 evaluation indices are used in this methodology and  aggregated  in  a  single  grade  compared  with  the threshold values set by Verisk Maplecroft;\n- 2.  The  results  of  social  audits  conducted  by  L'Or\u00e9al  in  the country include cases of Zero Tolerance or Need Immediate  Action  ('NIA'  rating  that  corresponds  to  the most severe non-conformities); and\n- 3. The internal experts or partners of L'Or\u00e9al (e.g. EcoVadis) recommend considering it as a country to be audited.\n- \u00b7 The  business  sector:  each  Supplier  is  associated  with  a sector  area  according  to  a  governance  ranking  of Purchases ('Global Purchasing Categories').\n- \u00b7 The  nature  of  operations:  the  activities  most  heavily exposed  to  labour  risk  are  the  activities  with  high  manual added value, implying work on a production line.",

The reports on Suppliers are intended for Group buyers.\n\n## EHS audits specific to Subsidiaries\n\nIn order to ensure compliance with the Group's EHS policy, a system of  worldwide  audits  has  been  set  up  since  1996,  and was reinforced in 2001 with the presence of external auditors, who  are  experts  in  the  local  context  and  regulations.  These audits  take  place  regularly  on  each  L'Or\u00e9al  site:  every  three years for production sites and every four years for distribution centres, administrative sites and research centres. If the result of  the  audit  does  not  meet  the  standard  required  by  the L'Or\u00e9al  benchmarks, a specific  interim  audit  is  scheduled  for the  following  year.  Every  year,  the  teams  responsible  for  EHS risks review the audit results and identify general improvement plans. The improvement plans specific to the audited Sites are established immediately after the end of the audit. In addition, any  emergency  measure  intended  to  prevent  an  imminent risk for the health of persons at the Site is implemented by the Site EHS teams without waiting for the completion of an audit even if it is not part of the improvement plan that may exist.\n\nThere  are  various  audit  grids  called  'risk',  'culture',  or 'combined risk and culture', used depending on the maturity and type of activity at the Sites. They assess in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 compliance of practices and facilities with the Group's rules and procedures;\n- \u00b7 progress in terms of EHS performance;\n- \u00b7 any risks that the sites may present from an EHS standpoint; and\n- \u00b7 the  level  of  management  and  deployment  of  EHS  culture on the Sites.\n\nEach risk finding is classified in one of three categories A, B and C according to a matrix of level of impact/probability of occurrence. 'A'  findings  are  monitored  monthly  and  consolidated  annually by risk type.\n\nThe monthly reporting of safety and environmental data also enables  consolidation  and  analysis  of  any  anomalies  and incidents  leading  to  regulatory  non-conformity,  complaints and/or fines.\n\n## Audits specific to Suppliers\n\n## There are three types of audits:\n\n- \u00b7 initial audits (first audits conducted) are a prerequisite to the start of the relationship with a new Supplier;\n- \u00b7 follow-up  audits  (audits  done  12  to  24  months  maximum after the immediate improvement request (Needs Immediate Action or NIA), depending on the severity of the non-conformities found); and\n- \u00b7 confirmation audits, three years after the initial audit.\n\n## The possible outcomes of the audits are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Satisfactory :  all  criteria  conform  to  the  Applicable  Rules and the best practices are highlighted;\n- \u00b7 Needs Continuous Improvement (NCI): minor nonconformities were found, but they do not have an impact on employee safety or health;\n- \u00b7 Needs  Immediate  Action (NIA): non-conformities  are reported either because they are serious, because they are recurring or because they have a potential impact on the health and safety of employees;\n- \u00b7 Zero Tolerance (ZT): reported, for example, in the event of a critical  non-conformity  because  of  child  labour,  forced labour,  physical  abuse,  restricted  freedom  of  movement, an immediate risk of accident for employees or attempted bribery of the auditors; and\n- \u00b7 Access  Denied : reported  when  the  audit  is  refused (for example in the event of refusal to provide partial or full site access to the auditors).\n\nIn the event  of  a  non-conformity  (Needs  Continuous Improvement,  Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero  Tolerance), corrective action plans must be implemented which are then audited at the level of the Subsidiary or Supplier.\n\nFailure to implement a corrective action plan can, in the case of  a  Subsidiary,  result  in  an  alert  being  sent  to  the  Country Manager. In addition, Subsidiaries can decide to link part or all of  the  remuneration  of  their  managers  and/or  of  their performance  evaluation  to  the  implementation  of  the Applicable Rules.\n\nIn  the  case  of  Suppliers,  serious  non-conformities  (Needs Immediate Action, Zero Tolerance and Access Denied) or the failure  to  implement  corrective  action  can  result  in  the non-listing of a new Supplier or the suspension or termination of commercial relations with a listed Supplier.\n\nIn the event that the existence of a serious non-conformity with the  Applicable  Rules  is  reported,  a  specific  audit  can  be initiated.  In  particular,  visit  reports  are  issued  as  part  of  the process  of  routine  visits  made  to  Suppliers.  They  can  result,  if necessary, in additional audits.\n\n## Specific EHS audits of subcontractors' sites\n\nAdditional  specific  EHS  audits  are  conducted  by  independent third  parties  for  subcontractor  sites  for  aerosol  production  or storage,  bleaching  powders,  flammable  products  under  the criteria defined by L'Or\u00e9al, which are similar to those used for the Group's  sites.  These  audits  are  triggered  at  the  time  of referencing/qualification, follow-up (audits conducted between 12  months  and  36  months  maximum  after  the  immediate improvement  request  (NIA),  depending  on  the  severity  of  the non-conformities found); and again at the time of confirmation, 5 years after the initial audit.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  are  the  same  type  as  those previously described: satisfactory, NCI, NIA and ZT.\n\nSerious  non-conformities  (Needs  Immediate  Action,  Zero Tolerance  and  Access  Denied)  or  the  failure  to  implement corrective actions can result in the non-listing of a new Supplier or  the  suspension  or  termination  of  commercial  relations  with a listed Supplier.\n\nAll the  main  non-conformities  found  are  monitored  and consolidated annually by risk type.\n\nIn the event that the existence of a serious non-conformity with the  Applicable  Rules  is  reported,  a  specific  audit  can  be initiated.  In  particular,  visit  reports  are  issued  as  part  of  the process  of  routine  visits  made  to  Suppliers.  They  can  result,  if necessary, in additional audits.",

        "page_content": "## Additional procedures\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also uses analyses and ratings provided by EcoVadis, an analytical company, to evaluate the policies implemented by the Suppliers, among others, in terms of the issues covered by  the  Vigilance  Plan.  This  evaluation  is  an  indicative  guide that can be added to the audits described above.\n\nBy participating in the EcoVadis assessment, L'Or\u00e9al compares its  environmental  and  social  policy  with  the  experts  and  the recommendations of external auditors qualified in the analysis of  multi-sector  risks.  This  is  a  useful  rating  for  the  continuous improvement of L'Or\u00e9al's programme, but it also contributes to  the  transparency  of  industry  practices.  This  assessment  is used  to  select  suppliers  by  taking  their  environmental  and social performance into consideration.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a co-founder of the Responsible Beauty Initiative (RBI),  a  sector  initiative  created  in  2017  with  EcoVadis  that brings  together seven major players in the cosmetics industry for  the sustainable transformation of the entire beauty supply chain.\n\n## (ii) Self-assessment system\n\n## Human Rights and fundamental freedoms\n\nAn annual ethics  reporting  system  enables  monitoring  of  the implementation  of  the  Applicable  Rules  in  the  Subsidiaries, namely  with  regard  to  Human  Rights  and  Fundamental Freedoms.\n\n## Environment, health and safety in the workplace\n\nThe  Management  Committees  of  L'Or\u00e9al  Sites  have  selfassessment  tools  for  their  practices  based  on  the  audit standards  provided  to  them,  which  enables  them  to implement  an  improvement  plan,  if  required.  These  selfassessments are input data in the EHS risk audits.\n\nTo direct its performance:\n\n- \u00b7 Every year, each Subsidiary site defines and revises its safety and environmental roadmaps to achieve the targets set by the Group. It tracks EHS indicators monthly.\n- \u00b7 At Group level, the indicators are consolidated monthly by region and globally for the Group's results.\n- \u00b7 A  Greenhouse  Gas  Assessment  is  prepared  annually (pursuant to the GHG Protocol).\n\n## 3.4.6. Whistleblowing mechanism and reporting system\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  'Speak  Up'  policy  enables  employees  and  external  stakeholders  to  report  serious  violations  of  Human  Rights  and fundamental freedoms, non-compliance of rules relating  to  the  health  and  safety  of  people  and  respect  for  the  environment, notably via a secure website (ethics whistleblowing channel) directly to the Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer.\n\n## 3.4.7. Update on the effective implementation of the Vigilance Plan\n\nThis section provides the 2021 results of the application of the Vigilance Plan for Subsidiaries and Suppliers.\n\n## 3.4.7.1. General results of whistleblowing mechanisms and reporting\n\nThe Group's ethics whistle-blowing line (www.lorealspeakup.com) was  opened  in  2008,  and  then  to  all  stakeholders  outside  the Group,  including  suppliers  and  subcontractors,  in  2018.  A  new procedure  to  collect  and  handle  reports  was  published.  In addition, employees can use several other channels to raise their concerns (hierarchical line, dedicated local lines, etc.).\n\nIn  2021,  there  were  379  reports  on  potential  non-compliance with the Applicable Rules, including:\n\n- \u00b7 16 on sexual harassment, 11 of which were proven, in whole or  in  part,  and  which  resulted  in  7  departures  from  the Group;\n- \u00b7 71 on bullying, 17 of which were proven, in whole or in part, and which resulted in 5 departures from the Group;\n- \u00b7 22 on discrimination, 2 of which were proven, in whole or in part, which did not result in a departure from the Group;\n- \u00b7 24 on health and safety, 4 of which were proven, in whole or  in  part,  which  resulted  in  2  departures  from  the  Group; and\n- \u00b7 none on environmental issues.\n\n## 3.4.7.2. Results of the application of the plan to Subsidiaries\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by the Subsidiaries\n\nThe  Applicable  Rules  are  incorporated  into  the  Group's Subsidiaries' internal rules.\n\n94%  of  employees  individually  acknowledged  the  receipt  of the Code of Ethics and 76% of employees have been trained using an e-learning training tool on ethics.\n\nEach EHS manager and each person working in a factory or distribution centre is trained in the Applicable Rules on Health, Safety  and  the  Environment  (EHS).  All  new  employees  are trained in the Rules on Health and Safety in the workplace and the Environment, regardless of their work location.\n\n3",

One audit  revealed  an  intern  working  nights,  a  point  that  had been corrected at the time of the follow-up audit.\n\nAs part of the annual ethics reporting in 2021, it was reported that:\n\n- \u00b7 16 employees were 16-18 years of age (1) ; and\n- \u00b7 0  employee  under  16  years  of  age  worked  in  the Subsidiaries\n- (ii) Forced labour : One audit revealed a case of employees of a  subcontractor  who  should  have  been  on  permanent contracts instead of fixed-term contracts, following successive fixed-term contracts. Another audit revealed that outsourced workers  were  on  fixed-term  employment  contracts  that  had expired, which had been corrected at the time of the followup audit.\n\nIn the annual ethics reporting, no subsidiary declared the use of labour in a prison environment.\n\n- (iii) Freedom of association : the audits did not reveal any cases of non-conformity. One audit revealed a case of a collective bargaining  document  that  had  not  been  sent  to  the competent public authorities due to the health crisis linked to Covid-19.\n- (iv) Non-discrimination : the audits did not reveal any cases of non-conformity.\n- (v) Working hours :  one audit revealed insufficient rest time at one site and two audits revealed working hours in excess of 60 hours per week.\n- (vi) Salaries  and  costs :  one  audit  revealed  an  error  in  the calculation  of  mandatory  social  security  contributions  and  a delay of more than one month in salaries being paid. Another audit  revealed  a  case  in  which  outsourced  workers  had  not been paid enough for overtime they had worked, which had been corrected at the time of the follow-up audit.\n\n(vii) Sexual and psychological harassment :  the  audits did not reveal any cases of non-conformity.\n\n(viii) Health and  safety : one  audit revealed irregular evacuation and fire safety exercises as well as missing health and safety registration documents.\n\n## Monitoring and control system in respect of Health, Safety and the Environment\n\nIn 2021,  83  'Top  managers'  (managers  of  factories  or distribution centres, Management Committee members, etc.) attended the Leadership & Safety Culture seminar, held at the CEDEP,  The  European  Centre  for  Executive  Development,  at the  INSEAD  campus  in  France.  Since  the  start  of  this programme,  669 senior  managers  have  been  trained.  The main objectives of these seminars are to raise awareness with top  managers  about  safety  issues,  increase  their  leadership ability  and  see  these  behaviours  adopted  and  maintained over the long term.\n\n34  factories  are  certified  ISO  45001,  representing  87%  of  the Group's factories.\n\n34  plants  are  certified  ISO  14001,  representing  87%  of  the Group's plants.\n\nIn 2021, in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis:\n\n- \u00b7 2 risk audits were performed on site;\n- \u00b7 2 combined risk and EHS culture audits were performed on site; and\n- \u00b7 2  combined  Quality,  Environment,  Health,  Safety  and Performance audits were performed on site.\n\nThe  most  frequently  identified  risks  during  EHS  risk  audits  are related  to  fire protection,  procedure  safety,  hazardous energies,  containment  of  fire  water  runoff  and  wastewater management. The cases of non-conformity and formal notice were systematically subject to corrective actions.\n\nThere  were  two  neighbourhood  complaints  in  2021:  one factory  was  the  subject  of  a  complaint  about  the  release  of an unpleasant odour related to wastewater being discharged from the site, and an administrative site was the subject of a complaint about the municipal storm water system overflowing  during  periods  of  heavy  rain.  This  system  passes through the site and, after a study conducted by the Syndicat Intercommunal  d'Am\u00e9nagement  Hydraulique  (the  French inter-district planning  authority),  the  under-sizing  of  the municipal system was identified as the most likely cause.\n\nThere  were  4  cases  of  non-conformity  with  environmental regulations notified by an administrative authority in 2021. They cover three sites and relate to the quality of wastewater (one site) and to the need to adapt some of the technical facilities (two sites).\n\nOne fine was imposed in 2021 (China) amounting to RMB 190,000 (approximately  \u20ac27,000):  this is linked to non-compliance regarding the quality of effluent discharged from the site.\n\n## 3.4.7.3. Results of the application of the plan to suppliers\n\n## Adoption of the Applicable Rules by Suppliers\n\n100%  of  strategic  Suppliers  in  the  direct  purchases  category and  78%  of  strategic  Suppliers  in  the  indirect  purchases category  have  made  a  contractual  commitment  to  comply with the Applicable Rules.\n\nAll  purchasers  know  the  Applicable  Rules  and  know  which people to contact in the event of doubts.\n\nIn 2021, 145 newly recruited purchasers in the Group received in-depth training in responsible purchases.\n\n## Monitoring and control system\n\nThe  Applicable  Rules  are  controlled  through  external  audits. These  audits  cover  questions  on  Human  Rights  as  well  as Environment, Health and Safety and cover all activities of the audited Site without being limited to the parts of the Site that operate for L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n1,236 on-site audits were conducted in 2021, as part of regular audits, but also ad hoc audits following a risk analysis (40 ad hoc  audits  in  2021) (2) .  Thus,  98%  of  Supplier  production  sites requiring audits were audited at least once.",

        "page_content": "The cases of non-conformity noted during these social audits that come under the Vigilance Plan are described below.\n\nIn  2021,  767  suppliers  conducted  an  Ecovadis  assessment  of their social, environmental and ethical policies, as well as the implementation of those policies by their own suppliers in 2021. 331  of  them  represented  89%  of  the  Group's  strategic suppliers, all areas combined.\n\n## In terms of Human Rights\n\n## Results of audits by topic\n\n## (i) Child labour : 1.8% non-compliance.\n\n2 audits identified employment of a child under the age of 16. The necessary measures have been taken to discontinue any commercial  relationship  with  the  companies  concerned. Demands  have  been  made  for  the  children  to  be  sent  to school. Other cases of non-conformity were found in the area of  'Child  Labour',  particularly  concerning  the  absence  of procedures to verify age at the time of hiring by the Supplier, and  the  absence  of  copies  of  identity  documents.  The Suppliers concerned have been asked to correct this situation, and follow-up audits are planned.\n\n## (ii) Forced labour : 6.7% of non-compliances \u2611 .\n\nOne  audit  found  employees  who  are  bonded  or  under contract  either  with  the  company  itself  or  with  a  broker.  The necessary  measures  have  been  taken  to  discontinue  any commercial relationship with the companies concerned. Other cases of non-conformity concern the demand for a monetary deposit at the time of hiring, withholding of identity documents without  a  legal  requirement,  as  well  as  the  freedom  for employees  to  end  their  contracts  without  being  penalised (financially  or  other)  except  for  those  stipulated  by  social legislation.  The  main  corrective  measures  requested  were  the return of the identity documents and the updating of employee contracts. Follow-up audits will check the effective implementation of these corrective measures.\n\n## (iii) Freedom of association (1) : 2.1% non-compliance \u2611 .\n\nMost  of  the  cases  of  non-conformity  concern  the  failure  to freely  elect  employee  representatives  without  management interference.  Elections  must  be  carried  out,  or  in  countries where such elections are not legal, employee meetings must be organised to report items to be improved.\n\n## (iv) Non-discrimination : 1.1% of non-compliances \u2611 .\n\nThese cases of non-conformity mainly concern the absence of a  clear  and  uniform  policy  to  ensure  the  absence  of discrimination at recruitment or discrimination in the payment of wages and other costs.\n\nSuppliers  were  requested  to  implement  such  policies,  which will be checked in future audits.\n\n- (v) Working hours : 24% of non-compliances \u2611 .\n\nCases  of  non-conformity  involved  failure  to  comply  with  the Applicable Rules for work time and regular days off, but also the lack of sufficient documents to ensure correct monitoring of the Applicable Rules. In all of these cases, action plans are implemented and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\n## (vi) Wages and charges : 19% of non-compliances \u2611 .\n\nThe audits did not find undue salary withholding or charges.\n\nMost  of  the  cases  of  non-conformity  concerned  insurance  and social  contributions  as  well  as  a  failure  to  monitor  payments  of wages.  When  an  audit  notes  a  case  of  non-compliance  with regard to the correct settlement of wages, social benefits or the correct payment of overtime, even though these are not undue salary  deductions,  the  Suppliers  are  requested  to  correct  the situation and a follow-up audit is planned.\n\n## (vi) Sexual harassment and bullying : 2.4% non-compliance.\n\nMost  of  these  cases  of  non-conformity  concerned  the absence of a written policy prohibiting sexual harassment and bullying  or  the  absence  of  an  internal  system  allowing  the situation  to  be  reported  without  negative  consequences  for the employee concerned.\n\nSuppliers were requested to draft these policies, which will be checked in future audits.\n\nThe  other  cases  of  non-conformity  did  not  concern  serious breaches of the Applicable Rules.\n\n## Health, Safety and the Environment\n\n41%  of  the  cases  of  non-compliance  concerned  the applicable rules on Health, Safety and the Environment.\n\nMost of these cases concerned (i) the absence of fire safety certification, (ii) the lack of training in emergency evacuation, extinguisher  handling  or  the  use  of  protection  equipment,  or (iii) access to running water flows in all spaces exposed to the use of solvents, corrosive products or other chemical risks.\n\nThe missing certifications  were  obtained  from  approved  third parties,  and  the  training  in  emergency  evacuation  and extinguisher handling were  implemented  as  the  main corrective measures. Likewise, renovations to adjust the water points were carried out by the Suppliers.\n\n## Sustainable sourcing of raw materials\n\nIn  2021,  100%  of  the  renewable  raw  materials  used  by  the Group were reassessed on the basis of criteria such as respect for biodiversity and forced labour. Out of the 313 plant species that  are  the  source  of  the  renewable  raw  materials  used  by the Group,  around  6% (2) present  significant biodiversity challenges  (endangered  species,  impact  of  production  on natural  environments)  depending  on  their  geographic  origin and  the  method  of  extraction  or  production  used.  They  are the subject of specific action plans initiated with suppliers and, if necessary, benefit from the systematic support of independent  external  third  parties,  in  order  to  manage  the real impacts on the territories of origin of the ingredients.\n\n3",

Definitions and general framework\n\nRisk  management  (events  or  situations,  the  occurrence  of which  is  uncertain,  could  have  a  financial,  non-financial,  or reputational impact) is a process that applies to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group').\n\nRisk management  consists  of  identifying,  assessing  and controlling  risks  that  may  affect  the  smooth  running  of  the Company. It also participates in the Group's development by promoting the good use of resources to minimise the impact of negative events and maximise the realisation of opportunities.\n\n## 3.5.2. Risk mapping\n\nThe Group's risk mapping process is led by the Ethics, Risks and Compliance  Department  with  the  support  of  all  Support Divisions  and  Business  lines.  This  mapping  is  reviewed  by  the Group's Executive Committee, which validates it.\n\n## 3.5.3. Risk factors\n\nThe  Group  operates  in  a  changing  environment.  Like  any company, it is necessarily exposed to risks which, if they were to  materialise,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  its  business activities,  its  financial  position  and  its  assets,  particularly  in terms of reputation and image.\n\nFor taking an informed investment decision, as required by the regulations  in  force,  this  section  presents  the  major  risks  in  a limited  number  of  categories  (given  the  probability  of  their occurrence  and  the  expected  magnitude  of  their  negative impact)  taking  risk  management  policies  into  account.  In\n\nIn order to ensure the sustainability of its development and the achievement of its objectives, the Group strives to anticipate and  manage  the  risks  to  which  it  is  exposed  in  its  different areas of activity. In addition, the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors  specify  the  role  played  by  the  Audit  Committee which 'must ensure that General Management has the means to enable it to identify and manage the economic, financial, non-financial,  and  legal  risks  facing  the  Group  inside  and outside  France  in  carrying  out  its  normal  or  exceptional operations'.\n\nOn the basis of the work by the Internal Audit Department, the analysis of major risks, in conjunction with the processes used by  subsidiaries,  makes  it  possible  to  identify  Internal  Control improvements and update the Group's standards.\n\nThe  risk  mapping  for  all  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities  is  updated annually. This process to identify, analyse and assess significant risks strengthens  Group  actions  and  allows  them  to  be prioritised.  The  results  of  this  work  are  presented  to  the  Audit Committee. The main risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.\n\neach category, the most material risks are mentioned first. This section specifies the way in which each risk factor could affect L'Or\u00e9al as well as the management policy implemented.\n\nRisk management work classifies the residual risks by category of importance (low, moderate or significant).\n\nHowever, a wholly risk-free environment cannot be guaranteed. Moreover,  the  Group  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  other risks  of  which  it  is  not  currently  aware  or  which  it  does  not consider material at the date of this Document.",

Business risks\n\n## Business risks/Sanitary crisis\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nBecause of its global presence, L'Or\u00e9al is exposed to epidemics or other public sanitary crises in the 80 countries in which it operates.\n\nThe  primary  risks  identified  cover  different  segments  of  the  Group's operations:\n\n- \u25cf impairment  of  the  health,  safety  and  security  of  employees  in  the context of their duties and their business travel, and confinement of the population that prevents employees from entering their work site, particularly at the manufacturing and distribution sites;\n- \u25cf difficulties  for  the  Company  to  operate  normally  because  of  the restrictive  measures  established  by  the  authorities,  which  restrict employee  access  to  the  Group's  sites,  or  as  a  result  of  the unavailability  of  individual  protective  equipment  necessary  to protect them;\n- \u25cf supply difficulties,  unavailability  or  increased  prices  of  raw  materials and components, and limited capacities to produce and distribute products related to the restrictive health measures established by the authorities of the country in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf reductions in product demand related to the impact of the measures to restrict movement on access to physical points of sale, particularly in  the  Travel  Retail  network  that  is  particularly  sensitive  to  sanitary crises;\n- \u25cf financial  difficulties  for  suppliers  and  clients  as  a  result  of  a  drastic reduction in their levels of business.\n\nThus 2021 was marked by the impacts of the Covid-19 health crisis that has spread around the world and has affected a number of geographic zones in which the Group operates.\n\nDepending  on  its  duration,  geographic  expansion  and  the  resulting economic  and  social  consequences,  a  sanitary  crisis  may  have  a material  impact  on  the  Group's  activities,  its  performance  and  its reputation.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set up a crisis management process led by a unit at Group level that can prevent and limit the impacts of undesirable events on all its entities.\n\nFacing a sanitary crisis, the Group's priority is to protect the health, safety and security of its employees. The Group responds through compliance with the directives of the authorities in the countries in which it operates, the  application  and  adaptation  of  its  worldwide,  high  management standards  for  health  and  safety  at  its  operational  sites  and  in  business travel situations.\n\nThe  Group's  information  systems  allow  large-scale  development  of flexible  and  remote  work  methods  and  are  the  subject  of  adequate safety protection processes (see section 4.3.2.4. 'Creating conditions for a stimulating and attractive work environment' of this document).\n\nThe policies to manage supply chain and inventories, and the business continuity  plans  of  the  industrial  and  logistics  sites,  allow  the  Group  to anticipate  the  actions  necessary  to  manage  disturbances.  The long-term  relations  with  the  Group's  strategic  suppliers,  the  policies  to diversify  sources,  and  operational  continuity  plans  limit  the  impacts  of these crises.\n\nThe Group's presence in all distribution channels, particularly online sales capacities developed with diversified partners (owned sites, e-retailers, pure  players),  as  well  as  its  expertise  in  digitised  consumer  relations, help to maximise development opportunities in disturbed contexts.\n\nFinally,  the  Group's  worldwide  and  balanced  presence  in  terms  of geographic  areas,  product  categories  and  distribution  channels,  the very  high  responsiveness  and  capacity  for  adaptation  of  its  teams through  its  strategically  concentrated  and  operationally  decentralised organisational model, as well as its robust financial position, contribute to its ability to face the economic consequences of these crises.\n\n3",

Furthermore,  in  order  to adapt  to  the  development  of  new  methods  of  communication  and collaboration, L'Or\u00e9al has introduced an Information and Communication Technologies Code of Practice. To address the growing threat  of  cybercrime,  L'Or\u00e9al  takes  continuous  steps  to  strengthen  the resources dedicated to information system security.\n\nThis plan relies in particular on anti-intrusion equipment, regular intrusion tests, an information system security audit programme, the protection of sensitive  equipment  and  global  supervision  to  identify  irregularities. L'Or\u00e9al's security focus is constantly adjusted to deal with new threats of cyberattacks.  For  example,  the  Group  is  increasingly  investing  in incidents  detection  and  reactions  systems  and  proceeds  to  regular reviews of the effectiveness of these solutions.\n\nIn addition, in order to mobilise all teams, the Group conducts a global awareness  campaign  every  year.  Online  training  in  best  cybersecurity practices is available for all employees. As at 31 December 2021, 82% of employees had validated this e-learning programme.\n\nManagement  of  risks  related  to  data  is  described  in  the  'Data'  risk section.\n\n## Business risks/Geographic presence and economic and political environment\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is a global corporation that has subsidiaries in 73 countries. More specifically,  the  global  development  of  the  cosmetics  market  has  led L'Or\u00e9al  to  develop  its  Travel  Retail  business  as  well  as  its  business  in countries  of  North  Asia,  which  represented  30.5%  of  sales  in  2021, SAPMENA-SSA (South Asia Pacific, Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa) 7.2% of sales, and Latin America 5.5% of sales.\n\nBecause of this globalisation, political or economic disturbances (strong economic slowdown due to e.g. geopolitical tensions or a health crisis, international trade tensions, sovereign debt crises) in countries in which the  Group  generates  a  significant  portion  of  its  sales  could  have  an impact on its business activities.\n\nThe  impact  and  management  of  the  risk  related  to  Covid-19  are described in the 'Sanitary crisis' risk factor.\n\n## Business risks/Crisis management\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nPrejudicial events or information mainly related to the use or misuse of a product,  or  an  inappropriate  individual  behaviour,  whether  proven  or not,  could  affect  the  reputation  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  its  35  major  international brands  and  its  products  and,  as  a  result,  affect  sales  and,  more generally, its financial position.\n\nThe impact of the risk could be amplified, notably, by:\n\n- \u25cf the explosion of digital and social media all around the world;\n- \u25cf the emergence of social beauty, which is connected and shared;\n- \u25cf the role of influencers as opinion leaders with a significant community of subscribers; and\n- \u25cf societal movements and enquiries by  thecivil society, consumers, etc. to the Group or the brands.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has set up a system of:\n\n- \u25cf training  sessions  in  crisis  communication  and  support  for  the communication teams on key issues for the Group;\n- \u25cf crisis risk management at corporate and local levels;\n- \u25cf permanent online monitoring system in English, French and Chinese. The subsidiaries deploy their own social media and web monitoring systems  under  the  responsibility  of  their  Director  of  Communication and immediately report a media risk in their country to the Corporate Communications Department; and\n- \u25cf L'Or\u00e9al  has  also  set  up  a  crisis  management  procedure  which  is tasked with preventing, managing and mitigating the consequences of undesirable events on the Company across the globe. The Group crisis management officer reports directly to General Management.\n\nThe  deployment  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  throughout  the  Group  aims  at reinforcing  the  dissemination  of  the  rules  of  conduct  which  form  the basis  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  integrity  and  ethics.  These  rules  of  conduct  seek  to guide  actions  and  behaviour,  inspire  choices  and  make  sure  that  the Group's values are reflected in the everyday acts of each employee. L'Or\u00e9al has also implemented a 'Code of Good Practice for the Use of Social Media' for its employees.\n\nOn its website, the Group has published the 'Influencer Value Charter' which  each  influencer  with  whom  L'Or\u00e9al  collaborates  agrees  to respect. The Group's principles and operational processes to be applied for partnerships with influencers, have been disseminated worldwide to the collaborators concerned.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  global  presence  and  its  portfolio  of  35  major  international brands helps to maintain a balance in sales and offsetting between the geographic zones, product categories and distribution channels (details on  sales  from  the  zones  are  presented  in  section  1.3.  '2021  Financial results and  corporate  social  responsibility commitments'  of  this document).",

In  particular,  the  European  General  Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016, which entered into force  on  25  May  2018,  (GDPR)  provides  for  major  sanctions  in  Europe, as does the CCPA in California, the LGPD in Brazil or the PIPL in China and the POPI Act in South Africa.\n\nAny  breach  of  data  integrity  or  confidentiality,  notably  personal  data processed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  or  its  partners,  for  exogenous  or  endogenous reasons  (including  intrusions,  malicious  acts,  etc.)  could  have  a significant impact on its reputation and consumer confidence and thus on the Group's business activities.\n\n## Business risks/Market and innovation\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  subject  to  constant  pressure  from  many  competitors  in  all countries due to:\n\n- \u25cf its  size  and  the  positioning  of  its  brands  in  various  markets  in  which major international groups operate;\n- \u25cf local brands and new players coming from the digital economy;\n- \u25cf rapid technological changes in emerging fields of research by new operators.\n\nIf  the  Group  fails  to  anticipate  or  respond  to  changes  in  consumer expectations,  especially  in  the  areas  of  natural  beauty,  health, personalised services, connected things and environmental commitments, with innovative and adapted product offerings, its sales and growth could be affected.\n\nThe  Group  continually  adapts  its  innovation  model  and  is  constantly increasing  its  investments  in  research  and  digital  services.  L'Or\u00e9al's research  teams  innovate  to  respond  to  the  infinite  diversity  of  beauty aspirations  all  over  the  world.  The  Consumer  &  Market  Insights Department within the Innovation Department is constantly monitoring changes  in  consumer  expectations  by  product  category  and  major regions of the world.\n\nAll of these research programmes, which are part of a long-term vision, allow  L'Or\u00e9al  to  meet  the  challenges  of  innovation  (see  section  1.2.6. 'The bet on Research, Safety and Innovation' of this document).\n\nThe  Digital  General  Management  is  responsible  for  accelerating  the Group's  digital  transformation  by  helping  the  brands  create  enriched spaces for expression and helping teams to establish more interactive, close-knit and bespoke relationships with consumers.\n\nConsumer expectations with regard to sustainability are also at the heart of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  (see  Chapter  4  of  this document)  and  are  taken  into  account  in  developing  the  Group's brand and product portfolio.\n\nFinally,  the  Group's  acquisition  strategy  always  takes  into  account changes in the competitive environment.\n\nThe  Group  constantly  and  progressively  deploys  policies,  training  and data management tools as well as the associated organisational  and technical measures. The Global IT Department has introduced strict rules with  about  data  security  (back-up,  protection  of,  and  access  to confidential data).\n\nThe Group's principles governing the processing of personal data have been  rolled-out  all  over  the  world  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all employees about respect for ethical principles, and legal and regulatory requirements in the matter.\n\nAn  organisation  has  been  set  up  based  on  a  Global  Data  Privacy Department at Group level, comprising a legal unit and a programme unit.  A  Group  Data  Protection  Officer  was  appointed  in  2018  and  a network of 46 Country DPOs has been created, for all countries in the European zone and gradually in other regions of the world.\n\nThe governance set up is based on a Global Governance Committee, a Steering Committee by region, as well as a network of Heads of Data Privacy  within  the M\u00e9tiers and  Zones,  responsible  for  the  protection  of personal  data,  which  provide  support  to  all  operational  stakeholders involved.\n\nThis  governance notably aims to monitor the Group's compliance with different  laws,  by  ensuring  the  mobilisation  of  all  stakeholders  and  by adapting customer, supplier and business line processes to the Group's rules and to applicable laws.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n3",

In  addition,  civil  society  is  expressing  higher  expectations  with  regard companies'  integrity  and  transparency  and  the  way  in  which  they manage scientific and technological innovations. Such non-compliance with its commitments or the lack of a response to new ethical questions could have an adverse impact on the Group's reputation and expose it to criminal or administrative sanctions.\n\n## Business risks/Sales distribution networks\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nTo sell its products, L'Or\u00e9al uses independent distribution channels, and may  develop  direct  distribution  to  the  consumer  for  certain  brands (branded  retail  and  e-commerce).  The  concentration  of  the  Group's large customers, the restructuring, disappearance or temporary closure of  physical  supply  chains,  and  changes  in  selective  distribution  could impact  the  development  of  the  Group's  brands  in  the  country  or countries involved.\n\nThe presence of the Group's brands in all types of distribution channels allows  the  Group  to  offer  its  products  and  services,  whatever  the consumer practices.  The  departments  concerned  anticipate  trends  to adapt  to  these  changes  and,  in  particular,  have  steadily  developed online  sales  with  diversified  partners  (e-distributors,  pure  players,  and market places).\n\n## Business risks/Risks related to Human Resources\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nOne of the keys to L'Or\u00e9al's success lies in the talent of its employees to ensure its growth. This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is changing within a complex,  highly  competitive  and  rapidly  changing  environment (globalisation, diversity and inclusion challenges, sustainable development  issues,  acceleration  of  the  digital  transformation,  etc.) that  requires  specific  expertise.  The  labour  market  is  marked  by  major changes  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  particularly  the  hybrid organisation  mode  with  both  in-person  and  remote.  If  L'Or\u00e9al  fails  to identify,  attract,  retain  and  train  competent  and  engaged  employees who behave responsibly, the development of its activities and its results could be affected.\n\nMoreover,  given  L'Or\u00e9al's  activities,  particularly  its  industrial  operations, the risk of occupational injuries or illnesses could become a reality.\n\nThe  Group  is  developing  a  motivating,  professional  environment  with respect for its ethical values, particularly diversity.\n\nThe  recruitment  and  development  of  employees  occurs  within  a long-term  perspective,  also  to  ensure  the  continuity  of  key  functions within  the  Group,  in  which  training  plays  a  core  role  throughout  an employee's career.\n\nThe remuneration policy combines external competitiveness and internal fairness. It recognises both individual and collective performance.\n\nThe global Share & Care programme meets the essential needs of each of the Group's employees in terms of benefits, healthcare, parenthood, flexibility  and  quality  of  life  at  work.  Actions  for  stress  prevention  and workstation ergonomics are organised.\n\nIn  order  to  meet  employees'  expectations  in  this  new  hybrid  working environment, L'Or\u00e9al has developed a balanced Group policy to ensure that opportunities for cooperation, discussion and creativity are always prioritised.\n\nThe  Group  has  set  ambitious  goals  for  the  health  and  safety  of  its employees, defining high standards that often exceed legal obligations and  involve  personnel  at  all  levels.  Prevention  is  based  on  the  GHAP (Global  Hazard  Assessment  Procedure)  and  SHAP  (Safety  Hazard Assessment  Procedure)  programmes,  which  identify  the  dangers, generally  and  for  each  workstation,  assess  the  risks  and  allow  the implementation of the necessary means of control (see section 4.3.2.1 'Preserving employee health and safety' of this document).\n\nThe  Group's  policies  on  sustainable  development,  social  and  societal responsibility,  compliance  and  philanthropy  are  based  on  the  Ethical Principles. The role and the resources granted to the Chief Ethics Officer allow  him  to  succeed  in  his  mission  by  relying  on  all  the  teams  and resources of the Group  (see  section  3.2.1. 'Organisation and environment'  of  this  document).  Specific  training  of  management teams,  regular  dialogue  with  stakeholders  and  the  establishment  of internal  working  groups  facilitate  the  inclusion  of  Ethics  in  the  Group's new policies and strategic decisions. The ethical risks are mapped and regularly updated, including for suppliers and subcontractors (see  section  3.4.5.2.  'Monitoring  compliance  with  the  Plan'  of  this document).  The  deployment  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  throughout  the Group,  mandatory  e-learning  training  and  ongoing  communication campaigns via an Ethics Day, ensure that employees are aware of the ethical  standards.  A  network  of  77  Ethics  Correspondents  around  the world and regular meetings of the Chief Ethics Officer with the Countries ensures  close  contact  with  these  employees.  Regular  audits  of  the Group's sites and those of its suppliers and subcontractors (see section 3.4. 'Vigilance Plan' of this document), the Group's whistleblowing line (www.lorealspeakup.com)opened  in  2018  accessible  to  all  Group stakeholders, as well as a procedure to collect and process reports to manage any violations.",

The  direct  and  indirect  consequences  of  these  risks may adversely affect people and the assets of the Group (tangible and intangible).\n\nIn  order  to  permanently  protect  these  resources  (or  Group  assets) against malicious acts, the Security Department helps in the preventive implementation of technical, HR and operational procedures to limit the residual risk of malicious damage and support the Group's international development in all  countries  concerned.  For  this  purpose,  the  Security Department:\n\n- \u25cf has implemented a watch and evaluation of the state of security in the countries in which the Group is active;\n- \u25cf conducts evaluation updates in the countries in which it is present;\n- \u25cf creates country security sheets for international travellers;\n- \u25cf defines  the  security  standards  and  minimum  protection  to  be implemented to protect the Group's activities; and\n- \u25cf coordinates, with related key players, the security crisis management procedure  which  is  tasked  with  preventing,  managing  and  limiting the consequences of undesirable events on the Group.\n\nThe security measures are regularly adjusted and reassessed based on the local situation and the level of exposure of employees and sites.\n\nConsumer  safety  is  an  absolute  priority  for  L'Or\u00e9al:  assessing  safety  is central  to  any  new  product  development  process  and  a  prerequisite before any new product can be brought to the market. The principles governing the Group's quality and safety policy are:\n\n- \u25cf satisfaction of customer needs;\n- \u25cf compliance with safety requirements and laws;\n- \u25cf the  maintenance  of  standards  and  regular  updates  of  safety assessment approaches; and\n- \u25cf product quality and conformity across the supply chain.\n\nThe Worldwide Safety Evaluation Department specifically evaluates the safety  of  raw  materials  and  finished  products.  It  establishes  the toxicological  profile  of  the  ingredients  used  and  the  tolerance  of  the formulas  before  they  are  launched  on  the  market.  The  same  safety standards are applied worldwide to ensure identical quality across the globe.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  goes  one  step  further  in  safety  assessments  by  monitoring  the potential  adverse  effects  that  may  arise  once  the  product  is  on  the market  through  its  international  cosmeto-vigilance  network  in  order  to take  the  appropriate  corrective  measures  if  necessary  (see  'Product quality and safety: a priority' in section 4.3.1.3.2.).\n\nIn  terms  of  questions  that  civil  society  may  ask  regarding  certain substances and their effects on health and the environment, L'Or\u00e9al's position can be summarised in three points:\n\n- \u25cf vigilance with regard to any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u25cf cooperation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u25cf precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  relies  on  its  scientific  teams  to  answer  consumers'  questions about the safety of its products, primarily through its Inside our Products platform that has been online since 2019.\n\nFinally, production quality standards define rules governing the quality of products,  for  all  stages  from  creation  to  production  and  distribution. Almost all factories are ISO 9001 certified for their production and follow the  Best  Manufacturing  Practices  in  accordance  with  the  ISO  22716 standard. In the case of production subcontracting, the rules governing the  choice  of  the  subcontractor  and  its  production  follow  the  same principles. The subcontracting quality charter picks up these requirements, compliance with which is assessed during audits and the plan  regularly  strengthened  to  ensure  appropriate  control  of  our partners.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n3",

Industrial and environmental risks\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks/Product availability\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nIn  the  context  of  a  globalised  supply  chain  and  the  increased geographic  concentration  of  certain  supply  sources,  the  failure  of  an external supplier to deliver raw materials, filling and  packing components  or  finished  products,  whether  resulting  from  operational difficulties  or  significant  non-compliance  with  ethical  commitments, along with a major interruption of operations in a L'Or\u00e9al industrial unit or shipping  hub,  could  impact  the  Group's  sales  because  of  the unavailability of products that could result from this.\n\nIn 2021, Group purchases related to production totalled \u20ac5.01 billion.\n\n## Industrial and environmental risks/Climate change\n\n## Risk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nAs for any company, the Group's activities are exposed to the physical and transition risks related to climate change.\n\nThe increase in risks of natural origin, both extreme and chronic, the loss of  biodiversity,  and  the  increased  pressure  on  water  resources  could impact  the  availability  of  finished  products  by  disturbing  the  Group's operations  and  supply  chain.  The  scarcity  of  resources  and  the implementation of the transition towards a low-carbon economy could also increase production costs.\n\nIn  addition,  insufficient  consideration  of  these  impacts  related  to  the usage  phase  during  product  design  could  represent  a  risk  for  sales  in certain  areas  of  the  world  affected  by  water  stress  or  the  lack  of adapted infrastructures to collect and treat waste and wastewater.\n\nLastly,  consumer  choices  could  be  increasingly  influenced  by  the impact  associated  with  the  use  of  a  product  (its  carbon  footprint,  its water  footprint,  its  impact  on  biodiversity)  and  by  the  Group's  overall environmental performance.\n\nAs a result, if the Group did not sufficiently anticipate all these impacts and did not initiate a voluntary process to adapt to climate change, its financial performance and reputation could be impacted.\n\nTaking into environmental challenges into account, particularly efforts to combat climate change, is an integral part of L'Or\u00e9al's business model.\n\nCapitalising on its previous achievements, the Group has announced a second generation of particularly ambitious and specific objectives for 2030 as part of its new sustainable development programme, 'L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future',  announced  in  June  2020.  These  objectives  cover  all impacts  associated  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  value  chain  in  order  to  reduce  the impact  not  only  of  its  production  and  distribution  sites,  but  also  of  its supply chains, as well as the impacts associated with the use of products by consumers (see Chapter 4 of this document, including in particular the information published in the Non-Financial Performance Statement, which includes recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)).\n\nThe  Group  has  defined  its  climate  objectives  in  accordance  with  the Science-Based  Targets  (SBT)  approach,  which  encourages  companies to commit voluntarily to a transition towards a low carbon economy and to  set  objectives  that  correspond  to  what  the  latest  scientific  climate data considers necessary to track the +1.5\u00b0C trajectory for 2050. These commitments were validated from 2017 by the SBT initiative:\n\n- \u25cf from  2025,  all  its  industrial,  administrative  and  research  sites  will  be carbon neutral;\n- \u25cf by 2030, the Group will have reduced all its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in absolute value compared to 2016 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3); and\n- \u25cf as  a  signatory  of  the  Business  Ambition  for  1.5\u00b0C  call  to  action, L'Or\u00e9al  has  made  a  commitment  to  reach  net  zero  emissions  by 2050.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  also  announced  that  by  2030  all  water  used  in  the  Group's industrial processes would be recycled and reused in a loop on its sites. Deployment of the necessary equipment will be prioritised according to the  water  situation  of  the  drainage  basins  in  which  L'Or\u00e9al  operates. Management of potential consequences of extreme events is described in the section on 'product availability' risk.\n\nIn addition, by relying on recent scientific developments, particularly in the  area  of  biotechnology,  the  Group  also  initiated  a  Green  Sciences programme to drive change in its portfolio of raw materials through the development of ingredients with a favourable environmental profile, by minimising the environmental impacts linked to the cultivation of plants that  are  the  source  of  these  ingredients  (deforestation,  soil  depletion, and consequences for biodiversity, for example), and by relying on ecofriendly transformation procedures that prevent upstream pollution.\n\nTo  inform  its  consumers  and  enable  them  to  make  more  sustainable consumer  choices,  the  Group  is  developing  an  environmental  and social display system for its products, with a rating ranging from A to E, which takes into account 14 factors of impact for the planet, including greenhouse gas emissions. This display is communicated for hair and skin care  by  the  Garnier  brand  in  several  European  countries.  It  is  now extended  to  skin  care  for  the  La  Roche  Posay,  Vichy  and  Biotherm brands in France and will be gradually rolled out in new markets and in new categories.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al regularly revises its inventory policies, reserves capacities with its suppliers  and  negotiates  long-term  contracts.  Likewise,  there  are business continuity plans for each operational site. The Group is currently deploying  a  single  methodology  of  business  continuity  plans  at  all  its factories and distribution centres. These plans aim to anticipate supply chain disruption and ensure a timely business continuity.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also looks for alternative sourcing of its raw materials, duplicates packaging  moulds  for  its  strategic  products,  implements  operational continuity plans with its suppliers and reviews, if required, the design of its formulas and finished products.\n\nThe  main  suppliers  and  subcontractors  are  asked  to  comply  with  the Letter of Mutual Ethical Commitment, which covers, in particular, Human Rights, working conditions, environmental protection and integrity.",

If  such  events  should  occur,  their  impact  could  be  of  a  financial, operational and/or reputational nature.\n\n## 3.5.3.3. Legal and regulatory risks\n\n## Legal and regulatory risks/Non-conformity\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nMany general  and  specific  laws  and  regulations  apply  to  the  L'Or\u00e9al Group, such as the European REACH and CLP (Classification, Labelling, Packaging)  regulations  intended  to  strengthen  the  human  and environmental  safety  of  chemical  products,  the  European  Cosmetics Directive governing  animal  testing  of  ingredients,  legislation  on competition law, the control of international  flows  and  corruption.  The diversity  and  constant  reinforcement  of  the  regulatory  environment expose the Group to a risk of non-conformity or increased compliance costs.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  could  be  exposed  to  a  failure  or  an  act  of  fraud  (particularly payment  methods),  which  could  have  an  impact  on  the  reputation, operations and results of the Group. Finally, in the ordinary course of its business,  the  Group  will  potentially  be  involved  in  all  types  of  legal actions and may be subject to tax, customs and administrative audits.\n\nThe Group's Legal Charter reaffirms the obligation to comply with local legislation and, in particular, sets out the internal principles for signatures, the  general  and  specific  rules  relating  to  contracts,  trademark  law, intellectual  property  law,  company  law,  competition  law,  embargoes and  economic  sanctions  and  the  protection  of  personal  data. The Group has put in place rules on the terms of delivery and transport of  its  goods,  with  the  aim  of  ensuring  the  control  and  compliance  of formalities in terms of customs imports and exports. In addition, training on  customs  fundamentals  is  provided  to  all  employees  concerned. Furthermore,  the  Group's  Legal  Department  has  set  up  a  training programme on competition law for the employees concerned. L'Or\u00e9al is involved in an ongoing dialogue with national or regional authorities in charge  of  specifically  regulating  products  in  its  sector  through  the professional associations to which it belongs.\n\nWith regard to the REACH and CLP regulations, L'Or\u00e9al communicates proactively  with  its  European  suppliers  in  order  to  ensure  a  continuing supply of compliant raw materials.\n\nAn action plan has been drawn up at L'Or\u00e9al in order to improve the design and methods used to assess the safety of raw materials. It led to the end of testing finished products on animals in 1989 (14 years before it became  a  legal  obligation  in  Europe)  and  the  development  of predictive evaluation strategies to meet European regulations.\n\nThe  components of the Internal Control and Risk Management system implemented  are  detailed  in  this  Chapter.  In  the  areas  of  fraud  and corruption, the deployment to all Group subsidiaries of programmes to prevent  corruption  and  raise  awareness  of  the  fraud  risk  (see  section 4.3.4. 'Policy to prevent corruption' of this document) contribute to the management of these risks.\n\nThe  Company  has  no  knowledge  of  any  governmental  procedures, legal or arbitration proceedings, which are pending or threatened, that may have, or have had over the last 12 months, material effects on the financial  position  or  profitability  of  the  Company  and/or  the  Group, other than those described in note 12.2. to the Consolidated Financial Statements appendix. The main legal risks are reported to the General Management and presented to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe  Group's  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  (EHS)  policy  aims  to minimise the impact on the environment and guarantee the health and safety  of  employees, customers and the communities in which L'Or\u00e9al carries out its activities. As a result of this policy, the risks inherent in our business  activities  are  systematically  identified  and  brought  under control.\n\nThe  Operations  Department  issues  Internal  Rules  that  set  out  the principles of L'Or\u00e9al's EHS policy. Each site is covered by an EHS officer. EHS risk management programmes, methods and tools are implemented and  the  corresponding  training  is  being  rolled  out  systematically.  EHS performance  indicators  are  collected  monthly  from  all  factories, distribution  centres,  and  administrative  and  research  sites  with  over  50 people.  Specific  audits  are  conducted  by  internal  EHS  teams,  and external independent experts. Fire risk is dealt with in the framework of very strict fire prevention standards (National Fire Protection Association standards or equivalent).\n\nIndustrial  sites  classified  as  'Seveso'  are  subject  to  specific  procedures adapted to  the  nature  of  the  risks  related  to  storage  of  chemicals  or flammable materials and are in compliance with the regulations. Since 2020, the Group has extended compliance with the main requirements of the European Seveso Directive beyond the European Union to all sites it operates worldwide.\n\nAcross  all  its  sites,  the  Group  strives  to  reduce  its  greenhouse  gas emissions,  its  water  consumption  and  its  waste  generation  and  to  limit the  impact  of  its  activity  on  biodiversity.  It  also  pledges  to  reduce  the footprint from transportation of its products and to no longer send waste to landfill.\n\nDetails  of  how  the  risk  relating  to  the  temporary  unavailability  of  an industrial  site  is  managed  are  given  in  the  section  relating  to  'Product availability'.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND CONTROL ENVIRONMENT\n\nRisk factors and risk management\n\n3",

These  communications  may  be challenged  by  authorities,  organisations  or  consumers,  despite  every care used to guarantee their accuracy and fairness. Such actions could affect sales or, more  generally,  the  Group's  financial  position, particularly if claims are made or products recalled.\n\n## 3.5.3.4. Financial and market risks\n\n## Financial and market risks/Currency risk\n\nRisk identification\n\n## Risk management\n\nDue  to  its  international  presence,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  naturally  exposed  to currency  fluctuations.  In  addition,  commercial  flows  resulting  from purchases  and  sales  of  items,  products,  royalties  and  services  arise between subsidiaries in different countries. Procurement by subsidiaries is mainly in the currency of the supplier's country.\n\nFluctuations  between  the  main  currencies  may  therefore  have  an impact on the results of the subsidiaries, but also on the Group's results during the conversion of non-euro subsidiaries' accounts into euros and, as  a  result,  make  it  difficult  to  compare  performances  between  two financial years.\n\nThe  impact  of  hedging  on  equity  and  the  analysis  of  sensitivity  to currency fluctuations  are  detailed  in  note  11.3.  'Other  comprehensive income' in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Finally, the impact of foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  on  the  income  statement  is described  in  note  10.2.  'Foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses'  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe  Financial  Charter  and  the  currency  risk  management  standard specify,  in  particular,  the  principles  to  be  applied  by  Group  entities  to ensure  that  management  of  currency  risk  is  both  prudent  and centralised.\n\nTo  limit  currency  risk,  the  Group  adopts  a  conservative  approach whereby it hedges a significant portion of its annual requirements for the following year through currency forward contracts (purchases or sales) or  through  options.  Hedging  requirements  are  established  for  the following  year  on  the  basis  of  operating  budgets  of  each  subsidiary. These requirements are then reviewed regularly throughout the year in progress.  In  order  to  obtain  better  visibility  over  the  flows  generated, currency risk management  is  centralised  through  the  Treasury Department  at  head  office  (Group  Corporate  Finance  Department), which uses a specific tool for centralising the subsidiaries' requirements by currency (FX report).\n\nThe system of foreign exchange risk hedging is presented to the Audit Committee.  The  hedging  methodology  and  the  equities  involved  are described in note 10.1. 'Hedging of currency risk' of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe Worldwide Regulatory & Claims Department controls the conformity of product communications before they are introduced on the market. The  Group's  Code  of  Ethics  sets  out  the  fundamental  principles  of responsible  communication  and  L'Or\u00e9al  has  made  a  commitment  to implement  the  International  Chamber  of  Commerce  Consolidated Code of  Advertising  and  Marketing  Communication  Practice  and  the Cosmetics  Europe  Charter  and  Guiding  Principles  on  responsible advertising  and  marketing  communication  to  which  the  key  global cosmetics industry players in Europe adhere. The Group's principles for 'responsible product advertising' are described in a summary brochure disseminated  worldwide  in  order  to  raise  employee  awareness  about compliance  with  ethical  principles,  specific  legal  and  regulatory requirements, and operational processes for the prior control of product communications.\n\nSpecial  care  is  given  to  the  protection  of  trademarks,  designs,  models and  domain  names  belonging  to  the  Group.  This  responsibility  is entrusted  to  a  special  unit  of  the  Legal  Department.  The  department ensures  the  worldwide  protection,  management  and  defence  of intellectual  property  rights  via  searches  for  prior  rights,  monitoring  of registration and renewal procedures, the implementation of monitoring services and  the  initiation of appropriate  legal  action  against counterfeiters.\n\nIn  order  to  protect  the  Group  against  the  risk  of  appropriation  of  a molecule,  a  formula,  packaging,  an  application  system  or  an application  by  another  company,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  the  International Industrial Property Department, a specific structure which is part of the Research  and  Innovation  Department.  It  is  responsible  for  filing  the Group's  patents,  their  use  and  defence  on  a  worldwide  basis.  It  also conducts studies on the free use of Group products with regard to thirdparty  patents  and  monitors  the  legality  of  competitors'  products  with regard to the Group's patents.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Group is also an active member of organisations which have set  themselves  the  goal  of  combating  counterfeiting  and  promoting best  commercial  practices.  This  is  the  case  of  the  UNIFAB  ( Union  des Fabricants ), the APRAM ( Association des Praticiens du Droit des Marques et des Mod\u00e8les ) and te AIM ( Association des Industries de Marque ).",

'Non-current  financial  assets'  of  the Consolidated  Financial  Statements),  the  value  of  which  fluctuates primarily as a function of global market trends, Sanofi's results and, more generally, economic and financial data from Sanofi and its sector.\n\nThis  interest  and  changes  in  the  market  in  which  Sanofi  operates  are monitored on a regular basis. As at 31 December 2021, the market value of the Sanofi share was significantly higher than the value recorded on the L'Or\u00e9al balance sheet (see note 9.3.

This chapter forms the Group's Non-Financial Performance Statement.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitments  and  policies  contribute  to  16  of  the  United  Nations'  17  Sustainable Development Goals (1) .\n\n## 4.1. INTRODUCTION\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  is  based  on  Glocalization  that  is  the globalisation  of  brands  with  profound  understanding  and respect for local differences to meet the beauty expectations and needs of women and men around the world, while at the same time being an environmental and societal leader.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  Ethical  Principles  -  Integrity,  Respect,  Courage  and Transparency  -  guide  the  Group's  development  and  help establish  its  reputation.  These  principles  are  the  basis  of  its sustainable  development,  social  and  societal  responsibility, compliance and philanthropy policies.\n\n## Sustainable development approach\n\nFor  many years, L'Or\u00e9al has begun a profound transformation of its model, in all areas, to adapt to the great changes in the world.  Sustainable  development  is  a  fundamental  pillar  of  this transformation and a strategic priority for all of the teams. In the firm  belief  that  sustainable  development  is  an  essential  factor for  success  and  durability,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  deploying  an  ambitious social, societal and environmental policy, which is shared by its management and teams.\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the  second  generation  of  its commitments to sustainable development, under the umbrella of a programme called L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, with a new set of particularly  ambitious  and  concrete  targets  for  2030,  in  order to  cover  all  the  impacts  associated  with  its  value  chain:  its production and distribution sites as well as its supply chains and the impacts associated with the use of products by consumers.\n\nIn  2015,  the  Group  also  undertook  to  define  Science-Based Targets to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain and over the long term, in accordance with the Paris  Agreement on climate change. In December 2017, the SBT  initiative  validated  the  Group's  proposal  and  L'Or\u00e9al committed  to  reduce  the  greenhouse  gas  emissions  on  its Scopes  1,  2,  and  3  by  25%  in  absolute  value  by  2030, compared to the 2016 baseline.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  which  is  subject  to public reporting every year, is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Transforming L'Or\u00e9al's business to ensure that it is included within  the  'planetary  boundaries', i.e. in  the  context  of what the planet can withstand, according to environmental science;\n- \u00b7 Involving  L'Or\u00e9al's  business  ecosystem  in  the  Group's transformation and helping the Group's transition to a more sustainable model; and\n- \u00b7 Contributing  to  solving  the  challenges  of  the  world  by supporting  the  most  urgent  social  and  environmental needs.\n\n## CSR governance\n\nTo  support  this  process,  the  Group  has  developed  a  strong governance structure.\n\nEvery  year,  the Board  of  Directors determines  L'Or\u00e9al's strategic directions, which integrate the challenges of climate change  and,  more  generally,  the  issues  of  sustainable development, as well as the Group's sense of purpose ( raison d'\u00eatre ) to 'Create the Beauty that moves the world'. In order to  monitor  the  determination  and  successful  implementation of these strategic directions, the Board of Directors can rely on its four Board Committees that are responsible for investigating the  issues  within  their  area  of  expertise  in  the  determination and  monitoring  of  the  non-financial  strategy  (see  section 2.3.2.1. 'Main Remits and Internal Rules' of this document). The Chief  Corporate  Responsibility  Officer  reports  on  the  Group's activities  to  the  Board  of  Directors  every  year  and  to  each meeting of the Strategy and Sustainability Committee. Before each meeting, all members of the Board of Directors receive a status update on the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme that details the programme's specific advances.\n\nIn order  to  implement  this  comprehensive  plan  for  the transformation of the Group, which affects all Divisions, Zones and support functions, the Chief Executive Officer can rely on the commitment of every member of the Executive Committee within their respective scope. The Executive Committee works with the CEO to implement strategic directions regarding nonfinancial matters. Status updates on sustainable development issues  are  conducted  regularly  to  define  and  implement  the necessary  action  plans.  A  network  of  sustainability  leaders, members  of  the  Management  Committees  is  responsible  for the  operational  deployment  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  in  each  Division,  each  geographic  Zone  and each entity.\n\nMore  specifically,  within  the  Executive  Committee, the  Chief Corporate  Responsibility  Officer ensures  strategic  consistency between  the  measures,  the  Group  takes  to  integrate sustainable development across its entire value chain and its charitable contributions. She is responsible for the formulation and implementation of the sustainable development strategy, assesses  and  manages  risks  and  opportunities  related  to environmental and societal challenges at Group level through the  action  plans  of  the  sustainability  programmes  (Sharing Beauty with All and, now, L'Or\u00e9al for the Future).",

        "page_content": "Introduction\n\nUnder  her  direction,  different internal  Committees  related  to sustainable development , composed of the experts responsible for the deployment of the programme, define the roadmaps  for  each  of  the  entities  represented  (Operations, Research,  Divisions,  Zones).  Each  of  the  internal  Committees defines  annual  objectives  and  directs  their  deployment throughout the L'Or\u00e9al value chain.\n\nThe  mission  of  the Sustainable  Finance  Department created in  2020,  is  to  integrate  the  environmental  challenges  from  a financial  standpoint.  This  Department,  which  reports  to  the Chief  Administrative  and  Financial  Officer  and  to  the  Chief Corporate  Responsibility  Officer,  aims  at  developing  and directing  Sustainable  Finance  actions  by  coordinating  the actions  within  the  finance  teams  and  by  continuing  to integrate  sustainability in decisions  on  investments  and acquisitions.\n\n- All L'Or\u00e9al employees are encouraged to receive training on sustainable development issues through a full range of online courses that are delivered as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme,  which  are  available  in  15  languages.  In  2021, over 41,400 employees completed the Green Steps or Green tests training modules.\n\nBecause sustainable development is a strategic transformation that  must  be  driven  by  all  teams,  remuneration  structures have been revised. At the highest level, the variable portion of the Chief Executive Officer's annual remuneration incorporates quantitative and qualitative non-financial objectives, including objectives associated with the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme  (and  previously,  the  Sharing  Beauty  with  All programme).  The  long-term  remuneration  of  the  Chief Executive  Officer  will  introduce  criteria  for  non-financial performance in addition to financial performance in order to correlate them with L'Or\u00e9al's strategy for which economic and social performance  go  hand-in-hand  (see  section  2.4. 'Remuneration  of  directors  and  corporate  officers'  of  this document).  Moreover,  from  2016,  non-financial  objectives  in line  with  the  Group's  goals  for  sustainability  have  been included in the variable remuneration of the top management,  including  international  brand  managers  and country managers.\n\nFinally, within the framework of ongoing dialogue and as part of a process which aims at making continual progress, L'Or\u00e9al takes into account its stakeholders' expectations in its strategy. For  this  purpose,  the  Group  has  defined  and  developed  a method  of ad  hoc interaction,  which  it  considers  to  be  the most efficient and appropriate, with a representative panel of outside  experts  around  the  world.  It  has  also  set  up  bodies dedicated  to  important  issues,  for  example  in  the  form  of  a women advisory board, to ensure that these issues sufficiently meet the expectations of civil society. Section 4.1.2. 'Constant dialogue  with  stakeholders'  of  this  document  sets  out  the primary stakeholder interactions.\n\nConvinced that acting ethically is the only way for a company to  succeed  over  time,  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  can  also rely  on  the  the Chief  Ethics,  Risk  &  Compliance  Officer who reports  directly  to  the  CEO  so  that  strong  ethical  principles continue  to  guide  L'Or\u00e9al's  development  and  contribute  to establishing its reputation.\n\nIn  2021,  for  the  seventh  consecutive  year,  L'Or\u00e9al  was recognised  as  a  Global  Compact  LEAD  company  for  its continued commitment to the Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact  and  for  placing  the  UN  Sustainable  Development Goals at the centre of its growth strategy.\n\n4",

Constant dialogue with stakeholders\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  perfectly  aware  that,  to  grow  sustainably,  a company  must  take  into consideration its ecosystem composed  of  its  stakeholders.  The  Group  attaches  great importance to dialogue with all stakeholders.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  ongoing  dialogue  and  as  part  of  a process aimed  at  making  continual  progress, L'Or\u00e9al endeavours to take into account its stakeholders' expectations  in  its  strategy.  For  this  purpose,  the  Group  has defined and developed a method of ad hoc interaction, that it  considers  the  most  efficient  and  appropriate,  with  all  the stakeholders involved.\n\nIn defining the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme for 2030, since April  2019,  seven  internal  expert  panels  have  coordinated independent studies and worked with outside partners and civil society  to  define  L'Or\u00e9al's  next  steps  in  sustainability.  The outcome of these dialogues and consultations is an ambitious strategy, built on quantified impact reduction targets and make a positive contribution to its ecosystem.\n\nThe Group conducts ongoing dialogues with NGOs, associations and experts on a large number of environmental and societal issues around the world to review its policies and action plans, and ensure their relevance.\n\nThe  dialogue  conducted by L'Or\u00e9al with its  stakeholders  has grown in importance over time. Stakeholders were consulted in the  context  of  the  construction  of  the  Group's  first sustainability programme, Sharing Beauty with All, both before the definition of its commitments and during follow-up.\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                 | CURRENT RELATIONSHIPS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | SOME INITIATIVES IN 2021                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Employees                                                                                                                                                       | L'Or\u00e9al sets up a large number of dialogue arrangements with  its  employees  to  ensure  their  health,  safety  and well-being at work while listening to their concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | More  than  60%  of  employees  logged  on  to  the  Ethics  Day  sessions  and more than 8,000 questions were asked worldwide.

MAIN NON-FINANCIAL RISKS\n\nL'Or\u00e9al presents its Corporate Social Responsibility strategy (1) in order to meet  the  requirements  of  the  Non-Financial Information Statement (2) in  particular. This Declaration sets out the  Group's  main  non-financial  risks  and  then  describes  the policies  implemented  to  address  them,  which  are  monitored and measured by performance indicators and their results. This presentation  refers  to  the  Group's  business  model,  set  out  in\n\n## 4.2.1. Risk identification process\n\nIn application of the European Directive of 22 October 2014 on the disclosure of non-financial information, as transposed into French law, the main environmental and social risks, the main risks  related  to  Human  Rights  and  the  main  corruption  risks (3) are detailed in this section 4.2. to the extent necessary to gain an  understanding  of  the  Company's  position,  business development, economic and financial results, and impacts of its activity.\n\nThe  Group's  significant  risks, i.e. the  risks  that  could  have  a material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  position,  or  outlook, are described in chapter 3 of this document (see section 3.5. 'Risk  factors  and  risk  management'  of  this  document)  and have  been  established  in  conjunction  with  the  Group  risk mapping (see section 3.5.2. 'Risk mapping' of this document).\n\nThese  risks  cover  all  areas  of  the  Group's  activities.  Some  of these  risks  are  specific  to  non-financial  issues;  others  are broader and may stem from environmental or societal causes.\n\nsection 1.2. 'Business model: economic  and  societal excellence to create lasting value for all' of this document.\n\nAs L'Or\u00e9al has had a long-standing commitment to corporate social responsibility, section 4.3. 'Policies, performance indicators  and  results'  of  this  document  also  includes  the policies  and  actions  voluntarily  implemented  beyond  a response to the main risks.\n\nThese  so-called  'CSR'  risks  were  the  subject  of  detailed analysis to select the main risks within the meaning of the NonFinancial  Information  Statement.  This  analysis  was  carried  out based on the work of Group experts, in conjunction with the Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance  Department  and  in  compliance with the Group's business model. This work also draws on the sustainable  development  materiality  analysis,  the  Group's Human  Rights  and  corruption  mapping  and  corruption mapping conducted for each country, as well as on the risk analysis carried out within the framework of the Vigilance Plan (see section 3.4. 'Vigilance plan' of this document).\n\nThe  risks  associated  with  climate  change  have  been  the subject of a long-term approach - more than 10 years - given their specific nature.\n\nThe  main  risks  have  been  validated  at  the  highest  level  of responsibility  of  the  organisation  by  the  relevant  General Managements.\n\n## 4.2.2. Main risks for corporate social responsibility, Human Rights and corruption\n\nThe  main  risks  in  respect  of  corporate  social  responsibility, Human  Rights  and  corruption  identified  by  the  Group,  as described in  section  4.2.1.  'Risk  identification  process'  of  this document, are set out below. Other risks, of which the Group is not currently aware or which it does not consider material at the date of this Document, could have a negative impact.\n\nFor  the  main  environmental  risks,  the  concept  of  risk  covers both  risks  related  to  the  impact  of  the  Group's  business activities  on  its  ecosystem  and  the  risks  of  the  impact  of climate change in the short and medium terms on its business model, activity and financial performance (4) .\n\n4",

        "page_content": ".\n\n## Main environmental risks\n\n## Industrial risks\n\nAs with any production, distribution, research and general administration activity, L'Or\u00e9al is exposed to a variety of industrial risks that may impact the  environment  and  safety:  fires,  explosions,  technical  failure  of  facilities,  safety  system  installations,  or  even  human  failure  in  the  operation  of existing facilities (such as those dedicated to the treatment of wastewater and/or their discharge), or when managing exceptional works. These events can generate accidental pollution (surface and underground water, air, soils, etc.) that may have consequences inside or outside the sites, which are sometimes located near an inhabited area.\n\n## Physical and transition risks associated with climate change\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks of natural origin in many countries. Risks of natural origin are those related to the occurrence of extreme weather events such as cyclones or floods, or those resulting from long-term climate change such as the rise in average temperatures, noticeable change in precipitation levels and the reduction of available water. The increase in these risks could impact the availability of finished products by disturbing the Group's operations and/or supply chain. To be sold, the products manufactured by the Group must be available on the market on the dates scheduled  to  respect  consumer  demands  and  launch  plans,  in  a  cosmetics  market  where  the  need  for  responsiveness  is  growing  constantly. A  major  stoppage  of  activity  at  a  factory  or  distribution  centre  could  therefore  have  an  adverse  effect  on  the  achievement  of  commercial objectives.\n\nThese risks may impact the Group directly on its sites, or indirectly via the sites of suppliers and subcontractors, thereby reducing the availability of raw materials or filling and packing components necessary to manufacture products. For instance, an exceptionally steep rise in the price of basic raw  materials  because  of  their  scarcity,  or  in  the  energy  costs  necessary  for  their  production  due  to  carbon  taxation,  or  even  their  total unavailability or the resulting failure of suppliers, could affect the Group's performance.\n\n## Risks related to the use and end of life of products\n\nThe  use  of  cosmetics  and  their  disposal  after  use  by  consumers  and  professional  customers  (mainly  hairdressers  and  beauticians)  generate environmental impacts. So-called 'rinsed' formulas (shampoos in particular) require water for their use, and the ingredients used in their composition can  be  found  after  use  in  domestic  wastewater,  the  treatment  of  which  is  dependent  on  existing  sanitation  systems  in  place  in  the  relevant geographic areas. Insufficient consideration of these impacts related to the usage phase during the design of L'Or\u00e9al products could represent a risk in certain areas of the world affected by water stress or the lack of adapted infrastructures for the collection and treatment of wastewater. Similarly, the use of predominantly plastic containers may represent an environmental risk with regard to the disposal of plastic waste, depending largely on the collection and treatment channels available.\n\n## Risk related to changing stakeholder and consumer expectations in terms of environmental and social performance\n\nThe Group anticipates that the choices made by certain categories of consumers could increasingly be influenced by the impact associated with using a product (its carbon footprint, water footprint and impact on biodiversity) and the global environmental performance of industrial producers. If  the  Group  is  unable  to  anticipate  changes  in  such  behaviours,  meet  stakeholders'  expectations,  overcome  major  environmental  and  social challenges  and  respond  in  particular  with  appropriate  product  innovation,  a  significant  contribution  in  the  transition  towards  a  low  carbon economy and the preservation of water, natural resources and biodiversity within its value chain, the Group's performance and reputation could be affected.\n\n## Risk of regulatory non-conformity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates through subsidiaries located in many countries. Like any international business, L'Or\u00e9al is subject to a wide range of constantly changing local laws and regulations in the areas of safety and environment, including fight against climate change, and the preservation of water resources, biodiversity and natural resources. This exposes it to the risk of regulatory non-compliance of higher compliance costs for its activities in a global context of increasingly diverse norms.\n\n## Main social risks\n\n## Employee health and safety risk\n\nGiven L'Or\u00e9al's activities, particularly its industrial operations, the risk of occupational injuries or illnesses could become a reality.\n\n## Human resources management risk\n\nOne of the keys to L'Or\u00e9al's success lies in the talent of its employees to ensure its growth. This is all the more true as L'Or\u00e9al is changing within a  complex,  highly  competitive,  and  rapidly  changing  environment  (globalisation,  diversity  and  inclusion  challenges,  sustainable  development issues, acceleration of the digital transformation, etc.) that requires specific expertise. The labour market is characterised by major changes related to the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly to the hybrid organisation mode, both in-person and remote. If L'Or\u00e9al fails to identify, attract, retain and train competent and involved employees who behave responsibly, the development of its activities and its results could be affected.\n\n## Main Human Rights risks\n\nFollowing an initial analysis conducted in 2017, the Group wanted to expand its mapping in 2020, by identifying the potential salient Human Rights risks. To  do  so,  L'Or\u00e9al  relied  on  the  reporting  framework  of  the  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights  (UNGP  Reporting  Framework). This identification process takes into consideration the severity, scale and remediability, as well as the likelyhood of its impacts for people throughout its value chain. The identification process at the global level and in 27 markets was finalised in 2021. This study was conducted with an NGO specialised in the area, providing independent analysis.\n\nThe following list of the main risks results from the 2017 risk analysis, complemented by the work to identify the detected salient risks in 2021:\n\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of L'Or\u00e9al's employees (discrimination because of gender, age, disability, gender identity, and sexual orientation);\n- \u25cf the  Human  Rights  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  suppliers'  employees  (child  labour,  forced  labour,  discrimination  because  of  gender,  age,  disability,  gender identity and sexual orientation, and lack of a living wage);\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of consumers (failure in the quality and safety of products, and lack of protection of personal data); and\n- \u25cf the Human Rights of communities (stereotypes in advertising).\n\nAnother risk identified concerns the Human Rights of communities potentially impacted by the Group's activities (respect for the environment, right of access to water, consideration of Human Rights in the choice of raw materials, and in particular, the right of access of local populations to their land and respect for their traditional knowledge under the Nagoya Protocol).",

        "page_content": "## L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\n## Main corruption risks\n\nL'Or\u00e9al operates in many countries where the risk of corruption can be significant and could lead L'Or\u00e9al's employees, as well as third parties acting in its name or on its behalf, directly or indirectly, voluntarily or involuntarily, to adopt practices contrary to the Group's ethical principles and the prevailing regulations. Corruption takes a variety of forms that are not necessarily easy for employees to identify. For instance, the exchange of gifts or invitations of excessive value could be perceived as corruption.\n\nThe assessment of corruption risk is materialised by specific mapping, carried out at the Group level and by each country in its local context. The Group's activities involve in particular relations with:\n\n- \u25cf public  authorities  and  their  representatives,  either  directly  or via intermediaries  or  professional  bodies,  to  obtain  the  authorisations  necessary for the Group's activities, for instance. The countries in which the Group operates must be given support in the fight against public corruption;\n- \u25cf the Group's customers and suppliers; and\n- \u25cf journalists, doctors, etc., to whom products can be given so that they can recommend them. Relationships are also maintained with third parties that, beyond the Group's products themselves, issue various or general opinions on L'Or\u00e9al. Any action potentially deemed as being intended to cause the persons in question to breach their obligation of loyalty must be avoided.\n\nAny breach of the Group's corruption prevention principles may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al and its partners. Equally, any failure of a partner may be detrimental to L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## 4.3. POLICIES, PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RESULTS\n\nThe  Group's  policies,  described  in  this  section,  address  the need to prevent the main CSR risks and mitigate their impact. By contributing to preventing and controlling the risks to which the  Group  is  exposed,  these  policies  are  intended  to contribute  to  the  Group's  sustainable  growth  in  a  controlled environment suited to its business lines. There are however limits inherent  in  any  system  and  process.  These  limits  result  from several  factors,  in  particular  the  uncertainties  of  the  outside world  or  malfunctions  that  may  occur  due  to  technical  or human failures.\n\nThese policies also reflect a proactive approach by the Group that  considers  stakeholder  expectations  (see  section  4.1.2. 'Constant dialogue with stakeholders' of this document).\n\n## 4.3.1. Environmental policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al,  whose  strategy  is  Glocalization,  sees  its  economic performance and its environmental and social performance as being  inextricably  bound.  Long  committed  to  reducing  its environmental footprint, the Group has the ambition to appear among the exemplary companies in the field by proving that it is  possible to decorrelate growth and impact, and to contribute positively to its ecosystem, throughout the world.\n\nIn  2013,  L'Or\u00e9al  intensified  its  environmental  ambitions  by launching  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme  based  on four  pillars:  'Innovating  sustainably',  'Producing  sustainably', 'Living sustainably' and 'Developing sustainably'. In 2015, the Group announced its  aim  of  becoming  a  Carbon  Balanced company by the end of 2020. In 2016, a programme was rolled out  within  Sharing  Beauty  With  All: Working  sustainably.  It brought  administrative  sites  and  research  centres  into  the process  of  improving  L'Or\u00e9al's  environmental  and  social impacts. In 2017, through its membership of the Science-Based Targets  programme,  an  initiative  of  the  CDP,  the  United Nations  Global  Compact,  the  World  Resources  Institute  and WWF,  L'Or\u00e9al  signalled  its  goal  of  reducing  its  global greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  25%  compared  to  their  2016\n\nlevels  by  the  end  of  2030  and  of  going  one  step  further  by putting  its  environmental  policy  at  the  service  of  a  major collective  challenge,  namely efforts  to  fight  climate  change. To  progress  further,  in  2018,  in  the  context  of  the  individual Act4nature  commitments,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  a  goal  of  100% renewable  raw  materials  coming  from  sustainable  sources by  2030.  Also  in  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  became  a  partner  of  the Ellen MacArthur  Foundation,  with  the  aim  of  adopting refillable,  reusable,  recyclable,  or  compostable  plastic  for 100% of packaging by 2025. Finally, in 2019, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the  first  companies  to  sign  the  Business  Ambition  for  1.5\u00b0C pledge  of  the  UN  Global  Compact,  thereby  committing  to reach 'zero net emissions' by 2050 over its entire value chain, in accordance with the 1.5\u00b0C paths of the IPCC (1) .\n\nAll  these  programmes  have  allowed  L'Or\u00e9al  to  broaden  the scope of its actions. Beyond its commitment to preserving the health and safety of its employees and reducing the impact of its  sites  on  their  environment, the Group has implemented an ambitious  policy  to  reduce  its  environmental  footprint  by preserving natural resources (energy, water, materials, biodiversity) on all sites operated and throughout the product life cycle, from the supply of raw materials to the end of life of products.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  increasingly  involving  its  suppliers  in  this process,  sharing  its  ambitions  and  best  practices,  with  the vision of a comprehensive and inclusive environmental policy.\n\nIn June 2020, L'Or\u00e9al announced its new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future sustainability  programme  built  on  three  pillars:  'Transforming ourselves', 'Empowering  our  business  ecosystem',  and 'Contributing to solving the challenges of the world'. In order to  reconcile  the  Group's  needs  to  preserve  a  planet  with limited  resources,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  raised  its  goals  and  defined targets  for  improvement by 2030 that cover all its direct and indirect  impacts,  related  for  example  to  the  activity  of  its suppliers or the use of its products by consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's commitment is to ensure that its activities respect the 'planetary  boundaries',  meaning  what  the  planet  can withstand, as defined by environmental science.\n\n4",

An ambitious EHS policy shared by all\n\nA pioneering, socially responsible company, L'Or\u00e9al applies an ambitious policy with regard to the Environment (E), Health (H) and  Safety  (S)  to  minimise  its  environmental  impact  and guarantee the health and safety of employees (1) , customers and the  communities  in  which  the  Group  carries  out  its  business activities.\n\nThis  has  been  reflected,  for  many  years,  in  the  desire  to systematically control the risks related to the safety of people and the environment that are inherent in the Group's business activities. Any establishment or renovation of a site, any launch of new equipment or production processes, and any changes\n\nin industrial processes give rise to a risk assessment and action plans that make it possible to reduce their potential impact.\n\nThis  commitment  has  led  to  the  deployment  of  the  Group's EHS policy over the entire spectrum of its business activities, but also  beyond  it.  Indeed,  the  Group  strives  to  ensure  the regulatory compliance of its activities, compliance with its own standards on its sites (industrial or administrative sites, research centres,  stores),  and  makes  sure  that  its  subcontractors  and suppliers  ensure  the  safety  of  people  and  the  environment through a specifically dedicated audit programme.",

It  includes  a  Group  'M\u00e9tier'  (business  activity)  Department, mirror  organisations  in  each  geographic zone and managers at each site.\n\n## WORLDWIDE EHS ORGANISATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) South Asia, Pacific, Middle East, North Africa.\n\nIn support of this organisation, the EHS manual is the reference tool  for  the  Group  sites.  It  is  essential  to  the  improvement  of their performance and respect for the key EHS commitments: moving towards 'zero accidents' for the Group and to reduce\n\nthe sites' environmental footprint (see 'A continuous improvement  process'  section  below).  It  defines  the  EHS management  system  and  the  responsibilities  shared  at  all levels of the organisation, up to the operational responsibilities:\n\n| General Management                                                                        | The  Chief  Operations  Officer,  a  member  of  the  Executive  Committee  who  reports  to  the  Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the Environment, Health and Safety for the Group.                                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Site managers (factories, distribution  centres, administrative sites, research  centres) | Site managers are responsible for the deployment and effective implementation of the policies defined.

In  addition, webinars  were  rolled  out  to  animate  the  different  EHS programmes, and, in particular, Green steps for all increased awareness  of  the  challenges  related  to  climate,  water, biodiversity and resources for 12,419 Operations employees in 2021.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  specialised  training  sessions,  every  new L'Or\u00e9al  employees  receive  general  and  specific  training  at their workstation including the Group's EHS rules before taking up their position.\n\n## A worldwide audit programme\n\nIn  order  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  Group's  EHS  policy, a  system  of  worldwide  audits  has  been  set  up  since  1996,  and was  reinforced  in  2001  with  the  presence  of  external  auditors, who are experts  in  local  contexts  and  regulations.  These  audits take  place  regularly  at  all  L'Or\u00e9al  sites:  every  three  years  for production  sites  and  every  four  years  for  distribution  centres, administrative  sites  and  research  centres.  A  follow-up  visit  is scheduled for the following year for the sites where it is necessary.\n\nTwo types of audits known as 'risks' or 'culture' are performed depending  on  the  maturity  and  type  of  activity  at  the  sites. The risks audits primarily assess:\n\n- \u25cf compliance  of  practices  and  facilities  with  the  significant requirements  of  local  regulations  and  Group  procedures and rules;\n- \u25cf controls  of  risks  to  health,  safety  and  the  environment generated by technical equipment, processes and operating modes implemented and used by employees; and\n- \u25cf progress in environmental, health and safety performances.\n\nThese audits are carried out by external independent experts.\n\nThe  results of these  audits  give  the  Group's  General Management objective knowledge of the risks in the areas of EHS on L'Or\u00e9al sites and provide the assurance that they are under control.\n\nIn  the  same  way,  within  the  framework  of  the  culture  audits, the leadership of site management, all operational managers, and  the  deployment  level  of  the  EHS  culture  with  all employees are evaluated.\n\nThese audits are carried out by internal EHS specialists through interviews with at least 20% to 30% of the site's workforce.\n\nThe  results  of  these  audits  provide  information  on  the  level of  knowledge  of  EHS  management  tools  and  the  maturity of  audited  sites  with  regard  to  the  safety  and  environment culture at all structural levels.\n\nDepending  on  the  case,  EHS  audits  are  exclusively  risks or culture audits, audits that combine risks and culture, or even audits that combine risks, culture, quality and performance.\n\nBecause of the Covid-19 health crisis, specific new audits were rolled  out  since  2020  to  evaluate  the  level  of  prevention necessary  to  avoid  the  spread  of  Covid-19.  After  an  initial audit,  a  follow-up  audit  is  conducted  after  one  month,  and then audits are performed every four to five months based on the results. Most of these audits are conducted remotely.\n\n4",

Audits  are  carried  out  in  addition  to  social  audits  by independent third party specialists on manufacturing or logistics subcontracting sites, in accordance with the criteria defined by L'Or\u00e9al and similar to those used for the Group's entities.\n\nIn 2021, in the context of the Covid-19 health crisis:\n\n- \u00b7 2 risk audits were conducted on-site;\n- \u00b7 2  combined  risks  and  EHS  culture  audits  were  conducted on site;\n- \u00b7 2  combined  Quality,  Environment,  Health,  Safety  and Performance audits were conducted on-site;\n- \u00b7 More than 270 Covid audits were carried out, most of them remotely; and\n- \u00b7 29 additional EHS audits of subcontracting sites were carried out  in  factories  and  4  in  distribution  centres.  All  of  these audits were conducted on-site.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  audit  programmes, prevention inspections are regularly conducted by experts from the Group's insurance companies as part of external Fire and Environment insurance policies. In 2021, given the Covid-19 health crisis, site inspections were  reduced:  9  sites  (6  factories,  2  distribution  centres  and 1  administrative  site)  were  inspected  for  environmental  risks  in four  countries  (France,  Germany,  Spain  and  China).  5  remote reviews were also completed to ensure progress in the effective implementation  of  recommendations  made  during  previous inspections.  With  regard  to  fire  prevention  inspections,  only 4 sites were inspected in 2021 (3 factories and 1 administrative site)  in  France.  18  sites  around  the  world  were  reviewed remotely.\n\n100% of all preventive audits and inspections described above involved  a  risk  component  which  is  always  carried  out  by external  independent  auditors  specialised  in  the  area  being audited.\n\n## A continuous improvement process\n\nThe  implementation  of  the  standards,  the  spread  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  EHS  culture  and  the  governance  system  in  place contributes to the continuous improvement of the Group's EHS performance.  Major  developments  occurring  within  the framework  of  the  Group's  Operations  are  also  included  with this  same goal, whether it involves the construction of a new factory,  the  purchase  of  new  equipment  or  the  definition  of new processes, each industrial development is an opportunity to reduce the environmental footprint and safety risks.\n\nLastly, some major programmes within EHS, or more generally within the Group, are vectors for progress in the areas of safety or  the  environment  for  all  entities,  and  are  the  subject  of detailed  improvement  plans,  the  effectiveness  of  which  is evaluated during the audits.\n\n## LIFE programme (Life-threatening Incidents or Fatality Events)\n\nFor  all  L'Or\u00e9al  sites,  this  programme  covers  activities  posing risks that, if not controlled, could result in serious injury or illness. Over  time  the  Group  is  prolonging  the  ambition  of  moving towards  'zero  accidents'  by  ensuring  the  sustainability  of actions  and  defining  the  requirements  in  terms  of  preparing for  emergencies  following  an  incident.  It  is  backed  up  by  a three-year communication campaign relayed by managers to cover the 10 identified families of LIFE risks.\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme\n\nBuilding on the Sharing Beauty With All programme, L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, the Group's  new  sustainability programme announced  in  June  2020,  has  set  a  second  generation  of particularly ambitious and concrete targets for 2030, covering all  the  impacts  of  the  Group's  value  chain  (supply  chains, consumer product use, etc.) and its operated sites (production and  distribution  sites, administrative  sites, and  research centres).\n\nThe  main  environmental  objectives  of  the  programme concerning operated sites are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate: reaching carbon neutrality for all operated sites by 2025,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and  using  100% renewable energy. L'Or\u00e9al is also committed to halving the transport footprint of its products by 2030.\n- \u00b7 Water:  in  2030,  100%  of  the  water  used  in  our  industrial processes will be recycled and reused in a loop.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity:  by  2030,  all  of  our  operated  buildings  and  all industrial  sites  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  biodiversity compared to 2019.\n- \u00b7 Natural resources: by 2030, 100% of the waste generated in our operated sites will be recycled or reused. L'Or\u00e9al is also committed to no longer send waste to landfill.\n\nThe  Group  is  committed  to  an  ISO  certification  process  to permanently anchoring EHS performance on its industrial sites:\n\n- \u00b7 Since 2003, L'Or\u00e9al has committed to ISO 14001 certification 'Environmental Management' in all of its factories;\n- \u00b7 In 2015,  the  Group  launched  an  ISO  50001  'Energy Management'  certification  programme  with  the  goal  of certifying  all  its  factories  in  accordance  with  a  clearly defined  roadmap.  Some  administrative  sites  and  research centres have also initiated this process; and\n- \u00b7 Since  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to  OHSAS  18001 certification, and then ISO 45001 'Occupational Health and Safety Management' certification to all its plants.\n\n| 2021 Certifications   | ISO 14001       | ISO 14001   | ISO 50001         | ISO 50001       | ISO 45001   |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n|                       | Number of sites | %           | Number of sites % | Number of sites | %           |\n| Factories             | 34              | 87          | 23  59            | 34              | 87          |\n\nAn internal Group communication system exists so that each site  is  informed  when  accidents,  near  misses,  or  significant incidents occur. Specific communication is circulated worldwide  so  that  the  facts  and  lessons  to  be  learnt,  the\n\nexisting  rules  and  the  new  requirements  to  be  applied  are taken into account. Finally, a historical record is accessible by each  site  covering  the  nature  and  root  causes  of  EHS incidents/accidents that have occurred in all sites.",

A  formal  integration process  then  makes  it  possible  to  provide  these  sites (1) with  extra support and assistance in order for them become compliant with all  EHS  requirements  defined,  and  to  bring  potential  risks  under control.\n\nThe purpose of this process is to enable these sites to rapidly achieve  the  performance  level  expected  by  the  Group. It comprises:\n\n- 1. a regulatory compliance  audit  carried out by an independent third party within six months of the acquisition;\n- 2. deployment  of  the EHS processes described above (EHS manual, EHS reporting, training, audit programme); and\n- 3. monitoring of the integration within the Group.\n\n## 4.3.1.1.2. Managing risks and controlling the impact of sites on their environment\n\nThe  Group  systematically  anticipates  industrial  risks  of  its activities, specifically the environmental impacts in the places where it operates, whether they concern soil, water or air.\n\n## Controlling and limiting risks to the environment\n\nEach site  has  a  general  environmental  analysis  that  must  be updated  on  a  regular  basis  and  whenever  a  significant change occurs.\n\nAll activities performed by employees  (permanent  or temporary) are covered by an environmental aspects analysis, including  routine  and  maintenance  activities.  The  preventive measures  described  in  the  internal  procedures  must  be complied  with  in  order  to  avoid  all  forms  of  pollution  (soil, surface  water,  groundwater,  air,  etc.).  Contingency  plans  in the  event  of  accidents  are  planned  and  are  the  subject  of training for the people concerned. Proper implementation of these  measures  is  verified  during  prevention  inspections  by insurers and periodic EHS audits.\n\nDepending  on  the  site,  if  significant  risks  are  identified  or  if L'Or\u00e9al's standards or regulations impose specific requirements, a more  detailed  evaluation  is  carried  out  for  the  activities concerned.  Appropriate  action  plans  -  with  immediate  action where necessary - are implemented to reduce significant risks to an acceptable level.\n\nAny establishment or site renovation, any introduction of new equipment  or  manufacturing  processes,  and  any  change  in industrial processes is also the subject of a risk assessment and action  plans  to  reduce  the  potential  impacts.  In  the  same way,  at  the  time  of  purchasing  land  or  buildings,  L'Or\u00e9al conducts due diligence, which includes, in particular, a review of the environmental aspects.\n\n## Biodiversity and soil use\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  biodiversity  and  soil  use  commitments  are  based on the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 establish an ecological inventory of the site: the purpose of this  inventory,  through  the  resulting  action  plan,  is  to preserve, restore and develop the biodiversity of the site in\n\nits  ecosystem. This inventory is performed by a local expert and  may  be  based  on  the  SITES  v2  standards  (Reference guide  for  Sustainable  Land  Design  and  Development), which  is  aligned  with  the  LEED  environmental  certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design);\n\n- \u00b7 reduce  the  impact  of  construction  on  the  environment, for  instance by choosing a zone that is already industrially developed, even an existing industrial site or brownfield site or,  for  administrative  sites,  an  urban  area  with  a  high population  density  close  to  a  residential  neighbourhood, ideally located in the city centre or in a neighbourhood well served  by  public  transport;  a  sustainable  building  site charter  includes  these  recommendations  and  requires selective  sorting  of  building  site  waste  and  minimised impact on residents during the project phase;\n- \u00b7 if possible,  place  the  site  on  land  located  more  than 30 metres from any wetland (sea, ponds, lakes, rivers, etc.), outside  natural  areas,  public  green  spaces,  land  with endangered  or  threatened  species,  or  any  other  unbuilt areas (farmland, etc.);\n- \u00b7 prevent soil erosion that may result from rainwater runoff or wind  erosion  during  construction,  inter  alia  by  protecting the stored arable soil layer to enable it to be reused;\n- \u00b7 maintain or restore native natural habitats and biodiversity on the built site;\n- \u00b7 maximise green space areas or natural spaces on the site (even  in  excess  of  local  regulations)  and  minimise impermeable surfaces;\n- \u00b7 focus on cleaning up polluted sites (brownfield site) where development  is  more  difficult  due  to  environmental contamination (real contamination or contamination perceived as such), thus avoiding construction on natural or undeveloped land; and\n- \u00b7 for  future  administrative  sites,  lease  buildings  that  are certified LEED Gold or Platinum or equivalent in mature real estate markets.\n\n## Surface water\n\nThe Group has adopted standards for rainwater management in order  to  monitor  its  quality  and  avoid  polluting  it. For instance, sites are equipped with oil separators for parking areas.  Similarly,  any  retention  and  operating  area  where accidental  spills  are  liable  to  occur  must  have  adequate retention  capacities.  Sites  must  also  have  retention  capacity to contain fire extinguishing water.\n\nIn 2021, no accidental spill was recorded.\n\n## Industrial wastewater\n\n31  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  have  their  own  wastewater  treatment plant.  They  use  a  range  of  technologies,  including  physical, chemical and biological processes adapted to the characteristics of the wastewater  and  local  discharge conditions.  L'Or\u00e9al  continues  to  install  wastewater  treatment plants for its wastewater, as for example in india in 2021.\n\nEquipment  operation  and  wastewater  management  are  the sites' responsibility, and are subject to specific procedures and instructions. An  internal  audit  or  self-assessment  of  the corresponding facility  is  organised  and  documented  at  least once each year.\n\n4",

This self-monitoring is a  tool  for  detecting  the  risk  of  overshooting,  which  helps anticipate any non-conformities and initiate corrective actions.\n\nIn  2021,  the  total  chemical  oxygen  demand  of  the  Group's wastewater at the exit of the site was 0.33 grams per finished product. \u2611 This  was  down  46%  in  tonnes  compared  to  2019 (a 73% decrease compared to 2005) and by 46% in grams per finished  product  compared  to  2019  (a  decrease  of  81% compared  to  2005).  These  reductions  are  related  to  the operational start-ups of new wastewater treatment plants and the optimisation of existing treatment plants at several Group factories.\n\n## WASTEWATER QUALITY INDEX\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(grams of COD per finished product)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurthermore, as part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group has established a L'Or\u00e9al internal standard for the quality of industrial wastewater at the exit of the sites: by 2030, 100%  of  the  wastewater  at  the  exit  of  factories  must  not exceed  a  chemical  oxygen  demand  of  1,000  mg  COD/l  (if local  regulations  impose  a  lower  threshold,  the  site  must comply with the lower value).\n\nAt  year-end  2021,  24  factories  were  in  compliance  with  this internal standard \u2611 , representing 62% of the Group's factories.\n\n| Scope of industrial sites                  | 2020      | 2021     |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|\n| Accidental spills  (m 3 )                  | 2         | 0        |\n| Wastewater at the exit of the site  (m 3 ) | 1,039,630 | 885,423  |\n| COD at the exit the site (in tonnes)       | 3,392     | 2,022  \u2611 |\n\n## The Group's air emissions, excluding greenhouse gases\n\nIndustrial sites have an inventory and mapping of air emissions, which  is updated  once  a  year.

The  sites comply  with  the  noise  standards  to  which  they  are  subject. Internal environmental reporting is one way in which to ensure monthly readings of any non-conformity on this issue.\n\n## Provisions for environmental risks\n\nThe amount of the provisions for environmental risks is not material (see Note 13.1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## 4.3.1.1.3. Fighting climate change on operated sites\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  a  major  objective  of  fighting  climate change  and  preserving  natural  resources  in  the  overall exercise  of  its  activity.  All  efforts  are  being  made  to  achieve this objective in the sites where its activities are performed and across  its  entire  value  chain,  from  the  search  for  renewable ingredients  and  the  sustainable  sourcing  of  raw  materials  to the  transport  of  products,  their  consumption  and  their  end of  life.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  continuously  improving  the impact of its products throughout their life cycle.\n\nAs  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed  to  improving  the  environmental  footprint  of  all operated sites.\n\nThe Group strives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (1) ,  water consumption, waste generation, and to protect biodiversity. It is also committed to reducing the footprint of product transport, and  no  longer  sending  waste  to  landfill  (without  regulatory constraints).\n\nThe  specific  context  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis  impacted  the amount  of  hours  worked  at  the  administrative  sites  and research centres, which decreased by 54% in 2021 from 2019, because of the different lockdown periods that resulted in the periodic or partial closure of some of these sites as well as an increase in telecommuting for eligible positions. The nature of the  activities  maintained  on-sites  -  laboratories,  pilots,  etc.  which generally consume more resources than the administrative  activities,  increased  the  effects  of  this  activity decline  on  certain  environmental  ratios  (energy,  water,  and waste per 100 hours worked).\n\nOn  the  other  hand,  the  production  of  the  industrial  sites remained stable in comparison with 2019 (decrease of 0.4%).",

Indeed, energy consumption was down 9% from 2019, and the  share  of  renewable  energy  rose  to  82%  (compared with  51% in  2019).  In  addition  to  the  improvement  projects  in place, which continued in 2021, the Covid-19 health crisis also had  a  favourable  impact  on  this  result  due  to  the  lower number of hours spent on-site by teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2019\n\n2021\n\n(in absolute terms: tonnes of CO2 equivalent at constant scope, as per the GHG Protocol )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B/ Reducing energy consumption and making increased use of renewable energy\n\n## Reducing energy consumption\n\nFor  over  20  years,  the  Group  has  been  endeavouring  to reduce  its  energy  consumption.

The  Sharing  Beauty With All programme initiated the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 24% per unit sold per kilometre between 2011 and 2020.\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  commitments,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  going  further  and has set itself a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50% per finished product by 2030. The scope of consolidation covers  the  transportation  flows  of  finished  products  from  the production sites up to the first customer delivery point.\n\nThe  commitments  have  been  shared  with  the  entire  internal and  external  transport  ecosystem:  sustainable  transportation was  ranked  as  a  priority  and  one  of  the  major  strategic components  of  the  Group's  sustainability  transformation. L'Or\u00e9al's sustainable transport strategy is based on five pillars with  particular  emphasis  on  the  heaviest  contributors  to  the greenhouse gas emissions related to product transport-the use of air and road transport.\n\nThe sustainable transport strategy was built on five pillars:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. The  sustained  and  ongoing  reduction  in  the  use  of  air transport and the specific monitoring measures put in place\n\nThe  reduction  of  air  transport  is  a  pillar  of  the  distribution strategy.  It  is  included  in  the  budget  targets  of  each  Division and  is  integrated  into  our  sourcing  strategies;  for  example, by favouring local production.\n\nIn 2021, the Group transported 0.4% of its products by weight by air,  representing 44.5% of its transportation-related carbon footprint. As a result, the total carbon footprint of air transport in 2021 was reduced by 7% compared to 2020.\n\nThe  Group  continues  to  capitalise  on  its  earlier  results,  and continues to reduce the carbon footprint of air transport with a  7%  reduction  in  2021  compared  to  2020  (-43%  in  2020 compared to 2019).\n\nFor example:\n\n- \u00b7 the  commitment  and  collaboration  of  its  supply  chain, operations  and  sales  teams  made  it  possible  for  the L'Or\u00e9al Luxe Division to reduce its CO2 emissions by 25% from 2020; and\n- \u00b7 the programme deployed in China reduced the tonnage of  the  CO2  emissions  tied  to  the  importation  of  finished products into the country by 10% compared to 2020.\n\nThe  implementation  and  use  of  the  online  platform  Global Freight Cockpit also provided precise monthly oversight of air transport  activity,  with  visibility  by  site,  by  brand,  and  by goods  flow  line,  leading  to  more  informed  and  proactive decision-making. Related information is shared with all of the Group's  Management  Committees  and  stakeholders  at performance review meetings or specific meetings focused on this subject.\n\n## 2. The Greener Lanes programme dedicated to long-distance road transport\n\nThis  programme  implements  solutions  that  will  reduce  CO2 emissions  on  long-distance  road  flows  with  the  highest emissions. In 2021, transportation of finished products by road represented 46.6% of the Group's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTo  cut  these  emissions,  new  solutions  are  being  rolled  out gradually  for  all flows between  the  Group's  factories, distribution centres and customers:\n\n- \u25cf the use of multimodal transport with, for example, the use of river or rail freight as an alternative to roads; and\n- \u25cf using  energy  with  a  lower  environmental  impact,  such  as biogas or biofuel vehicles, as an alternative to diesel.\n\nThus,  the  Group  has  identified  priority  transport  lines,  which requires a change to an alternative method of transport, one of the main ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThese priority lines have been identified according to several factors,  including:  the  distance  traveled,  the  weight  of  the finished  products  transported,  and  their  contribution  to  the CO2 emissions related to road transport.\n\nAs a result, new solutions were deployed in 2021. For example:\n\n- \u25cf 29  multimodal,  rail  or  maritime,  transport  lines  or  transport using  alternative  energy  such  as  HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) or LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) have been put in place in Europe;\n- \u25cf in  Brazil,  a  biomethane  solution  has  been  implemented between  the  Sao  Paulo  factory  and  the  Rio  De  Janeiro distribution centre; and\n- \u25cf in  Mexico,  a  rail  flow  has  been  set  up  between  the subsidiary's distribution centre and customers located in the North-West of the country.\n- 3. The  GLAM (Green  Last  Mile) programme  targets  the implementation of solutions that will reduce CO2 emissions from urban transport.\n\nThe  Group  is  also  specifically  addressing  the  environmental impact  of  urban  transport  with  the  goal  of  deploying lower-impact solutions such as electric vehicles, cargo-bikes or vehicles running on natural gas.\n\n4",

In  2021,  a  number  of initiatives were implemented combining deliveries on bicycles, in  biogas  and  electric  vehicles,  which  also  contributes  to  a reduction of emissions of fine particles in urban areas.\n\nFor  example,  in  2021,  as  part  of  the  overall  decarbonisation strategy in the North Asia Zone, the Group introduced cargo bikes in Tokyo in Japan, a key country in the region.\n\nIn  China,  70%  of  urban  deliveries  in  Shanghai  use  more sustainable vehicles (electric, biofuel, and gas).\n\nThe  Group's  goal  is  to  expand  this  programme  to  50  cities by 2025.\n\n## 4. Performance  management,  an  important  aspect  of  the Group's strategy\n\nFor  several  years,  the  Group  committed  to  a  sustainable decarbonisation policy and has implement robust action plans that are specific to each country.\n\nDigitalisation  that  facilitates  access  to  data  is  a  strategic vector:  by  analysing  the  precise  data  associated  with  the upstream  and  downstream  transport  from  the  distribution centres  of  the  Group's  commercial  subsidiaries,  the  supply chain and  transport  teams  are  thus  able  to  prioritize  their actions according to their impact.\n\nThis  regular  monitoring  of  action  plans  and  performance across  all  modes  of  transport  used  is  key  to  provide  internal and  external  stakeholders  with  the  visibility  they  need  to implement the Group's carbon footprint reduction strategy.\n\nThus, the Global  Freight  Cockpit was  developed  and deployed in 2020. These tools monitor all the Group's air and sea  flows.  In  addition,  the  Transport  Management  Systems (TMS),  which  are  operational  in  a  number  of  countries,  give access to operational data for a pertinent and precise analysis of performance.\n\n## 5. Working  in  partnership  with  the  stakeholders  in  its ecosystem:  a  key  driver  of  the  Group's  carbon  footprint reduction roadmap\n\nThe Group selects and assesses its suppliers and transportation partners considering their environmental and social policy and the  actions  they  take  to  support  the  Group  in  its  efforts  to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nTheir ability to create innovative sustainable solutions, such as green  energies  (biogas,  biofuel,  or  hydrogen)  or  alternative modes of transport (cargo bikes, train), is an essential selection criterion.\n\nThe Group also carries out regular monitoring to identify new opportunities and organises workshops on the decarbonisation of transportation with its partners.\n\nDuring  strategic  meetings  with  its  partners,  decarbonisation  of transport and monitoring of the implementation of the previously defined  action  plans  are  routinely  discussed.  Specific  in-depth discussions are organised if necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(tonnes of CO /two.denominator equivalent per unit sold)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe transport of products led to 450,460 tonnes of CO /two.denominator equivalent being emitted in 2021, which represents 69/uni00A0g/CO /two.numerator per unit sold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's carbon footprint linked to the transport of finished products rose by 12% between 2016 and 2021. This change is primarily due to the increase in the use of air transport over the same period because of the growth of the Asian markets and the increase in the Luxury Division flows to this zone.\n\nBetween  2020  and  2021,  global  consolidation  of  the  CO2 emissions  related  to  the  transport  of  finished  products  shows stable CO2 emissions (-0.4%), a 3.6% decrease in intensity of the Group's  carbon  footprint  (gCO2/unit  sold)  over  the  same period. In 2021, CO2 emissions linked to air transport fell by 7% compared  to  2020,  with  a  beneficial  carry-over  to  maritime and  rail  transport  modes,  the  use  and  carbon  footprint  of which increased by 19% and 16%, respectively.\n\nThanks to the actions put in place by the Supply Chain teams across the five pillars of the Group's transport decarbonisation strategy,  as  described  above,  CO2  emissions  per  tonne  of goods transported and per kilometre traveled decreased by 14% from 2020.",

Preserving water resources on operated sites\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Group  is  committed  to  preserving  water  resources throughout  its  value  chain,  especially  on  each  of  the  sites operated.  The  action  plans  implemented  around  the  world are based notably on the following key principles:\n\n- \u00b7 mapping  the  volumes  of  water  used,  particularly  by  the Group's factories,  using  a  L'Or\u00e9al  internal  tool  that  carries out a comprehensive analysis of the various uses of water on a site: the Waterscan tool. Each type of use is quantified and compared with a benchmark value in order to identify potential reductions;\n- \u00b7 the  installation  of  reduction  equipment  and  processes, particularly  during  the  cleaning  phase  of  production equipment  and  factory  filling  and  packing  lines,  following the  OPTICIP  (OPTImisation  Cleaning  In  Place)  approach developed by L'Or\u00e9al; and\n- \u00b7 the  reuse  of  untreated  industrial  water  for  a  new  purpose and recycling of the water used, after a specific additional treatment step.\n\nBy  the  end  of  2021,  17  Group  factories  had  such  recycling facilities allowing them to reuse process water.\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, the Group set a new target for 2030: 100% of the water used in our industrial processes  will  be  recycled  and  reused  in  a  loop, i.e. 100% of factories will be Waterloop factories.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  6  factories \u2611 were  awarded  the  status of Waterloop Factory, i.e. 15% of the Group's factories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The 'Waterloop Factory' concept\n\nThe  'Waterloop  Factory'  concept  consists  of  using  city mains  water  only  for  human  consumption  and  for  the production  of  the  high-quality  water  used  as  raw  material for product processing; all the water required by the utilities (cleaning  equipment,  steam  production,  etc.)  is  derived from water that is reused or recycled in a loop on the site.\n\nIt involves the implementation of a two-step system:\n\n- \u00b7 the  optimisation  of  industrial  processes  in  order  to minimise water consumption, which leads to a reduction of water withdrawals; and\n\n## WATER WITHDRAWAL AT INDUSTRIAL SITES\n\nAs  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  the  Group has  set  itself  a  new  target  for  2030:  to  reduce  the  water withdrawal of factories and distribution centres by 30% per 100 hours worked by 30%, compared to 2019.\n\nThe total volume of water withdrawal of the industrial sites at the  industrial  sites  was  2,057  thousands  m 3 for  2021 \u2611 , decreased by 5% compared to 2019, while the production of finished products decreased by 0.4% over the same period.\n\nWater withdrawal was 0.34 litres per finished product in 2021 \u2611 , representing a decrease of 5% from 2019 (and a decrease of 8% from 2020).\n\n- \u00b7 the  installation  of  a  water  recycling  system:  industrial wastewater, after pre-treatment in the on-site treatment plant, are reprocessed  using various technologies (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, etc.) in  order  to  extract  very  high-quality  water.  This  is  then used in a loop to clean production tools and services as a replacement for municipal mains water. As such, water requirements for utilities are fully covered.\n\nThe  Waterloop  Factory  concept  was  adopted  for  the  first time  in  2017  by  the  Burgos  factory  in  Spain.  In  2021,  this concept  was  also  extended  to  the  factories  in  Settimo  in Italy, Vorsino in Russia, Libramont in Belgium, Mexico City in Mexico and Yichang in China. It will gradually be deployed to all Group factories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This  difference  between  the  decrease  in  hours worked on-site and the withdrawal of water is primarily linked to  the  nature  of  activities  that  continued  on  the  sites (laboratories, pilots, etc.), which are water consuming.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in litres per 100 hours worked)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## WATER CONSUMPTION AND QUANTITATIVE WATER FOOTPRINT OF PRODUCTION SITES\n\nWater is a resource that requires local management tailored to the watershed in which a site is located. A watershed is the land irrigated  by  water  sources  and  waterways  that  converge towards the same point. Availability, access, and water needs may  vary  greatly  from  one  watershed  to  another:  they  differ depending on the nature and intensity of human activities, and according to the natural needs of ecosystems.\n\nIn order to take into account this local aspect of water-related issues,  the  Group  created  a  new  indicator  in  2021:    the quantitative  water  footprint.  It  is  calculated  based  on  the water  consumption  of  a  site  (the  difference  between  the water withdrawal and the wastewater at the exit of the site) and  the  level  of  water  stress  in  the  watershed  in  which  it  is located.\n\nWater stress describes the gap between the need for and the availability of water resources for a given watershed.\n\nThe  quantitative  water  footprint  is  calculated  only  for  the factories,  which  are  the  sites  that  account  for  the  majority of  the  Group's  water  withdrawal  (they  represent  85%  of  the withdrawals of all the sites operated by the Group in 2021).\n\nIn  2021,  10  of  the  Group's  39  factories  were  located  in watersheds  subject  to  water  stress,  representing  26%  of  the Group's factories.\n\n| Water consumption and quantitative water footprint of the Group's factories   | 2021         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Municipal water withdrawn (or other supplier) (m 3 )                          | 1,718,988    |\n| Rain water (m 3 )                                                             | 92           |\n| Water withdrawn from groundwater (m3)                                         | 256,003      |\n| Total withdrawal (m 3 )                                                       | 1,975,083  \u2611 |\n| Wastewater at the exit of the site (m 3 )                                     | 885,423      |\n| Water consumption (m 3 )                                                      | 1,089,660    |\n| Quantitative water footprint (m3eq)                                           | 8,511,553  \u2611 |\n\n## The Water Disclosure Project: a CDP initiative for transparency in information on water and water risk management across the value chain\n\nSince  2010,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  taken  part  in  the  Water  Disclosure Project, of which it is one of the Founding Responders. This programme  is  aimed  at  encouraging  companies  to  publish every year their water management strategy, their results and the projects they have launched to improve their performances  and  to  reduce  the  risks  with  regard  to  their activities  related  to  water  consumption.  It  was  launched  by the CDP, an important, independent not-for-profit organisation\n\nthat  promotes  transparency  and  environmental  information reporting on several issues: climate change, water, deforestation, etc.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  recognised  for  the  sixth  consecutive year as one of the world leaders for its strategy and actions in  sustainable  water  management  throughout  its  entire value chain, from the production of raw materials to the use of  products by consumers and the end of life of products, receiving a score of 'A', which is the highest possible level of performance in the CDP ranking.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also working with its Supply Chain on sustainable water  management  (see  section  4.3.1.2.2.

Protecting biodiversity on operated sites\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  limiting  the  impact  of  its  activity  on biodiversity  throughout its value chain, especially on each of the  sites  it  operates.  Projects  that  promote  the  protection  or development of biodiversity were initiated on most of the sites, along  with  actions  to  raise  awareness  among  employees. All  these  actions  must  be  harmonised  with  the  environment in which these sites are located.\n\nIn 2018, in addition to the rules laid down by L'Or\u00e9al on the use of  soils  (see  section  4.3.1.1.2.  'Managing  risks  and  controlling the impact of sites on their environment' of this document), it was  proposed  that  each  of  the  sites  should  implement  a suitable  system  to  roll  out  a  specific  biodiversity  roadmap. Partnerships  with  external  organisations  such  as  the  French League for the Protection of Birds (Ligue pour la Protection des Oiseaux  -  LPO)  may  be  established  to  carry  out  on-site\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt year-end 2021,\n\nAs  part  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  the  Group has  set  itself  a  new  target:  by  2030,  all  buildings  and  all industrial  sites  operated  by  the  Group  will  have  a  positive impact on biodiversity compared to 2019.\n\nA methodology for monitoring this commitment  was developed in 2021 and will be rolled out to all of the Group's sites in 2022.  Becoming 'net biodiversity positive' is achieved through:\n\n- \u00b7 Meeting  a  target  for  the  improvement  of  habitat  and biodiversity  quality:  at  site  level,  this  improvement  is measured  using  an  indicator  called  the  Site  Biodiversity Score (SBS). The information required to calculate the SBS is taken  from  biodiversity inventories. This enables  the improvement in the quality of biodiversity on a given site to be assessed and monitored; and\n- \u00b7 Reaching  a  biodiversity  culture  threshold::  developing  a biodiversity  culture  involves  raising  awareness  among  and training  all  teams  at  a  site,  incorporating  biodiversity considerations into the roll-out of new projects (extending a building,  etc.)  and  into  the  everyday  life  of  the  site (responsible purchasing, awareness of food waste, etc.).\n\nIn addition, L'Or\u00e9al wishes to eliminate the use of phytosanitary products  (insecticides, fungicides, and  herbicides)  in the maintenance of green spaces, as they can have an impact on the environment and human health. Sites operated by the Group must report on whether or not these products are being used.\n\nThe  Group  commits  to  ensuring  that  phytosanitary  products are not used on any of the sites it operates by 2030.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 143 sites, i.e. 84% of L'Or\u00e9al sites, do not or no  longer  use  phytosanitary  products  to  maintain  green spaces.\n\nbiodiversity  inventories  and  propose  suitable  action  plans. These  inventories  take  into  account  local,  regional  and national challenges, and cover soil permeability, the proportion  and  connection  of  green  spaces,  the  diversity  of habitats  and  plant  populations,  the  number  of  species  (flora and  fauna),  including  protected,  endangered,  and  invasive species. In this way, the inventories contribute towards a basis of scientific knowledge in order to define targeted biodiversity action plans, conducted with associations or local experts, in line  with  the  ecosystem  in  which  the  sites  operate.  These projects  may  result  in  the  transformation  of  available  spaces on-site  to  promote  biodiversity.  They  may  also  contribute  to actions  aimed  at  educating  L'Or\u00e9al  employees  and  local stakeholders  by  encouraging  them  to  better  connect  with nature  and  thus  enabling  them  to  become  key  players  in protecting biodiversity.\n\nAt year-end 2021, 80 biodiversity inventories were conducted in the Group, 73% of which by industrial sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n80\n\nsites conducted a biodiversity inventory.\n\n## 4.3.1.1.6. Preserving resources and reducing waste on operated sites\n\nFor several years, an ambitious approach  to waste optimisation that goes well beyond regulatory compliance has been implemented in the Group within the framework of the Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  and  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future  programme  is  continuing  this  work.  An  ambitious challenge,  in  light  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  exacting  definition  of  waste. Indeed,  any  solid  discharge  that  is  not  a  finished  product intended  for  consumers  is  considered  as  waste,  whatever  its treatment and future recovery.\n\nAs part of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme , the Group set a  new target for  2030  to  preserve  natural  resources:  100%  of the waste generated on the operated sites will be recovered (reused, or recycled).\n\nFurthermore, building on the Sharing Beauty With All programme, the  Group  has  set  itself  new  targets  for  reducing  the  waste  it generates:\n\n- \u00b7 reducing the waste production of factories and distribution centres  by  30%  per  finished  product,  compared  to  2019; and\n- \u00b7 reducing  the  waste  production  of  administrative  sites  and research centres by 30% per 100 hours worked, compared to 2019.\n\nFinally, L'Or\u00e9al remains committed to ensuring that none of its waste is sent to landfill (without regulatory constraints).\n\n4",

It  is  an  environmental  performance  indicator,  first for its industrial sites, administrative sites, and research centres, but also across the entire value chain of the Group:\n\n- \u00b7 for  the  packaging  teams,  who  are  mobilised  through  an eco-design  approach  to  filling  and  packing  components and  transportation packaging  (reduction  of weight, optimisation,  reuse,  etc.)  aimed  at  reducing  waste  and improving their recyclability;\n- \u00b7 for the purchasing teams, privileged contacts with suppliers, with  the  aim  of  optimising  filling  and  packing  used  for  the transportation of raw materials and packaging components  received  in  the  Group's  factories,  a  major source  of  waste.  The  development  of  the  wall-to-wall approach  (production  of  filling  and  packing  components close  to  the  Group's  production  facilities)  is  a  particularly effective means of reducing waste related to the supply of components at the source;\n- \u00b7 for the industrial teams involved in a process of continuous improvement  of  manufacturing  and  filling  and  packing processes in order to reduce losses during production;\n- \u00b7 for  the  Supply  Chain  teams  who  are  working  to  reduce obsolete inventories, which is essential for the reduction of waste  related  to  the  Group's  business  activities.  In  each zone, programmes combine industrial agility and improved sales forecasts with the aim of reducing obsolete products, and ensuring  better  flows  via  the  establishment  of  outlets, family  sales,  sales  to  staff  and  donations  to  not-for-profit organisations.\n\nFurthermore,  the  Group  has  initiated  a  campaign  against wasting food. In 2021, an average of 3,297 meals were served daily  in  the  Paris  region.  Company  restaurants,  both  those directly  managed  and  those  operating  under  agreements, donated  the  surplus  food  from  these  meals  to  associations such as Restos du c\u0153ur or Le Chainon Manquant, bringing the number of meals donated in 2021 to 3,973.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  adopts  best  practices  in  its  directly  managed restaurants.  An  awareness  programme  for  employees,  the recovery of 100% of food waste via the Bio-Waste system, very strict monitoring of use-by dates and inventories, real-time and on-demand cooking methods, and attention to the quantities served have been implemented in the restaurants.\n\nA number of initiatives are also taken to develop responsible, fair  and  sustainable  food  in  the  Group's  restaurants  and cafeterias.  For  example,  the  development  of  a  fair  trade coffee  supply,  the  proportion  of  local  products  from  organic farming, or the priority given to seasonal fruits and vegetables in menu preparation are applied.\n\nThe  campuses  in  the  Paris  region  also  initiated  actions  to reduce plastic use (elimination of plastic bottles and glasses for services  in  rooms  and  the  elimination  of  plastic  glasses  in cafeterias) and to recycle cooking oil into biofuel.\n\nFor  example,  the  Aulnay-sous-Bois  campus  developed  a special  partnership  with  the  French  Restaurants  du  C\u0153ur charity  based on a food donation agreement for more than 3,455  meals  in  2021  and  solidarity  sales.  It  also  made  the choice  for  supplies  exclusively  based  on  free-range  eggs. Finally, for all its efforts, it earned the 'Mon restau responsable' label established by the Fondation Nicolas Hulot for a quality food  service  that  respects  the  environment.  This  label  is granted  for  four  areas:  the  well-being  of  guests,  sustainable meals,  eco-friendly  practices,  and  a  social  and  local commitment.\n\n## GENERATION OF TRANSPORTABLE WASTE FROM INDUSTRIAL SITES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(in grams per finished product, excluding sludge and returnable packaging in rotation, including returnable packaging at source)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste generation at the industrial sites was 80,363 tonnes for 2021 \u2611 , which is a decrease in absolute value of 1% from 2019 (this  waste  does  not  include  the  sludge  generated  by  the plants  treating  the  wastewater  from  Group  sites),  while  the production of finished products was down 0.4% over the same period.\n\nIn 2021, waste generation for the industrial sites was 13.1 grams per finished product \u2611 ,  representing a 1% decrease from 2019 (an increase of 3% from 2020).\n\n## GENERATION OF TRANSPORTABLE WASTE FROM ADMINISTRATIVE SITES AND RESEARCH CENTRES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+55%\n\n(kilograms per 100 hours worked, excluding sludge and returnable packaging in rotation, including returnable packaging at source)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWaste  generation  at  the  administrative  sites  and  research centres was 4,466 tonnes in 2021, a decrease in absolute value of  29%  compared  to  2019  (this  waste  does  not  include  the sludge generated by the wastewater treatment plants at the Group's sites).\n\nIn  2021,  waste generation from these sites was 13.3 kilograms per  100  hours  worked,  an  increase  of  55%  from  2019 (22% increase from 2020).",

This  method identifies  and  quantifies  the  sources  and  causes  of  waste generation  in  the  different  flows  of  a  site.  This  approach enhances  the  action  plans  to  reduce  waste  and  is  an additional vector of progress for the sites.\n\nAt  each  Group  site,  specific  tracking  (volumetry,  collection streams,  treatments,  etc.)  of  waste  that  is  subject  to  special regulations (flammable, toxic, etc.) is implemented, taking into consideration  the  specific  characteristics  of  each  country  in which the site operates. Regulated waste benefits, as does all waste, from a continuous improvement approach.\n\n| Regulated waste (tonnes)                  | 2019   | 2020   | 2021     | Variation vs. 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|----------------------|\n| L'Or\u00e9al Group                             | 19,230 | 17,812 | 19,551   | 10%                  |\n| Industrial sites                          | 18,667 | 17,359 | 18,922 \u2611 | 9%                   |\n| Administrative sites and research centres | 563    | 453    | 629      | 39%                  |\n\nIn  2021,  the  portion  of  regulated  waste  produced  in  the  Group  changes  in  proportion  to  the  increase  in  waste  production compared to 2020.\n\n## Recovering the waste generated\n\nThe  Group  has  adopted  a  systematic  approach  to  the preservation  of  materials.  As  such,  beyond  the  reduction  at source,  the  Group  is  also  committed  to  finding  the  best solutions to energy recovery the waste it produces.\n\nWork  in  collaboration  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Research  laboratories and  a  waste  treatment  company  began  in  2020  to  find solutions for recycling finished products that cannot be sold or donated.\n\nA  study  also  began  in  2020  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Research Laboratories  to  find  material  recovery  alternatives  for  the sludge coming from the Group's purification stations.\n\nIn  2021,  97%  of  the  waste  generated  by  industrial  sites  was recovered through re-use, recycling or energy recovery, and 59%  was  recovered  through  re-use,  or  recycling,  thereby preserving the material \u2611 .\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  itself  the  goal  of  achieving  'zero  waste  to landfill'  by  the  end  of  2030  for  all  sites  (without  regulatory constraints). Work has been done with specialised companies and  local  authorities  to  implement  appropriate  treatment solutions.  The  mobilisation  of  all  the  factories  and  distribution centres  ensured  the  achievement  of  the  'zero  waste  to landfill'  objective  for  the  fourth  consecutive  year  (without regulatory constraints).\n\nIn 2021, all the Group's factories and distribution centres reached the goal of achieving 'zero waste to landfill' (without regulatory constraints).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The Statutory Auditors have expressed reasonable assurance about this indicator. \uf052\n\nAt the administrative sites and research centres, the process is more  recent,  but  has  accelerated:  the  waste  sent  to  landfill (without  regulatory  constraints)  was  reduced  in  2021  by  15% from 2020, representing a quantity of 51 tonnes.\n\n4",

More  than  900  suppliers  participated  in  these interactive exchanges in 2021.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.1. Due diligence: selection and assessment of strategic suppliers\n\n## A/ Incorporating suppliers' environmental and social performance into their selection and assessment\n\nThe Group has decided to use the environmental and social performance  of  its  partners  and  suppliers  as  a  key  selection criterion.  On  this  basis,  the  commitments  under  the  Sharing Beauty  With  All  programme,  and  now  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future programme, fit in with and follow on from those in the Group's responsible purchasing policy initiated in 2002 with the L'Or\u00e9al Buy & Care programme.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  published  a  new  sustainable  Sourcing  strategy, which  builds  on  the  previous  strategy  and  focuses  on  four pillars: protection  of  Human  Rights,  preservation  of  the environment and resources, the integrity of business relationships and diversity and inclusion.\n\nFor each  pillar,  the  commitments,  targets,  values  and standards  that  L'Or\u00e9al  shares  with  its  suppliers  are  set  out. These targets have been designed with external experts on the basis  of  recognised  benchmarks.  The  tools  for  monitoring progress are also specified. This strategy provides a common framework  for  integrating  these  issues  into  the  heart  of  the business  model  and  taking  action  to  achieve  sustainable performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  CSR  commitments  and  performance  of  suppliers  play  a significant role in the choice of the Group's business partners. In  this  respect,  L'Or\u00e9al's  purchasing  teams  have  defined  five performance pillars that make it possible to assess and choose suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 quality;\n- \u00b7 corporate social responsibility;\n- \u00b7 innovation;\n- \u00b7 the Supply Chain & Service; and\n- \u00b7 competitiveness.\n\nThese pillars form the basis for daily performance and long-term strategies.  A  global  scorecard  has  been  deployed  for  all purchasing fields and makes it possible to accurately measure supplier  results,  in  particular  their  compliance  with  their corporate  social  responsibility  commitments  which  represent 20% of the final assessment.\n\nThe  CSR  strategy  and  action  plans  of  the  suppliers  are  fully integrated into their relationship with L'Or\u00e9al and are therefore discussed  at  strategic  meetings  (Business  Reviews).  As  such, 627 business reviews were conducted in 2021. The evaluation of  suppliers  on  the  CSR  pillar  is  based,  in  particular,  on  their compliance  with  their  social  audits,  the  implementation  of Solidarity Sourcing projects and their results in the 'CDP Supply Chain' programme for the reduction of CO2 emissions.\n\nAll  the  suppliers  evaluated  represent  more  than  85%  of  total direct purchases (raw materials, filling and packing components, subcontracting and electronic devices) and 10% of indirect purchases.\n\nTo  give  suppliers  access  to  Group  training  tools  designed  to optimise their sustainable development policies, an online site dedicated  to  suppliers  has  been  operational  since  2016. It  offers  e-learning  modules,  videos,  presentations  on  various topics such  as, ethics, climate  change,  social  audits, etc. Today, it is open to all the Group's strategic suppliers and is being progressively expanded to all suppliers.\n\n## B/ Social audits: a rigorous and continuous improvement process\n\nSince  2002,  all  of  the  Group's  suppliers  have  had  to  sign  the Letter of Ethical Commitment. This letter sets out the suppliers' requirements  and  commitments  in  accordance  with  the Group's programmes and policies concerning ethics, corporate responsibility, Human Rights, and compliance.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  released  an  updated  version  of  this document,  now  entitled  the  'Mutual  Ethical  Commitment Letter',  which  highlights  the  mutual  commitment  between L'Or\u00e9al  and  its  suppliers.  This  document  covers,  in  particular, the issues of Human Rights and working conditions. The letter is being  rolled  out  gradually  to  all  suppliers  worldwide  (see section 3.4. 'Vigilance Plan' of this document).\n\nThe Group's subcontractors and its suppliers of raw materials, packaging, production equipment and POS/promotional  advertising items located in countries identified as being at risk according to Verisk Maplecroft are subject to a mandatory social audit (and prior to any inclusion on the supplier panel) aimed notably at ensuring compliance with applicable laws, Human Rights and labour law. This audit also covers employee safety and working conditions, and the way  in  which  the  impact  of  activities  on  the  environment  is taken into account.\n\nThe  social  audits  are  carried  out  on  behalf  of  L'Or\u00e9al  by independent external service providers.\n\nThe  initial  audits  and  re-audits  three  years  later  are  financed by the Group. Follow-up audits that make it possible to verify the  effectiveness  of  the  action  plans  are  paid  for  by  the suppliers.\n\n4",

In addition  to  its  own  assessment,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  mandated Ecovadis  to  evaluate  its  suppliers'  sustainable  development policies  with  the  aim  of  fine-tuning  the  analysis  of  supplier performance  and  assisting  suppliers in improving their performance  by  identifying  areas  for  improvement.  The Ecovadis  assessment  allows  L'Or\u00e9al  not  only  to  involve  its suppliers  in  Sustainable  Development,  but  also  to  encourage them  to  develop  their  ethics  policies  with  a  focus  on combating  corruption,  monitoring  the  health  and  safety  of their  employees  and  the  application  of  their  sustainable purchasing policies (see section 4.3.3. 'Human rights policy' of this document).\n\n## 2021 results\n\nIn  2021,  767  suppliers  conducted  an  Ecovadis  assessment  of their  social,  environmental,  and  ethical  policies,  as  well  as  the implementation of those policies by their own suppliers in 2021. 331 of them represented 82% of the Group's strategic suppliers, all areas combined.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  social  audit  is  largely  based  on  the  internationally recognised  SA  8000  standard.  The  Group  has  also  imposed more stringent criteria, particularly with regard to the minimum age for child labour. It is set at 16 years of age for all employees working for suppliers, a higher age limit than the minimum age required by the Fundamental Conventions of the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\n## Key figures\n\nOver  9,300  supplier  sites  have  been  audited  since  the reporting tool was implemented in 2006 (see section 3.4.7.3. 'Results  of  the  application  of  the  plan  to  suppliers'  of  this document):\n\n- \u00b7 1,236  audits (1) \u2611 were  carried  out  in  2021, i.e. more than 14,900 since 2006;\n- \u00b7 in  the  context  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis,  technical resources  were  deployed  by  the  Group  to  organise remote  audits  of  sites  and  thus  guarantee  health protection  and  social  compliance.  This  method  of auditing  is  valid  under  certain  circumstances  and remains  exceptional.  Since  2020,  79  social  audits  of supplier sites have been organised remotely;\n- \u00b7 Follow-up  audits,  which  verify  the  correction  of  nonconformities, represent 37% of the total number of audits conducted  in  2021  and  allowed  72%  of  the  suppliers audited to improve their results; and\n- \u00b7 98%  of  supplier  production  sites  requiring  audits  have been audited at least once.\n\n## 4.3.1.2.2. Involving strategic suppliers in the Group's ambitions\n\n## A/ Encouraging suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions\n\nSince 2009, L'Or\u00e9al has associated its suppliers in the process for  measuring  and  reducing  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions by  encouraging  them  to  work  with  the  CDP,  within  the framework  of  the  CDP  Supply  Chain  programme.  This international  not-for-profit  organisation,  of  which  L'Or\u00e9al  has been a member since 2003, invites companies to publish their environmental impact and provides them with measurement, evaluation and communication tools.\n\nIn  2021,  565  suppliers  participated  in  the  CDP  Supply  Chain, representing  86%  of  the  658  suppliers  invited.  They  were selected in all purchasing areas, everywhere in the world, both large  industrial  groups  and  small  and  medium  businesses. The average of the 2021 Supplier results was 'C'.\n\nIn the direct purchases category, the suppliers participating in the  CDP  Supply  Chain  programme  account  for  87%  of expenditures made in 2021. Among them, 227 suppliers have assigned their emissions to L'Or\u00e9al. The average score of the direct suppliers is 'C'.",

Since  then,  suppliers have been encouraged to:\n\n- \u00b7 participate in the CDP Supply Chain;\n- \u00b7 set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; and\n- \u00b7 communicate about their action plans in order to succeed in those plans.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  the  suppliers  meeting  this  commitment represented  77%  of  expenditures  on  direct  purchases.  The average score of these suppliers is  'B-',  the  best  score  since the start of the programme.\n\n## Associating the Group's suppliers in the CDP Forest Disclosure Project\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  a  target  of  Zero  Deforestation  to ensure  the  traceability  of  products  linked  to  deforestation (palm oil and derivatives, paper, soya, replanting projects,\n\netc.) and has also participated in CDP Forest since 2012.\n\nWith the new CDP Forest programme devoted to the Supply Chain which was launched in 2018, L'Or\u00e9al has\n\nAs part of its  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme, the Group is committed to supporting its strategic suppliers to put in place plans  to  reduce  their  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  50% between 2016 and 2030 (Scopes 1 and 2, in tonnes).\n\nIn 2021,  the  Group  set  out  the  methodology  and  the fundamental requirements needed to engage suppliers based on their emissions contributions and to manage their emissions performance with each of them. This emissions management is based on the volume of emissions reported in the responses to  the  CDP  questionnaires  for  those  taking  part  in  the programme, or based on available and verified data.\n\nFor each of these suppliers, an emissions reduction plan will be shared  depending  on  the  commitments  they  have  already made  (for  example,  suppliers  seriously  committed  to  the Science-Based Targets initiative).\n\n## Associating the Group's suppliers in the CDP Water Disclosure Project\n\nAs part of the Sharing Beauty With All programme, L'Or\u00e9al has  undertaken  to  reduce  its  water  footprint,  joining  the Water  Disclosure  Project,  an  initiative  aimed  at  measuring and reducing suppliers' water footprints,  as  soon  as  it  was launched in 2013.\n\nIn  2021,  for  the  seventh  edition  of  the  Water  Disclosure Project Supply Chain programme, L'Or\u00e9al selected 333 of its suppliers,  mainly  of  raw  materials,  filling  and  packing components  and  subcontracting  on  the  following  three criteria:  technology  consuming  particularly  large  amounts of  water,  location  of  at  least  one  production  site  in  a\n\nL'Or\u00e9al continues to be recognised by the CDP as one of the companies  most  committed  to  reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions.  The  majority  of  the  Group's  suppliers  who  are partners  of  the  CDP  testifies  to  this  fact.  This  growing commitment results in particular from the strong commitment of L'Or\u00e9al's Purchasing and Environmental teams who transmit results  with  comments  and  opportunities  for  improvement  to the suppliers who participated. In 2021 these teams:\n\n- \u00b7 organised, together with the CDP, meetings to explain and train on climate change for suppliers;\n- \u00b7 led online conferences for suppliers entering the programme; and\n- \u00b7 continued  to  develop  online  toolboxes  to  help  suppliers understand these issues.\n\nThe  CDP  Supply  Chain  assessment  is  at  the  heart  of  the discussions during annual business reviews, but also throughout the year, in the context of our interactions with suppliers.\n\nencouraged its  201  main  suppliers  of  paper,  palm  oil  and soya to participate in the CDP Supply Chain. At the end of 2021, 124 of the selected suppliers had participated in this third year. Suppliers that reported and implemented a zero deforestation policy and related initiatives represented 25% of expenditure in respect of all selected suppliers (raw  materials,  packaging  components,  subcontracting and electronic devices).\n\nTheir average score was B.\n\nIn  co-operation with the suppliers in question, an action plan will be drawn up and monitored, highlighting the decarbonisation  drivers  that  are  suited  to  their  business  and their specific circumstances.\n\n## B/ Encouraging suppliers to use water responsibly\n\nAs  part  of  the  new  sustainability  programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed to supporting its strategic suppliers to manage their water sustainably.\n\nThe Group wants to ensure that each of its strategic suppliers implements a sustainable water management plan and takes into account, in terms of its industrial water consumption and wastewater treatment, the condition of the drainage basin in which it operates.\n\nhydric-stress  area  and  the  size  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  purchase volumes. 221 of them agreed to take part in the programme and  will  be  given  an  individual  results  sheet  showing  the comments of the Group's environmental experts, which will enable them to identify  the  key  points  for  progress.  L'Or\u00e9al also  encourages these suppliers  to  measure,  report  and  set water  consumption  reduction  targets  for  each  of  their production sites and  to  deploy  a  water-related  risk assessment and management system.\n\nAt  the  end  of  2021,  suppliers  fulfilling  this  commitment represented  61%  of  the  expenses  incurred  on  all  suppliers, raw materials, filling and packing components, subcontracting  and electronic  devices  selected.

While being a company committed to demonstrating  strong  corporate  citizenship,  L'Or\u00e9al  makes  a contribution  to  many  local  projects.  As  a  general  rule,  the Group's  establishments  and  subsidiaries  build  good  relations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith  the  communities  in  the  areas  in  which  they  operate, and make every effort to share their growth with them.\n\nWithin  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  this  goal became a reality in 2020, with more than 100,000 people from underprivileged or poor communities accessing work. L'Or\u00e9al for the Future aims to double the number of beneficiaries, with an additional 100,000 beneficiaries by 2030.\n\nCreated in 2010, Solidarity Sourcing is L'Or\u00e9al's global inclusive purchasing  programme.  In  2021,  89,093  economically  or socially  vulnerable  people  benefited  from  decent,  lasting employment  under  this  programme  (see  section  4.3.3.6. 'Measures taken in favour of communities' of this document). This  represents  an  additional  7,955  people  compared  to  2020, an increase of nearly 10%.\n\nIn 2021, 89,093 the Solidarity Sourcing programme, 7,955 more people than in 2020.\n\npeople accessed work through\n\nThis programme aims to use the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion. It consists of teaming up with suppliers to give  people  who  are  generally  excluded  from  the  labour market access to work and a sustainable income.\n\n## Solidarity Sourcing and female entrepreneurship\n\nIn  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  continued  to  accelerate  its  Solidarity Sourcing  strategy  to  support  female  entrepreneurs  in  16 countries: 2,427 full-time jobs supported by suppliers owned,\n\nConvinced  of  the  need  to  act  collectively  to  transform  the corporate business model and increase the impact, the Group joined  the  Business  For  Inclusive  Growth  (B4IG)  coalition  from the beginning. This initiative, which was officially launched at the  G7  summit  in  Biarritz  in  August  2019  and  is  housed  within the OECD, covers 40 international companies that decided to join forces around the central issue of fighting inequalities.\n\nIn this framework, L'Or\u00e9al:\n\n- \u25cf also  made  a  commitment  as  the  leader  of  the  working group on inclusive purchasing and the issue of living wages in supply chains;\n- \u25cf provided the complete method and 10-year experience of its  inclusive  purchasing  Solidarity  Sourcing  programme  to the coalition; and\n- \u25cf is  also  a  driver  in  several  business  projects  with  a  positive social impact within the B4IG incubator.\n\nIn the particular case of raw material purchases, a prerequisite for Solidarity Sourcing projects is that they combine responsible  agricultural  practices,  environmental  protection and  biodiversity,  and  that  they  generate  a  positive  societal impact,  notably  through  the  implementation  of  fair  trade principles.\n\nThe Group is therefore continuing to open up its procurement process to companies who employ people from economically vulnerable communities, including small companies and those who  have  more  difficulty  in  having  access  to  multinational companies.  Fair practices in the business and  equal opportunities  have  gradually  become  major  pillars  of  the Group's Solidarity Sourcing programme, sustainable purchasing strategy, and growth model.\n\ncontrolled and led by women, nearly four times more than in 2020.

Energy  expenses  represent  nearly  one  third  of  household budgets and 105,000 hectares of forest disappear every year. Since its introduction in 2016, the sustainable and fair sourcing system has striven to combat  energy  poverty  and deforestation  by  facilitating  the  distribution  of  so-called improved  stoves  to  women.  The  project  is  multiplying  its impacts:\n- -household  wood  consumption  has  been  reduced  by half and significant savings are being achieved,\n- -thousands  of  hours  of  unpaid  work  are  avoided (collecting wood, cooking),\n- -working  conditions  have  improved  (60%  less  smoke in rooms), and\n- -CO2 emissions have reduced.",

Sustainability: from product design to end consumer\n\nAs  part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future,  the  new  sustainability programme announced in June 2020, the Group is continuing its  long-standing commitments to keep its activities within the planet's limits. The new targets have been designed to ensure the sustainability of its activities and to reconcile the Group's needs with the preservation of a planet with limited resources.\n\nFor the Group, the preservation of resources is a long-standing commitment  that  applies  to  the  entire  life  cycle  of  our products,  from  their  creation  to  their  use  by  consumers. Whenever  a  product  is  designed,  created  or  updated,  its environmental  and/or  social  profile  is  improved.  Eco-design and  reduction  of  the  environmental  footprint  of  its  product formulas, biodiversity through a raw materials sustainable and responsible  sourcing  policy,  packaging  eco-design  and  a commitment to 'zero deforestation'  are  all  drivers  activated by L'Or\u00e9al to promote sustainable innovation.\n\nIts  diversified  database  of  influencers  and  their  social  media content  enable  brands  such  as  Maybelline  and  NYX  to promote a daring and inclusive vision of beauty.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  USA's  partnership  with  Creator  Deck  illustrates  the unique  value  that  diversity-focused  companies  bring  to  the Group's  brands  and  business  activities  and  how  they  are forstering innovation.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  USA  recorded  22%  of  the  Group's  total performance within the global 'Supplier Diversity' programme, with  618  jobs  at  American  suppliers  that  are  owned  by women, representing one-third of these beneficiaries, but also with  those  holding  the  equivalent  certification  for  minorities, LGBTQIA+, veterans, or disabled people.\n\nTo  support  us  in  the  development  of  our  living  wage strategy and rollout plan, L'Or\u00e9al has partnered with the Fair Wage  Network,  a  meticulous,  internationally  recognised NGO.\n\nIn order to roll out this approach to our strategic suppliers, we need  to  initiate  a  dialogue,  work  together  and  establish common strategic frameworks, in collaboration with partners within  our  supply  chains,  other  companies,  civil  society, governments, etc.\n\nThe  Packaging  &  Development  teams,  the  CSR  team  and the  laboratories  conduct,  together  with  the  Management Committees  of  the  international  brands,  analyses  of  their portfolios of formulas and  their packaging.  Sustainable innovation  plans  are  therefore  systematically  defined  and identified  through  the  use  of  possible  improvement  drivers  for each  range  and  product.  In  addition,  thanks  to  recent developments  in  life  and  environmental  sciences,  the  Group also established a Green Sciences programme to drive change in  its  portfolio  of  raw  materials  and  formulas  through  the development  of  ingredients  with  a  favourable  environmental profile founded on five pillars: innovative agricultural production, biotechnology and fermentation, 'green' extraction, 'green' chemistry and 'green' formulation.\n\nFinally, through its brands and thanks to a scheme that displays the environmental and social impact of its products (Product Impact  Labelling),  the  Group  aims  to  engage  its  consumers and allow them to make informed choices about sustainable consumption.\n\n4",

Eco-designed products\n\nA/ Reducing the environmental footprint of products\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMost  of  the  ingredients  used  in  the  formulas  (over  90%  by weight) have an end of life in domestic wastewater, and are treated  by  more  or  less  advanced  sanitation  systems depending on the geographic area.\n\nAll  formulas marketed by the Group pose no foreseeable risk to the environment. However, as some of the ingredients used in the  formulas  may  have  a  more  or  less  significant environmental  impact,  L'Or\u00e9al  opened  its  first  environmental research  laboratory  in  1995  to  evaluate  and  reduce  the environmental  footprint  of  its  formulas.  Through  this  initiative, the  Group  has  developed  expertise  with  regard  to  the potential  impacts  of  its  cosmetic  products  on  aquatic environments.  Raw  materials  used  in  the  formulation  of products from the design stage are evaluated in such a way as  to  allow  a  strict  selection  of  ingredients.  L'Or\u00e9al  has abstained from registering new raw materials with an adverse environmental profile since 2005.\n\n## Measuring the environmental impact of products\n\nIn 2013, an index was developed to quantify the environmental performance of a cosmetic formula in respect of the aquatic environment. To do this, a calculation method for the Water Footprint specific to cosmetic products was also applied to the entire portfolio of formulas (performance index for  a  formula  based  on  the  environmental  profile  of  its ingredients  in  terms  of  biodegradability  and  aquatic  ecotoxicity).\n\nFor  several  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  carried  out  analyses  of  the  life cycles  of  its  products  in  order  to  identify,  evaluate  and improve their environmental impact.\n\nSince  2017,  the  SPOT  ( Sustainable  Product  Optimisation  Tool ), based  on  a  rigorous  scientific  methodology  for  assessing environmental  impacts,  has  been  rolled  out  to  all  Group brands  (except  recent  acquisitions).  This  tool  calculates  the complete environmental and social footprint of a product in accordance with the European Commission recommendation (Product  Environmental  Footprint)  on  the  use  of  common methods  to  measure  and  communicate  the  environmental performance of products and organisations. SPOT is an integral part of L'Or\u00e9al's product launch processes, making it possible to incorporate  sustainable  innovation  into  the  very  heart  of  the product development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe  SPOT  tool  provides  exhaustive  measurements  of  all environmental  factors  by  integrating  14  impact  factors  used by the European product environmental footprint framework. A standardised version of these different impacts is applied on the  basis  of  the  average  impacts  of  a  European  consumer. Then, to obtain a single value for the product environmental footprint  (formula  and  packaging),  impacts  are  aggregated using a method  based  on  the  planetary  boundaries developed  by  an  international  team  led  by  Professor  Johan Rockstr\u00f6m of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. In a final stage, the footprint is compared to a benchmark in order to obtain a dimensionless  score  between  0  and  10  which  allows  the product design teams to measure their progress.\n\nThe SPOT tools also includes a methodology for measuring the social  impact  of  products  that  was  jointly  developed  with internal  expertise  (formula,  packaging,  factory,  stakeholders) and nine international experts in social life cycle analyses (see paragraph  'Using  the  Group's  purchasing  power  to  serve social inclusion' in section 4.3.1.2.2.).\n\nThe SPOT tool has replaced the previously used environmental and social improvement assessment systems for formulas and packaging. SPOT takes account of more criteria and allows for a  more  complete  and  demanding  analysis  where  the different impacts are weighted according to their contribution to  the  product's  overall  impact.  This  tool  has  allowed assessment  the  environmental  and  social  footprint  of  all products developed in 2021.\n\nTo classify the products according to the benefits offered to the consumer,  all  19  product  types  manufactured  by  the  Group (shampoos, hair care products, shower gels, skincare products, cleansers,  hair  colours,  styling  products,  deodorants,  sun  care products,  make-up,  perfumes,  etc.)  were  analysed.  After defining  around  150  product  categories  that  bring  consumer benefits  and  screening  more  than  40,000  formulas  between 2014  and  2015,  the  performance  of  each  consumer  benefit category was established to allow eco-design of products using the  SPOT  tool  to  ensure  that  all  new  formulas  are  developed with  the  goal  of  an  improved  environmental  profile  with identical benefits for the consumer.\n\nIn 2021, 46% of created or renovated products had an improved environmental profile due to a new formula with a smaller environmental footprint.",

These two parameters have been integrated in the SPOT product eco-design tool.\n\nIt  is  used  by  all  teams  of  product  formulators  to  assess  the biodegradability and water footprint whenever new formulas are created.\n\n100%  of  the  formulas  put  into  production  for  the  first  time  in 2021  have  been  evaluated.  76%  of  them  have  an  improved environmental profile.\n\nAmong  the  new  products  launched  in  2021,  the  products below have formulas with biodegradability levels of over 98% across L'Or\u00e9al's Divisions:\n\n| Honey hand pomade                     | La Proven\u00e7ale Bio   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Regard des Reines                     | Sanoflore           |\n| Nu Dewy Mist                          | Yves Saint Laurent  |\n| Matrix Total Results Weightless Serum | Matrix              |\n\nThe Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme  led  to  a  very significant  increase  in  the  percentage  of  raw  materials  of renewable  origin  and  produced  in  accordance  with  the criteria of green chemistry. In 2021, via the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  continued  to  work  to  achieve  its commitments  regarding  the  biodegradability  of  its  raw materials  portfolio.  A  total  of  82%  of  the  volume  of  raw materials was biodegradable in 2021 and was stable compare to  2020.  A  recalculation  for  the  year  2020  was  done  based  on the new methodology used in 2021.\n\n## Using eco-design to reduce the impact of the product use phase\n\nInnovation  is  also  used  to  reduce  the  impact  of  the  phase during  which  consumers  use  our  products.  In  the  rinse-off cosmetics sector, the main impacts are the carbon and water footprints of the product use phase. As part of its new L'Or\u00e9al for  the  Future  sustainability  commitments,  the  Group  aims  to develop innovative solutions that enable consumers to reduce both the greenhouse gas emissions and the water consumption associated with using its products.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  Covid-19  crisis,  the  Group's  consumers have focused on skincare products, the number one category for  growth  in  the  beauty  market,  and  have  demonstrated  a desire for hair care and colouring, as well as hygiene products. These  categories  are  the  ones  that  contain  most  of  the Group's rinse-off products and therefore contribute heavily to the water consumption by the Group's consumers.\n\nAt  the  same  time  as  hair  salons  reopened  and  particularly dynamic growth in haircare and colouring was observed, the Group significantly reduced the water consumption associated with the use of its products in comparison to 2020.\n\nThe Group's strategy to meet this challenge is based on three pillars:\n\n- \u25cf Innovation  in  routines:  the  Group  continually  adapts  its innovation model to meet all beauty aspirations around the world.  L'Or\u00e9al  wants  to  allow  its  consumers  to  reduce  the use  phase  by  offering  new  innovations  in  the  areas  of product  use  and  routines,  with  the  goal  of  reducing  the impact of the usage phase by eliminating the rinse phase, for example. In 2021, the Garnier brand, through its Ultra Soft universe,  marketed  leave-in  conditioners  contained  in  a cardboard tube. This eco-designed technology (91%  biodegradable  and  94%  renewable  ingredients) eliminates the usual need to rinse off with water as required by traditional conditioners.\n- \u25cf The  deployment of technologies: the Group is developing equipment that will reduce water consumption in salons by collaborating with its ecosystem to develop new solutions. The Group has also partnered with the Swiss start-up Gjosa to  optimise  the  rinse-off  technology  of  shampoos  and thereby  limit  the  quantity  of  water  used.  In  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al and Gjosa announced that they were designing a shower head that can rinse off shampoo using just 1.5 litres of water (instead of the 8 litres normally used). Called L'Or\u00e9al Water Saver , this sustainable hair-care technology for use in salons and at home was presented at the Consumer Electric Show in January 2021.\n\nThe  emission  factors (1) of  the  energy  used  in  the  countries  in which L'Or\u00e9al sells its products vary according to their energy mix.  Given  the  changes  in  the  distribution  of  the  sales  and emission  factors  of  the  countries  since  2016,  greenhouse  gas emissions have been favourably decorrelated from the water consumption associated with the use of the products.\n\nIn addition, this positive change in greenhouse gas emissions is also  due  to  the  reduction  in  the  use  of  certain  types  of aerosols,  thus  reducing  CO2  emissions  from  the  use  phase  of products that do not require water.\n\n- \u25cf A  reduction  in  the  quantity  of  water  used  for  rinse-off products. This means the development of formulation bases that offer better rinsability. For example, the Garnier brand made available to its consumers solid shampoos that offer a 20% saving in the rinse volume used.\n\n4",

To do so, the Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ngives  preference,  in  particular,  to  the  use  of  renewable  raw materials (1) and  ensures  that  they  are  responsibly  sourced. L'Or\u00e9al  has  adopted  green  chemistry  principles  to  promote the use of renewable raw materials, to design products serving to reduce waste and preserve the water cycle. For more than ten  years,  green  chemistry  has  been  a  catalyst  for  L'Or\u00e9al's sustainable  innovation  policy.  In  the  broadest  sense,  green chemistry aims to prevent upstream pollution and to combat the use and contamination of the environment at source. The increasing use of plant-based ingredients presents risks in terms of  supply  related  to  the  consequences  of  climate  change (availability  and  price),  and  can  also  result  in  environmental consequences  through  the  cultivation  of  the  crops  that produce  these  ingredients  (deforestation,  soil  depletion, consequences on biodiversity, for instance).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, among the raw materials newly referenced by the Group 63% in number were renewable and 40% in number respected green chemistry\n\n| Products marketed in 2021 with a proportion of renewable raw materials above 98%   |                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Blowout solid serum                                                                | Softsheen-Carson      |\n| Hair spa hair tonic                                                                | L'Or\u00e9al Professionnel |\n| Hydra floral bright essence Garnier Fructis Curl Nourish Wonder Oil                | Decleor Garnier       |\n\nIn  2021,  Biotherm  updated  the  formula  for  its  Aquasource Hyalu Plump Gel hydrating face gel, increasing the percentage  of  renewable  materials  from  53%  to  91%  with  a pot  made of  40%  recycled  glass  in  recycled  and  recyclable paper packaging without cellophane.\n\nThe  Group  has  also  set  up  a  Green  Sciences  programme  to drive change in its portfolio of raw materials and formulas.

This represents more than 717 (2) raw materials. In 2020 (recalculated using the new methodology), this percentage was 28%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2021,  63%  of  the  newly  referenced  raw  materials  are renewable.  Furthermore,  33  new  raw  materials  based  on green  chemistry  principles  were  registered,  representing  40% of the total.\n\nThe  Group  considers  biodiversity  to  be  a  key  source  of innovation.  Accordingly,  plans  to  increase  the  use  of  raw materials  from  plant  sources  must  ensure  that  there  is  no impact  on  these  ecosystems  or  on  the  availability  of  these resources  for  other  uses.  The  Group  is  thus  making  a commitment  to  a  sustainable  and  responsible  supply  chain (see paragraph 'Using the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion' in section 4.3.1.2.2. of this document).\n\nIn 2021, 60% of our ingredients in formulas were from biobased sources, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy  2030,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  ensuring  that  95%  of  the ingredients  in  its  formulas  will  be  from  biobased  sources, derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes.\n\nAs  part  of  this  commitment,  the  Group  is  working  with specialised  external  partners  to  define  a  robust,  scientific methodology to classify the minerals used and to ensure that they are from abundant sources.\n\n## Respect for biodiversity and societal contribution\n\nIn 2018, as part of the Act4nature initiative, L'Or\u00e9al set a goal of having  100%  renewable  raw  materials  coming  from sustainable  sources  by  2030.  To  be  included  in  this  category, they  must  be  traceable,  with  an  identified  botanic  and geographic origin. The respect for Human Rights in accordance with ILO principles is now expected throughout the production chain. At the level of plant growing and harvesting, attention is also  placed  on  the  economic  development  of  the  producers and  respect  for  the  traditional  knowledge  coming  from biodiversity  in  accordance  with  the  principles  of  the  Nagoya Protocol  (preservation  of  biodiversity,  and  fair  and  equitable sharing of the benefits with local communities).\n\nIn  2021,  100%  of  the  renewable  raw  materials  used  by  the Group were reassessed based on criteria such as respect for biodiversity and forced labour (see SCAN Index below).\n\nFurthermore, the traceability campaigns launched with all the Group's suppliers have made it possible to trace 100% of plantbased ingredients to their country of production, or even as far as  the  biomass  production  site.  In  2021,  the  portfolio  of  raw materials from renewable sources therefore comprised 1,717 (3) raw  materials  from  nearly  313  botanical  species  from  more than 100 countries.\n\nOut  of  the  313  botanical  species  that  are  the  source  of  the renewable  raw  materials  used  by  the  Group,  around  6% (4) present significant biodiversity challenges (endangered species,  and  impact  of  production  on  natural  environments) depending  on  their  geographic  origin  and  the  method  of extraction or production used. They are the subject of specific action plans initiated with suppliers  and,  if  necessary,  benefit from  the  systematic  support  of  independent  external  third parties, in order to manage the real impacts on the territories of origin of the ingredients.\n\n- \u00b7 For the palm oil and its by-products segment, which are the subject  of  a  specific  'Zero  deforestation'  approach  (see below),  at  year-end  2021,  100%  of  the  supplies  were covered by action plans with the suppliers concerned.\n- \u00b7 For  other  streams  of  renewable  raw  materials,  which represent 17% of the portfolio of renewable raw materials in volumes  and  74%  in  number,  L'Or\u00e9al,  on  the  basis  of environmental,  social and  economic  indicators  from external  databases  (IHDI  of  the  UNDP,  EPI  from  Yale University,  Verisk  Maplecroft  Country  Index),  has  defined indicators  of  'sustainable  sourcing  challenges'  to  assess renewable  raw  material  streams  with  regard  to  their sustainability.  These  indicators  are  consolidated  within  the SCAN  (Sustainable  Characterisation)  index,  allowing  the Group  to  prioritise  the  implementation  of  its  sustainable sourcing  action  plans.  The  Group  updates  the  information collected  regularly.  79%  of  the  volumes  of  raw  materials that have sustainable sourcing challenges according to the SCAN  Index  (i.e.  36%  in  number  of  raw  materials)  are already the subject of improvement action plans with the suppliers in question in order to ensure a sustainable supply. The goal is for 100% of the Group's renewable raw materials to  come from sustainable sources. To achieve this, L'Or\u00e9al launched a support and training programme for more than 200  suppliers  on  the  issues  of  sustainable  sourcing  of  raw materials  in  order  to  guarantee  the  traceability  of  the  raw materials  delivered  to  L'Or\u00e9al  and  ensure  the  associated streams are secure. Depending on the level of environmental and/or social risk identified on these streams, suppliers  are  notably  asked  to  deploy  the  field  audit\n\n4",

They  are  also invited to rely on  sustainable sourcing certifications adapted  to  the  challenges  of  their  streams  (Fair  Trade, Sustainable Agricultural Network, Organic, etc.).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy relying on sustainable sourcing for the supply of renewable raw  materials,  L'Or\u00e9al  contributes  to  the  social  inclusion  of vulnerable  population  groups  while  ensuring  environmentally friendly sourcing.\n\nIn 2021, 94% of the biobased ingredients in our formulas were traced and sourced from sustainable sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Insurance Net for Smallholders (INES)\n\nToday,  four  out  of  five  small  farmers  worldwide  have  no access  to  insurance  schemes.  These  small  operators  and their families are therefore vulnerable to weather events but are  excluded  from  'conventional'  healthcare  coverage, making them even more vulnerable. In order to reduce this exposure to agricultural and health risks, L'Or\u00e9al and AXA, along  with  the  Business  for  Inclusive Growth  (B4IG) incubator,  decided  in  2020  to  develop  a  micro-insurance project offering tailored health and crop insurance solutions to  farmers  connected  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategic  raw  materials supply chains.\n\nIn  2021,  this  scheme  was  rolled  out  in  two  L'Or\u00e9al  supply sectors: the shea butter sector in Burkina Faso and the guar sector in India. The first pilot project aims to provide health and  crop  insurance  to  nearly  20,000  shea  gatherers  who may face health and climate risks. The second pilot project focuses  on  providing  a  health  micro-insurance  solution  for all  the  2,000  small-scale guar producers who are members of the Sustainable Guar Initiative (SGI), and their families.\n\n## The resilience of Guar\n\nAccounting for 80% of global production, India is the world's leading  guar-producing  country.  Guar  grows  primarily  in Rajasthan,  a  region  characterised  by  hostile  weather conditions and infertile land. Guar is a legume that is used as a powerful thickening agent, mainly in hair care products (shampoos, conditioners, and masks).\n\nNearly  80%  of  the  population  of  Rajasthan  depends  on agriculture, and on guar in particular, as it is one of the few crops  that  can  be  grown  in  this  arid  region.  For  these isolated communities, access to a basic social infrastructure such  as  water  and  healthcare  remains  limited:  their agricultural  production  is  significantly  affected  by  the monsoon  and  weather  conditions  and  their  income depends on conditions set by the market.\n\nTo address these environmental, agronomic and socio-economic  issues,  in  2015  L'Or\u00e9al  partnered  with  its supplier  Solvay  and  the  NGO  Technoserve  to  launch  the Sustainable  Guar  Initiative  (SGI).  This  was  aimed  at  nearly 1,500  farmers,  across  13  communities,  that  are  dependent on rain-fed agriculture.\n\nInitially, the project helped  structure the sector by establishing  a  traceable  guar  supply  chain  while  helping farmers to organise themselves into cooperatives. The  farmers  were  trained  in  best  agricultural  practices.  In order to guarantee the food security of these communities, the  women in the villages  were  taught  the  importance  of diversity  in  nutrition  and  helped  in  establishing  vegetable gardens.\n\nGiven  the  recurring  droughts  in  the  region,  water  is  a  key issue.  A  pilot  project  was  therefore  launched  to  develop systems  for  collecting  water  so  that  fields  can  be  irrigated during  periods  of  severe  drought,  thereby  preventing  the loss of crops.\n\nIn  2020,  in  order  to  capitalise  on  the  experience  it  has gained, strengthen its regional impact and cover 100% of its guar  supply,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  second  project  in partnership with its supplier Lucid Colloids and the NGO SOL. This project supports 1,200 new farmers in the same region. This  project  focuses  on  the  following  goals:  training  in ecological farming practices, promoting sustainable water management,  strengthening  the  capacity  of  women  to develop income-generating activities  supported  by  microcredit,  and,  finally,  supporting  the  education  of  farmers' children.\n\nIn  2021,  to  reinforce  the  socio-economic  resilience  of  all farmers connected to its supply chain and to combat the high  volatility  of  market  prices,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a  minimum price to ensure a fair income for guar producers. Finally, to address health issues, a health micro-insurance solution has been  developed  with  AXA  and  rolled  out  to  2,000  guar producers (see the box above on INES).",

The  conversion  of  natural ecosystems  due  to  the  expansion  of  agriculture  and  urban development is recognised by science as the primary factor for  the  loss  of  biodiversity,  followed  by  pollution,  climate change and the introduction of invasive species.\n\nAlthough the Group has, for many years, been committed to the  preservation  and  sustainable  use  of  biodiversity,  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  reaffirms  this  commitment by  positioning  biodiversity  right  at  the  heart  of  the  Group's goals.\n\nTo  this  end,  with  the  support  of  The  Biodiversity  Consultancy, the Group has developed an innovative way of measuring the impact  that  its  industrial  activities  and  sourcing  have  on natural ecosystems.\n\nThis  new  indicator  is  based  on  three  parameters  (the  ground surface  required,  the  loss  of  biodiversity  related  to  Group practices and the importance of biodiversity in the ecosystem concerned)  and  it  enabled  us  to  estimate  that  the  sourcing of ingredients of plant origin accounted for more than 80% of our biodiversity footprint.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is therefore committed to ensuring that, between now and 2030, its footprint on the ecosystems required to produce ingredients  of  plant  origin  remains  unchanged  from  2019 levels.\n\nThe following drivers have been identified as key to achieving this goal:\n\n- \u00b7 The  adoption  of  regenerative  agricultural  practices  by suppliers,  in  order  to  improve  yields,  preserve  biodiversity and  help  farmers  transition  towards  more  sustainable agriculture;\n- \u00b7 The  implementation  of  an  ambitious  plan  to  develop alternatives  to  the  raw  materials  with  the  highest  impact, particularly  through  biotechnology  and  circular  processes, as part of the Green Sciences programme; and\n- \u00b7 Finally,  support  for  rehabilitation  projects  for  ecosystems adjacent to our strategic supply chains.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  still  working  on  different approaches and methodologies for assessing the impact of its activities on developing biodiversity in France and internationally, by taking part in the work of the Science-Based Targets on Nature network's Corporate Engagement Programme, CDC Biodiversit\u00e9's B4B+ club ( Business for Positive Biodiversity ), and the One Planet Business for Biodiversity (OP2B) collective.\n\n## 'Zero Deforestation' commitment\n\nAs part of its 'Zero Deforestation' policy published in 2014, the Group pledged that by 2020 none of the ingredients and raw materials used in its products would be linked to deforestation. Since 2007, L'Or\u00e9al has been deploying action plans in order to guarantee a sustainable supply of agricultural raw materials that could be the cause of deforestation, including palm oil, soybean extract, and fibrewood-based products.\n\nIn 2021, aware of the increasingly critical threat that continues to threaten forests worldwide and the social and environmental consequences  associated  with  deforestation,  following  a consultation  process  with  its  stakeholders,  L'Or\u00e9al  renewed  its goals as part of its new Forestry Policy 2030.\n\nCapitalising on its previous achievements with palm, soy and wood fibre, the new Forestry Policy 2030 covers a wider range of  raw  materials,  prioritised  according  to  their  strategic importance and the social and environmental risks identified in the  zones  in  which  they  are  produced.  Based  both  on sustainable  and  responsible  management  throughout  the supply  chains,  and  on  the  preservation  and  rehabilitation  of natural  ecosystems  adjacent  to  production  areas,  this  policy has  been  incorporated  into  the  Group's  strategy  for  the sustainable  sourcing  of  ingredients,  and  sets  new  goals  that are  specific  to  these  raw  materials.  In  addition  to  the environmental  dimension,  the  Forest  2030  policy  focuses  on respect for Human Rights and improving the living conditions of the communities affected.\n\n## Results for raw materials\n\n## Palm:\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al consumed less than 310 tonnes of palm oil and 90,003 tonnes of palm oil derivatives (which come from palm fruit  pulp)  and  of  palm  kernel  oil  (extracted  from  palm  fruit kernels).  These  two  oils  are  used  to  produce  glycerine,  fatty acids  and  fatty  alcohols  which  form  part  of  the  composition of the Group's products.\n\nAs  part  of  its  'zero  deforestation'  commitment,  L'Or\u00e9al  is rolling  out  a  specific  strategy  for  palm  oil  derivatives,  in partnership  with  all  stakeholders  (producers,  NGOs  and suppliers):\n\n- \u00b7 100%  of  purchases  of  palm  oil,  and  palm  oil  and  palm kernel  derivatives  have  been  certified  as  sustainable according to the RSPO criteria (www.rspo.org) since 2012; and\n- \u00b7 94%  of  the  main  derivatives  come  from  sources  that  are identified (as far as mills).\n\nIn terms of certification, 100% of the volumes of palm oil used by  L'Or\u00e9al  meet  the  standards  and  procedures  of  the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), via one of its most demanding traceability models, the SG (Segregated) model. 100%  of  the  derivatives  are  also  certified.  L'Or\u00e9al  had increased the proportion of its physically certified purchases to 98.4%  of  RSPO  Mass  Balance  at  the  end  of  2021,  compared with 95% in 2020 and 70% in 2019. The remainder continues to be covered by the RSPO Book & Claim model. To complete its certification  objectives,  L'Or\u00e9al  made  a  commitment  for  at least 30% of its volumes to be connected to field projects that support  small,  independent  planters.  In  2021,  27%  of  these volumes  were  physically  connected  to  sustainable  sourcing projects in Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nWithin  the  framework  of  its  'Zero  Deforestation'  commitment made in 2014, the Group had pledged to trace the main palm and palm kernel derivatives that it uses as far as the mills by the end  of  2015.  This  was  a  difficult  task  as  the  process  for transforming derivatives involved a large number of players and many branches of the supply chains.\n\nAn  initial  phase  involving  a  survey  was  conducted  in  2014, with the support of a firm of independent experts, of L'Or\u00e9al's strategic  suppliers,  who  supply  more  than  half  its  palm  and palm kernel derivatives.  Since  2015,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  progressively updated  and  enriched  its  data  collection  by  extending  the scope to cover all suppliers in order to be able to trace and identify  the  origin  of  100%  of  its  main  palm  and  palm  kernel derivatives.  The  results  of  this  work  show  that  Malaysia  and Indonesia  are  the  main  countries  from  which  supplies  are obtained and that, for 2020, 98% of these volumes of palm and palm  kernel  derivatives  could  be  traced  to  the  refineries, 94% to the mills and 50% as far as the plantations.\n\n4",

This  tool  is  used  annually  to evaluate  suppliers'  progress  towards  the  Zero  Deforestation objective  and  their  level  of  compliance  with  the  Group's requirements. It was first made public in 2016 to enable it to be used by all players in the supply chain.\n\nIn  2018,  to  take  its  commitment  further,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the development  of  a  new  tool  in  collaboration  with  ZSL (Zoological  Society  of  London)  and  Transitions,  to  evaluate\n\n## Palm oil derivatives in Malaysia: from a pilot project to a regional approach\n\nIn 2015, in the Beluran district of Malaysia, L'Or\u00e9al launched a  pilot  project  called  'SPOTS'  (Sustainable  Palm  Oil  & Traceability with Sabah  small producers) aimed  at supporting 500 independent producers of palm oil by 2020. The  first  phase  of  this  innovative  project,  conducted  in partnership  with  direct  supplier  Clariant,  its  intermediate supplier  Global  Amines,  its  upstream  producer  Wilmar  and Malaysian social enterprise Wild Asia, was designed to:\n\n- \u25cf ensure that the supply of palm oil derivatives purchased by L'Or\u00e9al could be traced;\n- \u25cf promote RSPO certification;\n- \u25cf encourage  the  adoption  of  sustainable  production practices; and\n- \u25cf improve the living conditions of the 500 small producers.\n\nAccordingly,  as  the  end  buyer,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to buying RSPO-certified products from small producers under a five-year contract, thereby initiating a long-term commercial relationship with each stakeholder in the value chain,  including  small  independent  producers.  This  marks a  break  with  the  standard  practice  on  the  conventional palm oil market.\n\n## Soy\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al consumed 354 tonnes of soybean extract and 2,502  tonnes  of  soybean  extract  derivatives.  In  2021,  100%  of the  soybean extract  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al  and  coming  from  Latin America is from a land project certified RTRS, Bio and Fair For Life, aimed at supporting 36 small soybean producers in Brazil and Paraguay, or from certified sources (IP - Identity Preserved Proterra). Most derivatives come from areas classed without risk of deforestation.\n\nrefineries and crushers (which extract the oil from the kernels), on  the  basis  of  their  reporting,  policies  and  procedures.  The indicators  used  for  this  evaluation  were  aligned  with  the requirements of the Group's standards in respect of deforestation. This tool has been available and public since 2019.\n\nAt mill level, since 2016, the L'Or\u00e9al Group has relied on Global Forest Watch's  risk  assessment  tool  to  ensure  that  no derivative traced to mills is linked to deforestation.\n\nIn 2018, the procedure for dealing with cases of non-conformity with  our  zero  deforestation  commitment  by  direct  or  indirect suppliers was also made public.\n\nSince  November  2019,  in  order  to  contribute  to  the  sector transformation, L'Or\u00e9al has been a founding member of Action for  Sustainable  Derivatives  (ASD),  an  initiative  coordinated  by BSR and Transitions within which L'Or\u00e9al has actively contributed,  in  particular  by  sharing  all  its  methodologies  and tools developed since 2014.\n\nAt the end  of  the  first five years of the project, 942 independent producers had joined the SPOTS project, 774  of  whom  obtained  RSPO  certification,  representing nearly 28,000 hectares of sustainably managed plantations. More than 200 training sessions were organised by  Wild  Asia  for  small  palm  producers,  who  were  able  to learn  more  about  the  RSPO  certification  system,  best practice to limit production costs in sustainable agriculture, waste management and soil health.\n\nBuilding  on  the  significant  results  of  this  first  phase,  L'Or\u00e9al worked  with  its  suppliers  and  Wild  Asia  to  scale  up  the project, in  order  to  extend  its  positive  impact  to  the  entire state of Sabah by 2025.\n\nThe aim of this regional cooperation is twofold: to extend RSPO certification  to  3,500  independent  producers,  i.e.  100,000 hectares  of  plantations,  while  encouraging  the  adoption  of regenerative agricultural practices for palm oil production.\n\nThus,  by  building  on  the  experience  of  the  'Bio-farms' developed by Wild Asia  on  around  one  hundred  thousand hectares of palm plantations, the project aims to encourage small producers to volunteer to adopt low-carbon practices that  are  good  for  both  the  soil  and  biodiversity,  and  that enable  them  to  improve  their  yields  and  their  income. Establishing these bio-farms inspired by regenerative agricultural  practices  on  nearly  10,000  hectares  by  2025  will help L'Or\u00e9al to achieve its objective of maintaining a stable footprint on  the  ecosystems  required  to  produce  its ingredients. It will also help transition towards more sustainable  and  innovative  agriculture  that  breaks  with conventional practices in the production of palm oil.\n\n## Paper/cardboard\n\nRegarding  materials  used  by  L'Or\u00e9al  for  its  packaging,  the paper  used  for  notices  and  the  cardboard  used  for  boxes is certified  as  coming  from  sustainably  managed  forests (FSC  or  PEFC  certified)  (see  section  on  'Materials  vigilance and preservation of resources' below).",

The reduction in the environmental  footprint  of  packaging  is  therefore  naturally part of the commitments under the new L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme, following on from the former Sharing Beauty With All programme, which came to an end in 2020.\n\nIn  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  Packaging  and  the  Environment Policy that incorporates respect for consumers, the environment and biodiversity.\n\nThe  new  programme  highlights  three  major  challenges  to improving the environmental profile of packaging:\n\n- \u00b7 Reduce: designing filling and packing articles and finished goods  that  are  smaller  and  lighter  in  relation  to  the contents, thereby consuming fewer resources;\n- \u00b7 Replace: substituting high-impact materials with alternative materials  with  lower  environmental  footprints,  such  as recycled materials and  materials from natural and renewable sources; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, 78% of created or renovated products had an improved environmental profile due to improved packaging.\n\n## Materials vigilance and preservation of resources\n\nL'Or\u00e9al requires a food-grade level for all materials used in its packaging that is in contact with its products. The Group also takes a proactive approach with its suppliers in order to ensure that  packaging  does  not  contain  any  sensitive  substances. Audits are conducted regularly to ensure the conformity of the filling  and  packing  components  delivered,  thus  ensuring  an uncompromised level of quality and safety for consumers.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  pledged  that  it  will  no  longer  produce  finished products  containing  PVC.  This  commitment  has  been  kept since 1 January 2018, with the exception of recent acquisitions, no  PVC  packaging  has  been  used  in  the  manufacture  of finished products since that date.\n\nControlling  the  source  of  materials  used  in  packaging  is  a major challenge that requires responsible sourcing. L'Or\u00e9al has set  itself  the  target  of  using,  for  its  paper,  cardboard  or wooden  packaging,  materials  from  sustainably  managed forests,  exploited  with  respect  for  populations  and  forest ecosystems.  The  paper  and  cardboard  used  for  packaging come  from  forests  that  are  FSC  preferably  or  PEFC  certified (or have obtained any other certification recognised by PEFC International). Since 2010, L'Or\u00e9al has been a member of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) in France and the FSC label is the only one claimed on paper or cardboard packaging for the Group's products.\n\nIn 2021, 100% of the paper used for product leaflets and 99.9% of  the  cardboard  used  for  folding  boxes  for  finished  goods were certified as coming from sustainably managed forests.\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  Forest  2030  Policy,  LOr\u00e9al  is  expanding  its goals  to  move  beyond  certification  of  the  material,  while extending  its  scope  of  application  to  cover  the  Group's primary, secondary and tertiary packaging. In an approach to achieve  continuous  improvement  in  traceability,  L'Or\u00e9al  has made  a  commitment  that,  by  2030,  100%  of  its  packaging biomaterials  will  be  traceable  and  come  from  sustainable sources,  with  no  connection  to  deforestation.  To  do  so,  the Group  will  rely  on  the Chain  of  Custody  certification  of  its packaging  suppliers,  enhanced  by  knowledge  about  their supplies'  countries  of  origin  (production  sites  of  the  material, origin of fibres).\n\nFinally, with the aim of improving the recycling of the products put  on  the  market,  the  Group's  brands  have  worked  to provide  consumers  with  detailed  sorting  instructions  and  to design  packaging  that  is  at  most  compatible  with  existing sorting  and  recycling  streams,  eliminating  disruptors  and thereby promoting material recovery after use of the product, to participate in the circular economy.\n\nIn addition, several brands sold by L'Or\u00e9al in France (Cadum, Garnier,  L'Or\u00e9al  Paris,  Narta,  Ushua\u00efa,  Vichy,  and  others), in  partnership  with  the  eco-organism  CITEO,  are  pursuing  a sorting awareness campaign (media, advertising, etc.) via the 'Trionsenbeaute.fr'  platform,  designed  to  support  consumers in their process to sort their beauty products at the end of life.\n\n- \u00b7 Recycle:  making  sure  that  the  packaging  can  contribute to circularity by being recycled.\n\nThese principles  are  applied  well  ahead  of  each  launch,  right from  the  marketing  brief,  and  are  orchestrated  via  a  global, systematic  eco-design  process  for  the  Group's  packaging, notably  with  the  help  of  the  SPOT  measurement  tool  and methodology. L'Or\u00e9al's sustainable development commitments are  an  integral  part  of  the  Group's  packaging  strategy  and new  tools  are  have  been  rolled  out  for  use  by  the  product development teams.\n\nSince  2018,  the  Group  has  used  a  specific  POS  programme that is based on the principles of eco-design and the circular economics. In addition, for our Free Standing Stores, we have drawn up an eco-design and construction guide in line with our  principles  of  sustainable  development.  The  Group  shares the guidelines and best practices for both these initiatives with its suppliers and partner distributors.\n\n4",

Every  year,  L'Or\u00e9al launches  new  initiatives  aimed  at  reducing  the  quantity  of materials used in packaging.\n\nA  continuous  process  is  in  place  to  reduce  the  weight  of existing products. As an illustration, two initiatives implemented in 2021 can be mentioned:\n\n- \u25cf Lanc\u00f4me  redesigned  its  G\u00e9nifique  eye  care  by  reducing the weight of the jars by 7% for a savings of 37.5 tonnes of glass; and\n- \u25cf the  launch  of  a  new  line  of  solid  shampoos  by  Garnier allows  the  consumer  to  choose  to  avoid  plastic  bottles  in favour  of  an  FSC  biobased  cardboard  box  (one  solid shampoo with a cardboard box is equivalent to two plastic bottles avoided).\n\n## Replace: new sources of materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAware that using non-renewable resources will not last forever, the  Group  seeks  to  replace  them  with  recycled  or  biomass materials,  or  materials  generated  by  technology  that  is  not reliant on fossil-based resources. In 2021, L'Or\u00e9al used 159,351 tonnes  of  plastic  in  its  primary,  secondary  and  tertiary packaging. L'Or\u00e9al is committed to using non-fossil sources for 50% of its plastics by 2025, with an initial target of 40% for PET (2) plastic in 2020. This target has been exceeded as, since 2020, more than 50% of the PET used by the Group worldwide has been recycled PET.\n\nIn 2021, 21% of the plastic packaging materials were from recycled or biobased sources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMoreover, in the context of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, the Group is aiming at reaching 100% non-fossil plastic by 2030.\n\nSeveral brands use recycled plastic (some as much as 100%) or  recycled  glass  in  their  bottles:  73,707  tonnes  of  recycled materials (3) ,  including 43,373 tonnes in primary and secondary packaging,  saved  the  equivalent  amount  of  virgin  materials in 2021. 67.1%, or 26,073 tonnes, of the volume of PET used by the Group worldwide is recycled PET.\n\nIn  addition,  in  order  to  reduce  the  resources  intended  for packaging, L'Or\u00e9al is increasingly marketing reusable products, i.e .  reloadable  or  refillable  systems,  with  Valentino, for example, which launched its first refillable makeup line, and L'Or\u00e9al Paris,  which  launched shampoo pouches to be used to refill the original bottle.\n\nTo  limit  packaging  cubic  volumes  for  its  finished  products, L'Or\u00e9al  has  established  its  own  procedures  for  reduction  at source. L'Or\u00e9al's requirements are respectful of local regulations,  and  even  exceed  the  regulations  of  most countries.\n\nTo  optimise  the  flow  of  components,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  developed wall-to-wall (1) production to reduce the environmental impact.",

The same efforts are being made with PE (2) containers, both on tubes with, for example, 30% PCR PE on the Bare Look Tint range from YSL Nu, or on bottles in the 1L Redken  shampoo  and  conditioner  line,  which  now  contains 100% PCR PE, for hair salons in Europe.\n\nIn  addition  to  brands  whose  bottles  are  now  made  of  100% recycled  PET,  such  as  Garnier  and  Els\u00e8ve,  Maybelline Volum Express  Hyper  Curl mascara  tubes  are  produced  using  100% PCR PET in the Asia-Pacific Zone.\n\nAs part of an ongoing partnership on innovation in responsible packaging,  in  2021  L'Or\u00e9al  and  Alb\u00e9a  developed  a  new generation of cardboard cosmetics tube, replacing an even greater  proportion  of  plastic  with  a  renewable  material.  In November  2021,  this  innovation  led  to  the  marketing  of  the Lipikar  lip  balm  from  La  Roche  Posay,  contained  in  an innovative  cardboard-based  packaging,  thus  reducing  the weight of plastic by 64%.\n\nIn November  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  signed  a  partnership  with Lanzatech  to  develop  polyethylene  from  industrial  carbon emissions.\n\n## Recycle: integration into circular streams\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, 39% of the Group's plastic packaging was refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn  2017,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  New  Plastics  Economy  (NPEC) initiative  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation,  the  objective  of which  is  to  rethink  the  life-cycle  of  plastic  so  that  plastic packaging never becomes a waste product, and is re-inserted into  the  circular  economy  in  the  form  of  materials  with biological  or  technical  value.  Since  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a partner  of  the  Ellen  MacArthur  Foundation,  with  the  goal,  for example,  of  having  100%  of  its  plastic  packaging  refillable, reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025. This goal is one of  the  commitments  L'Or\u00e9al  made  as  part  of  the  Ellen\n\nMacArthur  Global  Commitment.  These  commitments  are monitored by the annual Progress Report.  The  percentage  of refillable,  reusable,  recyclable  or  compostable  plastics  in  2021 was 39%.\n\nAvoiding the introduction of recycling 'disruptors' is one way of improving the recyclability profile of packaging.\n\nWith this in mind, the L'Or\u00e9al Paris brand has discontinued the use  of  metallised  labels  across  the  entire  Els\u00e8ve  shampoo range  because  they  could  interfere  with  the  detection  of plastic in automatic sorting centres.\n\nIn order  to  implement  new  circular  solutions  for  plastic packaging,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  working  in  collaboration  with  an ecosystem of partners:\n\n- \u25cf L'Or\u00e9al  has  created  a  consortium  with  Carbios  that develops  a  bio-recycling  process  using  very  specific enzymes  that  will  recycle  PET  plastics  and  polyester  fibres more  broadly.  This  innovative  process  will  produced  a recycled PET equivalent to virgin PET. In April 2019, Suntory, Nestl\u00e9 Waters and Pepsi-Co joined this consortium. In June 2021, L'Or\u00e9al announced the creation of the first cosmetics bottle made  entirely  of recycled plastic using this technology.\n- \u25cf Since  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  partnered  with  LOOP  Industries \u00ae to depolymerise post-consumer PET into virgin-quality PET.\n- \u25cf In  July  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  signed  a  partnership  with  PURECYCLE to produce recycled PP.\n\nFor  glass  packaging,  the  integration  of  recycled  glass  has been  expanded  to  product  categories  other  than  skincare and now includes makeup and perfumes. The packaging for these  products  is  composed  of  up  to  40%  recycled  glass, like the perfume refill from Mugler.\n\n4",

'Eco-designed products' of  this  document),  which  assesses  the  impact  of  packaging; and\n- \u00b7 a  tool  to  help  in  reducing  the  environmental  impacts  of transportation packaging  for  packaging  components from  suppliers  to  plants  and  transportation  packaging  of finished  products  from  plants  to  the  Group's  distribution centres, particularly through optimisation of palletisation.\n\nTo  share  its  research  and  results  with  the  cosmetics  industry, in 2018  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  created  the  SPICE  initiative (Sustainable  Packaging  Initiative  for  Cosmetics)  with  Quantis (an environmental consulting firm). The purpose of SPICE is to share  the  best  practices  and  methodologies  of  each cosmetics  player  in  order  to  harmonise  and  enhance  the methods used to assess the cosmetic packaging environmental  footprint  to  make  it  easier  to  understand  for consumers. L'Or\u00e9al shares its own SPOTPackaging methodology through the SPICE initiative. Tracking of work and achievements, as well as the plan for the coming months, are accessible  on  the  open  platform  www.Open-Spice.com.  The SPICE initiative now has more than 25 members worldwide. The dedicated SPICE tool was launched in July 2020.\n\nSince  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  implementing  worldwide  a programme to eco-design POS materials and furnishings with its teams and suppliers:\n\n- \u00b7 14 robust and pragmatic golden rules;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 training support for teams and suppliers; and\n- \u00b7 monitoring indicators, sharing best practices and organising inter-team challenges, including our suppliers.\n\nThe  principles  relate  in  particular  to  materials:  recycled materials  and  those  from  biobased  sources,  their  weight, recyclability/separability  and  the  optimisation  of  electricity consumption  (for  permanent  POS).  L'Or\u00e9al  is  testing  and developing circular economy processes with its suppliers and local operators, notably in the context of uninstalling, recycling or  donations.  L'Or\u00e9al  continues  to  share  its  best  practice,  for example,  with  the  French  Federation  for  Beauty  Companies (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des Entreprises de la Beaut\u00e9 - FEBEA).\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al continued the roll out of its 'Sustainable retail box' programme,  aligned  with  the  highest  standards, providing  concrete  actions  for  the  design  and  responsible construction  of  its  free-standing  stores  (materials,  energy, accessibility,  water  management, construction waste, interior air  quality,  ergonomics,  etc.)  with  a  view  to  having  them certified. In 2021, 20 of the 22 new or renovated Group stores made a commitment to an eco-responsible process aligned with  the  highest  standards  of  the  Group.  Seven  of  them recorded  an  eco-design  rate  of  over  100%  or  are  certified LEED Gold (1) .\n\nFor  our  permanent  POS  materials,  but  also  our  Free-Standing stores, the Group uses design firms that are experts in lighting to  optimise  energy  consumption  without  compromising  the quality  of  in-store  lighting.  The  first  pilot  projects  are  very promising,  in  particular  for  the  reduction  of  environmental impacts.  In  2021,  the  teams  worked  on  new  operational guidelines  on  this  subject.  This  new  initiative  also  benefits  the Group's  distributors,  helping  them  to  improve  and  optimise their energy consumption.\n\nIn 2021, 91% of advertising displays at points of sale were eco-designed and 32% of free-standing stores, whether new or refurbished, were designed and built in line with the Group's principles of sustainable development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3.1.3.2. Involving consumers in the Group's transformation\n\n## A/ Product quality and safety: a priority\n\nA chapter of L'Or\u00e9al's Code of Ethics is devoted to product quality and safety.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  develops  and  devises  cosmetics  with  high-quality formulas  that  meet  the  needs  of  both  consumers  and professionals.  As  consumer  safety  is  an  absolute  priority  for L'Or\u00e9al,  assessing  the  safety  of  these  formulas  and  their ingredients  is  central  to  any  new  product  development process and a prerequisite for any new product being brought to  the  market.  As  a  result,  consumers  across  the  globe  have access  to  cosmetics  of  identical  quality,  with  proven  safety records.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al factories around the world produce cosmetic products that comply with ISO international standards. As such, almost all factories  are  ISO  9001  certified  and  implement  the requirements of ISO 22716 on Good Manufacturing Practices for  cosmetics.  This  standard  sets  out  all  the  requirements  for production, filling and packing, control, storage and shipment in  order  for  a  cosmetic  product  to  comply  with  the  defined quality.\n\n100% of the Group's products are subject to a rigorous safety assessment and a safety report is issued for them.\n\nThe  Worldwide  Safety  Evaluation  Department  specifically evaluates  the  safety  of  raw  materials  and  finished  products. It  establishes  the  toxicological  profile  of  the  ingredients  used and  the  formulas  prior  to  their  launch  on  the  market.  These same  safety  standards  are  applied  worldwide  to  protect the health of consumers from across the globe.",

This allows for appropriate corrective measures to be taken where necessary.\n\nThe safety cycle is summarised in the following graphic:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The product safety assessment process\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up  a  process  to  ensure  that  all  products developed  by  the  Group,  whatever  the  geographical location  of  the  laboratory  in  charge  of  the  project, are  subject  to  the  same  level  of  rigorous  safety  evaluation. The assessments by the Worldwide  Safety  Evaluation Department, based on a multidisciplinary scientific approach, are carried out at all stages of the life cycle of the products. This approach enables L'Or\u00e9al to meet the safety requirements  of  the  national  regulations  in  force  in  all  the countries  in  which  its  products  are  put  on  sale,  testifying  to their safety of use. A safety assessment is conducted for each product launched on the market.\n\nThe product safety evaluation is based on the evaluation of each  ingredient  that  enters  into  the  composition  of  the product and the finished product itself. It is carried out on the  basis  of  existing  safety  data  and  the  latest  scientific knowledge, and takes into consideration the conditions of use of the product. If necessary, L'Or\u00e9al conducts additional\n\nIn responding to questions that civil society may ask regarding certain  substances  and  their  effects  on  health  and  the environment, three points summarise L'Or\u00e9al's position:\n\n- \u00b7 vigilance with regard to any relevant new scientific data;\n- \u00b7 cooperation with the relevant authorities; and\n- \u00b7 precaution leading to the substitution of ingredients in the event of a proven or strongly suspected risk.\n\nThe launch of the website 'Au coeur de nos produits' (Inside our  products)  in  2019  is  testimony  to  the  Group's  desire  for increased transparency on this issue.\n\nFinally, production quality standards define rules governing the quality of products, for all stages from creation to production and distribution. Almost all factories are ISO 9001 certified for their  production and follow the Best Manufacturing Practices in accordance with the ISO 22716 standard.\n\nsafety studies in qualified laboratories all over the world. The results  of  these  studies  are  interpreted  by  experienced scientists who are specially trained in safety issues with regard to cosmetic ingredients and products.\n\nFurthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al's  ethical  principles,  rooted  in  both scientific  rigour  and  responsiveness  to  societal  concerns, lead to a pre-emptive approach whereby formulations are evolved  by  removing  and/or  replacing  substances  on  the basis of new data.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  added  value,  in  terms  of  the  safety  assessment  of ingredients  and  finished  products,  lies  in  its  investment for nearly 40 years in the development of predictive methods and  tissue  engineering,  and  their  international  regulatory recognition.  For  many years, the Group has been investing in  science and technology to create new evaluation tools which are used every day by safety assessors.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also works closely with all the international stakeholders  involved  in  relevant  industries  in  order  to progress  the  development  of  alternative  cross-disciplinary solutions in the field of safety assessment.\n\n4",

Equally,  L'Or\u00e9al  no  longer  tests  its  ingredients on  animals.  L'Or\u00e9al  no  longer  tolerates  any  exceptions  to this rule and this applies worldwide. The Group also does not delegate  responsibility  for  doing  so  to  anyone  else. Some health  authorities  may  nevertheless  decide  to  carry out animal testing themselves for certain cosmetic products and  this  is  still  the  case  in  China.  For  more  than  10  years, L'Or\u00e9al has been the company most committed to getting Chinese  authorities  and  scientists  to  recognise  alternative methods  and  changing  cosmetic  regulations  to  achieve\n\n## B/ Raising awareness among consumers about sustainable lifestyle choices\n\nThe Group wants to empower all L'Or\u00e9al consumers to make sustainable consumption choices.\n\nThe SPOT environmental and social assessment tool, rolled out to  all  of  the  Group's  brands  (excluding  recent  acquisitions), established  the  environmental  and  social  profile  of  all  new products in a process dating back to 2017.\n\n## Displaying  the  environmental  and  social  impact  of  the products\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  sustainability programme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  developed  an  environmental  and social labelling system for its products, with ratings from A to E, designed  to  inform  consumers  and  enable  them  to  make enlightened consumption choices.\n\nThe labelling is  built  on  the  SPOT  methodology to measure impacts,  which  was  co-created  with  11  independent international  experts  in  accordance  with  the  directives  of the  European  Product  Environmental  Footprint  (PEF),  to scientifically measure the environmental and social impact of a product.\n\nThis  tool  for  comparing  products  of  the  same  category provides  an  accurate  vision  of  the  impact  of  a  Group product,  taking  into  consideration  14  planetary  impact factors  such  as  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  water  stress, ocean acidification or the impact on biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe  complete and final elimination of animal testing. After the progress made in 2014, which put an end to the testing on animals of some products manufactured in China, since May 2021, all non-functional products imported into China no longer need to be tested on animals, provided that they are accompanied  by  a  safety  assessment  and  a manufacturing  best  practice  certificate  issued  by  their country of origin.\n\nIn  fact,  L'Or\u00e9al's products continually evolve as and when technological  innovations  occur,  but  with  the  constant desire  to  guarantee  the  highest  level  of  safety  for  both consumers and professionals.\n\nThese impacts are measured at each step in the life cycle of  a  product  and  calculated  by  taking  into  account  not only  the  cultivation  of  raw  materials,  the  processing  and transport of the product, but also the usage phase by the consumer and the recyclability of the packaging.\n\nIn the case of cosmetics, as the carbon and water footprints are  the  most  important  impact  factors,  the  Group  made the  choice  to  communicate a total environmental impact note  combined  with  a  focus  on  carbon  and  water footprints.\n\nThis  information  will  be  accessible  to  consumers  on  the product website. The first  phase  of  the  roll-out  began  with the Garnier hair-care category in July 2020 and now covers around twenty countries in Europe and will soon be in other zones.\n\nIn November  2021,  two  new  brands  -  Biotherm  and La  Roche  Posay  -  rolled  out  this  labelling  for  their  skin  care ranges in France, followed by Vichy in December 2021.\n\nRoll-outs in brands  and  zones  where  automated  data modelling is used are expected to accelerate in 2022.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  a  sectoral approach,  coming  together  with  its  competitors  to  form  the Eco  Beauty  Score  Consortium,  which  aims  to  develop  a methodology  for  rating  cosmetic  products,  backed  by  a scientific methodology for measuring environmental impacts in line  with  the  recommendations of the European Commission, similar to that used by the Group for its environmental labelling initiative.  Alongside  the  other  members, L'Or\u00e9al is committed to  sharing  its  experience  in  this  field  within  the  Consortium, in compliance with anti-trust legislation.\n\nIn 2021, an environmental impact score was calculated for 76% of the Group's rinse-off products. Labelling showing these scores, together with their social impact data, will be gradually rolled out in our markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Environmental and societal commitment of L'Or\u00e9al brands\n\nConscious  of  the  influencing  ability  of  its  brands,  L'Or\u00e9al encourages them to inform and mobilise their business partners, customers and consumers around the major environmental and societal challenges facing the world.\n\nEach brand must therefore identify an environmental or societal cause  of  its  own,  support  a  community  partner  involved  in  the field,  and  conduct  awareness-raising  and  outreach  campaigns with its consumers in order to contribute to change.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  Paris  is  therefore  backing  the  Stand  Up  programme against  street  harassment,  in  partnership  with  the  NGO Hollaback!.  Since  it  was  created,  more  than  550,000  people have already been trained in a method that enables them to react safely to street harassment, whether they are victims or witnesses.",

'Involving strategic suppliers in the Group's ambitions' of this document);\n- \u00b7 the commitment made by the Group to reduce the impact of downstream transport by -20% per unit sold per kilometre between  2011  and  2020  (see  paragraph  'Reduction  of greenhouse  gas  emissions  from  the  transport  of  finished products' in section 4.5.2.1. of this document);\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al, through its Science-Based Targets (SBT) commitment validated by the initiative at the end of 2017,\n\nhas  sought  to  cover  all  impacts  associated  with  its  value chain. The  commitment  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions  by  25%  in  2030  (baseline  2016)  comprises  all  of Scopes  1,  2,  and  3  (according  to  the  GHG  Protocol) (see section 4.3.1.4.2. 'Science-Based Targets commitment' in this document); and\n\n- \u00b7 finally,  in  June  2020,  in  the  context  of  the  launch  of  its L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  consistent  with  its Science-Based  Targets  (SBT)  commitment  (see  section 4.3.1.4.2. 'Science-Based  Targets  commitment'  in  this document),  the  Group  specified  its  2030  roadmap  by committing  to  a  reduction,  from  2016,  of  25%  per  finished product  in  the  emissions  associated  with  its  product  use phase, a 50% reduction in the emissions associated with its strategic suppliers and a 50% reduction per finished product in the emissions associated with product transportation.\n\n## CO2 emissions in 2021 (Scopes 1, 2, 3) over the entire Group (industrial sites, administrative sites and research centres)\n\n| (thousands of tonnes of CO2 equivalent)   | Scope 1   | Scope 2   | Scope 3   | Scopes 1, 2 & 3   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Group                                     | 27.7      | 10.6      | 12,488    | 12,526            |\n| Industrial sites                          | 25.9  \u2611   | 5.7  \u2611    | -         | -                 |\n| Administrative sites and research centres | 1.8       | 4.9       | -         | -                 |\n\nto L'Or\u00e9al  purchases  of  raw  materials  and  packaging materials used for the products manufactured by the Group.

Science-Based Targets commitment\n\nIn 2015, L'Or\u00e9al undertook to define Science-Based Targets to reduce  its  greenhouse  gas  emissions  across  its  entire  value chain  and  over  the  long  term,  in  accordance  with  the  Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nIn December 2017, the SBT initiative has validated the Group's proposal: Thus, by 2030, L'Or\u00e9al is committed to reducing by 25% in absolute value the greenhouse gas emissions of Scopes 1,  2  and  3  (with  full  coverage  of  the  items  of  Scope  3,  in accordance with the definition of the GHG Protocol), with a reference year of 2016; in particular, the Group is committed in particular to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from all sites it operates by 100% by 2025, through a programme of energy efficiency and a supply of renewable energy exclusively.\n\nThese  commitments  were  revaluated  in  2019  over  Scopes  1 and 2 by the SBT initiative and considered to be in compliance with the new SBT 1.5\u00b0C criteria.\n\nRoadmaps  were  deployed  within  the  different  business  lines (packaging,  research,  sourcing,  supply  chain,  etc . )  so  that each  one  contributes  to  the  reduction  of  CO2  emissions  in Scopes 1, 2 and 3. Specific tracking has been started, which allows each of the segments to monitor its own performance.\n\n## 4.3.1.4.3. UN Global Compact Pledge: 'Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C'\n\nIn  September  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  'Business  Ambition  for 1.5\u00b0C' initiative, a call to action launched by a broad coalition of companies, civil society and UN leaders, thus reaffirming its leadership on climate action. The Group has committed to net zero CO2 emissions by 2050, contributing in this way to limiting the  increase  in  global  temperature  to  1.5\u00b0C  above  preindustrial  levels,  a  necessary  condition  for  limiting  the  worst impacts of climate change  according  to  the  latest conclusions of climate science.\n\n## 4.3.1.4.4. Adapting the model to the climate emergency: alignment of the Group with the TCFD principles\n\nAware of the consequences of climate change, L'Or\u00e9al has initiated  its  transition  towards  an  increasingly  responsible business  development  model  in  which  the  non-financial challenges  are  placed  at  the  same  level  as  the  financial challenges  that  contribute  to  its  overall  performance.  The ambition is to design an innovative low-carbon business model and to make a contribution to the major collective challenge that is represented by limiting climate change.\n\nThe  Sharing  Beauty  With  All  programme,  rolled  out  globally since 2013 and supported at all levels of the organisation, has helped establish a culture in which environmental impacts and climate change  are  taken  into  account,  increasingly influencing  the  decision-making  process  of  each  of  the Group's  'M\u00e9tiers'  (business  activities)  each  day,  as  well  as their  major  projects,  as  shown  by  the  policies,  programmes and outcomes described above.\n\nAs the acceleration  of  the  environmental  and  social challenges  calls  for  a  more  radical  transformation,  in  June 2020  L'Or\u00e9al  announced  its  new  sustainability  programme L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future,  with  a  new  series  of  particularly ambitious  objectives  for  2030.  The  efforts  to  combat  climate change is an integral part of the Group's new ambitions and are  aligned  with  the  Science-Based  Targets  commitment validated in 2017.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  made  a  public  commitment  in  2020  to  adopt  the recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-Related Financial  Disclosure  (TCFD),  which  encourages  companies  to include  climate  issues  in  their  strategy,  and  to  provide consistent, reliable and clear information to allow investors to take  into  account  climate-related  financial  risks  in  their decisions.\n\n4",

She  leads  an  internal sustainability committee, which includes experts responsible for the  rollout  of  the  sustainability  programme  within  Operations, Research, Public Affairs, Communication, Divisions, and Brands. She  guarantees  the  implementation  of  the  orientations  and decisions  adopted  by  this  Committee.  She  also  defines  and deploys  annual  targets  across  L'Or\u00e9al's  value  chain,  and assesses  the  level  of  commitment  of  all  the  Brands,  Country Managers  and  subsidiaries  in  implementing  the  sustainable development  strategy.  This  implementation  determines  a portion of the variable remuneration of the Brand and Country Managers.\n\nThe  mission  of  the  Sustainable  Finance  Department,  created in 2020, is to integrate the climate challenges from a financial standpoint.  This  Department,  which  reports  to  the  Chief Administrative and Financial Officer and to the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer, aims at developing  and  directing Sustainable Finance actions. This means, in particular, building a new  income  statement  model  that  includes  sustainable development  elements  and  allows  the  Group  to  measure  its efforts,  especially  concerning  the  carbon  impact,  coordinate finance  actions,  and  continue  to  incorporate  sustainable development in its decisions on investing and acquisitions.\n\n## Strategy\n\nFor  the  main  environmental  risks,  the  concept  of  risk  covers both  risks  related  to  the  impact  of  the  Group's  business activities  on  its  ecosystem  and  the  risks  of  the  impact  of climate change in the short and medium-term on its business model, activity, and financial performance.\n\nThe  Group  has  identified  seven  principal  risks  and  six opportunities  relating  to  climate  change  that  have  potential consequences  for  its  activities  and  the  development  of  its strategy.\n\nIn-depth analyses of climate risks were conducted: identification and  a  dynamic  approach  to  the  risks, assessment of their impact using scenarios developed on two assumptions  based  on  the  2\u00b0C  and  4\u00b0C  paths,  assumptions that  also  integrate  political,  economic,  social,  technological, environmental and legal trends (PESTEL analysis).\n\n## Scenarios\n\n- \u00b7 a  'governed  transition'  scenario  ('TG')  on  the  basis  of global  warming  of  around  +2\u00b0C  in  2100.  This  scenario  is based on strong international cooperation, major increased consumer awareness of climate and external effects and, globally,  actions  to  anticipate  and  attenuate  climate change in a more responsible world based on solidarity.\n- \u00b7 'a  disorganised  transition'  scenario  ('DT')  on  the  basis  of global warming of around +4\u00b0C in 2100. This scenario is based on assumptions of limited international  cooperation,  growing tensions  on  trade,  economic  stagnation  or  slowdown  and, generally, a primarily reactive adaptation to climate change.\n\nThese  L'Or\u00e9al  scenarios  integrate  pre-existing  scenarios  or assumptions  based  on  scientific  content  as  input  data, particularly  the  RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) -AR5) of the IPCC (Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change)  to  assess  the physical  risks  for  the  governed  transition  and  disorganised transition respectively.\n\nMore specifically, studies of the impact of climate change on plant-based  raw  materials  sourcing  were  also  conducted. Assumptions  have  also  been  made  on  the  paths  of  carbon pricing  and  consumer  preferences,  the  main  factors  in L'Or\u00e9al's  exposure to climate-related transition risks.  This  work will allow the Group to adapt policies and define its strategic goals.\n\nTwo  timeframes  were  considered:  a  medium-term  2030 timeframe, aligned with scientific targets, and a long-term 2050 timeframe,  to  detect  significant  trends  in  the  physical  climate variables.\n\nThe  entire  value  chain  was  considered  in  the  analysis  of L'Or\u00e9al's scenarios.\n\nThe  two  scenarios  resulted  in  differentiated  assessments  of  the impact of the risks identified and favoured the prioritisation of the policies  implemented  and  the  determination  of  the  related programmes  and  action  plans  to  reduce  these  impacts.    They contributed to the development of the sustainability programme, L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, for 2030.\n\n## Risks\n\nThe  Group's  risk  review  includes  physical  risks  and  transition  risks associated with changes in its value chain and ecosystem. Risks as  diverse  as  those  associated  with  extreme  weather  events on the Group's infrastructures, or the risks inherent in the supply chain,  those  inherent  in  the  scarcity  of  resources,  carbon pricing  (taxes,  emissions  trading  schemes)  and  their  financial impacts,  or  those  related  to  the  Group's  reputation  and consumer  expectations,  are  analysed,  resulting in the preparation  of  impact  scenarios  as  part  of  the  scenarios constructed, and strategic orientations are defined.",

        "page_content": "## L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nIn  particular,  the  following  main  risks  and  opportunities  were studied:\n\n## Risk 1\n\nRegulations  concerning  carbon  pricing  mechanisms,  such  as specific taxes on fossil fuels, carbon taxes, and emissions trading schemes  (or  carbon  markets),  are  a  major  challenge  for  the Group and its suppliers. In this context, an increase in the price per tonne of direct greenhouse gas emissions for suppliers could be  reflected  in  the  sale  prices  of  their  products  and  services, and potentially have a material impact on L'Or\u00e9al's operating costs. In order to mitigate this risk, the Group is engaged with its suppliers,  in  particular  through  the CDP  Supply  Chain , to ensure they devise and implement emissions reduction targets and  associated  action  plans  (see  section  4.3.1.2.  'Involving suppliers in the Group's transformation' of this document).\n\n## Risk 2\n\nChanges  in  consumer  preferences  towards  consumption choices  increasingly  influenced  by  the  carbon  footprint  of products and the overall climate performance of plants could have  a  material  impact,  progressively  and  in  the  mediumterm,  for  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  challenge,  if  this  risk  were  insufficiently managed, would be a potential loss of revenue because of a reduction  in  demand  for  L'Or\u00e9al  products  from  consumers. L'Or\u00e9al's strategy to prevent the associated risk is to continue to reduce  the  carbon  footprint  of  its  products  and  to  give consumers the means to take enlightened purchasing decisions by  providing  transparent  information  and  listening  to  their expectations  on  the  issues  of  sustainable  development  (see paragraph 'Displaying  the  environmental  and  social  impact  of the products' in section 4.3.1.3.2. of this document).\n\n## Risk 3\n\nClimate  change  is  expected  to  lead  to  an  increase  in  the frequency and intensity  of  extreme  weather  events,  resulting primarily in changes in precipitation patterns, which will have a particularly strong impact on agriculture.\n\nIn  particular,  in  Indonesia  and  Malaysia,  medium-term  chronic changes in the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a cycles are likely to occur. For the preparation of its palm-based ingredients, which represent a large share of its purchasing volumes of ingredients of plant origin,  98.8%  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  supply  of  palm  oil  comes  from Indonesia and Malaysia. L'Or\u00e9al could, therefore, be affected by  the  consequences  of  a  chronic  increase  in  the  frequency and intensity of these extreme weather events with, as a result, an  increase  in  the  supply  costs  for  palm  oil,  associated  with higher production and certification costs.\n\nThese risks are taken into account by working on the resilience of  the  supply  chain,  developing  projects  in  the  field  with  the suppliers, and by making a long-term commitment with some of  them.  In  order  to  drill  down  on  this  identification  of  climaterelated  risks  on  the  price  and  availability  of  the  most  important raw  materials  of  plant  origin  in  the  L'Or\u00e9al  portfolio,  a  specific study taking account of a set of methodologies and sources on climate  change  was  carried  out  with  'BIPE'  (a  consulting  firm specialised  in  the  analysis  of  the  consequences  of  climate change  on  plant  production)  in  2017,  then  refined  in  2018 and 2019 in order to adapt supply strategies.\n\n## Opportunity 1\n\nOne of the consequences of climate change is the increase in the number of regions around the world that will face periods of  water shortage, particularly in urban areas. An increase in the  frequency  or  intensity  of  water  shortages  could  lead  to changes in consumer routines in terms of showering and hairwashing.  A  market  opportunity  consists  in  innovating  and developing  products  adapted  for  use  by  consumers  living  in these  areas  of  water  stress.  These  new  products  could increasingly  better  meet  consumer's  needs  in  this  context. L'Or\u00e9al could seize this opportunity by evaluating the products as  a  function  of  their  water  footprint,  by  developing  new products, routines or new technologies that improve rinsing or save  water  in  the  use  phase,  and  by  increasing  consumer awareness  of  the  challenges  associated  with  water  quality and availability.\n\n## Opportunity 2\n\nThe  medium-term  global  trend  in  the  price  of  non-renewable energy is expected to rise, both because of future regulations and  taxes  on  fossil  fuels,  and  complex  balances  between supply and demand. The progressive elimination of the use of conventional  fuels  in  favour  of  renewable  energies  would protect L'Or\u00e9al from increases in the fossil fuel prices and could result over time in operating costs that are relatively lower than those paid by other manufacturers who are not committed or insufficiently committed to this energy transition. L'Or\u00e9al intends to  seize  this  opportunity  by  rapidly  reducing  the  use  of  fossil energies. L'Or\u00e9al has thus committed to using 100% renewable energy at all its operated sites by 2025, by developing projects for self-supply of renewable energies on-site, as well as a 100% local  and  renewable  energy  supply  (electricity,  heat,  biogas, etc.). L'Or\u00e9al has already started on this path with, for example, the completion of a series of projects for its own consumption of renewable energy on-site in locations such as the United States, Western Europe, Brazil, and China.\n\n## Methods for managing risks and opportunities\n\nIdentification and  assessment  of  the  risks  are  primarily coordinated  at  the  Group  Level  by  the  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance Department with all relevant departments. When necessary and  relevant, an additional risk analysis is conducted  in  the  operational  entities,  particularly  for  the physical risks associated with climate change.\n\nContributions  are  collected  from  the  main  operational managers and experts in this area worldwide, representing all the Group's business activities, regions, and areas of activity. Climate-related  risks  have  been  the  subject  of  a  specific approach  that  identified  and  assessed  their  financial  and strategic impact when the Group's reputation is impacted or the  long-term  growth  of  the  Group  may  be  impacted.  This analysis is regularly updated.\n\nThe  mapping  of  the  Group's  risks  is  reviewed  regularly.  It  is validated  by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Executive  Committee  once  a  year and presented to the Audit Committee.\n\n4",

As  a  result  of  the acceleration of the environmental challenges, these indicators were reassessed and completed at the time of the June 2020 launch  of  the  new  sustainability  programme  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the Future. They cover the Group's entire value chain in the areas of greenhouse gas emissions, water, biodiversity, resources and waste, and support the goals for 2030.\n\nMore  specifically  in  terms  of  climate  change,  the  goals announced  in  the  context  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future programme  are  aligned  with  the  Science-Based  Targets\n\ninitiative  that  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  in  2015.  In  this  context,  L'Or\u00e9al  is committed to reducing in 2030 greenhouse gas emissions by 25% in absolute value (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) and by 50% per  finished  product  over  its  entire  value  chain  (Scopes  1,  2 and 3), compared with 2016.\n\nFinally,  in  September  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  United  Nations Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C initiative and made a commitment to reach net-zero emissions of CO2 by 2050.\n\nA  GHG  balance  is  prepared  and  published  annually  and details  emissions  over  all  the  items  described  by  the  GHG Protocol.\n\nThe cross-reference table below identifies the main information of  this  document  according  to  the  recommendations  of  the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\n| Governance              | Governance                                                                                                                           | Sections of this document   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1.                      | Supervision by the Board of Directors of climate-related risks and opportunities                                                     | 1.1., 2.3.2.1. and 4.1.     |\n| 2.                      | Role of Management in the assessment and management of climate-related risks and opportunities                                       | 3.2. and 4.1.               |\n| Strategy                | Strategy                                                                                                                             |                             |\n| 1.                      | Climate-related risks and opportunities identified in the short, medium and long term                                                | 3.5. and 4.2.               |\n| 2.                      | Impact of climate-related risks on the Group's business activities, strategy and financial forecasts                                 | 4.2.                        |\n| 3.                      | Resilience of the Group, taking into consideration different climate scenarios, including a scenario of 2\u00b0C  or less                 | 1.2. and 4.3.               |\n| Risks and opportunities | Risks and opportunities                                                                                                              |                             |\n| 1.                      | Procedures to identify and assess climate-related risks                                                                              | 3.5. and 4.2.               |\n| 2.                      | Procedures for managing climate-related risks                                                                                        | 3.5. and 4.2.               |\n| 3.                      | Integration of the procedures to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks within the total  management of the Group's risks | 3.2.                        |\n| Indicators              | Indicators                                                                                                                           |                             |\n| 1.                      | Indicators used to assess climate-related risks and opportunities, in line with the Group's strategy  and risk management procedure  | 4.1. and 4.3.               |\n| 2.                      | Scopes 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions and associated risks                                                                      | 4.2, 4.3. and 4.5.          |\n| 3.                      | Objectives used to manage climate-related risks and/or opportunities and the Group's performance  in relation to its objectives      | 1.1, 2.4, 4.3 and 4.4       |\n\n## 4.3.1.4.5. Alignment with the European Taxonomy, aiming primarily at sectors with the largest environmental footprint of which L'Or\u00e9al is not included\n\nIn application of European Regulation 2020/852 of 18 June 2020 (the  'Taxonomy'  Regulation),  L'Or\u00e9al  is  required  to  publish performance indicators for the 2021 financial year highlighting the  eligible  share  of  its  sales,  investments  and  operating expenses  resulting  from  products  and/or  services  associated with  economic  activities  considered  sustainable  within  the meaning of the  Regulation  and  the  Delegated  Acts  covering the  first  two  objectives  of  the  Taxonomy:  climate  change mitigation and climate change adaptation.\n\nThis first assessment  of  the  eligibility  of  all  the  Group's consolidated activities was conducted on the basis of:\n\n- \u25cf the  Climate  Delegated  Regulation  of  4  June  2021  and  its appendices  supplementing  Regulation  (EU)  2020/852, specifying the technical  criteria for determining  the conditions  under  which  an  economic  activity  qualifies  as contributing  substantially  to  climate  change  mitigation  or climate change adaptation;\n\n- \u25cf the  Delegated  Act  of  6  July  2021  and  its  appendices supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852, specifying how to calculate  the  performance  indicators  as  well  as  the narrative information to be published;\n- \u25cf a  detailed  analysis  of  all activities within its various consolidated  entities,  conducted  jointly  by  the  Finance Department, the Operations Department and the Department of Real Estate, the CSR Department, the Legal Department and the Research and Innovation Department.\n\nThe Group has not identified any eligible sales. In fact, under the first two objectives applicable from the 2021 financial year, mitigation and adaptation of climate change, the European Commission has prioritised the business sectors that contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions within the European Union.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  dedicated  solely  to  the  beauty  industry;  as such,  its  activities  are  not  considered,  within  the  meaning  of the  Taxonomy,  as  making  a  significant  contribution  to  these initial  climate  targets  or  as  a  priority  sector  targeted  by  the Taxonomy.  In  particular,  a  detailed  analysis  of  its  industrial activities in the production of raw materials did not identify any production  covered  by  the  Taxonomy  under  the  heading 'Manufacture of organic basic chemicals'.",

        "page_content": "## L'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nAs there were no eligible sales, there were no investments or operating expenses corresponding to activities related to sales that  could  be  qualified  as  eligible.  As  a  result,  the  various measures implemented to reduce the carbon footprint of the Group's  products  have  not  been  taken  into  account  in  the performance indicators relating to investments and operating expenses. The eligibility analysis for investments and operating expenses  was  therefore  focused  on  'individual  measures'  to reduce the Group's emissions, which explains why the eligible amounts are low, given the size of the Group.\n\nThe  eligible  investments  identified  mainly  correspond  to long-term  leases  on  buildings  (activity  7.7  of  the  Delegated Act) as defined by IFRS 16 but without analysis of the technical criteria (in line with the position of the French National Institute of  Statutory  Auditors)  as  well  as  to  the  costs  of  constructing and  renovating  buildings  to  improve  their  energy  efficiency and  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  Eligible  investments amounted to \u20ac404.8 million (including \u20ac374.8 million related to long-term leases on buildings without analysis of the technical criteria),  compared  to  total  investments  of  \u20ac1,971.1  million  as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThese investments do not include the amount of \u20ac100 million allocated  to  Impact  Investing  funds  intended  to  finance  the regeneration  of  damaged  natural  ecosystems  and  the  fight against climate change, in so far as investments in funds are not  considered  eligible  expenditure  under  the  Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nSimilarly, individual measures that incur operating expenses are limited  in  number  and  the  amounts  in  question  are  not significant for the Group. Furthermore, L'Or\u00e9al concluded that its research  and  innovation  programmes  are  not  eligible because  they  do  not  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  activities currently  covered  by  the  Taxonomy  (heavy  chemicals). It  should  be  noted  that  the  Group's  annual  budget  for  this category is significant: 1,029 million in 2021. L'Or\u00e9al's research and innovation is focused on Green Sciences (as described in section 4.3.1.3.1. 'Eco-designed products' of this document).\n\nThe  financial  information  used  to  conduct  this  initial  analysis was subject to additional reporting as part of the closing of the annual  financial  statements.  It  was  reviewed  and  analysed jointly  by  the  local  and  corporate  teams,  in  order  to  ensure that  it  was  consistent  with  consolidated  sales,  operating expenses,  and  investments  for  the  financial  year  2021.  In particular,  reporting  of  the  investment  data  was  subject  to self-assessment by the financial departments of the zones, with the consistency of the decisions regarding eligibility checked at corporate level.\n\nThe Group will adapt its methodology and eligibility analysis as the Taxonomy is implemented and in light of changes to the regulations, listed activities and technical review criteria.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  data  published  by  the  Group  in application  of  the  Taxonomy  Regulation,  it  should  be  noted that  L'Or\u00e9al  has,  for  many  years,  demonstrated  a  strong commitment  to  combating  climate  change.  In  2009  L'Or\u00e9al committed to reducing the environmental footprint of its plants and distribution centres by 50% compared  to  2005. Furthermore,  L'Or\u00e9al  placed  sustainability  at  the  heart  of  its strategy,  with  the  launch  of  the  Sharing  Beauty  With  All\n\nprogramme in 2013, with 2020 targets focused on sustainable production,  sustainable  innovation,  sustainable  consumption and shared growth. This meant that, by 2020, CO2 emissions by factories and distribution centres had fallen by 81% in absolute terms compared to 2005, while production had increased by 29% over the same period.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  sets  a  new  range  of particularly ambitious targets for 2030, covering all the impacts associated with the Group's value chain, including:\n\n- \u00b7 by 2025, carbon neutrality for all Group sites by improving energy efficiency and using 100% renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  reducing  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  25%  in absolute value compared to 2016 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3); and\n- \u00b7 by  2050,  aligning  the  trajectory  of  all  greenhouse  gas emissions  with  the  +1.5\u00b0C  scenario  approved  by  the Science-Based Targets initiative\n\nThese long-standing commitments set L'Or\u00e9al apart in terms of the action it takes. For example, L'Or\u00e9al is the only company in  the  world,  of  nearly  6,000,  to  have  received  three  'A' ratings,  from  the  Carbon  Disclosure  Project  for  the  sixth consecutive  year,  which  is  the  highest  score  in  three  areas: efforts  to  combat  climate  change,  forest  preservation  and sustainable water management.\n\nThe  goals  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  and  the 2021  results  are  described  in  greater  detail  in  this  section (see also section 4.4. 'L'Or\u00e9al for the Future: 2021 results' of this document,  which  reports  on  the  progress  made  on  the objectives, which is reported every year in this document).\n\n## 4.3.1.5. Contributing to solving the environmental challenges of the world\n\nIn  addition  to  transforming  its  economic  model,  the  Group's ambition is  to  help  to  solve  some  of  the  most  pressing  social and environmental challenges.\n\n## 4.3.1.5.1. Accelerating the development of the circular economy\n\nConscious  of  the  growing  pressure  on  natural  resources,  the global waste crisis and the role of the circular economy could play in mitigating climate change, L'Or\u00e9al has decided to set up  a  global  investment  fund  dedicated  exclusively  to  the circular economy, called the Circular Innovation Fund (CIF).\n\nThis  fund,  which  is  jointly  managed  by  two  management companies from different countries (Cycle Capital Management and Demeter) to firmly embed its international approach,  will  bring  together  several  co-investors  and  will have  an  estimated  total  value  of  between  \u20ac150  million  and \u20ac200 million over time. It aims to finance companies that are innovating in the areas of recycling, plastic waste management and materials from the bioeconomy.\n\nLaunched  at  the  end  of  2021,  the  fund  will  construct  and deploy  its  investment  portfolio  from  2022.    As  the  primary sponsor  of  the Circular  Innovation  Fund ,  L'Or\u00e9al  will  invest \u20ac50 million.\n\n4",

Contributing to the regeneration of nature\n\nAs part of its commitment to preserving biodiversity, and to go beyond  its  efforts  to  reduce  the  impact  of  its  value  chain, L'Or\u00e9al launched the L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Nature Regeneration in 2020.  This  \u20ac50  million  impact  investment  fund,  managed  by Mirova,  is  intended  to  simultaneously  combine  financial performance  with  the  creation  of  environmental  and  social value.\n\nBy supporting projects to rehabilitate degraded  soils, regenerate mangroves, and restore marine areas and forests, the  L'Or\u00e9al  Fund  for  Nature  Regeneration  aims  to  help preserve  or  restore  one  million  hectares  of  ecosystem,  to capture 15 to 20 million tonnes of CO2 and create hundreds of jobs by 2030.\n\nSince  the  fund  was  launched,  more  than  one  hundred projects  have  been  considered  for  the  purposes  of  building the investment portfolio. Fifteen projects have been selected for  further  study,  and  investment  has  commenced  in  four projects totalling more than two million euros.\n\nFor  example,  in  October  2021  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Fund  for  Nature Regeneration  invested  in  The  Real  Wild  Estates  Company\n\n(RWEC).    Based  in  the  county  of  Somerset  in  the  United Kingdom,  this  company  is  implementing  the  first  major 'rewilding'  project  led  by  the  private  sector  and  plans  to restore  50,000  hectares  of  degraded  habitats  across  the country and to create up to 1,000 direct jobs.\n\n## 4.3.2. Human Resources policy\n\nThe mission of L'Or\u00e9al's Human Resources Department (HR) is to support the Group's growth and its transformation initiatives. The Group, which has always placed people at the heart of its organisation,  relies  on  its  employees  above  all.  L'Or\u00e9al's  HR strategy  is  built  on  this  double  conviction:  individualised management linked with collective strength.\n\nTo meet the challenges of a world that is constantly changing, which impact both the organisation and the work relationship the  Group  initiated  a  process  of  transformation  to  adjust  its model to new aspirations and is implementing dedicated HR policies  on  recruitment,  development  and  engagement. These policies are described in this chapter.\n\nThe  Chief  Human  Relations  Officer,  who  is  member  of  the Executive  Committee,  reports  directly  to  the  Chief  Executive Officer on a regular basis.\n\n## Recruiting, developing and engaging: employees at the centre of the business model\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  always  placed  the  individual  at  the  centre  of  its model, convinced that the qualities of each one contribute to the performance of all. L'Or\u00e9al finds, recruits, and supports its employees with a long-term engagement vision. Training and development  play  a  central  role  all  along  their  professional careers.\n\nIn  order  to  fully  perform  their  function  as  strategic  partner, Human  Resources  integrates  the  technological  and  digital dimensions and takes into account strong challenges such as social  responsibility.  The  transformation  of  the  Group  towards Beauty Tech requires the recruitment of experts, the integration  of  new  businesses  and  the  dissemination  of  a digital culture at all levels of the company.\n\nHR  also  plays  a  central  role  in  the  transformation  of  work methods and management culture. Thus, they supported the rollout of the Simplicity programme, initiated in 2016, to foster a management style based on trust, leaving  room  to  initiative, cooperation and development. The programme was supported  by  a  major  training  programme,  LeadEnable  for Simplicity  and  specific  goals  target  the  highest  level  of  the Group. Since 2020, members of the Executive Committee and their Management Committees have been evaluated by their peers and their teams via the Leadership Survey.\n\nSince  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al's  HR  department  has  adopted  a  brand new  modus  operandi.  HR  has  become  the  incubator  for country ideas and initiatives as an extension to and in the spirit of  Simplicity.  With  the  Disrupt  HR  approach,  the  Group prioritises  co-construction  and  a  test-and-learn  approach designed to boost agility and respond more effectively to the expectations of employees and job candidates.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  committed  to  providing  training  to  100%  of  its employees every year, worldwide.\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  economic  growth  cannot  be  separated  from social progress. To support this conviction, the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care  programme,  created  in  2013  and  deployed  in  all  our subsidiaries,  offers  employees  a  set  of  benefits  organised around  four  pillars,  which  were  updated  in  2021:  welfare schemes,  healthcare,  work/life  balance  and  the  working environment. In 2021, Share & Care evolved to ensure that it remains  relevant  and  to  meet  employees'  needs  and expectations  at  every  key  moment  of  their  lives  in  this  fastchanging  world.  Emphasis  is  placed  on  health  with  a  global approach,  both  physical  and  mental,  as  well  as  on  new working methods.\n\nAs part of a responsible and innovative social policy, L'Or\u00e9al has also developed 'L'Or\u00e9al for Youth', a global programme to promote the employment of young people, which not only provides them with professional opportunities for work, but also provides them with concrete ways to boost their employability.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al also offers its employees a policy of sharing its growth. Profit-sharing programmes have been in place for many years everywhere  in  the  world.  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  an  employee  share ownership plan in 2018 and 2020.\n\nQuality social dialogue is also one of the essential components of the L'Or\u00e9al model. It illustrates the Group's desire to involve employees and their representatives to its development.\n\nFinally, L'Or\u00e9al acts with the conviction that a policy in favour of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion allows everyone, regardless of their background, gender identity, religion, sexual orientation, age or disability, to give their best in the company. This is an essential driver of performance and innovation and is crucial for maintaining sustainable growth.",

These  measures  were  audited  and  certified  in  several subsidiaries  by  an  independent  organisation.  They  are constantly updated  according  to  health  situation evolution;\n- \u00b7 measures focused on prevention have been in place in all L'Or\u00e9al sites since the beginning of the crisis, including social  distancing,  the  daily  distribution  of  masks,  the availability of sanitisers; the e-learning module #safetogether  was  rapidly  developed  internally  to  train employees in good personal protection practices;\n- \u00b7 vulnerable  or  at-risk  employees  are  exempt  from  being physically  present  at  work  depending  on  the  health situation in each country;\n- \u00b7 an  international  travel  ban  was  declared  in  February 2020  and  lasted  until  July  2021.

Preserving employee health and safety\n\n## An ambitious shared health and safety policy\n\nThe Health (H) and Safety (S) policy is a main priority objective of the Group's general policy, and one of its main managerial pillars.  All  managers are evaluated on their ability to apply it, and on their results in this area. It is based on the fundamentals presented in section 4.3.1.1.1. 'An ambitious EHS policy shared by all' of this document.\n\nMoving towards \u00ab zero accidents \u00bb is the ambition that L'Or\u00e9al has set for the safety of its employees. To this end, the Group has  implemented  comprehensive  programmes  aimed  at reducing  risks  and  ensuring  regular  improvement  in  results through the leadership of managers and the participation of staff at all levels.\n\nThe Group strives to ensure regulatory compliance with its own standards on its sites (industrial or administrative sites, research centres  stores),  and  makes  sure  that  its  subcontractors  and suppliers  ensure  the  health  and  safety  of  people  through  a specifically dedicated programme of external audits.\n\n## CHANGE IN SAFETY PERFORMANCE: CONVENTIONAL FREQUENCY RATE (TFC) (1)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n129  injured  with  lost-time  (L'Or\u00e9al  and  temporary  staff)  were reported in  2021,  compared with 107 injured with lost-time  in 2020.  The  conventional  frequency  rate  (TFc)  is  0.73  and  the enlarged total incident rate reported (TIRe) (2) is 1.39.\n\nwho were unable to work from home, also contributed to this increase.

Commitment and visible participation by management;\n- 3. Initiatives to fight the most frequent incidents, which include a global ergonomics  programme  and  a  specific  LIFE programme  (see  paragraph  'A  continuous  improvement process' in section 4.3.1.1.1.  of  this  document)  on  potentially serious accidents;\n- 4. Health and Safety organisation and practices in compliance with the Group's standards with ISO 45001 certification for all Operations sites;\n- 5.  Specific  training  programme for managers, EHS managers, operators/technicians and for all employees;\n- 6. Continuous  improvement  of  the  Health  and  Safety management systems at all sites;\n- 7. Active employee participation;\n- 8. Sharing of resources, feedback, and best practices.\n- 87%  of  the  Group's  factories  are  ISO  45001  certified  for  their safety policy.\n\n## A global programme dedicated to improving health and safety\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has programmes with specific and innovative tools to achieve excellence in safety, which is based on four areas:\n\n- \u00b7 a  strategy  based  on  risk  management,  the  search  for excellence  and  the  sharing  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  culture  outside the Group;\n- \u00b7 analysis  of  safety  and  health  risks  with  the  following  tools: GHAP  (Global  Hazard  Assessment  Procedure),  detailed SHAP (Safety Hazard Assessment Procedure), Ergoval, PSM (Process  Safety  Management),  CHERIE  (Chemical  Risk Evaluation);\n- \u00b7 analysis of the root causes for the occurrence of incidents/ accidents with the RCA tool (Root Cause Analysis);\n- \u00b7 The use of a correct prevention tool at the right time, such as:\n\n4",

Recruiting and supporting talents\n\nThe Group continually strives to enrich and diversify its pool of talent around the world for its present and future needs.\n\nThe  recruitment  teams  are  tasked  with  recruiting  the  best talent in all countries in which L'Or\u00e9al Group operates so as to form diverse teams that resemble our consumers and integrate all cultures. The local implementation of the recruitment policy is carried  out  by  a  network  of  local  recruitment  experts covering all countries.\n\nTo  select  the  best  talents  capable  of  contributing  to  its transformation, L'Or\u00e9al has always recruited on the basis not only of a candidate's skills, but also their potential. In 2021, the Group formalised  and  strengthened  its  definition  of  potential,  and implemented  innovative  methods  of  ensuring  its  recruitment  is more  inclusive.  Its  aim  is  to  capitalise  on  candidates'  strengths and  to  value  fundamental  traits  such  as  ambition,  resilience, empathy,  judgement,  and  learning  agility.  Once  recruited,  the\n\nGroup then supports its employees through a dynamic policy of continued professional development and internal promotion.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  a  unique  know-how  in  working  with  higher education to identify and recruit new graduates, with schemes such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Brandstorm , the Group's innovation competition for students, which brought together more than 60,000 students from  over  65  countries  in  2021,  in  a  completely  digital format, and gave them a unique experience allowing them to immerse themselves in the beauty industry, express their creativity  and  find  out  about  the  Group's  values  of innovation and entrepreneurship;\n- \u00b7 the Management  Trainee programme, a rotational programme  that  allows  new  graduates  to  prepare effectively to take on major business responsibilities. In 2021, this programme  was  offered  by  most  of  L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiaries.",

L'Or\u00e9al's  Social  Media  strategy  in  recruitment  has  also  been recognised  as  one  of  the  best  in  the  world  for  several  years. A  strong  presence  on  LinkedIn,  with  more  than  3.9  million followers, helps with proactively recruiting the best talent.\n\nFor  several  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  ranked  by  Glassdoor  as one of the best employers in France.\n\nAn International  Digital  team  provides  L'Or\u00e9al  recruiters  around the world with cutting edge digital tools to efficiently select the best  candidates  from  among  nearly  one  million  applications received. These solutions, such as MYA and SEEDLINK, use artificial intelligence, which both provides greater efficiency and targets a broader diversity of backgrounds.\n\nIn  2021,  the  recruiter  community  came  together  to  consider several  key  topics,  such  as  harmonising  our  practices  with GDPR requirements,  training  to  combat  unconscious  bias,  as well as overhauling training programs for new recruiters.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Group  also  launched 'L'Or\u00e9al  for  Youth',  its programme  aimed  at  supporting  the  employment  of  young people and improving their employment prospects throughout the world. Through  this comprehensive  and  long-term programme, the Group is committed to increasing the number of  job  opportunities  aimed  at  those  under  the  age  of  30, offering  training  packages  and  rolling  out  coaching  and mentoring initiatives.\n\nSuccessful integration of new employees lays the groundwork for a lasting, quality relationship with the Company. To this end, the 'FIT' integration programme provides a number of actions to  give  everyone  the  keys  to  success  within  the  Group,  both from  an  operational  standpoint  and  with  the  desire  to  share the corporate culture.\n\n## Learning in the context of Covid-19\n\nThe Covid-19 health crisis accelerated the transformation of the  business  and  changed  the  types  of  support  and upskilling required, while transforming learning methods and technologies. In this context, the Group's #SafeTogether elearning module, launched worldwide in May 2020, played a major role in the adoption of the right hygiene standards. It  contributed  to  the  protection  of  all  employees  from  the very  beginning  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis.  Nearly  65,000 employees have taken this  module  since  it  was  launched in 2020.\n\n## 4.3.2.3. Training and developing employees throughout their working life\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  always  considered  the  development  of  its employees as one of the main drivers of its performance and its  transformation, and has a driving ambition: to develop the potential  and  employability  of  each  employee  throughout their lives, and to prepare tomorrow's leaders.\n\nTo  achieve  this  aim,  the  People  Development  &  Learning teams  are  committed  to  providing  the  most  relevant  and modern  training  and  development  solutions  throughout  the world.\n\nThis  strategy  means  the  Group  is  recognised  as  a  centre  of excellence and contributes to L'Or\u00e9al's competitive advantage,  as  well  as  to  the  attraction,  engagement  and retention of employees.\n\nIt is based on five levers:\n\n- \u00b7 supporting and developing talent at each key stage of their career path;\n- \u25cf anticipating changes in job roles and the need for critical skills;\n- \u25cf large-scale upskilling (1) programmes to support transformations of the business and their respective challenges;\n- \u25cf sharing the corporate culture and the passion for the beauty industry to nurture a sense of belonging to the Group, as well as  sharing  our  raison  d'\u00eatre  'Create  the  beauty  that  moves the world'; and\n- \u25cf the growth experience of our employees, meaning the way to  live  out  their  development  every  day,  in  key  moments such as, for example, the day they join L'Or\u00e9al or enter a new  position , or  even  professional  and  development interviews.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  created  the 'Hybrid  Working'  elearning  module  to  support  the  Group's  new  policy  of maintaining  the  balance  between  on-site  working  and remote  working  and  making  this  arrangement  more effective.  A  'Best  of  Both  Worlds'  tool  kit  has  also  been made available to managers to enable them to train their teams in the best way and to implement this new policy. In total,  more  than  12,000  employees  have  already  been trained using one of these resources.\n\n4",

This programme, which has benefited more than 60,000 employees, has developed in order to support the development of essential new skills, around two major components:\n\n- \u00b7 integrating  digital  competencies  into  all  of  the  Group's training  plans,  particularly  within  the 'L'Or\u00e9al  University  for Marketing' ; and\n- \u00b7 consolidating  the  new  skills  necessary  for  the  digital transformation, particularly in e-commerce, with the launch of the 'L'Or\u00e9al  University  for  e-Commerce' in 2022, guaranteeing the best training offering in this field.\n\nIn  the  context  of  the  transformation  towards  Beauty  Tech, engaging all employees is a priority for the Group.\n\nFor  tech  and  data  experts,  L'Or\u00e9al  offers  a  personalised training course tailored to the various job roles, which aims to ensure  that  everyone  is  able  develop  their  skills  in  the  tech fields of the future (data, artificial intelligence, cyber security, enterprise architecture, etc.).\n\nAt the same  time, opportunities for training in new technologies  and  data  enable  all  employees  to  acquire  the technological  knowledge  base  required  to  tackle  the challenges  of  the  future  and  thus  contribute  to  the  Beauty Tech transformation.\n\nWith  regard  to  CSR,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  a  training  course  called 'Green Steps' for its teams as part of the launch of the L'Or\u00e9al for the  Future  programme.  This  programme  offers  podcast-based e-learning modules and webinars with Group experts as well as an online self-assessment called the Green Test. The programme has  four  components:  climate  change,  water,  biodiversity  and natural resources. This programme  has  been  rolled  out worldwide. At the end of 2021, 41,500 employees had started this programme and 35,000 had already completed it.\n\nWith  regard  to  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  (DE&I),  L'Or\u00e9al has developed a training course based on four fundamental pillars: gender equality and the inclusion of LGBTQIA+ people, disability,  socio-economic and multicultural background, age and  intergenerational  issues.  Available  to  all  subsidiaries,  this course  is  prioritised  for  new  arrivals  and  is  delivered  in  a workshop  format  via  a  virtual  classroom.  The  DE&I  offering  is both modular and flexible, with remote and in-person content, which  means  it  can  be  easily  adapted  to  various  local settings.\n\nThe  last  two  years,  which  have  been  characterised  by  high levels  of  remote  working,  have  accelerated the digitalisation of the offering, with nearly 85 resources (e-learning, e-conferences, podcasts, etc.) available in several languages on the My Learning website.\n\nA true revolution in working methods and leadership has been accomplished in five years thanks to the Simplicity project, thus demonstrating the Group's great agility. All the principles and methods  promoted  by  Simplicity  have  proved  to  be particularly effective to boost the engagement of teams.\n\nThe three major advances of this year were:\n\n- \u00b7 a  Leadership  Survey  rolled  out  for  the  first  time  to  the  top 2,000  executives,  covering  nine  exemplary  practices  of Simplicity,  the  results  of  which  are  taken  into  account  for awarding a bonus;\n- \u00b7 the launch of a quarterly webinar, LeadEnable for Simplicity, which  brings  together  500  participants  from  25  countries with  the  aim  of  sharing  the  fundamentals  of  Simplicity  with new arrivals; and\n- \u00b7 the  continuation  of  a  Leaders  Modelling  Feed-Back campaign: Two thirds of the Group's Executive Committee teams  have  already  integrated  these  rituals  in  their  daily practice.\n\nThese  transformations  were  supported  by  the  'Learn  Today, Shape  Tomorrow'  campaign,  a  series  of  monthly  newsletters circulated Group-wide from February 2021.\n\n## Learning for all & 'Next Learning'\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is committed to learning for all, which it considers to be a human and social responsibility.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  achieved  its  target  of  training  100%  of  its employees.

This consists of maximising the impact of learning initiatives, by simplifying and adding value for all subjects possible. There are four core pillars to this challenge:\n\n- 1. Prioritising key skills by ensuring that more than 90% of the target for 'must-do' programmes is met. The aim of these programmes is to provide employees at different levels with the  essential  skills  they  need  to  excel  in  their  work  and  to lead the Group's major transformations;\n- 2. Making employees the drivers of their own development, with the goal that at least 50% of the overall learning hours come from self-directed learning offers;\n- 3. Measuring  the  impact  of  all  training  programmes  with a  target  of  achieving  a  training  impact  score  of  at  least 80/100  points.  This  score  is  evaluated  by  the  participant after each training session; and\n- 4. Optimising  the  training  organisation  and  modernising  the training methods in order to train more and train better, by investing in the excellence of the Learning Community.\n\nIn order  to  anticipate  these  critical  skills,  the  Learning Departments of our Divisions and Business Lines work in close collaboration with their Operational Departments. This planning  work  establishes upskilling  roadmaps  for  different areas  of  expertise  and  identifies  the  most  suitable  learning solutions to meet those needs.\n\nThe Learning Departments of the Zones have a critical role in the  activation  of  these  solutions  and  participate  in  creating regional offers adapted to the specific features of their zone.\n\nThe Zones rely on regional campuses to ensure the large-scale deployment  of  all  solutions.  These  campuses  have  unique know-how  in  terms  of  designing  and  delivering  remote learning programs that fully engage the participants.\n\n## A learning offering transformed by technology\n\nEmployees  training  forms  part  of  a  comprehensive  EdTech (education  technology)  ecosystem  that  makes  use  of  digital content  providers,  interactive  animation  solutions,  or  unique learning  experiences.  In  2021,  the  Group  turned  to  new learning  content  providers  (LinkedIn  Learning,  TED@Work, Busuu)  to  further  enhance  its  existing  online  offering  and  to prepare  for  the  launch  of  a  fully  revitalised  learning experience in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, due to developments in the public health landscape, the  total  number  of  training  hours  from  remote  and  microlearning  formats  was  lower  than  in  2020,  but  still  well  above 2019 levels, indicating that new digital learning habits are here to stay.\n\n- \u00b7 MyLearning.com, the Group's e-learning platform, counted over  66,000  regular  users (1) (-  2.6%  vs  2020,  but  +16.8% compared to 2019) representing nearly 540,000 hours of elearning (- 7.9% vs 2020, but 2.5 times higher than in 2019).\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  over  2,700  employees  registered  for  the  MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) from Coursera, with a very high  certification  rate  of  43%  representing  more  than 17,000 hours of learning.\n- \u00b7 The functionalities of the Microsoft Teams platform enabled the  Group  to  set  up  live  remote  learning  sessions  totalling more  than  1,000,000  training  hours  (i.e.  +8%  compared  to 2020).\n\nThese  technologies  also  helped  us  to  reach  more  target employees more quickly: Marketing Media Week, for example, attracted nearly 5,000 participants from around the world.\n\n## Accreditation and rewards for L'Or\u00e9al's learning strategy\n\nAfter a 6-month evaluation process, the European Foundation for  Management  Development  (EFMD) (2) awarded  L'Or\u00e9al with the CLIP (3) accreditation for a period of 5 years for all the activities  delivered  by  the  L'Or\u00e9al  University  Leadership  & Culture.\n\nIn  2021,  the  Learning France teams won second place in the 'Victoires des Leaders du Capital Humain' (Human Resources Leaders  Awards)  organised  by  D\u00e9cideurs  magazine  for  the following initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 in  the  professional  training  category:  for  the  'Learning Never Stops' campaign;\n- \u00b7 in the Leadership & Management category: for its strategy to support hybrid working for managers and employees;\n- \u00b7 in  the  international  human  resources  category:  for  its 'Licence to Develop' workshop on the role of the manager as a 'people developer'.\n\n## 4.3.2.4. Creating conditions for a stimulating and attractive work environment\n\n## The L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme: an accelerator of social progress\n\nAll  along  its  history,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  aimed  to  offer  its  employees security and protection to enable them to work with peace of mind.  L'Or\u00e9al's  Share  &  Care  programme  follows  on  from  a long  tradition  of  social  progress  and  caring  of  the  individual. L'Or\u00e9al  makes,  and  will  continue  to  make,  a  difference  by putting  people  at  the  centre  of  its  concerns,  its  organisation and therefore its development.\n\nThe  Group  has  thus  set  a  goal  to  create  an  attractive  work environment  in  which  all  employees  can  thrive  at  both  a professional and personal level.\n\n4",

This is a strong commitment that reflects the Company's vision that sustainable growth necessarily goes hand in hand with a high level of social performance.\n\nThe programme was launched in 2013, improved in 2017, and implemented collaboratively in all the subsidiaries. The Group's ambition is three-fold:\n\n- \u00b7 establish a common base of social protection, i.e. minimum guarantees in all subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 become one of the top performers in each local market, by going  beyond  the  common  base  whenever  local  best practices offer more;\n- \u00b7 make  each  subsidiary  a  'social  innovation  laboratory'. Through local initiatives, the subsidiaries are encouraged to set  up  initiatives  adapted  to  the  expectations  of  their employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpdated  in  2021,  the  programme  strengthens  the  existing frame  while  adapting  it  to  a  changing  world.  It  offers  new perspectives,  particularly  in  terms  of  personal  ecology  and flexibility  at  work,  with  measures  that  reflect  the  changing needs of employees.\n\nThe  essential  components  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care programme have now been deployed in all Group subsidiaries and new components are being rolled out with implementation  targets  that  vary  between  2021  and  2023, based on the priority accorded by the programme.\n\n## The four pillars of the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme\n\nThis  large-scale  social  programme  consists  of  commitments revolving  around  four  pillars  that  were  updated  in  2021  and implemented  in  all  countries:  social  protection,  healthcare, work/life balance and the working environment.\n\n| Pillars                         | Objectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Main commitments achieved or in progress in all countries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PROTECTION (Welfare schemes)    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|                                 | Providing  employees  and  their  families with  financial  support  in  the  event  of unexpected  life  events,  by  allocating appropriate assistance.                                                                                                      | 24 months' salary, or equivalent pension, in the event of natural or accidental death. 24 months' salary, or equivalent pension,  in case of total permanent disability.

As  a  result,  the  ILO launched  the  Global  Business  Network  for  Social  Protection Floor  in  October  2015.  This  network  allows  acting  collectively and  mobilising  to  create  a  basic  set  of  social  protection measures for everyone. L'Or\u00e9al is a founding member of this new network created by the ILO to promote social protection all over the world.\n\n## Covid-19 health crisis: teleworking and cyber security\n\nThe  implementation of  teleworking  hugely  benefitted  from the security measures in place at L'Or\u00e9al, in particular, the encryption of hard drives, the use of security certificates to establish  secure  connections,  anti-spam  and  anti-virus\n\n## Flexible work organisation\n\nIn  each  subsidiary,  work  is  organised  according  to  local context  and  to  the  activity    performed  in  compliance  with legal and contractual obligations. In several subsidiaries, both work  organisation  and  working  time  are  part  of  collective agreements.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  believes  that  flexibility  at  work  is  a  key  element  in attractiveness.  Launched  in  2021,  the  third  step  of  L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care strengthened work flexibility with the implementation of the global 'Hybrid Working' policy, which provides  up  to  two  days  of  remote  work  per  week  on  a voluntary basis, for eligible employees, in agreement with line manager  and  in  accordance  with  the  organisation  of  the team.  In  2021,  all  Group  subsidiaries  set  up  remote  working, taking  into  consideration  the  evolution  of  the  Covid-19  crisis, and adopted the new 'Hybrid Working' policy when this was compatible  with  the  local  health  situation.  In  addition, 61 subsidiaries have now set up a flexible working time policy. Employees  from  all  categories  have  chosen  the  option  of part-time work. In 2021, there were 5,113 part-time employees, 4,597 of whom were women and 516 were men.\n\nprotection  of  emails,  protection  of  Internet  access  via access gateway in the cloud and two-factor authentication of users.\n\nIn the context of crisis management, this protection was even reinforced primarily to fighting phishing threats, notably with an additional  verification  of  URL  links  in  messages,  as  well  as highlighting emails from external sources.\n\n## An active social dialogue with employees and their representatives\n\nAs  a  signatory  of  the  United  Nations  Global  Compact  since 2003,  and  in  compliance  with  its  Employee  Human  Rights Policy,  L'Or\u00e9al  respects  the  freedom  of  association  and  the right  to  collective  bargaining.  In  countries  where  freedom  of association  and  the  right  to  collective  bargaining  are restricted  or  non-existent,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  other modes  of  dialogue  with  its  employees  that  allow  them  to report their possible concerns.\n\nIn  the  context  of  this  general  principle,  the  social  climate  at L'Or\u00e9al is the fruit of an  ongoing  dialogue  between Management,  employees  and  their  representatives, in accordance with trade union rights in each country and with a  neutral  attitude  with  regard  to  the  various  trade  union organisations.\n\nWhen  employees  wish  to  be  represented  by  authorised employee  representatives,  these  representatives  are  elected by  employees  without  company  interference.  Therefore, employee representative institutions are in place in most of the European  subsidiaries,  in  several  Asian  subsidiaries  (China, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Japan and Vietnam), in Africa (South  Africa,  Kenya  and  Morocco),  in  North  America  and South America (Canada, United States, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico), and also in Australia and New Zealand.  Employee  representatives  have  access  to  the workplace, to consenting employees, to collective bargaining agreements as well as to local documentation useful for the performance  of  their  mission,  subject  to  compliance  with Group's legitimate rules on confidentiality and security.\n\n4",

'Two Directors representing the employees since July 2014' of this document).\n\nAn  agreement  signed  in  1996  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and  French and  European  trade  unions  led  to  the  establishment  of  the Company's Instance Europ\u00e9enne de Dialogue Social / European  Works  Council.  This  council  leads  discussions  and formal  meetings  with  its  members  about  the  Group's  current situation  and future perspectives, on the basis of an agenda prepared  with  the  Liaison  Secretariat.  This  council  covers approximately  30,000  employees  in  25  member  countries  of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's social policy permits the signing of a certain number of collective agreements every year. In 2021, 148 agreements were signed in France and 100 agreements were signed in the rest of the world. In total, the number of agreements in force on 31 December 2021 was 743, 424 of which were in France. 117 agreements in force cover health and safety, in whole or in part.\n\nThese agreements primarily cover work organisation, remuneration and working conditions (working hours, quality of life  at  work,  professional  equality,  remote  working,  health  and safety,  etc.).  They  contribute  to  the  proper  functioning  and  to the performance of the Group since they strengthen employee participation and dialogue with their representatives.\n\n## 4.3.2.5. Offering a motivating and competitive remuneration system\n\n## The principles of the remuneration policy\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  remuneration  policy  aims  at  supporting  the achievement of the Group's objectives and is an integral part of its development strategy. L'Or\u00e9al wants to attract and retain talents,  propose  motivating  career  paths  and  encourage performance  and  engagement  of  its  employees  while accompanying the evolution of its jobs and business.\n\nFor  L'Or\u00e9al,  social  and  economic  performance  are  closely linked. The Group ensures that all employees receive at least the  minimum salary set by local law or applicable collective agreements.  In  most  of  the  countries,  L'Or\u00e9al's  lowest  base salaries are much higher than the national minimum wages in force.\n\nA  process  to  monitor  remuneration  practices  is  in  place  to ensure  that  the  Group's  permanent  employees  receive  at least a \"living wage\", i.e. a salary that covers their basic needs, as  calculated  in  line  with  the  best  practices  and  with  the support of independent experts.\n\nA  total  rewards  approach  is  used  to  provide  each  employee with a competitive rewards package including both compensation  elements  (fixed  pay,  variable  pay,  long-term incentives) and employee benefits.\n\nThe  Group  is  implementing  a  remuneration  policy  that combines  external  competitiveness  with  internal  equity,  and rewards  both  individual  and  collective  performances.    In addition,  employees  share  in  the  Company's  results  through results-based  collective  profit-sharing  schemes  rolled  out globally.\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al remuneration policy is formalised within a \"Rewards charter\" and is implemented by a network of Rewards experts present  in  the  different  countries.  External  surveys  are conducted every year with specialist firms to ensure L'Or\u00e9al's competitive  positioning  in  relation  to  each  local  reference market.\n\nFinally,  L'Or\u00e9al's  ambition  is  for  all  employees  to  understand their remuneration and how it is determined. The Group makes sure  that  it  communicates  clearly  and  transparently  on  this subject.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  remuneration  policy  is  supported  by  an  annual employee performance assessment system applied in all the Group's  subsidiaries. It enables  the  communication  of remuneration  decision  making  principles,  processes  and outcomes.  The  Group's  subsidiaries  are  encouraged  to provide employees, once a year, with a document presenting the  evolution  of  the  remuneration  package  and  its  various components with clarity and transparency.\n\n## Personnel costs (including welfare contributions)\n\n| \u20ac millions   | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total        | 6,131  | 6,124  | 6,471  |\n\nThe  comparison  between  the  three  years  takes  into  account  the  impacts  of foreign  exchange  and  is  not  representative  of  the  real  changes  in  personnel costs.\n\n## Employee shareholding plans\n\nIn  line  with  the  L'Or\u00e9al  policy  to  share  growth  with  its employees,  in  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  launched  its  first  worldwide employee share ownership plan, with very satisfactory results. This plan was indeed recognised by the French Federation of Employees  and  Former  Employee  Shareholder  Associations (FAS),  which  awarded  L'Or\u00e9al  the  \"CAC  All  Tradable  Grand Prix\" in 2018.\n\nA second employee share ownership plan was put in place in 2020,  as  L'Or\u00e9al  intended  to  offer  a  new  opportunity  for employees  to  support  the  growth  of  the  company  and participate in its strategic project. These plans are designed to gather, unite and increase the loyalty of employees worldwide by enhancing a feeling of belonging, engagement and social cohesion. Eligible employees had the possibility of purchasing shares with preferential conditions including, where permitted by local law, a 20% discount on the share reference price with an  employer  matching  share  contribution  of  up  to  4  free shares.\n\nThe plan was rolled out in 57 countries in 2020, 6 more than in 2018. Once again, it was a big success with a 35% subscription rate,  similar  to  the  first  plan,  which  represents  a  high percentage  compared  to  companies  that  have  set  up employee shareholding plans (1) .",

Under  the  19 th resolution  submitted  for approval by the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2022, the Board of Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  9  February  2022  and  on the recommendation of the Human  Resources and Remuneration Committee, decided to introduce new criteria to  assess  the  extra-financial  performance  in  addition  to  the financial  performance  for  the  conditional  grant  of  shares to employees, in order to align them with L'Or\u00e9al's strategy in which economic and social performance go hand-in-hand.\n\nTo ensure consistency with the Group's strategic objectives, the choice of  beneficiaries  and  the  vesting  criteria  are  determined by a specific policy (see section 7.4. 'Long-term incentive plans' of  this  document).  The  Board  of  Directors,  subject  to  the recommendation  of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration Committee,  approves  the  conditional  grant  of  shares  and  lays down the applicable rules.\n\n53%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  7  October  2021  plan  are women.  More  than  3,600  employees,  representing  around 9.5% of the managers around the world, nearly 58% of whom are in international subsidiaries, benefit or have benefited from at  least  one  stock-option  plan  or  one  conditional  grant  of shares plan (ACAs) since 2017, and were still employees of the Company as of 31 December 2021.\n\n## Profit sharing schemes\n\nFor  many  years,  L'Or\u00e9al's  policy  has  been  to  associate employees  in  the  results  of  the  Company  with  the  aim  of strengthening their feeling of belonging and their motivation. In the  context  of  the  profit-sharing  schemes  in  place, \u20ac352 million were redistributed to L'Or\u00e9al's employees in 2021 on the basis of 2020 results.\n\nIn 1968, an employee profit sharing agreement (' participation ')  was  signed  in  France,  followed  by  another agreement (' int\u00e9ressement ')  in  1988,  and  these  agreements have been constantly renewed since then.\n\nSince  2001,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  a  Worldwide  Profit Sharing Programme in all the Group's subsidiaries in which the employees  do  not  benefit  from  legal  or  contractual  profit sharing schemes. The amounts paid within this framework are calculated  locally  on  the  basis  of  the  turnover  and  profit  of each subsidiary, as compared to the budgeted targets.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  decided  to  give  employees  an  exceptional profit  sharing  award  equivalent  to  a  minimum  of  two  weeks' salary throughout the world, following the Covid-19 health crisis that  marked  the  year  2020.  With  this  gesture,  the  Group wished  to  recognise  the  collective  effort  of  its  employees during this difficult period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Amounts paid under  these programmes  (in \u20ac million)   |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total  (1)                                             |    310 |    368 |    352 |\n\n- (1) Profit sharing schemes.\n\n## Employee benefit and pension schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  wants  to  ensure  that  its  employees  benefit  from competitive  retirement  and  welfare  schemes  in  all  countries. Since  2002,  an  International  Benefits  Supervisory  Committee overviews  the  management  of  these  schemes  in  the subsidiaries  and  monitors  the  implementation  of  L'Or\u00e9al's Retirement and Employee Benefits policy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitments  with  regard  to  welfare  schemes  are part  of  the  Protection  pillar  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care programme.  In  all  subsidiaries, L'Or\u00e9al guarantees  the payment  of  a  lump  sum,  or  equivalent  pension,  equal  to  a minimum of 24 months' salary  in  the  event  of  death  or  total permanent disability, or a higher amount where it is the local practice.\n\nThe  characteristics  of  retirement  schemes  and  other  end  of career benefits offered by the subsidiaries vary depending on the applicable laws and regulations as well as local practices.\n\nIn  88%  of  the  countries  where  L'Or\u00e9al  operates,  the  Group contributes  along  with  its  employees  to  the  build-up  of supplemental retirement benefits for its employees in addition to the minimum benefits of the public social security system.\n\nRetirement  plans  are  financed  by  payments  into  specialised funds  or  by  setting  up  provisions,  in  accordance  with  the accounting standards adopted by L'Or\u00e9al. The performance of the managers of the main investment funds, as well as the financial  stability  rating  of  the  custodians,  are  regularly reviewed by the International Benefits Supervisory Committee.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  does  not  propose  company  retirement  plans  in countries that do not have an appropriate legal framework or without  long-term  investment  instruments  and  in  countries where there is a satisfactory public social security system. The International Benefits Supervisory Committee remains attentive to  changes  to  local  situations  and,  when  needed  additional complementary schemes are put in place.\n\n## Overview of the Pension and Employee Welfare schemes in France\n\n## Pension schemes\n\nTo  supplement  the  pensions  provided  for  by  the  compulsory French  pension  scheme,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  implemented  some supplementary pension schemes described below:\n\n## Defined contribution scheme\n\nIn  September  2003,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a  'defined  contribution pension scheme'.\n\nAll  categories of employees are beneficiaries of this scheme, after  one  year  of  employment,  that  is  financed  jointly  by L'Or\u00e9al  and  the  employee,  and  that  makes  it  possible  for everyone to build up retirement savings.\n\nThis  scheme  entitles  pensioners  to  a  lifelong  annuity  (or  to  a lump-sum,  under  certain  conditions),  calculated  after  they claim  their  pension  rights  with  the  Social  Security  pension system, calculated on the basis of the capital formed by the contributions paid  and  the  financial  income  on  such contributions at the end of the employee's career, as well as the annuity option selected.\n\n4",

        "page_content": ".\n\nPolicies, performance indicators and results\n\nOn 1 April 2021, the scheme was converted into a Mandatory Company Savings Plan (Plan d'Epargne Entreprise Obligatoire - PERO) within the framework laid down by the French Pacte law  (Loi  Pacte).  This  made  it  possible  to  introduce  many improvements to the scheme, such as new options for paying into it, more diversified financial investments and more flexible exit conditions.\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has also set up defined benefit schemes with unvested entitlements,  initially  differential  followed  by  an  additive defined  benefit  schemes,  in  order  to  take  into  account important  developments  impacting  these  schemes  and  with the aim of building a coherent system between the different pension schemes that exist in the Company.\n\nFrench Order No. 2019-697 of 3 July 2019 that transposed EU Directive of 16 April 2014 into French law no longer allows the acquisition of unvested new rights in schemes open on 20 May 2014 for employment periods after 31 December 2019. In this context, L'Or\u00e9al froze the rights at 31 December 2019 and, in 2021,  finalised  the  establishment  of  two  substitution  schemes with vested rights in compliance with French Order no. 2019697 for employment periods from 1 January 2020, following the publication  of  the  circular  of  23  December  2020.  These schemes are the 'Supplementary pension scheme for Former Senior  Managers  with  vested  rights'  (Retraite  suppl\u00e9mentaire des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres  Dirigeants  \u00e0  droits  acquis)  and the 'Retirement Income  Guarantee  for former senior managers  with  vested  rights'  (Garantie  de  Ressources  des Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens  Cadres  Dirigeants  \u00e0  droits  acquis).  These schemes  are  considered  as  the  continuations  of  the  old schemes  because  of  the  consistency  in  terms  of  population and benefits.\n\nThe  'Supplementary  pension  scheme  for  Former  Senior Managers'  (Retraite  suppl\u00e9mentaire  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens Cadres Dirigeants) concerns retirees who have held positions as  senior  managers  for  a  minimum  of  10  years,  hired  or promoted to this position between 1 January 2016 and 4 July 2019, who end their career in the Company. This is an additive defined  benefit  pension  scheme  which  grants  entitlement  to payment  of  a  life  annuity.  The  reference  salary  taken  into account  for  calculation  of  the  pension  is  the  fraction  of  the salary  which  exceeds  six  times  the  French  annual  Social Security  ceiling.  The  calculation  base  of  the  supplementary pension is the average of the revalued reference salaries for the best three full years of activity out of the seven calendar years  prior  to  the  end  of  their  career.  The  supplementary pension  is  1.36%  of  the  calculation  base  per  year  of  service within the Group until 31 December 2019, up to a maximum of 25 years. Any retiree who so wishes could elect an option of a surviving spouse pension.\n\nAccess to the 'Retirement Income Guarantee for former senior managers'  (Garantie  de  Ressources  des  Retrait\u00e9s  Anciens Cadres  Dirigeants)  was  closed  on  31  December  2015.  This scheme,  created  on  1  January  2001,  was  open  to  former senior  managers  of  L'Or\u00e9al  who,  in  addition  to  fulfilling  the requirement of having ended their career with the Company, met the condition of having had the status of senior manager for  at  least  ten  years  at  the  end  of  their  career.  It  provides entitlement to payment to beneficiary retirees of a life annuity, as  well  as,  after  their  death,  the  payment,  subject  to conditions,  to  their  spouse  and/or  ex-spouse(s)  of  a  surviving spouse  pension  and,  to  the  children,  of  an  orphan  pension. The calculation base is the average of the salaries for the best three years out of the seven calendar years prior to the end of the  senior  manager's  career  at  L'Or\u00e9al.  The  pension  is calculated on the basis of the number of years of professional service  in  the  Company until  31  December 2019, capped at\n\n25  years,  each  year  leading  to  a  progressive  and  regular increase  of  1.8%  in  the  level  of  the  guarantee.  The  pension cannot  exceed  50%  of  the  calculation  base  or  exceed  the average of the fixed part of wages. A gross annuity and gross lump sum equivalent are then calculated, taking into account the sum of the annual pensions accrued by beneficiaries as a result  of  their  professional  activity  and  assuming  that  their retirement  age  is  65.  The  life  annuity  is  the  result  of  the conversion into an annuity at the beneficiaries' actual age on the  date  they  apply  for  their  pension  of  the  gross  lump  sum equivalent, less the amount of all payments due as a result of termination of the employment contract, excluding any paid notice period and paid holiday, and less all salaries paid under any  early  retirement  leave.  Around  330  senior  managers  are eligible  for  these  schemes  if  they  fulfil  all  conditions  after ending their career with the Company.\n\nAccess to the 'Pension Cover for Members of the Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture' (Garantie de Retraite des Membres du Comit\u00e9 de Conjoncture) was closed on 31 December 2000. This former scheme  granted  entitlement  to  beneficiary  retirees,  after having ended their career with the Company, of a life annuity as  well  as,  after  their  death,  the  payment  under  certain conditions  to  the  spouse  and/or  ex-spouse(s)  of  a  surviving spouse  pension  and,  to  the  children,  of  an  orphan  pension. The  calculation  base  for  the  pension  is  the  average  of  the salaries  for  the  best  three  years  out  of  the  seven  calendar years  prior  to  the  end  of  the  beneficiary's  career  at  L'Or\u00e9al. The  pension  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  the  beneficiary's number of years'  service,  with  a  ceiling  of  40  years,  it  being specified  that  at  the  date  of  closure  of  the  scheme,  on 31  December  2000,  the  minimum  length  of  service  required was  10  years.  The  pension  may  not  exceed  40%  of  the calculation base, plus 0.5% per year for the first twenty years, then  1%  per  year  for  the  following  twenty  years,  nor  exceed the average of the fixed part of the salaries. Around 120 senior managers  (active  or  retired)  are  eligible  for  this  scheme subject  to  the  requirement,  for  those  in  active  employment, that  they  fulfil  all  the  conditions  after  having  ended  their career with the Company.\n\n## Collective Retirement Savings plan (PERCO)\n\nSince  2003,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  proposed  that  employees  make savings with a view to their retirement within the scope of the PERCO.  If  the  profit  sharing  is  placed  in  the  PERCO,  a  100% matching  contribution  is  paid  by  the  Company  on  the  first \u20ac1,200 gross and 50% thereafter (capped at \u20ac4,600/year total PERCO employer contributions). For employees who pay 100% of their profit sharing into the PERCO for five consecutive years, an employer contribution of \u20ac600 gross is paid into the PERCO (Club  PERCO)  in  the  fifth  year.  Since  2021,  an  additional employer contribution  of  \u20ac150  gross  has  been  paid  from  the sixth consecutive year in which 100% of the profit sharing has been  invested  into  the  PERCO.  Each  year,  employees  may also  transfer  10  days  of  saved  leave  time  (Compte  \u00c9pargne Temps,  or  CET)  in  the  PERCO.  An  additional  employer contribution of 20% is paid for these days.\n\n## Pre-retirement arrangements\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  pays  close  attention  to  its  employees'  retirement conditions. The existing arrangements are, in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 early  retirement  leave  ('cong\u00e9  de  fin  de  carri\u00e8re',  CFC): this  early  retirement  arrangement  consists  of  exempting employees from the requirement to perform their activities, while  maintaining  their  remuneration  (up  to  a  limit  of \u20ac10,611  gross/month)  as  well  as  profit  sharing,  incentives and paid leave. The CFC may range from 3 months for 20 years' seniority to 9 months for 30 years' seniority and more; and",

Thus,  when  they retire,  employees  may  benefit  from  retirement  indemnities ranging  from  2  months'  salary  for  5  years'  service  to 8 months' salary for 40 years of service. In order to increase the special leave prior to retirement, employees may opt to convert all or part of their retirement indemnities into time, or  may  choose  to  receive  payment  of  all  or  part  of  the retirement indemnities, which will be made at the time they leave the Company.\n\nThese  commitments  are  guaranteed  by  external  financial cover  aimed  at  gradually  building  up  funds  derived  from premiums paid to external organisations.\n\n- \u00b7 The  Time  Savings  Account  (CET):  this  optional  scheme enables  employees  to  plan  the  end  of  their  career  or increase their retirement income. Employees can bank up to 10 days of leave per year in the CET, five days of which attract  an  employer  contribution  of  +25%  and/or  a  cash payment, up to a maximum of 6% of gross remuneration per year.  This  scheme  is  capped  at  300  days.  The  CET  can finance a shift to part-time working from the age of 55, early retirement,  increased  retirement  income,  or  a  retirement lump-sum.  CET  savings  are  valued  on  the  basis  of  the employee's  final  salary.  A  maximum  of  10  days  per  year can be transferred to the defined contribution scheme or the  L'Or\u00e9al  PERCO  (CET  days  transferred  to  the  PERCO attract an employer contribution of +20%).\n\n## Employee Welfare schemes in France\n\nIn addition to the compulsory guarantees provided for by the collective  bargaining  agreements,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  set  up,  in France,  under  an  agreement,  an  Employee  Welfare  scheme providing additional collective guarantees to its employees.\n\nAll these guarantees are based on gross income and can total up  to  eight  times  the  French  annual  social  security  ceiling. They  are  generally  financed  on  Brackets  A,  B,  and  C  of income, except for the Education Annuity which is based on Brackets  A  and  B,  and  the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  which  is based on Brackets B and C.\n\nThis  Employee  Welfare  scheme  provides  guarantees  in  the event of:\n\n- \u00b7 incapacity: to all employees, 90% of their gross remuneration limited to 8 social security caps, at this level net of charges, after the first 90 days of work stoppage; in the event of disability: to all employees, a fraction that is a function of the level of disability, rising to 90% of their gross remuneration  limited  to  8  social  security  caps,  up  to  this amount net of charges;\n- \u00b7 in the event of death:\n- \u00b7 for  all  employees,  the  payment  of  a  Lump  Sum  Death Benefit,  increased  depending  on  the  employee's  family status. The amount of this Benefit is doubled in the event of accidental death;\n- \u00b7 for  the  employees  affiliated  with  the  benefit  scheme  for managers,  employees  governed  by  Article  36  of  the AGIRC  convention and sales representatives, the payment of a Spouse Pension to the surviving spouse. This ensures  that  the  spouse  has  an  income  similar  to  the Surviving Spouse Pension paid for supplementary retirement  contributions  on  the  portion  of  remuneration greater  than  the  annual  cap  on  social  security  if  death had occurred at the age of 65; and\n- \u00b7 for all  employees, the payment of an Education Annuity to  each  dependent  child,  according  to  an  age-based schedule.\n\nThe  total  amount  of  the  Lump  Sum  Equivalent  for  these guarantees may not exceed \u20ac2.3 million per event.\n\n## Minimum guaranteed lump sum death benefits\n\nL'Or\u00e9al has established an additional guaranteed Lump Sum Death  Benefit  that  supplements,  where  applicable,  for  all employees, the Lump Sum Death Benefit in an amount equal to three years' average income. The total amount of the risk capital  needed  to  fund  the  Surviving  Spouse  Pension  and Education  Annuity,  the  Lump  Sum  Death  Benefits  and  the minimum guaranteed Lump Sum Death Benefit is capped.\n\n## Healthcare expenses\n\nThe healthcare scheme is compulsory for all the employees of L'Or\u00e9al and its French subsidiaries. Employees have the option of including their family members  in  these  schemes. Contributions are generally individual. The contribution by the employee is partly financed by the Company.\n\n## 4.3.2.6. Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nDiversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  are  part  one  of  the  Group's strategic commitments, which aims to have teams that reflect the diversity of its consumers all over the world and to provide all  its  employees  with  an  equitable  and  inclusive  working environment.  The  Group  also  adopts  an  inclusive  approach towards communities, suppliers and stakeholders. The Group's strategy in terms of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is built around four key pillars:\n\n- 1. Gender and LGBTQIA+ : achieve gender parity at all levels and  functions  of  the  company;  contribute  to  the establishment of more inclusive environments in favour of the  LGBTQIA+  community  everywhere  in  the  world;  act against  any  type  of  harassment  or  violence,  particularly sexism, sexual harassment and gender-based violence;\n- 2. Disability : accelerate the inclusion of people  with disabilities, by means of targeted actions, with a minimum target for employees with disabilities in all countries;\n- 3. Socio-economic  and  multicultural  background :  promote and increase the diversity of socio-economic and cultural origins in the Group's teams;\n- 4. Age and generations: encourage dialogue and cooperation among employees of different generations.\n\nThe  Group's  policy  on  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  is  also reflected  in  its  approach  towards  its  suppliers  (see  section 4.3.3.6.  'Measures  taken  in  favour  of  communities'  of  this document),  its  consumers,  partners,  communities  and  the NGOs  and  associations  dedicated  to  inclusion  on  each continent.\n\nTo  achieve  its  objectives,  L'Or\u00e9al  relies  particularly  on  an internal network of 'Diversity Coordinators', in all of its entities, who  are  the  guarantors  of  the  Group  Diversity,  Equity  and Inclusion policy which they adapt to their local context.\n\nThe  Group  shares  its  achievements  and  progress  in  a dedicated section on the loreal.com website.\n\nTo  measure  the  perception  of  the  Diversity,  Equity  and Inclusion of employees, 'Pulse', our annual in-house survey on employee engagement, includes questions on this issue.\n\n4",

In  its  Code  of  Ethics,  the  Group  commits  not  to  harm  the dignity of human beings or present degrading stereotypes in its advertising.  It  is  also  sensitive  to  possible  reactions  to  the Group's advertising from different religious,  ethnic,  cultural  or social groups.\n\nTo  strengthen  our  commitment  to  more  inclusive  marketing and  advertising,  in  2021  L'Or\u00e9al  joined  the  Unstereotype Alliance,  an  initiative  led  by  companies  convened  by  UN Women. The Unstereotype Alliance brings together advertisers, industry  leaders  and  designers  with  the  aim  of  eradicating harmful stereotypes in advertising.\n\n## Gender equity: professional parity and equality for women and men\n\nAchieving  real  gender  equality,  up  to  the  most  strategic positions,  is  a  key  challenge  for  L'Or\u00e9al,  which  aims  to strengthen its ability to innovate while promoting a culture of inclusion.  The  Group  therefore  ensures  that  all  jobs  are accessible  to  women  and  men,  both  at  the  level  of recruitment  and  with  regard  to  opportunities  for  career development.  Special  attention  is  given  to  pivotal  periods such  as  parenthood  (see  paragraph  'The  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  & Care programme: an accelerator of social progress' in section 4.3.2.4. of this document).\n\nThe policy on diversity  and gender balance deployed in the Group includes a goal to maintain, every year, a proportion of employees of each gender that may not be less than 40% in strategic positions (around 300 positions). General Management reports annually to the Board of Directors on this policy  and  the  results  obtained  during  the  previous  financial year.  Under  the  19 th resolution  submitted  for  approval  by  the\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al and gender balance\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, women account for:\n\n- \u00b7 69% of the total workforce;\n- \u00b7 49% of expatriates in place;\n- \u00b7 47% of strategic positions (2) ;\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  chose  to  have  its  gender  equality  practices  and policies audited and relies on two independent organisations to measure and assess the situation of its subsidiaries: Gender Equality  European  &  International  Standard  (GEEIS)  and Economic Dividend for Gender Equality (EDGE).\n\nSince  2010,  the  Group's  head  office  in  France  and  23  of  its countries  have  been  awarded  the  GEEIS  label,  and  are audited  every  two  years  by  Bureau  Veritas  to  measure  the progress  achieved.  The  countries  currently  certified  are: Austria,  Belgium,  Bulgaria,  Croatia,  Czech  Republic,  Estonia, Finland,  France,  Germany,  Hungary,  Ireland,  Italy,  Latvia, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAnnual  General  Meeting  of  21  April  2022,  the  Board  of Directors,  at  its  meeting  on  9  February  2022  and  on  the recommendation of the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee,  decided  to  introduce  criteria  for  non-financial performance in  addition  to  financial  performance  within  the long-term remuneration plans, one of which is a criterion linked to gender balance in strategic positions.\n\nSince  March  2019,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  published  its  'Index  of Professional  Gender  Equality',  which  is  calculated  using  five indicators  defined  by  the  'Professional  Future'  law.  This  2022 Group Index is at 97% for all of L'Or\u00e9al's French entities.\n\nSince  2007,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  collaborated  with  the  INED  (National Institute  for  Demographic  Studies)  to  conduct  an  annual analysis  of  the  differences  in  remuneration  between  women and men working in France. The aim is to guarantee identical pay  for  people  with  the  same  level  of  skills  and  the  same classification. The median pay gap in France decreased from 10% in 2007 to 0% in 2019 for all categories (1) (stable in 2020).\n\nIn  addition  to  the  INED  analysis  in  France,  in  2020  L'Or\u00e9al launched a global tool to measure gender pay equality 'all things  being  equal'  (net  of  structural  effects)  certified  by EDGE.\n\nThis analysis was  conducted  in  28  countries  in  2021 (representing  more  than  80%  of  the  global  workforce): Argentina,  Australia,  Brazil,  Canada,  Chile,  China,  Denmark, Finland,  France,  Germany,  Greece,  India,  Indonesia,  Ireland, Italy,  Japan,  Mexico,  Norway,  Peru,  Philippines,  Russia,  South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States.\n\nAccording to  this  analysis,  the  average  'unexplained'  salary gap in these countries is -0.76% in favour of men. L'Or\u00e9al aims to eliminate any 'unexplained' salary gaps due to gender in all countries analysed by 2025.\n\n- \u00b7 66% of employees promoted;\n- \u00b7 59% of international brand directors \u2611 ;\n- \u00b7 51% of all key positions within L'Or\u00e9al S.A. (3) ;\n- \u00b7 55% of all key positions within the Group (4) ;\n- \u00b7 32% of Executive Committee members; and\n- \u00b7 50% of members of the Board of Directors.\n\nAs  of  today,  8  other  countries  rely  on  the  EDGE  certification process. The countries are audited  by  the  third-party organisations Flocert or Intertek in order to be certified. L'Or\u00e9al USA  was  the  first  country  to  earn  the  label  in  2014.  The countries  currently  certified  are:  Australia,  Brazil,  Canada, India, Philippines, Russia, Switzerland and United States.\n\nIn  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  Brazil  was  the  first  of  the  Group's  subsidiaries  to achieve 'EDGE Lead' status, the highest level of EDGE certification.\n\nIn 2021, L'Or\u00e9al USA and L'Or\u00e9al Canada were the first of the Group's  subsidiaries  to  achieve  'EDGE  Plus'  status,  which provides  an  additional  analysis  in  terms  of  intersectional equality  (gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  age,  ethnicity, disability and nationality).",

Its  aim  is  to create  and  test  measures  to  combat  violence  against  women and to  support  the  employees  concerned,  through  specialised NGOs.\n\nConcrete actions were taken in 2021 with the 'One In Three Women' network, such as:\n\n- \u25cf an  e-learning  module  made  available  in  5  languages  to raise employee awareness;\n- \u25cf the  launch  of  4  new  podcast  episodes  dedicated  to  the impact  of  domestic  violence  in  the  workplace,  with testimonies from people who have been subject to this type of  violence,  as  part  of  the  International  Day  for  the Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  regularly  attends  international  conferences,  such  as the  Global  Summit  of  Women,  the  UN  Global  Compact  and the  Women's  Business  Council,  to  speak  about  the  action  it has taken to combat violence against women.\n\nAfter having committed to support the ILO's adoption of the first international convention against violence and harassment in  the  workplace in 2019 along with the NGO, CARE, L'Or\u00e9al established  a  HR  policy  on  domestic  violence  in  2020.  The worldwide deployment of this policy began in 2021 and there are great ambitions for 2022.\n\nWhen  it  was  launched  in  2018,  the  #StOpE  initiative  against so-called  'ordinary'  sexism  in  the  workplace,  led  by  L'Or\u00e9al France with AccorHotels and EY, brought together 30  companies  and  organisations  that  signed  a  commitment under  the  patronage  of  the  French  Minister  for  Equality between Women  and  Men  and  the  Fight Against Discrimination. Today, 114 organisations are involved with this initiative,  which  aims  to  promote  best  practices  to  combat sexism  in  the  workplace.  The  Group  began  to  roll  out  this initiative internationally in January 2021. An e-learning was also developed collaboratively by 7 companies in the network.\n\n## Contributing to the establishment of more inclusive environments in favour of the LGBTQIA+ community\n\nWith a presence on all continents, L'Or\u00e9al contributes to the establishment of more inclusive environments for the LGBTQIA+ community (2) .\n\nSince  2018,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  one  of  the  sponsors  of  the 'Standards of Conduct for Business' established by the United Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Human  Rights  in  the  fight against discrimination against LGBTQIA+ people.\n\nIn 2019, a co-parenting policy was implemented in France and the  United  States,  with  the  same  rights  established  for paternity leave, which was increased to 6 weeks paid leave in\n\nFrance  and  8  weeks  paid  leave  in  the  US.  This  policy  was integrated  into  the  new  version  of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care programme in 2021.\n\nIn 2020, L'Or\u00e9al published its Employee Human Rights Policy.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al USA again received the maximum score of 100 on the 2021 Corporate Equality Index of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, which reflects its commitment.\n\n## Promoting the inclusion of people with disabilities\n\nFor more than 20 years, L'Or\u00e9al has applied a global policy to include  people  with  disabilities  within  the  Company.  In  2021, the Group  employed  1,509  statutory employees with disabilities, i.e. 1.8% of the total workforce. L'Or\u00e9al's goal is that people  with  disabilities  will  account  for  2%  of  the  Group's statutory  employees  by  2025.  The  disability  pillar  of  L'Or\u00e9al's Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  policy  covers  the  following five priorities:\n\n- \u00b7 Recruitment:  L'Or\u00e9al  promotes  the  recruitment  of  people with disabilities in all countries;\n- \u00b7 Declaration of disability: create the conditions for employees to declare their disability, so that the company can adapt positions, jobs and support;\n- \u00b7 Digital  accessibility:  any  new  digital  platform  must  now meet this objective;\n- \u00b7 Employee awareness: the success of the Disability pillar of L'Or\u00e9al's  Diversity,  Equity  and  Inclusion  policy  is  closely linked to internal communication and training; and\n- \u00b7 Sharing best practices: collaboration with experts, associations  and  NGOs  recognised  on  the  subject  is  an important  element  in  advancing  inclusion  within  and outside the Group.\n\nAn active member of the ILO since 2010, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the  first  signatories  of  the  Global  Business  and  Disability Network Charter in 2015. L'Or\u00e9al chaired this network in 2021.\n\nIn November  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  became  a  member  of The Valuable 500 ,  a  global  business  collective  whose  objective  is to  promote  the  inclusion  of  people  with  disabilities.  L'Or\u00e9al shared its commitment on disability with this collective in 2021, and also  participates  in  discussions  to  identify  best  practices and to facilitate the acceleration of actions on this key matter.\n\n## Reinforcing multicultural and socio-economic diversity\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's goal is to reflect, at all levels and in all functions, the diversity  of  the  markets  in  which  it  operates.  Particular attention is therefore paid to the diversification of recruitment pools,  to  ensure  equal  opportunities  in  terms  of  professional development,  and  to  raise  awareness  of  employees  and management on this subject.\n\n170: Number of nationalities (in the global workforce) distributed among the 68 countries (3) .\n\n4",

Since 2019, L'Or\u00e9al has been an active member of the Tent Partnership for Refugees, a  global  network  of  more  than  200  companies  that  support refugees.  This  partnership  enables  L'Or\u00e9al  to  strengthen  the socio-economic  and  multicultural  diversity  of  its  teams,  offer job opportunities to the candidates in question and facilitate their inclusion in their host countries. In 2021, L'Or\u00e9al committed  to  taking  part in a three-year mentoring programme  for  50  female  refugees  in  France,  Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\nOn World Refugee Day 2021, L'Or\u00e9al's Chief Executive Officer signed  an  open  letter  with  other  executives  as  part  of  the Refugees Are Talents collective  and  took  part  in  professional gatherings and various international events to encourage the recruitment of refugees into our teams.\n\n## Training employees in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nIn order to support these initiatives, L'Or\u00e9al trains its employees in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion by organising Diversity Training Workshops.  This  training  is  now  available  virtually.  Since  2007, more than 75,000 employees have been trained through these workshops.\n\nSince 2010, L'Or\u00e9al has participated in the EVE programme, an initiative led by the Danone Group, aimed to help women to be agents of change in their company and to develop their leadership and careers. Since its launch, more than 650 of the Group's  employees  have  taken  part  in  this  programme.  The Group  wanted  to  go  further  by  partnering  with  Danone  to create  editions  in  Asia  in  2014  (EVE  Asia-Pacific),  and  Africa (EVE Africa) since 2017.\n\nOn  the  Group's  internal  platform  dedicated  to  training, MyLearning,  a  page  dedicated  to  Diversity,  Equity  and\n\n## 4.3.3.

This mission has been entrusted to her by L'Or\u00e9al's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, to whom she reports.\n\nThe Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer has a budget and a dedicated  team  composed  of  Human  Rights  experts.  She relies on all the Group's teams and resources to carry out her work.\n\nA  dedicated  network  of  Human  Rights  Correspondents covering all of the Group's markets allows the Group's Human Rights commitments to be rolled out.\n\nThe Human Rights Committee, chaired by the Chief Corporate Responsibility Officer and composed of representatives of the\n\nInclusion was created in 2020. More than 80 learning resources are now available.\n\nIn 2021, the Group made 9 new e-learning modules available, covering  the  following  topics:  micro-aggressions,  sexism, unconscious bias, mental health, digital accessibility, domestic violence, cyber-harassment,  workplace  inclusion  of  the LGBTQIA+ community, combating racism in the workplace, as well as quarterly e-conferences and a selection of podcasts.\n\n## Awards obtained in 2021\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  been  recognised  on  several  occasions  for  its excellence in the area of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 For  the  fifth  consecutive  year,  L'Or\u00e9al  was  recognised  by Bloomberg's  Gender-Equality  Index  2022  (GEI)  for  its commitments  to  female  leadership,  talent  management, gender equality, inclusion, and policies on sexual harassment. In 2022, the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index includes 418 international companies with their headquarters in 45 countries around the world.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  is  recognised  as  one  of  the  100  best-ranked companies in terms of diversity and inclusion in the Refinitiv Diversity  &  Inclusion  Index  2021.  This  international  index  is compiled  following  an  analysis  of  more  than  11,000  listed companies.\n- \u00b7 For the fourth consecutive year, L'Or\u00e9al was one of the top five  most  advanced  companies  in  the  world  in  terms  of gender equality, according to the Equileap Global GenderEquality Ranking 2021, which assesses nearly 4,000 companies in 23 countries. L'Or\u00e9al came fourth worldwide in this ranking, first in the consumer goods sector and first in France.\n- \u00b7 In  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  won  the  \"Parity  of  the  Top  100'  Special Award for the Feminisation of Governing Bodies, at the 8th annual Awards for the Feminisation of Governing Bodies of the SBF120 companies.\n\nvarious  activities,  functions  and  Zones  (including  Purchasing, HR,  CSR,  Safety,  Security,  etc.),  allows  coordination  and exchange  on  the  implementation  of  the  Group's  Human Rights policy. Its primary objective is to enable the emergence of a Human Rights culture within the Group.\n\nThe Group completed a generic review of the Human Rights issues  related  to  its  operational  activities  and  commercial relationships, and identified four groups of impacted stakeholders that inform the Human Rights policy:\n\n- \u00b7 the Human Rights of our employees;\n- \u00b7 the Human Rights of the employees of Group suppliers;\n- \u00b7 the Human Rights of consumers; and\n- \u00b7 the Human Rights of communities.\n\nIn order to achieve its Human Rights goals and face these risks, L'Or\u00e9al  has  been  a  member  of  the  United  Nations  Global Compact  since  2003,  and  is  committed  to  respecting  all internationally recognised Human Rights. A specific partnership was  also  signed  in  2019  with  the  Danish  Institute  for  Human Rights to support the Group in the implementation of Human Rights. This commitment to respect Human Rights is supported each  year  at  the  highest  level  of  the  Company  by  its  Chief Executive  Officer,  by  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risks  and  Compliance Officer, and by the Chief Sustainability Officer, who also chairs the Group's Human Rights Committee.",

L'Or\u00e9al's commitment to protecting personal data\n\nThe  Group  attaches  great  importance  to  the  principle  of transparency and aims to establish a relationship of trust with all its stakeholders, and in particular its consumers, employees and  suppliers. The Group  ensures  that  personal  data protection and data security are at the heart of its responsible use of personal data.\n\nIn  support  of  this  ambition,  the  Group's  principles  governing the  processing  of  personal  data  (Data  Privacy)  have  been shared  all  over  the  world  to  raise  the  awareness  of  all employees about respect for ethical principles and the legal and regulatory requirements in this area. These principles were updated  in  2020  and  are  supplemented  by  a  framework  of policies, procedures and operational guidelines.\n\nThe  Group  has  put  in  place  a  structure  based  on  a  Global Data Privacy Office (Global DPO Office) ,  which  consists  of  a Legal  unit  and  a  Programme  unit.  A  Group  Data  Privacy Officer (DPO) was appointed in 2018 and a network of country DPOs  has  been  set  up  worldwide  and  is  constantly  being strengthened (46 DPOIs in 2021).  The structure also relies on a network of Head of Data Privacy in each region and in each business area (IT, Digital, Marketing, HR, Research & Innovation,  Retail,  Operations,  etc.),  who  are  responsible  for defining  and  deploying  privacy  policies  tailored  to  the challenges and specific features of their fields.\n\nA  Global  Strategic  Data  Privacy Committee  was  set  up  to establish  strategic  guidelines  and  ensure  the  data  privacy programme is rolled out within the Group. Led by the Group DPO,  this  Committee  is  composed  specifically  of  the  Chief Financial  Officer,  the  Chief  Ethics,  Risk  and  Compliance Officer, the Group General Counsel and the Chief Information Officer. For the sake of consistency and operational efficiency, a  Data  Privacy  Steering  Committee  is  in  place  for  each region.\n\nThis governance  notably  aims  to  monitor  the  Group's compliance with different laws, such as the GDPR in Europe, the CCPA in California, the LGPD in Brazil, the PIPL in China or the POPI Act in South Africa, by ensuring the involvement of all stakeholders and by adapting customer, supplier and business line  processes  to  the  Group's  rules  and  to  applicable  local laws.\n\nIn  order  to  comply  with  European  rules,  the  Group  has established a record of data processing performed in Europe. This  tool  is  also  offered  in  countries  not  subject  to  the  GDPR that wish to use it in order to map their processing operations.\n\nIn support of the 'privacy by design' principle, the Group has also  developed  and  deployed  a  digitalised  tool  that  is available  to  operational  staff,  to  help  them  to  ensure  that  a project complies with operational principles and rules relating to  data  privacy  from  the  very  start  and  to  carry  out  the required privacy impact assessments.\n\nAll employees within the Group have access to an awarenessraising  programme  on  the  protection  of  personal  data. Specific training is also available for the main business lines. An Intranet site dedicated to this subject can be accessed at any time by all employees worldwide.\n\nThe  Group  Internal  Control  is  in  charge  of  organising  a  selfassessment  of  the  implementation  of  the  data  privacy compliance  programme  for  all  countries  and  business  lines. This  evaluation  is  performed  annually.  As  part  of  the  Group's digital  activities,  the  Internal  Audit  Department  conducts dedicated  audit  checks  on  the  protection  of  the  personal data  of  consumers.  This  control  has  been  supplemented  by the  creation  and  deployment  in  2019  of  a  specific  audit programme on the protection of personal data, aimed at all European  countries  that  are  subject  to  GDPR  and  this programme is conducted by an independent auditor.\n\n## 4.3.3.3. Measures taken in favour of consumers\n\n| Brand programmes           | Conscious of the influencing ability of its brands, L'Or\u00e9al encourages them to inform and mobilise their business partners, customers and consumers around the major environmental and societal challenges facing  the  world.  Each  brand  must  therefore  identify  an  environmental  or  societal  cause  of  its  own, support  a  community  partner  involved  in  the  field,  and  conduct  awareness-raising  and  outreach campaigns  with  its  consumers  in  order  to  contribute  to  change.

Measures taken in favour of L'Or\u00e9al employees\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  has  also  implemented  several  other  policies  that contribute  to  the  respect  of  employees'  Human  Rights  and Fundamental  Freedoms,  notably  through  its  policies  on workplace  health  and  safety,  social  dialogue  and  diversity, and  its  Share  &  Care  programme  (see  section  4.3.2.4. 'Creating  conditions  for  a  stimulating  and  attractive  work environment' of this document).\n\nThe  Group  ensures  that  all  employees  receive  at  least  the minimum  salary  set  by  local  law  or  the  applicable  collective agreements, and that they receive a living wage (1) that  covers their basic needs, calculated in line with best practices.\n\nLastly, L'Or\u00e9al's subsidiaries must comply with applicable local legislation  and  the  minimum  set  of  core  rules  designed  to prevent  serious  Human  Rights  violations.  The  details  and implementation  of  these  rules  is  described  in  L'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance  Plan  (see  section  3.4.  'Vigilance  Plan'  of  this document) which also explains the Group's organisation in the area of Human Rights.\n\n## 4.3.3.5. Measures taken in favour of employees of the Group's suppliers in the context of their working conditions\n\nL'Or\u00e9al's  commitments  are  communicated  to  all  suppliers  via the general terms of purchase. Moreover, suppliers identified in the  Group's  risk  mapping  must  sign  the  Letter  of  Ethical Commitment;  some  may  also  be  audited.  The  details  and implementation of this Buy & Care programme are described in L'Or\u00e9al's Vigilance Plan in section 3.4. 'Vigilance Plan' and 4.3.1.2.1. 'Due diligence: selection and assessment of strategic suppliers' of this document.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al wants to carry this goal beyond the Group. This is why the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  includes  a  new demanding  commitment:  ensuring  that  all  employees  of strategic  suppliers  are  paid  at  least  the  level  of  a  'living' wage. Calculated by region and aligned with the best local practices,  these  new  standards  must  allow  employees  to cover  their  basic  needs  and  those  of  their  family  for  decent housing,  food,  education  and  any  other  needs.  In  many countries, this 'living' wage goes beyond the legal minimums.\n\n## 4.3.3.6. Measures taken in favour of communities\n\nAs part of the Sharing Beauty With All programme, the Group's action  has  enabled  more  than  100,000  people  from  socially disadvantaged or poor communities to access employment.\n\nAs  part  of  its  new  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  sustainability programme,  the  Group  reiterated  its  commitment  to  help 100,000 more beneficiaries by 2030.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al seeks out suppliers that share its ethical commitments, namely with regard to Human Rights and working conditions of their employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2030 targets                                                                                                                             | 2021 results                                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| An additional 100,000 people from underprivileged or poor communities will be able to access employment through the following programme: | 13,946 people from underprivileged or poor communities have access to work.                             |\n| \u25cf Solidarity Sourcing;                                                                                                                   | 89,093 people accessed work through the Solidarity Sourcing  programme, 7,955 more people than in 2020. |\n| \u25cf Professionalisation in the beauty industry;                                                                                            | 5,991 people from extremely vulnerable environments were trained  in beauty professions.                |\n\n4",

In this area, L'Or\u00e9al has a long-standing commitment to  managing risks and reducing its environmental footprint, and is implementing an ambitious policy described in detail in section\u00a04.3.1. 'Environmental policy' of this document.\n\nA responsible approach to property assets\n\nFor prospective acquisitions of premises or building land, L'Or\u00e9al must ensure that the former owners and/or occupiers have not been unfairly removed and/or that any expropriation by the authorities was conducted in accordance with international law, namely with the free agreement and compensation of the previous owners and/or occupants.\n\nResponsible sourcing\n\nSee  'Giving  preference  to  the  use  of  sustainably  sourced  renewable  raw  materials'  in section\u00a04.3.1.3.1.\u00a0'Eco-designed products' of this document.\n\nSolidarity Sourcing: Using the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion\n\nThrough  its  Solidarity  Sourcing  programme,  established  in  2010,  due  to  its  many  industrial  and administrative sites all over the world, L'Or\u00e9al is heavily involved in the life of local communities in the areas neighbouring its sites and suppliers. While being a company committed to demonstrating strong corporate citizenship, L'Or\u00e9al makes a contribution to many local projects.\n\nThe programme aims to use the Group's purchasing power to serve social inclusion by dedicating part of  its  purchases  to  suppliers  providing  access  to  work  and  a  sustainable  income for people who are generally  excluded  from  the  labour  market,  economically  vulnerable  communities,  including  small businesses and those that have trouble accessing major contractors.\n\nThe programme concerns all the Group's suppliers and values their commitment to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.  The  Solidarity  Sourcing  programme concerns for example: fair trade producers, companies which employ people with disabilities,  social  insertion  enterprises,  or  companies  owned  by  minorities (when this is permitted by national legislation).\n\nAs part of L'Or\u00e9al for the Future, its new sustainability programme announced in June 2020, the Group is renewing its goal to allow over 100,000 people from underprivileged or poor communities to find work by 2030.\n\nSolidarity Sourcing offers a novel purchasing approach due to its global, holistic nature:\n\n- \u25cf the programme is deployed in all geographic zones;\n- \u25cf it concerns all areas of purchases (raw materials, packaging, subcontracting, logistics, promotional items and indirect retail, services, etc.); and\n\nThe ambition of the programme is to associate economic performance with a positive corporate social responsibility footprint.\n\nGlobal beneficiaries of the Programme included 2,499 people with a disability in 28 countries in 2021. The number of beneficiaries rose by 20% over the last three years. This was achieved as the result of a stronger  commitment  from  the  Group,  despite  the  unprecedented  Covid-19  health  crisis,  which particularly impacted this community.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, as part of the Solidarity Sourcing programme, 89,093 economically and socially vulnerable people gained access to lasting employment, i.e. an additional 7,955 people.\n\nThroughout 2021, the Solidarity  Sourcing  programme enabled 89,093 people from underprivileged or poor communities all over the world to gain access to work or to keep a job and receive a decent income. This represents an additional 7,955 people compared to 2020, an increase of 9.8%.\n\nSolidarity Sourcing today has 365 projects up and running in 709 local initiatives (with an additional 211 initiatives launched in 2021) in 61 countries, with the support of 70 third parties.\n\nThis  programme  has  offered  the  opportunity  for  the  Group's  purchasers  to  enrich  their  jobs  by contributing to improving the lives of thousands of people involved in the processing of the goods and services purchased. As a result, in 2021, 176 buyers supported Solidarity Sourcing project, an increase of 7% compared to 2020.\n\n## Focus on the Group's solidarity purchases in France\n\n77 projects of the global Solidarity Sourcing programme support employment in France (1 in 5 projects), deployed in 122 local initiatives. France, the birthplace of the Group, is the country that undertakes the highest  number  of  Solidarity  Sourcing  projects  (out  of  the  61  countries  in  which  the  programme operates) and the seventh country in number of beneficiaries behind Burkina Faso, Indonesia, India, Madagascar, the United States and China.\n\nIn 2021, solidarity purchases in France represented 2,737 full-time jobs. The number of jobs generated by the Solidarity Sourcing programme in France was up 9% compared with 2020 (representing 228 jobs), thanks in large part to the mobilisation of Group purchasing managers and 130 suppliers including 68 Adapted Enterprises (Entreprises Adapt\u00e9es - EA) and work assistance organisations (Etablissements et Services d'Aide par le Travail - ESAT).",

They  include Professors  Elizabeth  H.  Blackburn,  Ada  Yonath,  Emmanuelle  Charpentier  and  Jennifer  Doudna,  who received a Nobel Prize after winning the International Prize. Each year, the programme also recognises more than 250 young talented scientists at doctoral or post-doctoral level in over 110 countries, 15 of whom will be selected to represent the future of science on an international level.                                        |\n|                                                              | A total of more than 3,900 female researchers have been supported worldwide in the last 23 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                                                              | To  support  these  scientific  women  even  further,  and  to  allow  them  to  break  the  glass  ceiling  more easily,  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Foundation  has  also  made  a  commitment  to  train  them  in  skills  to  which  they generally  do  not  have  access  during  their  academic  courses  (such  as  personnel  development, management, communication, negotiation).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|                                                              | For three years, the Foundation has also led an ambitious initiative: 'Men for Women in Science'.

Over  fifty  male scientific leaders around the world have made a commitment through a charter to remove the brakes on  the  advancement  of  women  in  the  sciences  and  accelerate  the  change  in  the  culture  and practices.                                                                                                                            |\n|                                                              | Since the under-representation of women in the scientific fields originates during the school years, the Foundation launched the 'For Girls in Science' programme in 2014. The goal: to improve the appeal of science, encourage scientific careers for young female students, and fight gender stereotypes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |",

The fund also supports projects for the education of vulnerable girls, in particular Aide et Action's Education for Women Now programme in Senegal, Madagascar, India, and Laos.\n\nAs regards the fight against violence, the fund supports the Re#Start collective, which works to expand the Maisons des Femmes initiative. Maisons des Femmes are holistic centres that provide emergency services and work to empower women who have been victims of violence.\n\nLastly,  to  play  its  part  in  the  social  and  professional  integration  of  women  and  girls  from  refugee communities, the fund supports Techfugees, which provides digital technology training in France, Italy and Greece.\n\nSince it was launched, the L'Or\u00e9al Fund for Women has supported more than 120 organisations around the world, which support more than 400,000 direct beneficiaries.\n\nAlongside  the  NGO  Care,  Lanc\u00f4me  is  taking  part  in  Write  her  Future,  an  international  programme aimed at fighting illiteracy among girls. In 2021, the program had more than 44,000 beneficiaries (see section 4.3.3. of this document).\n\nOver 60% of the beneficiaries of the Group's solidarity purchase programme (see section 4.3.3.6. of this document) are women. A total of 48,061 beneficiaries come from 66 projects - encompassing 134 local initiatives - specifically related to the emancipation of women in 30 countries, with the support of 17 associations and NGO partners. These Solidarity Sourcing projects support the following women:\n\n- \u25cf producers of raw materials such as shea, Indian pennywort, argan, babacu or galanga grown and harvested in accordance with fair trade principles;\n- \u25cf hailing from various vulnerable local communities, or who have assumed positions usually reserved for men;\n- \u25cf beneficiaries through support for Women-Owned Businesses (suppliers owned, controlled and led by 51% or more women); In 2021, the Group continued to accelerate its strategy to support female entrepreneurship, reconfirming its involvement in WEConnect International (1) and multiplying by 3.8 the number of suppliers led by women supported in 16 countries. This strategy, initiated many years ago  in  the  United  States  through  the  partnership  with  The  Women's  Business  Enterprise  National Council (WBENC), is being deployed and accelerated worldwide;\n- \u25cf single mothers;\n- \u25cf military wives; and\n- \u25cf victims of violence.\n\nOther than agricultural professions, these projects concern a broad range of manufacturing activities and services: production, assembly, logistics, sales, marketing, or digital business activities.\n\n4",

It  moreover  reserves  the  right  to  put  an\n\n## 4.3.5. Tax policy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al considers that the contribution of taxation is an integral part of its social, environmental and societal responsibility and constitute a way to participate positively to the development of the countries in which the Group operates.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  Group's  tax  policy  forms  part  of  the  sustainable development  of  its  business  and  is  based  on  three  pillars: Compliance, Transparency and Legitimacy, as defined in the Internal  Tax  Charter  prepared  and  distributed  around  the world.\n\n## Compliance\n\nL'Or\u00e9al completes its tax declarations and pays its taxes by the deadlines in compliance with the laws and regulations in the\n\nend  to  any  relationships  with  business  partners  who  fail  to comply with anti-corruption laws.\n\n## A recognised approach\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  was  recognised  for  the  twelfth  time  as  one  of  the 'World's Most Ethical Companies' by the Ethisphere Institute.\n\ncountries  in  which  the  Group  operates.  Special  vigilance  is required  on  compliance  with  the  rules  related  to  the  fight against tax fraud and tax evasion.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  located  in  countries  where  it  conducts  a  real operational  and  commercial  activity.  If  applicable,  the Group's presence in certain so-called 'tax haven' countries is justified  for  operational  reasons  and  the  development  of  its activity, and not for tax purposes.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al ensures that transactions between Group companies are  carried  out  in  compliance  with  arm's  length  principle  as defined  by  the  OECD  and  satisfies  increasingly  digitalized reporting obligations (transfer pricing documentation, countryby-country reporting, etc.).\n\nL'Or\u00e9al aims for excellence in tax compliance.\n\n4",

L'Or\u00e9al  also develops  a  constructive  relationship  with  Tax  and  Customs Authorities,  a  relationship  based  on  the  principles  of  cooperation and mutual respect. L'Or\u00e9al responds appropriately and promptly to requests from the tax authorities regarding the exchange  of  information  and  in  compliance  with  tax conventions.\n\nWhere permitted  to  do  so  by  governments,  L'Or\u00e9al  joins  the cooperative  compliance  programmes  launched  by  the  tax authorities.  For  example,  the  trust  relationship  (\"relation  de confiance\") with the French tax authorities.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Group  may  contribute  to  the  analysis  of legislative  changes  at  the  request  of  Tax  and  Customs Authorities  or  professional  associations  requested  for  said changes.  Consequently,  the  Group  takes  part  in  OECD working groups relating to pillars 1 and 2.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  takes  into  consideration  global  challenges  and standards  in  terms  of  tax  transparency.  In  particular,  it adheres  to  the  reporting  recommendations  of  the  GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) and, more specifically, standards GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2 and GRI 207-3.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al is also a member of the European Business Tax Forum (EBTF),  a  European  companies  association  that  seeks  to increase transparency in the tax debate.\n\n## Legitimacy\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  legitimately  applies  the  most  relevant  tax  treatment, in accordance  with  the  economic  reality,  operational objectives and the laws in force.\n\nIn  an  evolving  international  tax  environment,  the  positions taken  by  the  Group  may  be  questioned  and  subject  to  tax and customs audits by local authorities. If there is disagreement with a Tax or Customs Authority, L'Or\u00e9al is able to  legitimately  defend  its  interpretation  of  the  law,  prove  its good faith and, as needed, bring the disputes to court.\n\nA  regular  review  of  tax  risks  carried  out  by  the  Group's  Tax Department in contact with the local financial teams enables the  risks  to  be  assessed,  resulting,  if  applicable,  to  the recognition  of  a  provision.  The  main  tax  risks  are  reported  to the General Management and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Organisation\n\nCompliance with these three pillars is  ensured  by  centralised expertise and a strong geographical presence of tax function in the countries.\n\nTax  compliance  falls  under  the  responsibility  of  the  Chief Financial  Officers,  backed  up  and  relayed  by  the  Tax  and Accounting Departments. These Departments, assisted where applicable  by  external  advisors,  monitor  changes  in  tax regulations  to  ensure  that  the  Group  complies  with  these regulations.\n\n## Centralised expertise\n\nWithin the Department of Operational Finance, the Group Tax Department  ensures  compliance  with  the  Tax  Policy  in collaboration with the Finance Departments through the relay of different group-wide tax experts:\n\n- \u25cf Intra-group Transactions & Customs, which ensures compliance  with  tax  and  customs  standards  and  secures the  prices  of  intra-group  transactions  and  the  related documentation;\n- \u25cf Analytics  &  Compliance,  which  analyses,  verifies  and informs on the Group's compliance and global tax liability;\n- \u25cf M&A, which  assists  and  provides  tax  advice  on  proposed merger-acquisition projects.\n\nIn  order  to  enhance  these  centres  of  expertise,  two  new functions were created in 2021:\n\n- \u25cf Tax  Digitalisation  which  will  support  digital  tax  compliance projects in accordance with tax regulations in this area; and\n- \u25cf Tax Governance, in order to ensure the correct deployment of the Group's tax policy.\n\n## A strong geographical presence\n\nIn the  zones  and  countries,  the  tax  function  is  directly represented in 30 countries by local tax departments operating under  the  accountability  of  the  Country/Zone  Chief  Financial Officer. The Tax Directors have different responsibilities:\n\n- \u25cf respect  for  compliance  rules  in  collaboration  with  the accounting departments;\n- \u25cf assistance and tax advice to the operational teams in the context of their projects;\n- \u25cf tax  directives,  ongoing  training  and  pedagogy  with  other parties;\n- \u25cf management of the tax contribution;\n- \u25cf management of tax and customs risks, controls, claims and litigations;\n- \u25cf relations with the Tax and Customs Authorities and the other public authorities; and\n- \u25cf tax watch and best practices, which implies dialogue with peers,  professional  associations,  external  auditors  and  law firms.\n\nThis matrix organisation, combined with the Group's tax policy respect,  are  the  basis  of  successful  management  of  the  tax burden and a responsible tax practice.",

Scope of consolidation\n\nThe employees indicated and their breakdown correspond to the total headcount (1) .\n\nEmployees  in  the  Retail  Excellence  4,  Thermes  de  La  Roche Posay, Saint Gervais Mont Blanc, Ecole OA and Mugler Fashion entities,  a  total  of  444  employees,  are  included  in  the  total workforce.  The  different  distributions  of  these  employees  are calculated  in  proportion  to  the  distribution of France employees. They are excluded from the indicators on diversity, training,  minimum  salaries  and  the  number  of  collective agreements.\n\n## 4.5.1.1.2. Indicators\n\nThe indicators chosen are those used in the management of employees and of the social aspects of  the  Company.  They reflect the results of the Human Resources policy.\n\n## 4.5.1.1.3. Data\n\nFour methods are used to collect data for the defined scope:\n\n- \u00b7 most  of  the  data  are  collected  using  the  dedicated 'Country  Reporting'  Intranet,  available  in  all  countries  in which  there  is  a  L'Or\u00e9al  subsidiary.  The  system  covers several  topics:  employees,  training,  absenteeism,  labour relations, the L'Or\u00e9al Share & Care programme, remuneration, diversity, recruitment, freedom of association and profit sharing. At the beginning of each financial year, the  local  Human  Resources  Directors  provide  the  required data for the previous year;\n- \u00b7 other data are collected by each department concerned (i.e.  Training,  Recruitment)  using  dedicated  systems  which follow the same operational and dissemination approach;\n- \u00b7 if information is not consolidated for the entire scope of the Cosmetics  Division,  it  can  be  extrapolated  from  the available  results  for  the  entities  connected  to  the  local Information Systems (IS), provided that the scope covered by such entities is representative; and\n- \u00b7 lastly, the data relating to specific populations (expatriates, key positions, etc.) are gathered from the 'CAROL' online career monitoring system, deployed in all subsidiaries of the Cosmetics Division.\n\nThe number of employees trained is calculated on the basis of all  types  of  training  format  and  length.  Trained  employees include the total number of employees (including those who left the Group during the year) who took at least one training course  during  the  year,  including  regular  users  of  the MyLearning platform.\n\nFor absenteeism because of illness, the scope and methodology  of  the  indicator  have  not  changed  over  the past  three  years.  The  2019  and  2020  values  for  illness absenteeism were corrected (2.2% instead of 2.0%), as a result of a material error that was made in 2019 and 2020.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been put in place. They are reviewed each year, taking into account  the  Statutory  Auditors'  recommendations  and  the monitoring  objectives  for  subsequent  years:  updating  the indicators to be monitored, improving their definition and their communication, monitoring and control process.\n\n## 4.5.1.2. Health and safety data\n\n## 4.5.1.2.1. Scope of consolidation\n\nThe  safety  indicators  relate  to  all  sites:  factories,  distribution centres,  administrative  sites,  research  centres  and  stores, as well as sales forces.\n\nSafety reporting covers 100% of the plants, distribution centres, administrative sites, research centres, sales forces and stores.\n\nAt  year-end  2021,  173  administrative  sites  and  research centres, sales forces and stores participated in the reporting.\n\nTo  achieve  better  monitoring  of  accident  history  by  type  of site, safety reporting from administrative sites has been refined in recent years by being  split into three categories: administrative  sites  with  only  one  strictly  administrative  staff; sales  forces  for  travelling  staff;  stores  for  in-store  beauty consultants managed by L'Or\u00e9al.\n\nThe  safety  indicators  of  the  factories,  distribution  centres, administrative sites or research centres sold or closed during the financial  year  are  reported  in  full  up  to  the  date  they  exit  the scope. The factories, distribution centres, administrative sites or research centres that join the Group have a maximum period of two years to integrate the environmental and safety reporting systems.\n\n## 4.5.1.2.2. Indicators\n\nThe indicators applied are those used in the management of the  Group's  sites.  They  reflect  the  results  of  the  Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy.\n\nHours worked report the time during which the staff is exposed to  professional  risks,  including  remote  work  or  the  equivalent. They  include  overtime  hours.  However,  they  do  not  include holidays and days of absence (illness, paid holidays).\n\nConcerning  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Share  &  Care  indicator  relating  to healthcare coverage, the best practices in the countries are regularly  evaluated  in  each  country  in  which  the  Group  is present.",

Data\n\nThe following method is used to collect data for the defined scope:\n\nThe health and safety data are collected using the dedicated site reporting Intranet system, available in all countries in which there  is  a  L'Or\u00e9al  subsidiary.  The  required  data  are  reported every month by the local managers.\n\nWhen the data are compiled, each site or zone must validate the accuracy of all the data provided.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been put in place. The systems are reviewed each year, taking into  account  the  Statutory  Auditors'  recommendations  and monitoring  objectives  for  subsequent  years:  updating  the indicators  to  be  monitored,  improving  their  definition,  and enhancing  the  communication,  monitoring  and  control process.\n\nIn rare cases,  certain  data  already  published  for  the preceding year may be modified when inaccuracies or errors are discovered after the end of the financial year. These data are monitored and included in the annual consistency review. They are included in the reported figures each year.\n\n## 4.5.1.3. Environmental data\n\n## 4.5.1.3.1. Scope of consolidation\n\nThe environmental indicators cover all sites: factories,\n\ndistribution centres, administrative sites and research centres.\n\nEnvironmental reporting covers 100% of the plants, distribution centres,  administrative  sites  and  research  centres  with  more than 50 people for these last two types of site.\n\nThe  environmental  indicators  of  the  factories,  distribution centres,  administrative  sites  or  research  centres  sold  or  closed during the financial year are reported in full up to the date they exit the scope. The factories, distribution centres, administrative sites  or  research centres that join the Group have a maximum period of two years to integrate the environmental and safety reporting systems.\n\nThe  indicators  do  not  take  into  account  the  impacts  of exceptional incidents or events caused externally (construction, extension work, etc.) not linked to the site's activity in terms of water and energy consumption and waste production. Similarly, in the special case  where  a  subcontractor  is  located geographically  on  the  sites,  its  impacts  are  not  taken  into account.\n\nIn  order  to  cover  all  of  the  Group's  impacts,  environmental reporting was extended to the Group's administrative sites and research  centres  in  2016.  In  2021,  87  administrative  sites  and research centres participated in the reporting. Some sites that share  their  premises  with  other  companies  are  unable  to obtain  certain  information:  100%  of  these  sites  provided information on energy consumption and CO2 emissions, 99% of the  sites  reported  their  water  consumption  and  92%  of  the sites reported their quantity of waste.\n\nThe  sites  of  Vichy  and  La  Roche  Posay  are  part  of  a  unique legal  entity  (CAP)  but  are  accounted  for  as  two  Group factories.\n\nFour  Group  factories  contain  a  logistics  centre  in  their  building: these four logistics  centres  are  not  included  in  the  count  of  the total number of Group logistics centres.\n\n## 4.5.1.3.2. Indicators\n\nThe indicators chosen are those used in the management of the Company's  sites.  They  reflect  the  results  of  the  Group's Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) policy.\n\nActivity : the activity of L'Or\u00e9al sites is measured on the basis of finished  goods  for  industrial  sites  and  hours  worked  for administrative sites and research centres.\n\nThe  production  units  included  are  the  equivalent  units produced on-site or affected by occasional subcontracting.\n\nHours worked are the hours performed on-site, thus excluding remote working hours.\n\nGreenhouse gases : The Group's CO2 emissions are calculated in  accordance  with  the  concepts  defined  by  the  GHG protocol, and monitored according to the Market-Based CO2 indicator.\n\nWith  the  desire  for  comparability,  the  data  on  CO2  emissions for the 2005 baseline provided have been updated in light of these  rules  (recalculated  on  the  basis  of  a  constant  scope). The  calculation  of  the  2005  baseline  is  based  on  the  2003 emission  factors  of  local  electricity  suppliers  -  when  they  are available.  When  the  emission  factors  are  not  available,  IEA (International  Energy  Agency)  and  eGRID (1) emission  factors , available  in  2006,  corresponding  to  IEA  factors  for  2003  and EPA (2) (eGRID) factors for 2000, are used. For the estimates for the following years, the emission factor used follows the GHG Protocol rules: in general, the factor provided by the supplier, which  is  the  most  accurate;  if  it  is  not  known,  the  regional emission  factor  is  used  or  failing  this,  the  IEA  emissions  factor (the 2018 IEA edition with the 2016 emission factor for emissions since 2019).\n\nRemarks  concerning  the  level  of  uncertainty  depending  on the Scopes in question:\n\nScopes 1 and 2: The level of uncertainty at the Group level is approximately 1% for  plants  and  distribution  centres,  and  5% for administrative sites and research centres.\n\nScope 3: The highest level of uncertainty in a GHG assessment concerns the Scope 3 estimate given the number and nature of  the  data  necessary  for  calculating  it  (emission  factors  for the  energy  used  to  heat  the  water  necessary  for  the  usage phase of our rinse-off products all over the world, the quantity of  water  necessary  for  rinsing,  CO2  emissions  of  our  raw materials  and  packaging  suppliers,  distances  travelled  for transportation, etc.).\n\nBecause  measurement  of  the  global  CO2  impact  of  the Group's business activities is essential information in light of the commitments made to fight climate change, efforts are made year  after  year  to  increase  the  reliability  of  these  data.  The level  of  uncertainty  of  the  Group's  Scope  3  emissions  is estimated to be between 20% and 30%.\n\nThis  suggests  that,  unlike  Scopes  1  and  2,  the  changes  in Scope 3 emissions from one year to the next may relate more to  the  quality  of  the  data  collected  and  the  methods  of calculation  used  than  to  a  real  measurement  of  change  in performance.  This  margin  of  uncertainty  with  regard  to Scope 3 is a reality  for  all  companies,  and  does  not  make  it possible  to  consider  this  data  as  an  adequate  benchmark or method of performance assessment.\n\n4",

The Vichy and La Roche Posay sites are part of a unique legal entity (CAP) but are  recognised  as  two  Group  factories,  including  in  the recognition of sites that have achieved carbon neutrality.\n\nIn 2021, an R134a leak of 171 kg, corresponding to 222 tonnes of CO2  equivalent,  occurred  at  the  North  Little  Rock distribution centre following the installation of new equipment. Investigations  were  carried  out  with  the  supplier  of  this equipment, which accepted responsibility  for  non-conformity of  the  delivered  equipment,  which  was  defective  by  design. The  supplier  replaced  this  equipment  and  no  further  leaks were recorded at this site in 2021. L'Or\u00e9al decided to consider this case as an exception to the rule of carbon neutrality and to  maintain  this  status  in  2021  for  the  North  Little  Rock distribution centre.\n\nWastewater : For industrial sites, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)  covers  the  volumes  of  wastewater  leaving  the  site, whether or not they have been treated on the site.\n\nWaterloop: see  the  Waterloop  Factory  concept  in  section 4.3.1.1.4 'Preserving the water resource on operated sites' of this document. Exceptions to the definition of Waterloop status may be  authorised  if  they  are  approved  by  the  Operations Department:  these exceptions are related to regulatory constraints (e.g. requirements of the Food and Drug Administration) or Group quality requirements.\n\nBiodiversity :  biodiversity  inventories  that  describe  the  actual situation of the sites in terms of species and habitats present in the  zone  studied  must  be  carried  out  by  a  certified organisation  at  least  every  three  years  with  specific  interim follow-ups.\n\nWaste :  L'Or\u00e9al  includes  everything  in  its  transportable  waste that comes out of a factory or a distribution centre and which is not  a  finished  or  semi-finished  product  (the  following examples are included for a factory: raw material packaging or  filling  and  packing  components,  sludge  from  wastewater treatment plants, broken pallets, etc.).\n\nIn order  to  improve  the  system  of  waste  performance monitoring  and  exhaustively  record  the  waste  generated  by the  use  of  returnable  packaging,  a  system  of  recording returnable  packaging  at  source  was  put  in  place  in  2014. L'Or\u00e9al thus records the weight of its returnable packaging at source  in  transportable  waste,  with  each  of  the  sites  being responsible  for  maximising  the  number  of  rotations.  The recording of the weight of returnable packaging at source is a measure  intended  to  encourage  rotation  of  this  returnable packaging and contributes, through its reuse, to increasing its useful life.\n\nSites that no longer send any waste for destruction or to landfill are considered to have attained a 100% recovery rate.\n\nThe  material  recovery  index  corresponds  to  the  quantity  of waste,  reused  or  recycled,  divided  by  the  total  amount  of waste generated, excluding returnable packaging at source, including  the  returnable  packaging  in  rotation,  excluding waste sent to landfill due to regulatory obligations.\n\nThe  recovery  index  corresponds  to  the  quantity  of  waste recovered,  whether  material  or  energy,  divided  by  the  total amount of waste generated excluding returnable packaging\n\nat source, including returnable packaging  in  rotation, excluding waste sent to landfill due to regulatory obligations.\n\nTo obtain a more accurate understanding of the recovery and material  recovery  indices,  these  indicators  are  calculated excluding the transport pallets that would otherwise represent a significant share of the returnable packaging in rotation.\n\nSince  2021,  waste  generation  no  longer  includes  the  sludge from the wastewater treatment plans at the Group's sites.\n\nEnergy : the energy produced by the heat pumps that comes from  geothermy  is  no  longer  counted  in  the  Group's  total energy consumption; the energy necessary for the operation of this equipment is, however, included in the Group's energy consumption.\n\n## 4.5.1.3.3. Data\n\nThe collection of data for the defined scope uses the following method:  environmental  data  are  collected  using the dedicated Intranet-based site reporting system, available in all countries  where  L'Or\u00e9al  has  a  subsidiary.  The  required  data are reported every month by the local managers.\n\nWhen the data are compiled, each site or zone must validate the accuracy of all the data provided.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been  put  in  place.  They  are  reviewed  each  year  by  the Statutory  Auditors  and  modified  taking  into  account  their recommendations  and  monitoring  objectives  for  subsequent years: updating the indicators to be monitored, improving their definition  and  the  communication,  monitoring  and  control process.\n\nIn rare cases,  certain  data  already  published  for  the preceding year may be modified when inaccuracies or errors are discovered after the end of the financial year. These data are monitored and included in the annual consistency review. They are included in the reported figures each year.\n\n## 4.5.2. L'Or\u00e9al for the Future data\n\n## 4.5.2.1. Transforming the Group's activities\n\n## Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport of finished products\n\nThe  scope  considered  includes  the  transport  of  the  Group's finished and promotional products from its production sites to the  first  point  of  delivery  to  its  customers.  Deliveries  made directly to its consumers are excluded.\n\nThe period considered is 12 months, between 1 November of year  n-1  and  31  October  of  year  n.  The  calculation methodology  employed  uses  greenhouse  gas  emissions factors  (in  grams  of  CO2  equivalent  per  ton  of  merchandise transported  and  per  km  travelled),  which  depend  on  the mode of transport and the type of energy used.\n\nThese  were  updated  in  2021  by  the  Quantis  company considering best practice with regard to current technological knowledge.",

        "page_content": "## Respecting biodiversity - Traceable biobased ingredients from a sustainable source\n\nThe calculation of the percentage of biobased ingredients for traced  formulas  from  a  sustainable  source  is  based  on  the following definitions:\n\n- \u25cf a  raw  material  is  considered  to  be  biobased  when  more than  50%  of  the  carbons  it  contains  are  of  plant  origin (according to ISO 16 128);\n- \u25cf an ingredient is considered traced when the following three pieces of information are available: the botanical species, the country in which it grows or is collected, the growing or collection method;\n- \u25cf an ingredient is considered to be sustainably sourced when, on  the  basis  of  the  elements  of  traceability,  it  has  been analysed for environmental and social risk (SCAN Index);\n- \u00b7 either no risk has been identified and the raw material is considered to be sustainably sourced,\n- \u00b7 or risks have been identified and an adapted action plan must have been put in place with this supplier. This action plan  must  have  been  verified  by  an  independent  third party  (e.g.,  audit,  certification,  land  project  established with the support of an NGO) that verifies compliance with the basic and progressive criteria of sustainable sourcing of the Group's raw materials.\n\nThis  indicator  is  calculated  on  the  basis  of  actual  purchases between January and November 2021.\n\n## Reduction of the water consumption related to the use of the products\n\nScope of consolidation refers to the data on the products sold over  a  period  of  12  months  from  1 January to  31  December of 2021.\n\nThe calculation of this indicator is based on the evaluation of the  volume  of  water  necessary-in  other  words,  the  value calculated  on  the  basis  of  an  average  water  volume necessary per usage dose-for the use of the Group's products by  consumers.  These  data  are  provided  by  the  IDG management software, which is the source of the data used for the economic results and which contains all the figures for worldwide sales of finished products, both rinse-off and leavein. The only exception is samples, which are not products sold and are therefore not taken into account.\n\n## Eco-designed products - SPOT\n\nEco-designed  products  are  new  or  renovated  products  that have  an  improved  environmental  or  social  profile.  The indicator  covers  the  Group's  scope  and  concerns  new  or renovated  products  by  production  centres  that  were manufactured by the Group's factories or subcontractors and that  had  an  availability  date  at  the  distribution  centre scheduled  for  between  1  January  2021  and  31  December 2021. The analysis concerns all international brands that were in the Group before 2013. The following are excluded from the scope: all products that were designed or renovated but not yet  produced,  full-buy  products  (i.e.  products  not  packaged at L'Or\u00e9al but purchased as FP from a supplier), products not for  sale  (i.e.  samples,  testers  and  one  shots),  promo  products and any brand acquisition made after 2013 that had not yet fully integrated the product design ecosystem (e.g.\n\nLOGOCOS,  THAYERS,  TAKAMI,  etc.)  or  new  creation.  The indicator covers products with formulas/packaging that have been  developed  and  produced  for  the  first  time,  products with  formulas/packaging  that  were  renovated  in  2021  or products  that  have  been  improved  in  terms  of  the  social component.\n\n## Ingredients in formulas are from biobased sources, derived from abundant materials or from circular processes\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe scope of consolidation corresponds to the twelve months of  2021.  The  scope  corresponds  to  the  cosmetic  products manufactured  in  the  L'Or\u00e9al  factories  and  the  purchases  of finished  products  from  subcontractors.  The  scope  of  the L'Or\u00e9al factories covers only the factories operating under the SAP  WISE  system,  which  permits  the  feedback  of  information via  the  IDG  information  system.  To  date,  there  are  only  four Group  factories  that  are  outside  the  scope  (India:  factories in Pune and Badi), the Magdal factory in Israel and the Nairobi factory  in  Kenya).  Thus,  reporting  covers  99.4%  of  production from our factories. This indicator is evaluated for all the Group's active formulas and is calculated on the basis of the data on production  volume.  The  data  are  processed,  including consistency checks and correction of anomalies if necessary.\n\n## Data\n\nCalculation  of  this  indicator  relies  solely  on  the  dry  material, excluding the 'water' used in certain formulations.\n\nThere are three elements that are calculated independently:\n\n- \u25cf The biobased portion: this represents the percentage of raw materials of renewable origin in our portfolio according to the definition of ISO 16 128.\n- \u25cf The abundant mineral portion: this refers to the percentage of  ingredients  of  mineral  origin,  the  abundance  of  which allows  sustainable  use  and  the  inorganic  ingredients  (nonmineral and not containing any carbon atoms, oxygenated water  for  example)  obtained  by  green  processes.  The definition  of  abundant  minerals  is  established  by  the  Raw Materials  Department  (DIMP)  with  the  assistance  of  an expert  consultant  from  the  French  Bureau  of  Geological and Mining  Research  (Bureau  de  recherches  g\u00e9ologiques et mini\u00e8res - BRGM). An initial list was available at the start of 2022 that covers 40% in volume of the minerals used by the Group (characterising 463 raw materials). This list will be updated during the coming years (updateable list)\n- \u25cf The  circular  process  portion:  the  definition  of  this  subelement  is  still  being  established  by  the  Raw  Materials Department (DIMP) with the assistance of experts and will be available in the near future.\n\n## Resources - Data on packaging indicators\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe  packaging  data  cover  all  the  finished  products  leaving the  factories,  with  the  exception  of  certain  finished  products for which the data are not yet linked to the central information systems, such as MINDS. This is the case for the products from the factories in Migdal, Nairobi, Funza or Salzhelmmendorf, for certain subcontracted products from recent acquisitions, and packaging  specific  to Travel  Retail.  These  packaging  data exclude POS /PLV materials.\n\n4",

        "page_content": ".\n\nMethodological notes\n\n## Indicators\n\n## 1. Percentage  of  created  or  renovated  products  had  an improved environmental profile due to improved packaging\n\nSPOT:  The  proportion  of  new  or  updated  products  whose environmental  profile  has  been  improved  are  reported annually;  this  is  calculated  by  the  SPOT  tool.  For  a  new product, improvement is measured in relation to an average of  the  brand's  existing  and  comparable  products;  for  an updated product, improvement is measured and compared to the earlier product.\n\n## 2. Percentage of labelled paper and cardboard\n\nThe  data  on  the  percentage  of  FSC  labelled  paper  and cardboard  (sourced  from  wood  derivatives)  comes  from tracking  the  supplies  of  all  suppliers:  the  Group's  sourcing entities  demand  that  each  of  their  suppliers  complete  the information on tonnage and provide the related certifications. The data are aggregated by the central sourcing department.\n\n## 3. Reduction  in  intensity  of  the  quantity  of  packaging  used for the Group's products\n\nThe reduction in packaging intensity is measured in packaging weight  divided  by  the  weight  of  the  formula.  The  unit  is  g/g and  scope  is  all  the  packaging  leaving  a  factory  (primary, secondary or tertiary). The reduction in intensity is calculated from  specification  systems  for  filling,  packing  and  production articles.  The  data  are  aggregated  at  the  global  level  by  the data management teams.\n\n## 4. Percentage  of  plastic packaging  recycled  or  from biobased sources\n\nThe  tonnages  of  plastic  materials  recycled  or  from  biobased sources used in the products come from specification systems for  the  filling  and  packing  articles  and  the  production  of finished products, and are aggregated at the global level by the data management teams. The portion of recycled plastic is an actual rate of recycled material in the packaging: it does not  come  from  a mass  balance  certification  system. The scope  of  this  indicator  is all  packaging  leaving  the  factory (primary, secondary and tertiary).\n\n## 5. Percentage of plastic packaging that is refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable\n\nThe definition of refillable, reusable, recyclable or compostable packaging  follows  the  definitions  of  the  Ellen  Mc  Arthur Foundation described in the document 'New Plastics Economy Global  Commitment  -  Reporting  Guidelines  April  2021'.  These definitions are taken  account  of  in  the  Group's  data management systems, which allows identification and counting of the quantities.\n\n## Data\n\nThe following method is used to collect data for the defined scope: the different indicators come from product specification  systems  linked  to  the  production  management tools.  The  data  are  extracted  and  recovered  by  the  data management  teams  who  aggregate  them  globally  using  a centralised  IT  tool.  It  is  the  Sustainability  entity  of  the Department of Packaging Operations and Development that verifies all the elements and the figures.\n\n## Eco-designed advertising displays at points of sale\n\nThe  scope  of  consolidation  for  POS  eco-design  covers  POS purchasing  expenses  (display,  advertising  elements  at  the points  of  sale)  in  the  countries  in  which  a  L'Or\u00e9al  subsidiary that  has  a  Sourcing  team  is  established.  Every  year  the Sourcing teams in question report the POS expense and the % of conformity with eco-design 'Must Haves'.\n\nThe  Country  data  are  collected  using  the  intranet  systems dedicated to reporting by 'Reporting 21' country, which can be  accessed  by  each  Sourcing  team  in  the  countries.  Each Sourcing  team  is  responsible  for  compiling  the  data  of  the team's Country, and must validate the accuracy of the data communicated. The data are also validated by the Sourcing Zones. The indicator is consolidated at the Group level by the Global  Retail  Sourcing  teams.  In  2021,  53  Entities  (Country  or Hub) participated in the reporting.\n\nThe  Sourcing  teams  and  suppliers  concerned  are  trained  in eco-design, including the associated data collection process. The process is defined and explained every year to the teams responsible. The percentage of eco-designed POS is calculated  in  accordance  with  a  self-declared  statement from the suppliers trained in eco-design. It is reviewed by the Statutory  Auditors  whose  recommendations  are  used  for continuous improvement of the systems.\n\n## Eco-design of owned stores and points of sale Scope of consolidation\n\nThe scope considered includes the Group's new and renovated free-standing stores over a global scope. The period considered is 12 months, from 1 January to 31 December of the current  year.  A  store  is  considered  ecodesigned  if  the ecodesign  rate  exceeds  100%  or  if  the  store  is  LEED  Gold certified.\n\nThe ecodesign rate of the free-standing stores is calculated on the  basis  of  the  process  tracking  and  the  documentation  of the Sustainable  Retail  Box  checklist  and  according  to  a  selfdeclaration of the conformity of said points of sale, unless the store holds an external LEED certification.\n\n## Data\n\nAt  the  time  the  data  are  compiled,  each  country  team  is responsible for verifying the accuracy of all data communicated  to  the  teams  of  each  of  the  geographic zones.  Ecodesign  is  the  subject  of  training  for  the  teams monitoring  the  process  and  the  documentation  of  the \"Sustainable Retail Box' checklist.\n\nA  process  of  continuous  improvement  of  these  systems  has been  put  in  place.  They  are  reviewed  every  year  by  the Statutory  Auditors  and  modified  by  taking  into  consideration their  recommendations  and  follow-up  objectives  for  the following years.",

Empowering the Group's business ecosystem\n\n## Beneficiaries of the Solidarity Sourcing programme\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe  period  considered  is  12  months  from  1 January  to 31 December of the current year over a worldwide scope.\n\nConditions apply and must be met in order to be counted as a beneficiary of the Solidarity Sourcing programme:\n\n- \u25cf Workers  from  economically  or  socially  disadvantaged communities  who  work  at  the  Group's  suppliers  and  their subcontractors;\n- \u25cf The supplier must also produce materials, goods or services purchased  by  L'Or\u00e9al;  in  other  words,  the  work  hours  are assignable to the Group;\n- \u25cf Finally, being counted as a beneficiary requires meeting at least  one  of  the  following  two  criteria:  access  to  and remaining in a permanent job if their community is generally excluded  or  under-represented  in  the  activity  and,  as applicable,  a  substantial  and  lasting  improvement  in income thanks to the activity associated with the \"Solidarity Sourcing' programme.\n\n## Data\n\nIn the majority of projects, the counting methodology is based on  the  number  of  full-time  equivalents  (FTE)  under  local regulations and on the basis of a full year. The FTE number is proportional  to  L'Or\u00e9al's  weight  in  the  supplier's  business activity.  Thus,  the  number  of  beneficiaries  of  the \"Solidarity Sourcing' programme who work at a supplier is calculated as a proportion of the payroll of the supplier who participates in the production of L'Or\u00e9al products. However, if the supplier's employees work for customers other than L'Or\u00e9al, it is then the amount of the orders in relation to the supplier's total revenue that determines the number of hours assigned to the L'Or\u00e9al production.\n\nA  specific  feature  should  be  noted  for  projects  related  to sustainable sourcing of raw materials (e.g. Projects based on fair trade  principles);    the  unit  of  measurement  of  the beneficiaries  is  not  FTE,  but  the  number  of  producers concerned. The supplier, with the assistance of an independent  third  party,  defines  a  threshold  at  which  the project has a significant impact on the target community with respect to the local situation (for example, living conditions or income). It is then possible to count the beneficiary workforce for said  project  resulting  from  the  'Solidarity  Sourcing' programme.\n\n## People from very difficult social or economic situations trained in beauty professions.\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThis  indicator  is  calculated  over  a  global  scope  using  annual data and a sliding total over four years.\n\nThis is  the  number of people trained (beneficiaries) within the Beauty  for  a  Better  Life programme  implemented  by  the partner  structures  (NGOs,  etc.)  between  1 January  and  31 December 2021.\n\n## Data\n\nThe  data  collection  is  performed  by  managers  of  the programme  at  L'Or\u00e9al's  subsidiaries  on  the  basis  of  the information  and  a  certificate  of  compliance  transmitted  to them  by  the  partner  structures.  The  data  are  collected  and consolidated by the Foundation teams (within the Department of Corporate Responsibility) that perform consistency controls.\n\n## People in very difficult social or economic situations who have benefited from beauty care and wellbeing treatments\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThis indicator is calculated over a France scope using annual data. This is the number of people who have benefited from beauty  care  under  the Beauty  for  a  Better  Life  programme implemented by the partner structures (NGOs, etc.) between 1 January and 31 December 2021.\n\n## Data\n\nThe  data  are  collected  by  the  programme's  partners structures.  The  data  are  collected  and  consolidated  by  the Foundation  teams  (within  the  Department  of  Corporate Responsibility) that perform consistency controls.\n\n## Beneficiaries of our brands' social engagement programmes\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThis indicator is calculated over a scope limited to the brands that  have  social  engagement  programmes.  The  scope excludes the brands' environmental programmes.  Also excluded  from  the  scope  of  consolidation  are  product donations and media awareness-raising campaigns.\n\n## Data\n\nThe following method is used to collect data for the defined scope: in order to be counted, a beneficiary must be directly supported  by  a  NGO  partner  of  the  brand's  programme  or have received training from the brand or the NGO partner of the  brand's  programme.  The  data  are  collected  and consolidated  by  each  Marketing  department  and  each subsidiary,  which  must  validate  the  accuracy  of  all  the  data consolidated and communicated.\n\n## Displaying the environmental and social impact of the products\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe  indicators  concern  all  rinse-off  products  that  belong  to one  of  the  following  categories:  Shampoo,  Conditioner  & Masks, Leave-in care & Oil, Colouring, Face Cleanser, or Body Cleanser manufactured in the year 2021 over a Group scope. The indicators do not count the Hand Cleanser and Rinse-off Shave Cream categories.\n\nThe  indicators  used  are  those  used  in  the  application  of  the Product Impact Labelling (PIL) methodology. They reflect the results  of  the  Group's  policy  for  measuring the environmental and  social  impact  of  the  products.  The  calculation  method and the data are verified by independent auditors.\n\n## Data\n\nThe data for the defined scope is collected by the Operations Department using SPOT (Sustainable Product Optimization Tool).\n\n4",

Contribute to solving the challenges of the world\n\n## Supporting the most vulnerable women\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThis  indicator  is  calculated  over  a  global  scope  using  data accumulated since the Fund was launched. It is the number of structures (NGOs, etc.) supported by the Fund, the number of women  directly  supported  by  these  structures  with  the assistance  of  the  Fund,  and  the  budget  in  euros  allocated since the launch of the Fund.\n\n## 4.5.3. Human Rights data\n\n## 4.5.3.1. Scope of consolidation\n\nThe scope of consolidation of human rights data arising from ethics reporting is identical to that of social data.\n\n## 4.5.3.2. Indicators\n\nThe  indicators  chosen  are  those  within  the  scope  of  the applicable  regulations,  with  in  particular  the  aim  of  data comparability.\n\n## Data\n\nData  is  collected  by  the  structures  supported  by  the  Fund which  have  used  all  or  a  portion  of  the  budget  allocated during  the  reference  period.  The  data  are  collected  and consolidated  by  the  Fund  teams  (within  the  Department  of Corporate Responsibility), who perform consistency controls on the  basis  of  the  information  reported  and  a  certificate  of conformity transmitted by the partner structures.\n\nThe  budget  allocated  is  monitored  and  consolidated  by  the Fund's teams within the Department of Corporate Responsibility  in  cooperation  with  the  Finance  team  of  the Founder (L'Or\u00e9al).\n\n## 4.5.3.3. Data\n\nThe following methods are used to collect data for the defined scope:\n\n- \u00b7 the  data  relating  to  Ethics  and  Human  Rights  for  L'Or\u00e9al subsidiaries is collected by the Ethics, Risk and Compliance Department using the Annual Ethics Reporting platform. The scope  is  aligned  with  individual  company  data  unless otherwise indicated for each indicator in the report;\n- \u00b7 Human  Rights  data  for  the  employees  of  the  Group's suppliers  are  consolidated  by  the  Purchasing  Department and collected during social audits by an independent and accredited third party that carries out the audits and shares the data collected as well as the audit reports; and\n- \u00b7 the other data  are  collected from the corporate departments  concerned  (Corporate  Social  Responsibility, Worldwide  Product  Safety  Evaluation,  Ethics,  Risk  and Compliance, and the L'Or\u00e9al Foundation).",

In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures  aimed  at  ensuring  compliance  with  applicable  legal  and  regulatory  requirements,  ethical  requirements  and  the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes ) relating to this engagement.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work engaged the skills of ten people between October 2021 and February 2022 and took a total of twenty-one weeks.\n\nTo assist  us  in  conducting  our  work,  we  referred  to  our  corporate  social  responsibility  and  sustainable  development  experts.  We conducted around thirty interviews with people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking account of the risk of material misstatement of the Information.\n\nWe consider that the procedures conducted in exercising our professional judgement enable us to express a limited assurance conclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 We familiarized ourselves with the activities of all companies in the consolidation scope and the description of the principal risks.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the suitability of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector;\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement covers each category of information stipulated in section III of Article L. 225-102-1 governing social and environmental affairs, respect for human rights and the fight against corruption and tax evasion;\n- \u00b7 We verified  that  the  Statement  provides  the  information  required  under  Article  R.225-105  II  of  the  French  Commercial  Code where  relevant  with  respect  to  the  principal  risks,  and  includes,  where  applicable,  an  explanation  for  the  absence  of  the information required under Article L.225-102-1 III, paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code;\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of the principal risks associated with the activities of all the consolidated entities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- \u00b7 We referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- \u00b7 assess the process used to identify and confirm the principal risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the principal risks and the policies presented, and\n- \u00b7 corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important - presented in Annex 1; for certain risks or information, (human resources, health and safety, human, social and environmental rights, etc.) our work was carried out on the consolidating entity, while for other risks, our work was carried out on the consolidating entity and on a selection of entities;\n- \u00b7 We verified that the Statement covers the consolidated scope, i.e. all companies within the consolidation scope in accordance with Article L. 233-16, with the limits specified in the Statement.\n\n4",

Statutory Auditor's reports\n\nL'OR\u00c9AL'S SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIETAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n- \u00b7 We  obtained  an  understanding  of  internal  control  and  risk  management  procedures  implemented  by  the  Company  and assessed the data collection process aimed at ensuring the completeness and fairness of the Information;\n- \u00b7 For the key performance indicators and other quantitative outcomes - presented in Annex 1 - that we considered to be the most important, we implemented:\n- \u00b7 analytical  procedures  that  consisted  in  verifying  the  correct  consolidation  of  collected  data  as  well  as  the  consistency  of changes thereto;\n- \u00b7 substantive tests, on a sample basis and using other selection methods, that consisted in verifying the proper application of definitions  and  procedures  and  reconciling  data  with  supporting  documents.  These  procedures  were  conducted  for  a selection  of  contributing  entities  -  presented  in  Annex  2  -  and  covered  between  17%  and  28%  of  the  consolidated  data selected for these tests.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the overall consistency of the Statement in relation to our knowledge of the entire Company.\n\nThe procedures conducted in a limited assurance review are substantially less in scope than those required to issue a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the  professional guidelines of the French National Institute of Statutory Auditors ( Compagnie Nationale  des  Commissaires  aux  Comptes );  a  higher  level  of  assurance  would  have  required  us  to  carry  out  more  extensive procedures.\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February 18, 2022 One of the Statutory Auditors,\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s\n\nDavid Dupont-No\u00ebl Partner, Audit\n\nCatherine Saire Partner, D\u00e9veloppement Durable",

In  addition,  we  have  set  up  a  quality  control  system  that  includes  documented  policies and  procedures  aimed  at  ensuring  compliance  with  applicable  legal  and  regulatory  texts,  ethical  rules  and  the  professional doctrine of the National Company of Auditors relating to to this intervention.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe  performed  our  work  as  described  below  in  accordance  with  the  professional  guidance  issued  by  the  French  Institute  of Statutory  Auditors  ( Compagnie  nationale  des  commissaires  aux  comptes )  relating  to  this  engagement  and  with  international standard ISAE 3000 ( A s ssurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information ).\n\nWe planned and performed our work taking into account the risk of material misstatement of the Selected Information.\n\nWe believe that the procedures we have carried out by exercising our professional judgment allow us to form a conclusion of reasonable assurance:\n\n- \u00b7 We examined the Guidelines set up by L'Or\u00e9al with regard to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and clarity, taking into consideration, where applicable, best practices in the sector;\n- \u00b7 We took note of the internal control and risk management procedures put in place by the entity and assessed the collection process aimed at the completeness and sincerity of the Selected information;\n- \u00b7 We have implemented analytical procedures consisting in verifying the correct consolidation of the data collected as well as the consistency of the changes;\n- \u00b7 We have implemented detailed tests, on the basis of surveys or other means of selection, consisting of verifying the correct application of the definitions and procedures and reconciling the data with the supporting documents. This work was carried out with a selection of contributing entities, namely:\n- \u00b7 for  selected  human  resources  information:  the  activities  in  France,  Canada  and  Taiwan,  representing  20%  of  the  Group's headcount;\n- \u00b7 for selected social information: the L'Or\u00e9al head office which centralizes all the information;\n- \u00b7 for  selected  environmental,  health  and  safety  information:  South  Africa  (Midrand),  Germany  (Karlsruhe),  Brazil  (Sao  Paulo), Canada, (Mont\u00e9ral, DC Ville Saint Laurent), China (Suzhou, DC China), Egypt (Cairo), United States (Florence, DC North Little Rock,  DC  Mc  Calla,  DC  Walton),  France  (Ormes,  Saint  Quentin,  DC  Creuzier  Le  Neuf,  DC  Essigny),  India  (Pune), Indonesia  (Jakarta),  Italy  (Settimo),  Japan  (Gotemba),  Mexico  (Mexico,  San  Lui  Potosi),  Poland  (Warsaw),  Russia  (Vorsino), Turkey (Istanbul), representing 47% of Group activity (in units of finished goods reviewed).\n\nTo assist us in carrying out our work, we called on our specialists in sustainable development and social responsibility.

The financial statements will not become final until they have been approved by the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to be held on 21 April 2022.\n\nThe Group did not anticipate any standards or interpretations not mandatorily applicable in 2021.\n\nThe Group is currently reviewing a decision of the IFRS IC:\n\nIn  April  2021,  a  decision  relating  to  IAS  38  'Intangible  Assets' was published. It addressed the matter of how to account for the  costs  of  configuring  or  customising  software  accessed via the  cloud under a 'Software as a service' (SaaS) agreement. At  31  December  2021,  this  analysis  has  not  yet  been  finalised due  to  the  operational  complexity  of  implementing  this decision.\n\n## Amendments and interpretations applied in 2021: Decision relating to IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' regarding the attribution of employee benefits to periods of service.\n\nThe method traditionally used to recognise obligations arising from defined benefit pension schemes involved attributing the rights  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  entire  career  of  the beneficiaries.\n\nThe  IFRS  IC  recommended  adjusting  this  method  for  defined benefit schemes that had the following characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 dependent on the length of service with the Company;\n- \u00b7 capped at a specified number of years of service;\n- \u00b7 payable from retirement age.\n\nFor  this  type  of  scheme,  the  decision  published  in  late May  2021  states  that  rights  vested  over  the  period  prior  to retirement age should be attributed on a straight-line basis by limiting its duration to the specified number of years of service at which rights are capped.\n\nImpact  at  Group  level  is  focused  on  France  and  stands  at \u20ac137.4 million gross and \u20ac102.2 million after tax, recorded as an increase  in  shareholders'  equity.  The  impact  on  the  income statement for the period is marginal.\n\n## Amendments and interpretation applied in 2020: IFRS 16 \"Leases\"\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group completed its analysis of the IFRS Interpretation Committee (IC) decision dated 26  November  2019.  This  decision  relates  to  the  duration  of certain leases (indefinite term or short initial  contractual term which  is automatically  renewable)  as  well  as  to  the depreciation period for fixtures and  fittings that are inseparable from the leased asset. This decision does not have a significant impact at the Group level.\n\nThe Group applied the amendment to IFRS 16, adopted by the European Union on 12 October 2020 and on 31 March 2021, relating to Covid-19-related rent relief reducing lease payments due on or before 30 June 2022.  The  amendments allow  changes  in  terms  of  rent  relief  to  be  recognized immediately in income rather than spread over the term of the contract.\n\nThe impact is not material at the Group level.\n\n5",

Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in accordance with international accounting standards requires that  the  Group  make  a  certain  number  of  estimates  and assumptions that may affect the value of the Group's assets, liabilities, equity and net profit (loss).\n\nThese estimates and  assumptions  mainly  concern  the measurement  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets, operating  lease  terms,  provisions,  non-current  tax  liabilities, pension obligations, deferred taxes and share-based payments.  Estimates  used  by  the  Group  in  relation  to  these different  areas  are  made  based  on  information  available when the accounts are prepared and are described in detail in each specific associated note.\n\n## 1.2. Scope and methods of consolidation\n\nAll companies included in the scope of consolidation have a financial year ending 31 December or close their accounts on that date.\n\nAll  companies  directly  or  indirectly  controlled  by  the  parent company L'Or\u00e9al have been fully consolidated.\n\nGroup  companies  that  are  jointly  controlled  with  a  limited number of other shareholders under a contractual agreement are  consolidated  under  the  equity  method  in  accordance with IFRS 11.\n\nAssociates  over  which  the  Group  has  a  significant  influence have been accounted for by the equity method.\n\n## 1.3. Translation of the accounts of foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at closing exchange  rates. Income  statement  items are translated at average exchange rates for the year.\n\nThe resulting translation difference attributable to the Group is entered  directly  under  equity  under  the  item Cumulative translation adjustments , while the translation difference attributable  to  non-controlling  interests  is  recognised  under the Non-controlling interests item.\n\n## 1.4. Valuation of goodwill in foreign currencies\n\nGoodwill  generated  on  foreign  companies  is  considered  to form part of the assets and liabilities of the foreign company, and is  therefore  expressed  in  the  entity's  functional  currency and translated  using  the  closing  exchange  rates  in  effect  at the  closing  date.  Goodwill  recorded  before  1  January  2004 continues to be recorded in euros.\n\nThe discount rate used to assess the lease debt corresponds to the effective annual interest rate for each lease. We calculate it using the zero interest rate coupons received per currency and per maturity tranche, plus the Group credit spread.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  selected  the  simplified  retrospective  approach  and has  measured  the  right  of  use  of  almost  all  its  leases  by determining their book value from the lease start date.\n\n- \u00b7 95% of the capitalised leases are property leases, including country head offices, stores and distribution centres. Other types  of  leases  involve  vehicle  fleets,  traditional  handling equipment and packaging tools and equipment.\n- \u00b7 Low  value  leases  and  leases  that  ended  in  2019  are  not included in the scope.\n- \u00b7 On initial recognition, deferred tax are recognised.",

Year 2021\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nOn 1 February 2021, L'Or\u00e9al finalised the acquisition of Takami Co.  This  company  develops  and  markets  under  licence products from the Takami skincare brand; owned by Dr. Hiroshi Takami,  the  founder  of  the  two  eponymous  dermatology clinics in Tokyo. Mainly available in Japan and in some Asian countries, notably in China.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  L'Or\u00e9al  also  renewed  the  brand  licensing agreement with Dr. Takami for a very long period and signed a collaboration agreement with the Takami clinics.\n\nT akami will be integrated into the L'Or\u00e9al Luxe Division.\n\nOn  8  December  2021,  L'Or\u00e9al  signed  an  agreement  to acquire  Youth  to  the  People,  a  skincare  company  based  in California inspired by superfood.\n\nYouth to the People develops and markets high-performance skincare products known for innovative formulas that combine premium vegan blends of superfood extracts and science.\n\nAvailable in the US, Canada, Australia and in select European countries  where  it  enjoys  a  very  strong  appeal,  the  brand  is marketed through an omnichannel distribution - mix of D2C ecommerce and selective distribution.\n\nThe brand will be integrated into the L'Or\u00e9al Luxe Division. In 2021,  Youth  to  the  People  is  expected  to  record  over US$50 million of sales.\n\nThis acquisition was completed on 29 December 2021 and has been fully consolidated since that date.\n\nThe cost of these new acquisitions represented \u20ac524.8 million. The  total  amount  of  goodwill  and  other  intangible  assets resulting  from  their  acquisitions  provisionally  amounted  to \u20ac510,5 million.\n\nIn  2021,  the  acquisition of Takami represented \u20ac54.4 million in full-year net sales and -\u20ac7.7 million in full-year operating profit.\n\n## Sale\n\nOn 31 March 2021, L'Or\u00e9al finalised the sale of the Cosmeurop production site, located in Strasbourg, France to the Superga group.\n\n## 2.1.2. Year 2020\n\n## Acquisition\n\nOn  31  March  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  finalised  the  acquisition  of  the Mugler  and  Azzaro  brands  and  perfumes  belonging  to  the Clarins  group  for  a  cash  amount  of  \u20ac1.3  billion,  net  of  cash acquired.\n\nThis acquisition has been fully consolidated since that date.\n\nOn  18  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  announced  the  acquisition  of  US skincare  brand  Thayers  Natural  Remedies.  The  brand  will  be integrated into L'Or\u00e9al's Consumer Products Division.\n\nThe  distribution  strategy,  initially  focused  on  a  network  of natural  products  stores,  has  evolved  into  a  multi-channel approach that today includes mass-market retailers, specialised retailers, drug stores and online distribution. In 2019, Thayers generated sales of US$44 million. The acquisition was\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\ncompleted on 31 July  2020  and  has  been  fully  consolidated since that date.\n\nThe cost of these acquisitions represented \u20ac1.7 billion. The total amount of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from these  acquisitions  amounted  at  their  acquisition  dates  to \u20ac1,464  million  for  Azzaro  and  Mugler  and  \u20ac304.3  million  for Thayers.\n\nIn 2020, these acquisitions represented \u20ac275.7 million in full-year net sales and \u20ac34.9 million in full-year operating profit.\n\n## Sale\n\nOn 4 February 2020, after some strategic thinking to ensure the best  possible  development  for  the  Roger  &  Gallet  brand, L'Or\u00e9al announced it had entered into exclusive negotiations with the French investment holding company Impala to sell this brand.\n\nFounded  in  Paris  in  1862,  Roger  &  Gallet  emerged  from  the world of Apothecary Perfumery inspired by the French art de vivre.  Part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  since  2008  following  the  acquisition  of Yves  Saint  Laurent  Beaut\u00e9,  Roger  &  Gallet  offers  a  rich catalogue of fragrances in a range of perfumes, toiletries and skincare. In 2018, the brand generated sales of \u20ac52 million.\n\nOn  29  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  and  French  investment  holding company Impala announced that they had finalised the sale of the Roger & Gallet brand.\n\n## 2.1.3. Year 2019\n\n## Acquisition\n\nL'Or\u00e9al did not make any significant acquisition in 2019.\n\n## 2.2. Impact of changes in the scope of consolidation in the cash flow statement\n\nFor  2021,  these  changes  mainly  related  to  the  Takami  and Youth to the People acquisitions.\n\nFor  2020,  these  changes  mainly  related  to  the  Azzaro-Mugler and Thayers Natural Remedies acquisitions.\n\nThe impact of acquisitions is not material for 2019.\n\n## 2.3. Transaction on share capital\n\nOn 7 December 2021, the L'Or\u00e9al Board of Directors approved a  strategic  transaction  consisting  of  the  repurchase  by L'Or\u00e9al, as part  of  its share  buyback  programme,  of 22.26 million of its own shares - representing 4% of its capital from  Nestl\u00e9.  The  total  price  paid  to  Nestl\u00e9  was  \u20ac8.904  billion. All  shares  redeemed  by  L'Or\u00e9al  have  been  bought  back for  the  express  purpose  of  cancelling  them.  The  transaction had a marginally accretive impact on the diluted net earnings per  share  in  2021,  given  that  the  shares  were  repurchased at the end of 2021, but will have a full-year accretive impact of at least 4% for the 2022 financial year.\n\nThis  transaction  led  the  Group  to  take  out  a  bridging  loan of  \u20ac1.9  billion  and  issue  commercial  paper  for  \u20ac2.3  billion, with the  balance  financed  by  the  cash  available  at 31 December 2021.\n\n5",

Operating items - Segment information\n\n## Accounting Principles\n\n## Net sales\n\nNet  sales  are  recognised  when  the  goods  have  been transferred to the customer.\n\nSales  incentives,  cash  discounts  and  product  returns  are deducted  from  net  sales,  as  are  incentives  granted  to distributors or consumers resulting in a cash outflow, such as commercial  cooperation,  coupons,  discounts  and  loyalty programmes.\n\nIncentives granted to distributors and consumers arerecorded  as  a  deduction  from  net  sales  when  the followingtwo  conditions  are  met  at  the  same  time:  the service is notseparable from the sale of the product and it is not possibleto reasonably estimate the fair value of the cost of theservice.\n\nSales  incentives,  cash  discounts,  provisions  for  returns  and incentives granted to customers are recorded simultaneously to the recognition of the sales if they can be estimated in a reasonably  reliable  manner,  based  mainly  on  statistics compiled from past experience and contractual conditions.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nThe  cost  of  goods  sold  consists  mainly  of  the  industrial production  cost  of  products  sold,  the  cost  of  distributing products to customers including freight and delivery costs, either directly or indirectly through  depots,  inventory impairment costs, and royalties paid to third parties.\n\n## Research and innovation expenses\n\nExpenditure  during  the  research  phase  is  charged  to  the income  statement  for  the  financial  year  during  which  it  is incurred.\n\nExpenses incurred during the innovation phase  are recognised  as Intangible  assets only  if  they  meet  all  the following criteria set out in IAS 38:\n\n- \u00b7 the  project  is  clearly  defined  and  the  related  costs  are separately identified and reliably measured;\n- \u00b7 the technical  feasibility of the project has  been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the intention and ability to complete the project and to use  or  sell  the  products  resulting  from  the  project  have been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the resources necessary to complete the project and to use or sell it are available;\n- \u00b7 the  Group  can  demonstrate  that  the  project  will generate  probable  future  economic  benefits,  as  the existence  of  a  potential  market  for  the  production resulting  from  the  project,  or  its  internal  usefulness  has been demonstrated.\n\nIn view of the very large number of innovation projects and uncertainties  concerning  the  decision  to  launch  products relating  to  these  projects,  L'Or\u00e9al  considers  that  some  of these capitalisation criteria are not met.\n\n## Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nThese  expenses  consist  mainly  of  expenses  relating  to  the advertisement and promotion of products to customers and consumers. They are charged to the income statement for the financial year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nThese expenses relate mainly to sales teams and sales team management, marketing teams and administrative services, as well as general expenses and the costs and expenses of free shares.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nOperating  profit  consists  of  gross  profit  less  research  and innovation  expenses,  advertising  and  promotion  expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses.\n\n## Tangible assets\n\nTangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet at their purchase price. They are not remeasured.\n\nAssets financed by lease contracts are recognised as assets on  the  balance  sheet  under Right-of-use assets.  The corresponding debt is recognised as a liability under Lease debt .\n\nInvestment subsidies are recorded as liabilities under Other current liabilities .\n\nThe components of tangible assets are recorded separately if their estimated useful lives, and therefore their depreciation periods, are materially different.\n\nTangible  assets  are  depreciated  using  the  straight-line method, over the following useful lives:\n\n| Buildings                                       | 40 years   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Industrial machinery and equipment              | 5-15 years |\n| Point-of-sales advertising: stands and displays | 3 years    |\n| Other tangible assets                           | 3-10 years |\n\nDepreciation  and  impairment  losses  are  recorded  in  the income statement according to the use of the asset.\n\nIn  view  of  their  nature,  tangible  assets  are  considered  to have a value of zero at the end of the useful lives indicated above.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost method.\n\nA provision is made for obsolete and slow-moving inventories on the basis of their probable net realisable value, estimated on the basis of historic and projected data.",

        "page_content": "## 5.4. Post-employment benefits, termination benefits and other long-term employee benefits\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  Group  operates  pension,  early  retirement  and  other employee benefit schemes depending on local legislation and regulations.\n\nFor obligatory state schemes and other defined-contribution schemes,  the  Group  recognises  in  the  income  statement contributions payable when they are due. No provision has been set aside in this respect as the Group's obligation does not exceed the amount of contributions paid.\n\nThe characteristics of the defined benefit schemes in force within the Group are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 French  regulations  provide  for  specific  length-of-service awards  payable  to  employees  on  retirement.  An  early retirement  plan  and  a  defined  benefit  plan  have  also been set  up.  In  some  Group  companies  there  are  also measures providing for the payment of certain healthcare costs for retired employees. These obligations are  partially  funded  by  an  external  fund,  except  those relating to healthcare costs for retired employees;\n- \u00b7 for foreign subsidiaries with employee retirement schemes or other specific obligations relating to defined benefit  plans,  the  excess  of  the  projected  benefit obligation over the scheme's assets is also recognised by setting  up  a  provision  for  charges  on  the  basis  of  the actuarial value of employees' vested rights.\n\nThe charges recorded in the income statement during the year include:\n\n- \u00b7 additional  rights vested  by  employees  during  the accounting period;\n- \u00b7 the  impact  of  any  change  to  existing  schemes  on previous years or of any new schemes;\n- \u00b7 the change in the value of the discounted rights over the past year;\n- \u00b7 income on external funds calculated on the basis of the discount rate applied to the benefit obligation.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used to calculate these obligations take into account the economic conditions specific to each country or Group company. The main weighted average assumptions for the Group are as follows:\n\n| In %                          | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2019   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Discount rate (commitment)    | 1.6%         | 1.1%         | 1.6%         |\n| Discount rate (service cost)* | 1.8%         | 1.4%         | 1.9%         |\n| Salary increases              | 3.6%         | 3.4%         | 3.5%         |\n\n|                                        | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021   | 31.12.2021                 | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020   | 31.12.2020                 | 31.12.2019   | 31.12.2019   | 31.12.2019                 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------|\n|                                        | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application  of final rate | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application  of final rate | Initial rate | Final rate   | Application  of final rate |\n| Expected rate of health care inflation | 5.3%         | 4.2%         | 2027                       | 5.3%         | 4.2%         | 2027                       | 5.7%         | 4.2%         | 2027                       |\n\nThe discount rates are obtained by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds having maturity dates equivalent to those of the obligations.\n\nBond quality is assessed by reference to the AA-/Aa3 minimum rating provided by one of the three main credit-rating agencies.\n\nThe latter two items represent the interest component of the pension  costs.  The  interest  component  is  shown  within  Net financial  income  on  the Other  financial  income  and expenses item.\n\nTo  determine  the  discounted  value  of  the  obligation  for each  scheme,  the  Group  applies  an  actuarial  valuation method  based  on  the  final  salary  (projected  unit  credit method). The obligations and the fair value of plan assets are assessed each  year  using  length-of-service, life expectancy,  staff  turnover  by  category  and  economic assumptions (such as inflation rate and discount rate).\n\nThe  Group  applies  a  simplified  granular  approach  to calculate its service cost for the period. Under this simplified approach,  two  different  discount  rates  are  used  to calculate the obligation and the service cost based on the duration of the future cash flows relating to each of these items.  Financial  costs  are  calculated  by  applying  the discount rate used for the obligation to plan assets and by applying the differential interest rate to service cost for the period.\n\nActuarial  gains  and  losses  arising  on  post-employment defined benefit obligations are recognised in equity.\n\nActuarial gains and losses in relation to other benefits such as jubilee awards and long-serve bonuses are immediately charged to the income statement.\n\nThe  liability  corresponding  to  the  Company's  net  defined benefit obligation regarding its employees is recorded in the balance  sheet  on  the Provisions  for  employee  retirement obligations and related benefits line.\n\n5",

Income tax\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nThe  income  tax  charge  includes  the  current  tax  expense payable by each consolidated tax entity and the deferred tax expense. Deferred tax is calculated whenever there are temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and  their  basis  for  consolidated  accounting purposes, using the balance sheet liability method.\n\nThe  restatement  of  assets  and  liabilities  relating  to  lease contracts results in the booking of deferred tax.\n\nDeferred  tax  includes  irrecoverable  taxation  on  estimated or confirmed dividends.\n\nDeferred tax is measured using the tax rate enacted at the closing date and which will also apply when the temporary differences reverse.\n\n## 2021 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nDeferred tax assets generated by tax loss carryforwards are only recognised to the extent it is probable that the entities will  be  able  to  generate  taxable  profit  against  which  they can be utilised.\n\nUnder the French system of tax  consolidation,  the  taxable profits of some  French  companies  are  offset  when determining  the  overall  tax  charge,  which  is  payable  only by  L'Or\u00e9al,  the  parent  company  of  the  tax  Group. Tax consolidation systems also exist outside France.\n\nUncertain tax positions  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet under Non-current  tax  liabilities .  These  correspond  to  an estimate of tax risks and litigation related to income tax for the various countries in which the Group operates.\n\n## 6.1.

The assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the Company  acquired  are  measured  at  fair  value  at  the acquisition date. Any valuation differences identified when the  acquisition  is  carried  out  are  recorded  under  the corresponding asset and liability items.\n\nAny residual difference between the cost of an acquisition and the  Group's  interest  in  the  fair  value  of  the  identified assets and liabilities is recorded as Goodwill and allocated to the Cash Generating Units expected to benefit from the acquisition or the related synergies.\n\nGoodwill  generated  on  the  acquisition  of  an  associate  is presented in the Investments in associates item.\n\nFor business combinations carried out after 1 January 2010, the  main  changes  with  regard  to  previously  applicable accounting principles are set out below:\n\n- \u00b7 for  each  acquisition,  the  Group  chooses  whether  to recognise  the  full  amount  of  goodwill  regardless  of  the ownership  interest  acquired,  or  an  amount  of  goodwill corresponding  to  its  interest  in  the  acquired  company (previously the only method allowed);\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets recognised after the initial accounting is complete are included in profit or loss, and in contrast to previous practices, the amount of goodwill that  would  have  been  recorded  had  the  deferred  tax asset  been  recognised  as  an  identifiable  asset  at  the acquisition date is not deducted;\n- \u00b7 costs  incurred  in  respect  of  a  business  combination  are now expensed and no longer included in the acquisition cost;\n- \u00b7 the acquisition cost, which includes contingent consideration, is recognised and  measured  at  its acquisition-date  fair  value.  Subsequent  changes  in  fair value, affecting in particular the contingent consideration recorded in liabilities, are recognised in Other income and expenses in the income statement and no longer treated as an adjustment to goodwill;\n- \u00b7 any  previous  interest  held  in  the  acquiree  prior  to  the date  control  was  obtained  is  now  remeasured  at  its acquisition-date  fair  value,  with  the  corresponding  gain or  loss  on  remeasurement  recognised  on  the  income statement;\n- \u00b7 purchase commitments for minority interests are recognised in financial  debt  at  the  acquisition-date  fair value. Subsequent  changes  in  fair  value  of  the commitment are recognised by adjusting equity.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "## 7.2. Other intangible assets\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nIntangible  assets  are  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  at cost. Intangible assets identified following an acquisition as well  as  internally  generated  intangible  assets  are  also included in this item.\n\n## a) Intangible assets acquired through business combinations\n\nThey  mainly  consist  of  brands,  customer  relationships  and formulas and patents.\n\nWith  regard  to  brands,  the  use  of  the  'discounted  cash flow' method is preferred to enable the value in use to be monitored  more  easily  following  the  acquisition.  Two approaches have been adopted to date:\n\n- \u00b7 premium-based approach: this method involves estimating the portion of future cash flows that could be generated by the brand, compared with the future cash flows that the activity could generate without the brand;\n- \u00b7 royalty-based  approach:  this  involves  estimating  the value of the brand by referencing the levels of royalties demanded for  the  use  of  similar  brands.  It  is  based  on sales forecasts drawn up by the Group.\n\nThese  approaches  are  based  on  a  qualitative  analysis  of the brand in order to ensure that the assumptions selected are  relevant.  The  discount  rate  used  is  based  on  the weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  for  the  target acquired. Terminal growth  rates are consistent with available market data (generally 2.5% for Europe and 3% for the rest of the world, except in specific cases).\n\nA brand may have a finite or an indefinite useful life span.\n\nLocal  brands  which  are  to  be  gradually  replaced  by  an international brand already existing within the Group have a finite useful life span.\n\nThey are amortised over their useful lives as estimated at the date of acquisition.\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\nInternational brands are brands which have an indefinite life span. They are tested for impairment at least once a year during the fourth quarter, and whenever an adverse event occurs. Adverse events may result among other things from an increase in  market  interest  rates  or  from  a  decrease  in actual  net  sales  or  operational  profit  compared  to forecasts.\n\nThe impairment test consists of calculating the recoverable amount of the brand based on the model adopted when the acquisition took place.\n\nCustomer  relationships  refer  to  relations  developed  with customers  either  through  contractual  arrangements  or  by non-contractual  means  through  constant  revenue  streams resulting from the target's competitive position or reputation in its market.\n\nThe useful life of a customer relationship is limited and varies depending  on  the  estimated  attrition  rate  of  existing customers at the time of the acquisition.\n\nThe Group may decide to identify and value patents and formulas that it intends to develop.\n\nThe value of a patent or a formula is assessed on the basis of  the  future  profits  expected  from  its  ownership  in  the future, in accordance with the royalty-based approach.\n\nThe amortisation period applicable to patents corresponds to  the  period  during  which  they  enjoy  legal  protection. Formulas,  which  are  not  protected  by  legal  means,  are amortised over a maximum period of 5 years.\n\n## b) Internally generated intangible assets\n\nThese mainly consist of software.\n\nInnovation costs of software for internal use are capitalised for the programming, coding and testing phases. The costs of substantial updates and upgrades resulting in additional functions are also capitalised.\n\nCapitalised  innovation  costs  are  amortised  from  the  date the software is made available in the entity concerned and over its probable useful life, which, in most cases, is between five and eight years.\n\n5",

It is tested for impairment at least once  a  year  during  the  fourth  quarter  or  whenever  an adverse  event  occurs.  Adverse  events  may  result  among other things from an increase in market interest rates or from a  decrease  in  actual  net  sales  or  operational  profit compared to forecasts.\n\nImpairment tests consist of comparing the carrying amount of assets including goodwill with the recoverable amount of each  Cash  Generating  Unit.  A  Cash  Generating  Unit corresponds  to  one  or  more  worldwide  brands.  A  Cash Generating Unit can contain several brands depending on organisational  criteria  and  particularly  when  distribution circuits and commercial/management  structures are pooled. Recoverable values are determined on the basis of discounted operating cash flow forecasts covering a period of  10  years  (the  period  considered  necessary  for  the strategic positioning of an acquisition) and a terminal value. The  cash  flows  are  determined  in  the  currencies  of  the\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\ncountries in question and are translated, in the same way as the net carrying amounts to which they are compared, at the  estimated  exchange  rate  for  the  following  year.  The discount  rate  used  for  these  calculations  is  based  on  the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),  which amounted to 7.8% in 2021, to 7.3% in 2020 and 6.8% in 2019 for  amounts  in  euro,  adjusted  where  appropriate  by  a country  risk  premium  according  to  the  geographic  zones concerned. The discount rates are post-tax rates applied to post-tax  cash  flows,  and  result  in  recoverable  amounts identical to those obtained by applying pre-tax rates to pretax  cash  flows.  The  assumptions  adopted  in  terms  of  sales growth and terminal values are reasonable and consistent with  the  available  market  data  (generally  2.5%  for  Europe and 3% for the rest of the world for terminal values except in specific cases).\n\nThe  use  of  discounted  cash  flow  forecasts  is  preferred  in order  to  determine  recoverable  amounts,  unless  details  of similar recent transactions are readily available.\n\nImpairment charged against goodwill cannot be reversed.\n\n5",

Financial assets and liabilities - Cost of debt\n\n## Accounting principles\n\n## Finance costs, net\n\nNet  financial  debt  consists  of  all  current  and  non-current financial borrowings and debt, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNet finance costs consist of income and expenses arising on the  items  making  up  net  financial  debt  during  the accounting  period,  including  gains  and  losses  on  the corresponding  interest  rate  and  foreign  exchange  rate hedges.  As  interest  rate  derivatives  are  fully  effective,  no ineffectiveness impacts finance costs.\n\n## Borrowings and debt\n\nBorrowings  and  debt  are  valued  at  amortised  cost  based on an effective interest rate.\n\nIn  accordance  with  the  principle  of  fair  value  hedge accounting, fixed-rate borrowings and debt swapped at a floating  rate  are  valued  on  the  balance  sheet  at  market value.  The  resulting  changes  in  value  are  recorded  as finance costs and are offset by changes in the value of the related interest rate swaps.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  fixed-rate  debt  is  determined  by  the discounted  cash  flow  method  using  bond  yield  curves  at the closing date, allowing for the spread corresponding to the Group's risk class to be taken into account.\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  floating-rate  debt  is  a  reasonable approximation of its fair value.\n\nMedium- and long-term borrowings and debt are recorded under Non-current liabilities. Short-term borrowings and debt as  well  as  the  current  portion  of  medium-  and  long-term borrowings and debt are presented under Current liabilities .\n\n## 9.1. Borrowings and debt\n\nThe  Group  takes  out  bank  loans  to  cover  its  medium-term financing needs and issues short-term marketable instruments in  France  and  commercial  paper  in  the  US  to  cover  its\n\nfinancing  needs  in  the  short  term.  None  of  the  Group's borrowings or debt contains an early repayment clause linked to financial ratios (covenants).\n\n## Cash and cash equivalent\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  in  bank accounts,  units  of  cash  unit  trusts  and  liquid  short-term investments with a negligible risk of changes in value and a maturity  date  of  less  than  three  months  at  the  date  of acquisition.\n\nInvestments  in  shares  and  cash,  which  are  held  in  an account  blocked  for  more  than  three  months,  cannot  be recorded  under  cash  and  are  presented  under Other current assets .\n\nBank overdrafts considered to be financing are presented in Current borrowings and debt .\n\nThe money-market unit trusts are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. As such, they are valued in  the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value  at  the  closing date.  Any  related  unrealised  gains  are  accounted  for  in Finance costs, Net in the income statement .\n\nThe  carrying  amount  of  bank  deposits  is  a  reasonable approximation of their fair value.\n\n## Non-current financial assets\n\nNon-current  financial  assets  include  investments  in  nonconsolidated companies and long-term loans and receivables maturing after more than 12 months.\n\nInvestments in non-consolidated companies are classified as financial  assets  at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive income.  As  such,  they  are  valued  on  the  basis  of  their  fair value,  and  unrealised  losses  and  gains  are  accounted  for through equity on the line Other comprehensive income .\n\nThe fair value of listed securities is determined on the basis of the share price at the closing date. For unlisted securities, in the  absence  of  specific  events,  their  acquisition  cost  is deemed to be the best possible estimate of fair value.\n\nLong-term  loans  and  receivables  are  considered  to  be assets generated by the business. As such, they are valued at amortised cost. If there is an indication of a loss in value, a provision for impairment is recorded.",

Derivatives and exposure to market risks\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nDerivative  instruments  entered  into  to  hedge  identifiable foreign exchange and interest rate risks are accounted for in accordance with hedge accounting principles.\n\nForward foreign exchange contracts and options are put in place  in  order  to  hedge  items  recorded  in  the  balance sheet (fair value hedges) and cash flows on highly probable future commercial transactions (cash flow hedges).\n\nAll foreign exchange hedging instruments are recorded on the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  including  those which relate to purchases and sales in the next accounting period.  Hence  changes in  the  fair  value  of  these  hedging instruments is recorded as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 changes  in  the  market  value  linked  to  variations  in  the time value of forwards used as hedges are recognised in equity  and the amount accumulated in equity impacts the income statement at the date on which the hedged transactions are completed;\n- \u00b7 changes  in  the  market  value  linked  to  variations  in  the spot rate between the inception of the hedge and the closing  date  are  charged  to  equity,  and  the  amount accumulated  in  equity  impacts  income  statements  at the  date  on  which  the  transactions  hedged  are completed.  Any  remaining  hedge  ineffectiveness  is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nIn accordance with hedge accounting, unrealised exchange gains and losses relating to unsold inventories are deferred  in  the  inventories  item  in  the  balance  sheet. Similarly, if a currency hedge has been taken out in respect of fixed assets purchased with foreign currency, these assets are  valued  in  the  balance  sheet  on  the  basis  of  the hedging rate.\n\nThe  Group  may  decide  to  hedge  certain  investments  in foreign  companies.  Exchange  gains  or  losses  relating  to these hedges are directly charged to consolidated equity, under the item Cumulative translation adjustments.\n\nWith regard to interest rate risk, fixed-rate debt and financial loans  hedged  by  interest  rate swaps are  valued  in  the balance  sheet  at  their  market  value.  Changes  in  the  fair value  of  these  items  are  recorded  as  finance  costs  and offset  by  adjustments  to  the  fair  value  of  the  related hedging derivatives. Floating-rate debt and financial loans are valued at cost, which corresponds to their market value. The swaps or caps which hedge these items are valued in the  balance  sheet  at  their  market  value,  with  changes  in value  recorded  directly  through  equity  on  the Other comprehensive income item.\n\nThe  fair  value  of  interest  rate  derivative  instruments  is  their market  value.  This  market  value  is  calculated  by  the discounted cash flow method at the interest rate effective at the closing date.\n\nTo manage its exposure to currency and interest rate risks arising in the course of its normal operations, the Group uses derivatives negotiated with counterparties rated investment grade.\n\nIn accordance with Group rules, currency and interest rate derivatives are set up exclusively for hedging purposes.\n\n## 10.1. Hedging of currency risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  currency  risk  on  commercial transactions  recorded  on  the  balance  sheet  and  on  highly probable future transactions.\n\nThe Group's policy regarding its exposure to currency risk on future commercial transactions is to hedge, before the end of the  year,  a  large  part  of  the  currency  risk  for  the  following year,  using  derivatives  based  on  operating  budgets  in  each subsidiary.\n\nAll  the  Group's  future  foreign  currency  flows  are  analysed  in detailed  forecasts  for  the  coming  budgetary  year.  Any currency  risks  identified  are  hedged  by  forward  contracts  or options  in  order  to  reduce  as  far  as  possible  the  currency exposure  of  each  subsidiary.  The  term  of  the  derivatives  is aligned with the Group's settlements. Exchange  rate derivatives are negotiated by FINVAL or, in exceptional cases, directly  by  the  Group's  subsidiaries.  Such  transactions  are supervised by the Group's Treasury department.\n\nAs  a  non-financial  corporation,  FINVAL  is  subject  to  the European  Market  Infrastructure  Regulations  (EMIR).  Published by  the  European  Commission  in  September  2012,  EMIR  is aimed at moving OTC markets towards a centralised model, thereby  enhancing  market  transparency  and  regulatory oversight  and  decreasing  systemic  risk  using  a  guarantee mechanism.  As  the  Group's  companies  must  borrow  and invest their cash in their own currency, the exchange rate risks generated by managing their own cash and debt are almost non-existent.\n\nOwing to the Group's policy of currency risk hedging a large part of annual requirements for the following year before the end  of  the  current  year,  the  sensitivity  of  profit  or  loss  to changes  in  foreign  exchange  rates  at  31  December  is marginal. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the  foreign  exchange  cash  flow  hedges  reserve  is  described in note 11.3.",

Foreign exchange gains and losses\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from the difference between the value of foreign currency operating income and expenses translated at the spot rate effective on the transaction date and at the exchange rate effective on the settlement date are recognised directly on the appropriate income and expense lines, after allowing for hedging derivatives.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses break down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                              |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Time value                              |  -70.5 |  -87.6 | -126.9 |\n| Other foreign exchange gains and losses |   17.7 |   94   |  -63.2 |\n| TOTAL                                   |  -52.8 |    6.4 | -190.1 |\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated at the spot rate at the transaction date.\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign  currencies  have been  translated  using  the  exchange  rates  effective  at  the closing date. Foreign exchange gains and losses also include the following items relating to derivative instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 changes in market value linked to variations in the spot rate between the inception of the hedge and the date when the hedged transactions are completed;\n- \u00b7 residual  ineffectiveness  linked  to  excess  hedges  and recognised  directly  in  the  income  statement  under  other foreign exchange  gains  and  losses  for  \u20ac1.5  million, \u20ac13.3  million  and  -\u20ac9.2  million  in  2021,  2020  and  2019, respectively.\n\nThese  amounts  are  allocated  to  the  appropriate  operating expense items. They are broken down as follows:\n\n| \u20ac millions                                   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Cost of sales                                |  -37.2 |    6.4 | -161.9 |\n| Research and innovation expenses             |   -4.2 |   -2.1 |   16.5 |\n| Advertising and promotion expenses           |   -5.9 |    1.2 |  -25.5 |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses |   -5.5 |    0.9 |  -19.3 |\n| FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES            |  -52.8 |    6.4 | -190.1 |\n\n## 10.3. Hedging of interest rate risk\n\nThe Group did not have any interest rate hedging instruments at 31 December 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## 10.4. Sensitivity to changes in interest rates\n\nAn increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have had a direct negative impact of -\u20ac18.2 million on the Group's net finance costs at 31 December 2021, compared with a direct positive  impact  of  \u20ac56.4  million  at  31  December  2020  and  a direct  positive  impact  of  \u20ac45.3  million  at  31  December  2019. This calculation  allows  for  cash,  cash  equivalents  and derivatives,  and  assumes  that  total  net  debt/cash  remains stable  and  that  fixed-rate  debt  at  maturity  is  replaced  by floating-rate debt.\n\nThe impact of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates on the fair value  of  the  Group's  fixed-rate  financial  assets  and  liabilities, after  allowing  for  any  interest  rate  derivatives,  can  be estimated at -\u20ac1 million at 31 December 2021 compared with -\u20ac1.0 million at 31 December  2020  and  -\u20ac0.9  million 31 December 2019.\n\n## 10.5. Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group has financial relations with international banks rated investment  grade  by  specialised  agencies.  The  Group  thus considers that its exposure to counterparty risk is low.\n\nFurthermore,  the  financial  instruments  used  to  manage exchange  rate  and  interest  rate  risk  are  issued  by  leading international banking counterparties.\n\n## 10.6. Liquidity risk\n\nThe  Group's  liquidity  risk  can  be  assessed  on  the  basis  of  its outstanding  short-term  debt  under  its  short-term  marketable instruments  programme.  Should  these  bank  facilities  not  be renewed,  the  Group  would  have  confirmed  undrawn  credit lines  of  \u20ac5,000  million  at  31  December  2021.  These  lines  were not subject to any covenants.\n\n## 10.7. Shareholding risk\n\nNo cash has been invested in shares.\n\nAvailable cash is invested with top-ranking financial institutions in  the  form  of  non-speculative  instruments  which  can  be drawn in very short periods. At 31 December 2021, marketable securities consist exclusively of unit trusts (note 9.2).\n\nAt  31  December  2021,  the  Group  held  118,227,307  Sanofi shares for an amount of \u20ac10,472.6 million (note 9.3.). A change of plus or minus 10% in the market price of these shares relative to  the  market  price  of  \u20ac88.58  on  31  December  2021  would have an impact of plus or minus \u20ac1,047.3 million before tax on Group equity.\n\nThe initial share price for Sanofi shares was \u20ac34.12.\n\nThe shares are valued based on their fair value, and unrealised losses  and  gains  are  accounted  for  through  equity  in  the Other comprehensive income item.",

A change of plus or minus 10% in the market price of these shares relative to  the  market  price  of  \u20ac89.62  on  31  December  2019  would have an impact of plus or minus \u20ac1,059.5 million before tax on Group equity.\n\nNotes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 10.8.

Offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities resulting from foreign exchange and/or interest rate hedging transactions entered into with the Group's  counterparty  banks  are  not  offset  in  the  balance sheet since they are FBF (French Banking Federation) or ISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) agreements that only provide for offsetting in the event of default by one of  the  parties  to  the  agreement.  Accordingly,  they  do  not meet the offsetting criteria set out in IAS 32.\n\nHad  the  agreements  been  offset  at  the  level  of  each counterparty bank, assets and liabilities would have decreased  by  \u20ac62.7  million,  \u20ac75.5  million  and  \u20ac48.8  million respectively in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n5",

Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\n## Accounting principles\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  set  up  to  cover probable outflows for the benefit of third parties without any equivalent  consideration  being  received  by  the  Group  in return.  They  mainly  relate  to  restructuring  costs,  industrial, environmental  and  commercial  risks  relating  to  operations such as breach  of  contract, product returns, and employee-related risks.\n\nThese provisions are estimated on the basis of the most likely assumptions or by using statistical  methods, depending on the nature of the risks.\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recorded  either  as Non-current liabilities or  as Current liabilities ,  depending on their type. Provisions for liabilities or disputes which must be settled  within  12  months  of  the  closing  date,  and  those linked  to  the  normal  operating  cycle  (such  as  product returns), are recorded as Current liabilities .  Other provisions for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recorded  as Non-current liabilities .\n\n## 12.1.1.

In  light  of changes in market practices and a favourable change in the opinion  of  its  advisers,  since  1  January  2018  L'Or\u00e9al  has recognised the IPI collected under income and the provision that had been funded was accordingly reversed in 2018.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding  the indirect  IPI  tax  for  financial  years  2008  and  2011  to  2015 totalling  \u20ac523.9  million,  including  interest  and  penalties.  The Brazilian tax authorities are questioning the ex-works sales price to  the  commercial  arm  used  to  calculate  the  IPI  tax  base. After consulting with its tax advisors, L'Or\u00e9al considers that the Brazilian tax  authorities'  position  is  unfounded  and  has challenged these notices. L'Or\u00e9al continues its legal proceedings with the tax and legal authorities.\n\nIn  light  of  the  negative  developments  in  administrative  court decisions  on  the  same  matter  for  other  Brazilian  groups, L'Or\u00e9al  funded  a  provision  for  \u20ac35  million  to  partially  cover this risk.\n\n## India - Advertising, marketing and promotional costs challenged\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  received  several  tax  reassessment  notices  regarding financial years 2007/08  to  2017/18  for  the  most  part concerning the tax deductibility of advertising, marketing and promotional  expenses  for  a  total  amount  of  \u20ac202.4  million including  interest  and  penalties.  After  consulting  with  its  tax advisors,  L'Or\u00e9al  decided  to  contest  these  notices  and continues  the  legal  proceedings  with  the  administrative  and legal authorities.\n\n## Mutual agreement procedures\n\nMutual  agreement  procedures  were  instigated  vis-\u00e0-vis  the Italian,  French,  Spanish,  Indonesian  and  Singaporean  tax authorities  in  order  to  eliminate  double  taxation  following disagreements between these authorities.\n\n## 12.2.2. Investigations carried out by the competition authorities\n\nThe  national  competition  authorities  in  several  European countries have launched investigations targeting the cosmetics industry in particular.\n\n5",

L'Or\u00e9al Hellas refuted all allegations of having  engaged  in  anti-competitive  practices  with  other luxury  cosmetics  manufacturers.  The  Greek  Administrative Court of Appeal quashed this decision on 5 November 2018. The  Greek  competition  authority  lodged  an  appeal  in cassation  against  this  decision  on  28  January  2019  and  a hearing before the Council of State, which was postponed on numerous  occasions,  was  finally  held  on  17  November  2020. The  decision  should  be  handed  down  during  the  first-half of 2022.\n\nIn  Germany,  after  the  German  competition  authority  filed  a lawsuit  in  2008  in  the  area  of  personal  care  products,  which was  definitively  closed  in  2015,  distributors  filed  a  lawsuit seeking damages against L'Or\u00e9al Germany which has resulted in dismissals by the courts at this stage. These proceedings are still ongoing. L'Or\u00e9al Germany is contesting the merits of these claims and denies that any damages occurred.\n\n## b) France\n\nIn  France,  on  18  December  2014,  the  French  competition authority handed down a fine of \u20ac189.5 million against L'Or\u00e9al in  the  hygiene  products  sector  for  events  that  took  place  in the early 2000s. On 27 October 2016, the Paris Court of Appeal upheld this first instance decision. L'Or\u00e9al refutes all accusations  of  concerted  practices  with  its  competitors  and regrets that the French competition authority did not take into\n\naccount  the  highly  competitive  French  market  in  household and  hygiene  products  as  illustrated  by  the  number  of manufacturers and retailers present on the market, the large choice  of  products  available  to  consumers,  and  the  high degree of innovation and number of product launches.\n\nFollowing an appeal lodged by L'Or\u00e9al, on 27 March 2019, the Court  of  Cassation  partially  overturned  the  ruling  relating  to the amount of the fine imposed on L'Or\u00e9al. On 18 June 2020, the  Second Court of Appeal confirmed the initial amount of the  fine.  L'Or\u00e9al  lodged  a  second  appeal  with  the  Court  of Cassation  against  this  ruling.  The  decision  should  be  handed down during the first-half of 2022.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  since  the  appeal  and  Cassation appeal  do  not  entail  a  stay  in  the  judgement,  the  fine provisioned at the end of 2014 was paid on 28 April 2015.\n\n- At  31  December  2021,  the  provision  was  maintained  in liabilities and the payment recognised in Other current assets .\n\nFollowing this ruling, the distributors filed lawsuits for damages against  L'Or\u00e9al.  These  proceedings  are  in  initial  stages  or resulted in dismissals by the courts. These proceedings are still ongoing.  L'Or\u00e9al  contests  the  merits  of  these  claims  and denies that any damages occurred.\n\nA provision has been set aside for all disputes still in progress at 31  December  2021  amounting  to  \u20ac189.5  million  at  year-end unchanged from the provision at end-2020 and end-2019.\n\nAt  the  present  time,  no  other  exceptional  events  or  disputes are  highly  likely  to  have  a  material  impact  on  the  earnings, financial situation, assets, or operations of the Company or the L'Or\u00e9al Group.",

        "page_content": "Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## NOTE 13. Sustainable development and the climate\n\n## 13.1. Measurement of assets and liabilities\n\n## a) Environmental risks\n\nThe Group strictly complies with regulations and laws relating to  environmental  protection,  and  does  not  expect  current regulations  to  have  any  significant  impact  on  the  Group's operations, financial position, earnings or assets.\n\n## b) Mea surement of assets\n\nFor  many  years,  L'Or\u00e9al  has  shown  a  strong  commitment  to environmental,  social  and  societal  responsibility.  L'Or\u00e9al placed  sustainability  at  the  heart  of  its  strategy,  with  the launch in 2013 of the Sharing Beauty With All programme with 2020  targets  focused  on  sustainable  production,  sustainable innovation, sustainable consumption and shared growth.\n\nIn  June  2020,  L'Or\u00e9al  initiated  the  second  phase  of  its commitments to sustainable development, under the umbrella of  the  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme,  with  a  new  set  of particularly  ambitious and concrete targets for 2030, in order to  cover  all  the  impacts  associated  with  its  value  chain:  its production and distribution sites as well as its supply chains and the impacts  associated  with  the  use  of  products  by consumers.\n\n## For example:\n\n- \u00b7 the  Group  undertakes  to  reach  carbon  neutrality  for  all Group  sites  by  2025,  by  improving  energy  efficiency  and using 100% renewable energy;\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  100%  of  ingredients  in  formulas  and  biobased packaging  materials  will  be  traceable  and  come  from sustainable  sources.  None  of  them  will  contribute  to deforestation;\n- \u00b7 by 2030, 100% of the plastics used in packaging will be from either recycled or biobased sources;\n- \u00b7 by  2030,  L'Or\u00e9al  undertakes  to  innovate  to  enable  its consumers to reduce by 25%, on average and per finished product,  the  water  consumption  and  greenhouse  gas emissions  linked  to  the  use  of  its  products,  compared  to 2016.\n\nThe  above  commitments do not jeopardise the value of the Group's assets or the useful lives of our non-financial assets. In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 our  ongoing  efforts  to  bring  our  products  in  line  with consumer  demand  as  part  of  L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  are included  in  the  Group's  short-term  strategic  plans  used  in impairment  tests  on  intangible  assets  with  an  indefinite useful life;\n- \u00b7 to date, the adaptation of our plants and product formulas has  not  led  us  to  identify  any  risk  of  our  production  lines becoming  obsolete  or  experiencing  a  reduction  in  their value in use .\n\n## 13.2. Financing and investment\n\nThe Group's L'Or\u00e9al for the Future programme rests on its financing and short- and long-term investment strategies.\n\n## a) Financing\n\nThe credit lines indexed to the Group's sustainable development  performance  incorporate  a  borrowing  cost adjustment mechanism.\n\nThe  L'Or\u00e9al  Group  has  a  syndicated  loan  from  20  banks (\u20ac5 billion), which had not been used at the end of December 2021. This loan incorporates a mechanism whereby the margin is  adjusted  in  line  with  the  Group's  performance  with  regard to  four  ESG  KPIs:  climate,  biodiversity,  resources  and  social commitment.\n\n## b) Short-term investment\n\nThe  Group's  available  cash  is  mainly  invested  in  SRI  SICAV money-market  funds.  Investment  in  these  types  of  SICAV accounted for 70% of all short-term investment in 2021.\n\n## c) Long-term investment\n\nThe  Group  recorded  a  total  of  \u20ac139  million  in  non-current financial assets related to sustainable development activities, measured at fair value through equity (see note 9.3).\n\n- \u00b7 at  the  end  of  2021,  investment  in  the Circular  Innovation Fund amounting  to  \u20ac50  million.  L'Or\u00e9al  is  one  of  the  main\n\ncontributors to this impact investing fund, whose investment thesis  is  focused  on  the  circular  economy,  structured around seven verticals including new packaging materials and  solutions  from  the  bioeconomy  and  the  circular economy,  green  technology  and  waste  and  recycling collection services;\n\n- \u00b7 in  2020, the creation of a fund for Nature Regeneration to financially support projects to restore natural marine, forest and agricultural ecosystems. This dedicated \u20ac50 million fund had already invested in three projects at the end of 2021 (creation of a Blue Carbon Facility, a reforestation project in Colombia  and  a  pan-European  project  to  reintroduce biodiversity);\n- \u00b7 investment  in  start-ups  (\u20ac39  million  in  total),  including  the Swiss environmental technology firm Gjosa, which developed  innovative  water  saving  solutions, the  French biotech company Global Bioenergies, which developed a process  to  convert  plant-based  resources,  and  the  green chemistry  start-up  Carbios,  which  developed  enzymatic processes for plastic biodegradation and biorecycling.\n\n5",

STATUTORY AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## (For the year ended 31 December 2021)\n\nThis  is  a  free  translation  into  English  of  the  Statutory  Auditors'  report  issued  in  French  and  is  provided  solely  for  the  convenience of  English  speaking  readers.  This  report  includes  information  specifically  required  by  European  regulations  or  French  law,  such as  information  about  the  appointment  of  Statutory  Auditors.  This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## L'OR\u00c9AL\n\n14, rue Royale\n\n75008 Paris, France\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  Annual  General  Meeting , we  have  audited  the  accompanying consolidated financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  consolidated  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  and  of  the  financial position  of  the  Group  at  31  December  2021  and  of  the  results  of  its  operations  for  the  year  then  ended  in  accordance  with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  these  standards  are  further  described  in  the  'Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code ( Code  de  commerce )  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  ( Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie )  for  Statutory  Auditors,  for  the  period  from 1 January 2021 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014.\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been  prepared  and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt  is  in  this  complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial Code relating to the justification of our assessments, we inform you of the key audit matters relating to the risks of material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgement,  were  the  most  significant  in  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed as part of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n5",

        "page_content": ".\n\n## 2021 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Description of risk\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\n## Measurement of intangible assets\n\nSee Note 7.1 - Goodwill, Note 7.2 - Other intangible assets, Note 7.3 - Impairment tests on intangible assets, and Note 4 - Other operational income and expenses, to the consolidated financial statements\n\nAt  31  December 2021, the net carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible  assets  recognised  in  the  consolidated  financial  statements totalled \u20ac14,537 million, representing 34% of assets. These assets consist primarily  of  goodwill  and  non-amortised  brands  with  indefinite  useful lives, recognised following business combinations.\n\nWhenever there is an indication of impairment, or at least once a year, the Group verifies that the carrying amount of these assets is not greater than  their  recoverable  amount  and  does  not  present  a  risk  of impairment (impairment test).\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  each  Cash  Generating  Unit  (CGU)  is determined  on  the  basis  of  discounted  operating  future  cash  flow forecasts  covering  a  period  of  10  years  (the  period  considered necessary for the strategic positioning of an acquisition) and a terminal value.  The  main  assumptions  taken  into  account  in  the  measurement of the recoverable amount concern:\n\n- \u25cf growth in sales and margin rate;\n- \u25cf a perpetual growth rate for calculating the terminal value; and\n- \u25cf discount  rates  based  on  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital, where necessary adjusted by a country risk premium.\n\nThe impairment tests performed led to the recognition of an impairment loss  of  \u20ac338  million  in  2021,  including  \u20ac255  million  on  the  goodwill  of  IT Cosmetics.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of these assets to be a key audit matter because  of  their  relative  materiality  in  the  consolidated  financial statements  and  because  the  calculation  of  their  recoverable  amount requires  a  high  degree  of  judgement  from  Management  in  terms  of projecting  future  cash  flows  and  determining  the  main  assumptions  to be used.\n\nWe  obtained  the  impairment  tests  and  sensitivity  analyses  prepared by  Management.  We  assessed  the  sensitivity  analyses,  in  particular by  comparing  them  to  our  own  sensitivity  analyses,  to  determine  the nature and scope of our procedures.\n\nWe assessed, in particular, the quality of the process for drawing up and approving budgets and forecasts and, for the impairment tests that we deemed the most sensitive,  the  reasonableness  of  the  main  estimates made and, more specifically:\n\n- \u25cf the consistency of sales and margin rate projections with the Group's past performance and the economic and financial context in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf the  corroboration  of  the  growth  rates  used  with  analyses  of  the performance  of  the  global  cosmetics  market,  taking  into  account specific  features  of  the  local  markets  and  distribution  channels  in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf the discount rates applied to future cash flows, by comparing their inputs  with  external  references,  with  the  guidance  of  our  valuation experts;\n- \u25cf the analyses of the sensitivity of the recoverable amount to the key main  assumptions  used,  as  described  by  Management  in  Note  7.3 to the consolidated financial statements, and to our own analyses.\n\nWe verified the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of provisions for liabilities and charges (excluding provisions for product returns), non-current tax liabilities and contingent liabilities\n\nSee  Note  6  -  Income  tax  and  Note  12  -  Provisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  -  Contingent  liabilities  and  material  ongoing  disputes,  to  the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Group is exposed to various risks arising in the ordinary course of its business, particularly tax risks, industrial, environmental and commercial risks  relating  to  operations  (excluding  provisions  for  product  returns), employee-related cost risks and risks related to antitrust investigations.\n\nWhen  the  amount  or  due  date  of  a  liability  can  be  estimated  with sufficient reliability, provisions are recorded for these risks. When this is not the case, the Group provides disclosures on contingent liabilities in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe contingent liabilities and material ongoing disputes reported in Note 12.2.1 include tax disputes in Brazil and India, for which the tax authorities are claiming \u20ac524 million and \u20ac202 million, respectively.\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  (excluding  provisions  for  product returns)  amounted  to  \u20ac881  million,  and  non-current  tax  liabilities  to \u20ac345 million at 31 December 2021.\n\nWe deemed the determination and measurement of these items to be a key audit matter given:\n\n- \u25cf the  high  degree  of  judgement  required  from  Management  to determine  which  risks  should  be  provisioned  and  measure  with sufficient reliability the amounts of these provisions;\n- \u25cf the  potentially  material  impact  of  these  provisions  on  the  Group's profit.\n\nIn  order  to  identify  and  gain  an  understanding  of  all  of  the  existing disputes and liabilities as well as the corresponding judgements made, we made inquiries with General Management and the Legal and Tax Departments at all levels of the organisation, in France and abroad. We corroborated the list of identified disputes with the Group's risk mapping, as  presented  by  the  Legal  Department  to  the  Audit  Committee,  and the information provided by the principal law firms acting for the Group, which we interviewed on the matters.\n\nRegarding  the  most  significant  disputes  for  which  a  provision  was recorded, we assessed the quality of Management's estimates by taking into  consideration  the  data,  assumptions  and  calculations  used.  We carried out a retrospective review by comparing the amounts paid out with the provisions recorded in recent years.\n\nWith  the  guidance  of  our  experts  in  the  field  where  applicable,  we carried out the following procedures:\n\n- \u25cf we examined the procedural aspects and/or the legal or technical opinions  prepared  by  the  lawyers  or  external  experts  selected  by Management in order to assess the merits of the decision to record a provision;\n- \u25cf on the basis of the information provided to us, we critically assessed the estimated ranges of risk level and verified that the measurements used by Management fall within these ranges;\n- \u25cf when appropriate, we verified the consistency of the methods used for these assessments.\n\nRegarding contingent liabilities, with the guidance of our experts in the field  where  applicable,  we  examined  the  procedural  aspects  and/or the  legal  or  technical  opinions  prepared  by  the  lawyers  or  external experts  selected  by  Management  in  order  to  assess  the  merits  of  the decision not to record a provision.\n\nWe verified the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Description of risk\n\n## How our audit addressed this risk\n\n## Recognition of sales - estimation of items to be deducted from sales\n\nSee Note 3 - Accounting principles - Sales, to the consolidated financial statements\n\nSales incentives, discounts and product returns are deducted from sales, as  are  incentives  granted  to  distributors  or  consumers,  such  as commercial cooperation, coupons, discounts and loyalty programs.\n\nThese various deductions are recorded simultaneously to the recognition of sales, based mainly on statistics compiled from past experience and contractual conditions.\n\nWe deemed estimating these amounts at the reporting date to be both difficult  (due  to  the  range  of  contracts  and  contractual  conditions prevalent in the Group's different markets) and sensitive (sales are a key indicator  in  the  assessment  of  the  performance  of  the  Group  and  its Management),  and  to  have  a  material  impact  in  the  financial statements.\n\nAccordingly, these estimates constitute a key audit matter given the risk that  product  returns,  sales  incentives,  discounts  and  other  incentives granted to customers (distributors or consumers) are not fully catalogued and/or  properly  measured  and  thus  that  sales  are  not  accounted  for correctly and/or in the appropriate reporting period.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the accounting policies applied by the  Group  with  respect  to  the  recognition  of  product  returns,  sales incentives,  discounts  and  other  incentives  granted  to  customers,  with respect to IFRS.\n\nWe familiarized ourselves with the internal control systems implemented by  the  Group's  commercial  entities,  with  a  view  to  measuring  and accounting for items deducted from sales, especially at the end of the reporting period, and we tested, on a sample basis, the main controls of those systems.\n\nWe also carried out substantive tests on representative samples in order to  ascertain  whether  product  returns,  sales  incentives,  discounts  and other incentives granted to customers were being estimated correctly. Our tests consisted primarily in:\n\n- \u25cf assessing  the  appropriateness  of  valuation  methods,  in  particular through a critical assessment of the assumptions used, verification of the  consistency  of  the  methods,  and  analysis  of  the  unwinding  of provisions from the previous year;\n- \u25cf reconciling  the  statistics  compiled  from  past  experience  and contractual  conditions  with  the  data  contained  in  the  IT  systems dedicated to the management of commercial conditions;\n- \u25cf verifying  the  calculation  of  the  corresponding  expenses  (including the  residual  commitment  at  the  end  of  the  reporting  period)  and how  they  are  recorded  in  the  accounting  system  and  presented in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nAs required by legal and regulatory provisions and in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, we have also verified the information pertaining to the Group presented in the Board of Directors' management report.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe attest that the information pertaining to the Group presented in the management report includes the consolidated non-financial performance statement required under Article L.225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code. However, in accordance with Article L.823-10 of the French Commercial Code, we have not verified the fair presentation and consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information given in that statement, which will be the subject of a report by an independent third party.\n\n## Other verifications and information pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial report\n\nIn accordance with professional standards applicable to the Statutory Auditors' procedures for annual and consolidated financial statements presented according to the European single electronic reporting format, we have verified that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial report referred to in paragraph I of Article L.451-1-2 of the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  ( Code  mon\u00e9taire  et  financier )  and  prepared  under  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's responsibility,  complies  with  this  format,  as  defined  by  European  Delegated  Regulation  No.  2019/815  of  17  December  2018. As  it  relates  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  our  work  included  verifying  that  the  tagging  in  the  financial  statements complies with the format defined by the aforementioned Regulation.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic reporting format.\n\nIt  is  not  our  responsibility  to  ensure  that  the  consolidated  financial  statements  to  be  included  by  the  Company  in  the  annual financial report filed with the French Financial Markets Authority - AMF correspond to those on which we carried out our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed Statutory Auditors of L'Or\u00e9al by the Annual General Meeting of 29 April 2004.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s were in the eighteenth consecutive year of their engagement.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial statements\n\nManagement  is  responsible  for  preparing  consolidated  financial  statements  giving  a  true  and  fair  view  in  accordance  with International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  as  adopted  by  the  European  Union  and  for  implementing  the  internal  control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n5",

        "page_content": "- 5 . 2021 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Statutory Auditors' report on the consolidated financial statements\n\nIn  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  Management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's  ability  to  continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems, as well  as,  where  applicable,  any  internal  audit  systems,  relating  to  accounting  and  financial  reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of  assurance,  but  is  not  a  guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the  aggregate,  they  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic  decisions  taken  by  users  on  the  basis  of  these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit.\n\n## They also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify  and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design  and  perform  audit  procedures  in  response  to  those  risks,  and  obtain  audit  evidence  considered  to  be  sufficient  and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  made  by Management and the related disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assess the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained,  whether  a  material  uncertainty  exists  related  to  events  or  conditions  that  may  cast  significant  doubt  on  the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory  Auditors  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  they  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or are inadequate, to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assess whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence  regarding  the  financial  information  of  the  entities  or  business  activities  within  the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The Statutory Auditors are responsible for the management, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated financial statements and for the opinion expressed thereon.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors. Where appropriate, we discuss any risks to our independence and the related safeguard measures with the Audit Committee.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, 18 February 2022 The Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nAnne-Claire FERRI\u00c9\n\nDeloitte & Associ\u00e9s David DUPONT-NOEL",

Sales\n\nThese  are  comprised  of  sales  of  goods  (net  of  returns  from distributors and rebates and discounts) and services (including technological assistance fees).\n\n## 1.2. Advertising and promotion expenses\n\nExpenses  relating  to  the  advertisement  and  promotion  of products  to  customers  and  consumers  are  recognised  as expenses  for  the  year  in  which  the  advertisement  or promotional initiative takes place.\n\n## 1.3. Research and innovation costs\n\nResearch and innovation costs are recognised in expenses in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## 1.4. Income tax\n\nThe  Company  has  opted  for  the  French  tax  group  regime. French companies included in the scope of tax consolidation recognise an income tax charge in their own accounts on the basis of their own taxable profits and losses.\n\nL'Or\u00e9al, as the parent company of the tax group, recognises as  tax  income  the  difference  between  the  aggregate  tax charges recognised by the subsidiaries and the tax due on the basis of consolidated taxable profit or loss of the tax group.\n\n## 1.5. Intangible assets\n\nIntangible  assets  are  recorded  in  the  balance  sheet  at purchase cost, including acquisition costs.\n\nTechnical  merger  losses  are  allocated  to  the  corresponding underlying assets and amortised where appropriate.\n\nThe value of newly acquired trademarks is calculated based on  a  multi-criteria  approach  taking  into  consideration  their reputation and their future contribution to profits.\n\nIn  accordance with regulation No. 2004-06 on assets, certain trademarks  have  been  identified  as  amortisable  regarding their estimated useful life.\n\nNon-amortisable trademarks are tested for impairment at least once a year on the basis of the valuation model used at the time  of  their  acquisition.  An  impairment  is  recorded  where appropriate.  Initial  trademark  registration  costs  are  recorded as expenses.\n\nPatents are amortised over a period ranging from 2 to 10 years.\n\nBusiness goodwill is not amortised. It is impaired whenever the present value of future cash flows is less than the book value. Business goodwill is subject to impairment tests at least once a year, even when there is no evidence of an impairment loss.\n\nSoftware of material value is  amortised  using  the  straight-line method  over  its  probable  useful  life,  generally  between five and eight years. It is also subject to accelerated tax-driven amortisation, which is recognised over a 12-month period.\n\nOther intangible assets are usually amortised over periods not exceeding 20 years.\n\nNotes to the financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al SA\n\n## 1.6. Tangible assets\n\nTangible  assets  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost,  including acquisition expenses.\n\nThe useful lives of tangible assets are as follows:\n\n|                                    | Length      |\n|------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Buildings                          | 20-50 years |\n| Fixtures and fittings              | 5-10 years  |\n| Industrial machinery and equipment | 10 years    |\n| Other tangible assets              | 3-10 years  |\n\nBoth  straight-line and  declining-balance  depreciation  is calculated  over  the  actual  useful  lives  of  the  assets concerned. Exceptionally, industrial machinery and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over a period of 10 years, with all additional depreciation classified as accelerated tax-driven depreciation.\n\n## 1.7. Financial assets\n\n## 1.7.1. Investments\n\nThese items are recognised in the balance sheet at purchase cost excluding incidental expenses.\n\nTheir value is assessed annually by reference to their value in use,  which  is  mainly  based  on  the  current  and  forecast profitability  of  the  subsidiary  concerned  and  the  share  of equity  owned.  If  the  value  in  use  falls  below  the  net  book value, an impairment is recognised.\n\n## 1.7.2. Other financial assets\n\nLoans  and  other  receivables  are  valued  at  their  nominal amount. Loans and other receivables denominated in foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at the  end  of  the  financial  year.  If  necessary,  impairments  are recognised against these items to reflect their value in use at the end of the financial year.\n\nTreasury shares acquired  in connection  with  buyback programmes to be cancelled is recognised in other long-term investments.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, other long-term investments are compared with their probable sale price and a provision for impairment recognised where appropriate.\n\n## 1.8. Inventories\n\nInventories  are  valued  using  the  weighted  average  cost method.\n\nAn  impairment  is  made  for  obsolete  and  slow-moving inventories on the basis of their probable net realisable value, estimated on the basis of historic and projected data.\n\n## 1.9. Trade accounts receivable and other receivables\n\nTrade  accounts  receivable  and  other  receivables  are recorded  at  their  nominal  value.  Where  appropriate,  an impairment is recognised based on an assessment of the risk of non-recovery.\n\n6",

Marketable securities cash and cash equivalents\n\nMarketable  securities  are  recognised  at  purchase  cost  and are valued at the end of the financial year at their probable sale price.\n\nTreasury shares held that is specifically allocated to employee stock option and free shares plans recognised in marketable securities.\n\nNo  discount  is  granted  on  the  exercise  price  of  the  options. Provided that the shares are purchased at a lower price than the  exercise  price,  no  impairment  is  required.  However, an impairment is recognised in the event of a decline in the market price,  representing  the  difference  between  the  book value  of  the  treasury  shares  and  the  average  share  price  in the month preceding the reporting date.\n\nA  provision  for  liabilities  and  charges  in  respect  of  shares  of Treasury  shares  allocated  to  free  share  plans  for  L'Or\u00e9al  S.A. parent  company  employees  is  recognised  over  the  period during  which  the  rights  to  the  free  shares  vest.  Shares  of Treasury shares allocated to free share plans for employees of Group  subsidiaries  are  written  down  in  full.  However,  the subsidiaries  concerned  will  bear  most  of  the  cost  of  granting these free shares.\n\n## 1.11. Provisions for liabilities and charges\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  are  recognised  to  cover probable outflows of resources to third parties, without receipt of  equivalent  consideration  by  the  Company.  They  relate mainly  to  commercial  and  financial  contingencies  and litigation (subsidiaries\u2026) and to Administration and employeerelated contingencies.\n\nThese provisions are estimated on the basis of the most likely assumptions  or  by  using  statistical  methods,  depending  on their type.\n\n## 1.12. Accounting for foreign currency transactions and exchange rate hedges\n\nAll receivables and  payables  denominated  in  foreign currencies  are  translated  at  the  exchange  rates  prevailing at the end of the financial year.\n\nExchange rate hedging instruments are contracted to hedge commercial transactions recognised in the balance sheet and future transactions that are considered to be highly probable. Gains  and  losses  generated  by  these  instruments  are recognised symmetrically with the gains and losses arising on the hedged items, in the same aggregate as profit and loss. Option  premium  income/discounts  are  recognised  in  profit and loss when the hedged item is recognised.\n\nDerivatives that are not designated as hedges are classified as isolated  open  positions.  These  are  recognised  at  their  fair value  in  the  balance  sheet,  and  offset  an  'Unrealised exchange gains or losses' account.\n\nTranslation  differences  on  operating  assets  and  liabilities  and related  hedging  instruments  are  also  recognised  in  the balance sheet as 'Unrealised exchange gains or losses'.\n\nA  provision  is  recognised  if  the  sum  of  these  unrealised exchange gains  and  losses  shows  a  potential  exchange  loss based  on  the  overall  exchange  position,  calculated  on  a currency-by-currency  basis.  The  overall  foreign  exchange position excludes translation differences of hedging instruments and hedged items.\n\nIn accordance  with  French  accounting  standards,  the potential  gain  resulting  from  the  overall  foreign  exchange position is not recognised as income in the income statement.\n\nHedges have already been taken out in respect of forecasted operating transactions for the next financial year. The impact of  such  hedges  on  profit  or  loss  will  be  recorded  during  the same accounting period as the transactions hedged.\n\n## 1.13. Accounting for interest rate instruments\n\nIn the case of interest-rate hedges, for gains and losses arising on  interest  rate  swaps  and  caps,  hedging  financial  liabilities are recorded on a pro rata basis symmetrically with the gains and losses on the items hedged.\n\n## 1.14. Employee retirement obligations and related benefits\n\nThe L'Or\u00e9al parent company  operates  pension,  early retirement  and  other  benefit  schemes  for  employees  and retirees depending  on  local  legislation  and  regulations. Directors  and  corporate  officers  are  regarded  as  employees for  all  additional  benefits  relating  to  their  remuneration,  and are  therefore  covered  by  the  same  employee  benefit schemes.\n\nThese obligations are partially funded by an external scheme where  the  funds  are  gradually  built  up  through  contributions paid.  The  contributions  are  expensed  as  incurred  under  the Other purchases and external charges item.\n\nThe  related  obligations  are  measured  using  an  actuarial valuation  method  based  on  final  salaries.  The  method  takes account  of  length  of  service,  life  expectancy,  turnover  by category  of  personnel  and  economic  assumptions  such  as inflation  and  discount  rates.  The  company  has  opted  for  the new method provided by recommendation ANC 2013-02 on the  accounting  treatment  of  pension  obligations  and  similar benefits as amended on 5 November 2021. That is to say, the increase  in  the  obligation  for  each  employee  is  no  longer recognised  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  his  or  her  term  of employment but straight-line only over the vesting period for his or her benefit rights.\n\nNo  provision  is  recognised  in  the  balance  sheet  for  net unfunded  obligations,  which  are  shown  in  off-balance  sheet commitments.\n\nOnly  obligations  in  respect  of  long-service  awards  are  no longer  recognised  as  an  off-balance  sheet  commitment; instead, a provision is recognised in the balance sheet based on an actuarial valuation of the obligation.",

This  report  includes  information  specifically  required  by  European  regulations  or  French  law,  such  as information  about  the  appointment  of  Statutory  Auditors.  This  report  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with,  and  construed  in accordance with, French law and professional auditing standards applicable in France.\n\n## L'Or\u00e9al\n\n14, rue Royale\n\n75008 Paris, France\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn  compliance  with  the  engagement  entrusted  to  us  by  your  Annual  General  Meeting , we  have  audited  the  accompanying financial statements of L'Or\u00e9al for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nIn  our  opinion,  the  financial  statements  give  a  true  and  fair  view  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  and  of  the  financial  position  of  the Company at 31 December 2021 and of the results of its operations for the year then ended in accordance with French accounting principles.\n\nThe audit opinion expressed above is consistent with our report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\n## Audit framework\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with professional standards applicable in France. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur  responsibilities  under  these  standards  are  further  described  in  the  'Statutory  Auditors'  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the Financial Statements' section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with the independence rules provided for in the French Commercial Code (Code  de  commerce)  and  the  French  Code  of  Ethics  (Code  de  d\u00e9ontologie)  for  Statutory  Auditors  for  the  period  from 1 January 2021 to the date of our report, and, in particular, we did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014\n\n## Justification of assessments - Key audit matters\n\nDue  to  the  global  crisis  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  financial  statements  of  this  period  have  been  prepared  and audited under specific conditions. Indeed, this crisis and the exceptional measures taken in the context of the state of sanitary emergency have had numerous consequences for companies, particularly on their operations and their financing, and have led to greater uncertainties on their future prospects. Those measures, such as travel restrictions and remote working, have also had an impact on the companies' internal organisation and the performance of the audits.\n\nIt  is  in  this  complex and evolving context that, in accordance with the requirements of Articles L.823-9 and R.823-7 of the French Commercial  Code  relating  to  the  justification  of  our  assessments,  we  inform  you  of  the  key  audit  matters  relating  to  the  risks of  material  misstatement  that,  in  our  professional  judgement,  were  the  most  significant  in  our  audit  of  the  financial  statements, as well as how we addressed those risks.\n\nThese matters were addressed as part of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on specific items of the financial statements.",

Investments and intangible assets are recognised at purchase cost.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the value in use of a given item falls below its net carrying amount.\n\n- \u25cf As  described  in  Notes  1.5  and  1.7  to  the  financial  statements,  the value of these items is assessed annually by reference to their value in use, which is based on:\n- \u25cf for investments: the current and forecast profitability of the subsidiary concerned and the share of equity owned;\n- \u25cf for intangible assets: discounted future cash flows.\n\nIn order to estimate the value in use of these items, Management must use  judgement  to  project  future  cash  flows  and  determine  the  main assumptions to be used.\n\nGiven the materiality of investments and intangible assets in the balance sheet  and  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  certain  components  of  the calculations, including the forecasts used to calculate value in use, we deemed  the  measurement  of  these  items  to  be  a  key  audit  matter, carrying a risk of material misstatement.\n\nWe examined the methodology employed by Management to estimate the  value  in  use  of  investments  and  intangible  assets  (excluding software and intangible assets in progress).\n\nOur  audit  work  consisted  primarily  in  verifying,  on  the  basis  of  the information  provided  to  us,  that  the  estimated  values  determined  by Management  were  based  on  an  appropriate  measurement  method, and  in  assessing  the  quality  of  these  estimates  by  taking  into consideration the data, assumptions and calculations used.\n\nWe primarily focused our audit work on the investments and intangible assets with a value in use close to their net carrying amount.\n\nWe  assessed  the  reasonableness  of  the  main  estimates  and,  more specifically:\n\n- \u25cf the  consistency  of  projected  sales  and  margin  rates  with  past performance and the economic and financial context;\n- \u25cf the  corroboration  of  the  growth  rates  used  with  analyses  of  the performance  of  the  global  cosmetics  market,  taking  into  account specific  features  of  the  local  markets  and  distribution  channels  in which the Group operates;\n- \u25cf the discount rates applied to future cash flows, by comparing their inputs  with  external  references,  with  the  guidance  of  our  valuation experts.\n\n## Measurement of provisions for liabilities and charges and contingent liabilities\n\nSee Accounting principles Note 1.11 - Provisions for liabilities and charges, Note 18 - Provisions for liabilities and charges (excluding subsidiaries and holdings) and Note 24.3 - Contingent liabilities, to the parent company financial statements\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  subject  to  legal  proceedings  and  tax,  customs  and administrative audits arising in the ordinary course of its business.\n\nProvisions  are  recorded  so  that  L'Or\u00e9al  can  meet  its  likely  payment obligations to third parties with no corresponding consideration for the Company in return. They mainly relate to business and financial risks and disputes,  as  well  as  risks  with  authorities  and  staff-related  risks.  These provisions  are  estimated  by  taking  into  account  the  most  likely assumptions or by using statistical methods based on their nature.\n\nMaterial provisions mainly concern the dispute with the antitrust authority and the risks with the authorities mentioned in Note 18.\n\nProvisions  for  liabilities  and  charges  amounted  to  \u20ac878  million  at  31 December 2021.\n\nWe deemed the determination and measurement of these items to be a key audit matter given:\n\nthe high degree of judgement required from Management to determine which risks  should  be  provisioned  and  measure  with  sufficient  reliability the amounts of these provisions;\n\nIn  order  to  identify  and  gain  an  understanding  of  all  of  the  existing disputes and liabilities as well as the corresponding judgements made, we made inquiries with General Management and the Legal and Tax Departments.  We  corroborated  the  list  of  identified  disputes  with  the Group's  risk  mapping,  as  presented  by  the  Legal  Department  to  the Audit  Committee,  and  the  information  provided  by  the  principal  law firms acting for L'Or\u00e9al SA, which we interviewed on the matters.\n\nRegarding  the  most  significant  disputes  for  which  a  provision  was recorded, we assessed the quality of Management's estimates by taking into  consideration  the  data,  assumptions  and  calculations  used.  We carried out a retrospective review by comparing the amounts paid out with the provisions recorded in recent years.\n\nWith  the  guidance  of  our  experts  in  the  field  where  applicable,  we carried out the following procedures:\n\n- \u25cf we examined the procedural aspects and/or the legal or technical opinions prepared by the lawyers or external experts selected by Management in order to assess the merits of the decision to record a provision;\n- \u25cf on the basis of the information provided to us, we critically assessed the estimated ranges of risk level and verified that the measurements used by Management fall within these ranges;\n- \u25cf when appropriate, we verified the consistency of the methods used for these assessments.\n\nRegarding contingent liabIilities, with the guidance of our experts in the field  where  applicable,  we  assessed  the  merits  of  the  decision  not  to record a provision.\n\n## PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n6",

Based on this work, we attest to the accuracy and fair presentation of this information.\n\nConcerning  the  information  given  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  Article  L.22-10-11  of  the  French  Commercial  Code relating to those items the Company has deemed liable to have an impact in the event of a takeover bid or exchange offer, we have verified its consistency with the underlying documents that were disclosed to us. Based on this work, we have no matters to report with regard to this information.\n\n## Other information\n\nIn  accordance  with  French  law,  we  have  verified  that  the  required  information  concerning  the  acquisition  of  investments  and controlling  interests  and  the  identity  of  the  shareholders  and  holders  of  the  voting  rights  has  been  properly  disclosed  in  the management report.\n\n6\n\n.",

        "page_content": "## Other verifications and information pursuant to legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the financial statements to be included in the annual financial report\n\nIn accordance with professional standards applicable to the Statutory Auditors' procedures for annual and consolidated financial statements presented according to the European single electronic reporting format, we have verified that the presentation of the financial  statements  to  be  included  in  the  annual  financial  report  referred  to  in  paragraph  I  of  Article  L.451-1-2  of  the  French Monetary  and  Financial  Code  (Code  mon\u00e9taire  et  financier)  and  prepared  under  the  Chief  Executive  Officer's  responsibility, complies with this format, as defined by European Delegated Regulation No. 2019/815 of 17 December 2018.\n\nOn the basis of our work, we conclude that the presentation of the financial statements to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic reporting format.\n\nIt is not our responsibility to ensure that the financial statements to be included by the Company in the annual financial report filed with the French Financial Markets Authority - AMF correspond to those on which we carried out our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed Statutory Auditors of L'Or\u00e9al by the Annual General Meeting of 29 April 2004.\n\nAt 31 December 2021, PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s were in the eighteenth consecutive year of their engagement.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and those charged with governance for the financial statements\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing financial statements giving a true and fair view in accordance with French accounting principles, and for implementing the internal control procedures it deems necessary for the preparation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn  preparing  the  financial  statements,  Management  is  responsible  for  assessing  the  Company's  ability  to  continue  as  a  going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless it expects to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of internal control and risk management systems,  as  well  as,  where  applicable,  any  internal  audit  systems  relating  to  accounting  and  financial  reporting procedures.\n\nThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\n## Objective and audit approach\n\nOur  role  is  to  issue  a  report  on  the  financial  statements.  Our  objective  is  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the financial statements as a whole are free of material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee  that  an  audit  conducted  in  accordance  with  professional  standards  will  always  detect  a  material  misstatement when  it  exists.  Misstatements  can  arise  from  fraud  or  error  and  are  considered  material  if,  individually  or  in  the  aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions taken by users on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code, our audit does not include assurance on the viability or quality of the Company's management\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the Statutory Auditors exercise professional judgement throughout the audit. They also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify  and  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  in  the  financial  statements,  whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and perform audit procedures in response to those risks, and obtain audit evidence considered to be sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for their opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of the internal control procedures relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate  the  appropriateness  of  accounting  policies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  made  by Management and the related disclosures in the notes to the financial statements;\n\n6",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of the audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the Statutory  Auditors  conclude  that  a  material  uncertainty  exists,  they  are  required  to  draw  attention  in  the  audit  report  to  the related  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  not  provided  or  are  inadequate,  to  issue  a  qualified opinion or a disclaimer of opinion;\n- \u00b7 evaluate  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial  statements  and  assess  whether  these  statements  represent  the  underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes, in particular, a description of the scope of the audit and the audit programme implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report any significant deficiencies in internal control that we have identified regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were the most significant for the audit of the financial statements and which constitute the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No. 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France, as defined in particular in Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code and in the French Code of Ethics for Statutory Auditors.

Depending on the choice made by the Board of Directors in accordance  with  the  provisions  of  section  1  above,  the General Management is carried out either by the Chairman, or by a natural person, appointed by the Board of Directors and bearing the title of Chief Executive Officer (1) .\n- 3. The  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  granted  the  most  extensive powers  to  act  in  all  circumstances  on  behalf  of  the Company. He exercises these powers within the limitations of the object of the Company, and subject to the powers expressly granted by law to Shareholders' Meetings.\n- The Chief Executive Officer represents the Company in its relations with third parties. The Company is bound even by actions  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  which  are  outside the  object  of  the  Company,  unless  the  Company  can prove that the third party was aware that the action was outside the object of the Company, or that the third party could not be unaware of this in view of the circumstances, it  being  stated  however  that  the  mere  publication  of  the Articles of Association does not constitute such proof.\n- 4. On  the  proposal  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  whether this  office  is  assumed  by  the  Chairman  of  the  Board  of Directors or by another person, the Board of Directors may appoint one or more natural persons in charge of assisting the Chief Executive Officer, with the title of Deputy Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, the Board of Directors  determines  the  extent  and  duration  of  the powers granted to the Deputy Chief Executive Officers.'

Financial year (Article 14 of the Articles of Association)\n\n'Each fiscal year shall have a duration of twelve (12) months, to begin on January 1st and to end on December 31 st of each year.'\n\n## 7.1.10. Statutory distribution of profits (Article 15 of the Articles of Association)\n\n- A. 'From  the  distributable  profits,  the  following  amounts  shall be withheld, in the following order:\n- 1. The amount required to pay the 'primary dividend' to the shareholders  equal  to  five  percent  (5%)  of  the  amounts paid up on the unredeemed securities in accordance with calls  for  funds,  provided  however  that  (where  the  profits for  a  given  year  do  not  allow  such  dividend  to  be  paid) the  shareholders  shall  not  be  entitled  to  claim  such dividend from out of the profits of subsequent years.\n- 2. From  the  available  remainder,  the  Ordinary  General Meeting,  upon  a  proposal  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  shall have the authority to resolve to withhold the amounts that it deems appropriate  (and  even  the  entire  amount  of  such available  remainder),  either  to  be  carried  forward  to  the next fiscal year, or to be paid into a 'prudential fund' or into one  or  more  ordinary,  extraordinary  or  special  reserve funds.  Such  reserve  fund(s),  which  shall  not  bear  any interest, may  be  distributed  to  the  shareholders,  or\n\nInformation relating to the Company\n\n- allocated  to  complete  the  5%  primary  dividend  for  the shareholders, in the event of insufficient results during one or more fiscal years, or to acquire and to cancel shares in the Company, or to redeem in whole or in part such shares.\n- 3. The remaining balance (if any) shall be divided up among all the shareholders, without any discrimination, and each share shall entitle its holder to receive the same income.\n- However, any shareholder who can prove at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  payment  of  the dividend paid for such financial year, will be entitled to a preferential dividend on the shares that are thus registered, equal  to  10%  of  the  dividend  (initial  dividend  and additional dividend) paid on the other shares, including in the event of payment of the dividend in new shares, the preferential dividend thus paid being rounded down to the nearest lower cent, if necessary.\n\nSimilarly, any shareholder who can prove, at the end of a financial  year,  that  shares  have  been  registered  in  his name for at least two years and that they continue to be registered  in  his  name  at  the  date  of  completion  of  an increase  in  capital  carried  out  through  capitalisation  of reserves,  profits  or  share  premiums  by  the  distribution  of bonus shares, shall be entitled to an increase in the number of bonus shares to be distributed to him, equal to 10%; this number being rounded down to the nearest lower unit in the event of fractional share rights.\n\n- The new shares created in this manner will be identical, for the  purposes  of  calculating  the  rights  to  the  preferential dividend and to the increased share allocations, to the old shares from which they result.\n- 4. The  number  of  shares  eligible  for  these  preferential dividends may not exceed 0.5% of the share capital at the closing  date  of  the  past  fiscal  year,  for  the  same shareholder.\n- B. The losses (if any) shall be charged to the retained earnings from preceding financial years or to the reserve funds, and the balance  shall  be  booked  into  a  special  'carry  forward' account.' '\n\n## 7.1.11. Annual General Meeting\n\nAnnual  General  Meetings  are  governed  by  all  the  legal provisions  and  regulations  laid  down  in  this  connection.  It  is specified that, in accordance  with  Article  12  of  the Company's Articles of Association, if the Board of Directors so decides when the General Meeting is called, any shareholder may take part in the meeting by videoconference or by any other  telecommunication  or  remote  transmission  means including the Internet, under the conditions stipulated by the applicable regulations at the time it is used. If this decision is taken, it is communicated in the meeting notice published in the Bulletin des Annonces L\u00e9gales Obligatoires (B.A.L.O).\n\nSince  the  Annual  General  Meeting  of  29  April  2004,  double voting rights have been eliminated. Applying the provisions of French law No. 2014-384 of 29 March 2014, the Annual General Meeting  of  22  April  2015  confirmed  that  each  share  entitles the holder to only one vote at General Meetings.\n\nIn the exceptional context related to the Covid-19 health crisis, L'Or\u00e9al's  Ordinary  and  Extraordinary  General  Meeting  was held  on  20  April  2021  behind  closed  doors, i.e. without  the physical  presence  of  shareholders  and  persons  entitled  to attend, at the Company's administrative headquarters, within\n\n7",

Such notice must  also  be  given  to  the  Company  when  a  shareholder's ownership falls below one of the thresholds set forth above.' This  provision  of  the  Articles  of  Association  supplements  the legal requirements  covering  disclosures concerning  the crossing, upwards or downwards, of thresholds relating to onetwentieth,  one-tenth,  three-twentieths,  one-fifth,  one-quarter, three-tenths, one-third, one-half, two-thirds, eighteentwentieths or nineteen-twentieths of share capital or of voting rights.\n\n'If not disclosed in accordance with the conditions stipulated by  law  or  by  the  Articles  of  Association,  the  shares  of  the offending  shareholder  exceeding  the  fraction  which  should have  been  disclosed  are  deprived  of  voting  rights,  in accordance  with  the  conditions  stipulated  in  the  French Commercial Code, if during a General Meeting, the failure to disclose  is  noted  and  if  one  or  more  shareholders  together holding at least 5% of the share capital so request during said meeting.'\n\nSee  the  full  Articles  of  Association  of  the  Company  on www.loreal-finance.com, under the heading ' Regulated information' .\n\n## 7.2.

Presentation of the stock option Plans for the purchase or subscription of shares and Plans for Conditional Grants of Shares to employees (ACAs)\n\n## Policy\n\nFor several years L'Or\u00e9al has set up long-term incentive plans in  favour  of  its  employees  and  corporate  officers  in  an international  context,  in  the  form  of  grants  of  performance shares.\n\nThese grants serve a dual purpose:\n\n- \u00b7 motivate  and  associate  those  who  make  significant contributions to future increases in the Group's results; and\n- \u00b7 strengthen  involvement  and  the  sense  of  belonging  of  its beneficiaries  by  fostering  long-term  loyalty  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nWithin  the  context  of  the  19th  resolution  submitted  for  the approval of the Annual General Meeting of 21 April 2022, the Board of Directors,  at  its  meeting  of  9  February  2022  and  on the recommendation of the Human  Resources and Remuneration Committee, decided to introduce new criteria to  assess  the  extra  financial  performance  in  addition  to  the financial performance within the long-term incentive plans, in order to align them with L'Or\u00e9al's strategy in which economic and social performance go hand-in-hand (see section 7.4.4. of this document).\n\n## History\n\nUntil  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  exclusively  granted stock  options  to  the  senior  managers  and  corporate  officers whom  L'Or\u00e9al  wished  to  reward  for  their  performance  and their  important  role  in  business  development  and  in  the Group's current and future projects, wherever they might be geographically located.\n\nIn  2009,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  enlarged  its  policy  by introducing a mechanism for the conditional grants of shares to employees (ACAs).\n\nThe objective was:\n\n- \u00b7 to provide a long-term incentive offering greater motivation to  all  those  who  received  stock  options  only  occasionally or in limited numbers; and\n- \u00b7 to reach  out  to  a  broader  population  of  potential beneficiaries,  particularly  internationally,  in  a  context  of increased competition for talent.\n\nIn  2011,  L'Or\u00e9al's  Board  of  Directors  decided  to  make  ACAs the  primary  instrument  for  its  long-term  incentive  policy  by extending the grant of shares to the main senior managers of the Group who until then had only received stock options: In 2012,  at  the  suggestion  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee,  the  Board  of  Directors  went  one step further in this policy and decided to replace the grant of stock  options  with  conditional  grants  of  shares  for  all beneficiaries as of the 2013 Plan.\n\n## Grant process\n\nThe  plans  are  proposed  by  General  Management  to  the Board of Directors which decides, after receiving the opinion of  the  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the principle  of  these  plans  and  the  applicable  conditions  and rules.\n\nIn  accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF recommendation, these grants are made over the same period each year: between 2009 and 2019 they were put in place following the approval of the financial accounts for the previous financial year by the Annual General Meeting and since 2020 they have been put in place at the end of the year, provided that the first year the performance  conditions  are  assessed  is  the  financial  year following the year of grant.\n\nThe decision with regard to each individual grant is, in every case,  contingent  upon  the  quality  of  the  performance rendered  at  the  time  of  implementation  of  the  plan  with particular  attention  being  paid  to  the  main  talents  for  the future. According to the eligibility criteria linked to the position held  by  the  beneficiary  and  the  size  of  the  entity  or  the country  in  which  the  beneficiary  works,  to  ensure  worldwide fairness,  these  grants  are  made  every  year,  on  a  recurring basis every two to three years, or more regularly.\n\nThe General Management and the Board of Directors reiterate the importance that is given to bringing together the interests of the beneficiaries of conditional grants of shares and those of the shareholders themselves.\n\nThe beneficiaries (employees  and  executive  corporate officers)  share  with  the  shareholders  the  same  confidence  in the strong steady growth of the Company with a medium and long-term vision.  This  is  why  stock  options  were  granted  for  a period  of  10  years  including  a  5  year  vesting  period,  and conditional grants of shares for a period of 4 years followed, for France  up  until  the  2015  Plan,  by  a  2-year  holding  period during which these shares cannot be transferred.\n\nThe  attention  of  the  beneficiaries  of  conditional  grants  of shares is drawn to the regulations in force concerning persons holding  'inside  information'.  The  beneficiaries  of  conditional grants of shares undertake to read the Stock Market Code of Ethics included when settling the conditional grants of shares plans that they benefit from and to comply with the provisions thereof.\n\n## Number of beneficiaries\n\n53%  of  the  beneficiaries  of  the  7  October  2021  Plan  are women. More than 3,600 employees, representing approximately 9.5% of the managers around the world, nearly 58% of whom are in international subsidiaries, benefit or have benefited  from  at  least  one  conditional  grant  of  shares  plan since  2017  and  were  still  employees  of  the  Company  on  31 December 2021.",

Authorisation of the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of 30 June 2020\n\nThe Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting of 30 June 2020 gave  the  Board  of  Directors  the  authorisation  to  carry  out  free grants of existing shares and/or shares to be issued to employees and  corporate  officers  of  the  Company  and  of  its  French  or foreign subsidiaries under the conditions of Article L. 225-197-2 of the French Commercial Code.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting set the period of validity of the authorisation, which may be used on one or more occasions, at 26 months.\n\nThe  total  number  of  free  shares  thus  granted  may  not represent more than 0.6% of the share capital recorded on the date of the Board of Directors' decision.\n\nThe  number  of  free  shares  granted  to  the  Company's corporate  officers  may  not  represent  more  than  10%  of  the total  number  of  free  shares  granted  during  a  financial  year pursuant to this resolution.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  determine  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries  of  the  free  grants  of  shares  and  the  number  of free shares granted to each of them as well as the conditions to  be  met  in  order  for  the  shares  to  finally  vest,  and  in particular the performance conditions.\n\nThese performance conditions will take into account:\n\n- \u00b7 partly,  growth  in  L'Or\u00e9al's  comparable  cosmetics  sales  as compared  to  those  of  a  panel  of  its  biggest  direct competitors; and\n- \u00b7 partly, growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit.\n\nThe Board of Directors indeed considers that these two criteria, assessed over a long period of 3 financial years and applied to several plans, are complementary, in line with the Group's objectives and its specificities and likely to promote balanced, continuing  growth  over  the  long  term.  They  are  demanding but  remain  a  source  of  motivation  for  the  beneficiaries.  The grant of such shares to their beneficiaries, for all or part of the shares  granted,  will  become  final  provided  that  the  other conditions  set  at  the  time  of  grant  are  met,  at  the  end  of  a minimum vesting period of 4 years.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to sales, in order for all the free shares granted to finally vest for the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, L'Or\u00e9al must outperform the average growth in  sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors.  Below  this  level,  the  grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales is less than the average growth in sales of the panel of competitors over the period, no share will be allocated for this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all the free shares granted to finally vest for the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, a level of growth defined by the Board  of  Directors,  but  not  made  public  for  confidentiality reasons,  must  be  achieved  or  exceeded.  Below  this  level,  the grant  decreases.  If  the  operating  profit  does  not  increase  in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nThe  grant  of  these  shares  to  their  beneficiaries  will  become final  prior  to  the  expiry  of  the  above-mentioned  vesting periods in the event of disability of the beneficiary corresponding  to  classification in the second  or  third categories provided for in Article L. 341-4 of the French Social Security  Code  ('Code  de  la  s\u00e9curit\u00e9  sociale'),  and  such shares will be freely transferable in the event of disability of the beneficiary  corresponding  to  classification  in  the  abovementioned  categories  under  Article  L.  341-4  of  the  French Social  Security  Code.  Pursuant  to  Article  L.  225-197-3  of  the French  Commercial  Code,  in  the  event  of  the  death  of  the beneficiary,  his/her  heirs  may  request  the  allocation  of  the shares within six months from the date of death. These shares are freely transferable.\n\nThe Board of Directors will be able to provide for vesting and holding  periods  which  are  longer  than  the  minimum  periods set above.\n\nThe  mechanism  for  the  Conditional  Grant  of  Shares  to employees complies with the AFEP-MEDEF Code of Corporate Governance and in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 any  conditional  grants  of  shares  to  the  corporate  officers will  be decided by the Board of Directors after assessment of their performance;\n- \u00b7 final  vesting  of  all  or  some  of  the  shares  will  be  linked  to performance  conditions  to  be  met  that  are  set  by  the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 corporate officers will be obliged to keep 50% of the shares that  are  definitively  granted  to  them  at  the  end  of  the vesting period in registered form until the termination of their corporate office; and\n- \u00b7 An  executive  corporate  officer  may  not  be  granted  any shares at the time of their departure.",

Conditional Grants of Shares granted within the framework of the authorisation of 30 June 2020 (ACAs Plan of 7 October 2021)\n\nOn  the  basis  of  the  proposals  made  by  the  General Management  and  examined  by  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors decided, at its meeting on 7 October 2021, to make a Conditional Grant of Shares  within  the  scope  of  the  authorisation  granted  by  the Annual General Meeting on 30 June 2020.\n\nThe  share  capital  at  7  October  2021  was  composed  of 557,671,748  shares,  and  3,346,030  shares  could  therefore  be issued.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  used  this  authorisation  at  its  meeting of 7 October 2021 by granting 588,750 shares to 2,408 beneficiaries.\n\nThis is a free grant of shares to be issued.\n\nVesting of the shares is subject to a dual condition:\n\n- \u00b7 presence: the shares granted will only vest after a period of 4 years  at  the  end  of  which  the  beneficiary  must  still  be an employee of the Group (except in the cases provided by the law or the Plan rules); and\n- \u00b7 performance:\n- \u00b7 vesting  of  all  or  part  of  50%  of  the  shares  granted  will depend on the growth in comparable cosmetics sales for financial years 2022, 2023 and 2024 compared with those of a panel of L'Or\u00e9al's biggest direct competitors made of  Unilever,  Procter  &  Gamble,  Est\u00e9e  Lauder,  Shiseido, Beiersdorf,  Johnson  &  Johnson,  Henkel,  LVMH,  Kao  and Coty, and\n- \u00b7 vesting  of  all  or  part  of  50%  of  the  shares  granted  will depend on growth in the Group's consolidated operating profit, over the same period.\n\nThe  calculation  will  be  made  on  the  basis  of  the  arithmetic average of the performances for 2022, 2023 and 2024.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to sales, in order for all the free shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  L'Or\u00e9al  must  outperform the  average  growth  in  sales  of  the  panel  of  competitors.\n\nBelow this level, the grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales is less than the average growth in sales of the  panel  of  competitors  over  the  period,  no  share  will  be allocated  for  this  criterion.  The  Board  of  Directors  defines  a threshold,  not  made  public  for  confidentiality  reasons,  below which no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to operating profit, in order for all  the  free  shares  granted  to  finally  vest  for  the  beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, a level of growth defined by the Board of Directors, but not made public for confidentiality reasons, must be met or exceeded. Below this level, the grant decreases. If the operating profit does not increase in absolute value over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nThe  Human  Resources  and  Remuneration  Committee  is responsible  for  communicating  to  the  Board  of  Directors  the level  of  indicators  recorded  for  the  years  to  be  used  for  the calculation  of  the  performance  conditions.  The  Board  of Directors  records,  at  the  appropriate  time,  the  level  of performance  achieved  on  which  the  number  of  shares  that finally vests depends.\n\nThe  figures  recorded  each  year  to  determine  the  levels  of performance  achieved  are  published  in  sections  7.4.3.5. 'Shares finally vested under the 17 April 2018 ACAs plan' and 7.4.3.6.  'Tables  monitoring  performance  conditions  for  the ACAs plans that are currently in progress'.\n\nThe  vesting  of  the  first  200  conditional  grants  of  shares  is  not subject to fulfilment of the performance conditions except for beneficiaries who were members of the Executive Committee on the date they were granted, including the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## 7.4.3.3.

INFORMATION POLICY\n\nL'Or\u00e9al  is  committed  to  improving  the  quality  of  its  financial information  and  takes  steps  to  ensure  it  maintains  a  regular dialogue with its shareholders and  with French and international  investors.  Beyond  its  legal  obligations,  it  has  a whole range of information and communication tools: printed and digital media on the L'Or\u00e9al Finance website, shareholder events  and  meetings  either  organised  physically  or  virtually, investor conferences  and  roadshows,  which  are  made available to all stakeholders to give them  a  better understanding of L'Or\u00e9al's business model and the potential of the beauty market.\n\n## 7.6.1. Additional communication tools\n\nKeen on transparency and accessibility of information, in 2021, in  the context of the ongoing Covid-19 health crisis, L'Or\u00e9al's Financial  Communication  Department  shared  a  wealth  of complete  financial  and  non-financial  information  with  the entire  financial  community  via  communication  tools,  with  a high emphasis on digital:\n\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al makes two exhaustive and complementary annual publications available: the Annual Report and the Universal Registration Document can be consulted and downloaded at www.loreal-finance.com.\n- \u00b7 The www.loreal-finance.com website contains a complete set of all financial and non-financial information. Its content and  ergonomics  evolve  regularly  to  provide  quicker  and easier access to information.\n- \u00b7 The  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance  mobile  app,  available  on  the  App Store  and  Google  Play,  makes  it  possible  to  keep  L'Or\u00e9al Finance  news  close  to  hand.  Downloaded  more  than 64,000 times since it was created, it is highly appreciated by professionals and individual shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The  Letter  to  Shareholders  and  e-newsletters  make  it possible  to  keep  shareholders  and  subscribers  regularly informed of all major events in the life of the Group.\n- \u00b7 The  shareholder  brochure  'Take  part  in  the  L'Or\u00e9al adventure' describes the Company's business model and explains  the  advantages  of  registered  shares  to  answer questions that shareholders may have about this shareholding method.\n- \u00b7 Testifying to the loyalty of the shareholders who support the Group's development over the long term, more and more shareholders are showing an interest in becoming registered  shareholders.  Thanks  to  preferential  dividends and  the  numerous  advantages  related  to  this  method  of shareholding,  becoming  a  registered  shareholder  enables the  Group's  shareholders  to  be  known  to  the  Group,  to have systematic and regular access to information, and to be closely involved in the Company's development.\n\n## 7.6.2. A large number of shareholder events for regular and detailed dialogue\n\nIn  2021,  in  the  context  of  the  Covid-19  health  crisis  and  to protect  the  health  of  all  our  stakeholders,  shareholders  and investors,  as  well  as  employees  of  L'Or\u00e9al,  all  events  were organised  and  some  were  transformed  to  digital  format  to maintain the relationship and dialogue. Thus:\n\n- \u00b7 The Financial Communications  Department  and  the Investor Relations Department  organised  a  financial information meeting and telephone conferences intended for  analysts  and  institutional  investors,  to  which  journalists specialising  in  the  cosmetics  sector  were  invited.  The presentations  of  the  Group's  financial  results  and  the business activities of the Operational  Divisions were broadcast live online on the financial website www.lorealfinance.com.  All  the  information  presented  was  made available on this site, on the day of its publication, when the annual and half-yearly results were published, as well as at investor conferences.\n- \u00b7 The  Annual  General  Meeting  was  broadcast  live,  then  on replay,  in  French  and  English,  on  the  L'Or\u00e9al  Finance website.  For  several  years,  shareholders  have  had  the option  to  vote  remotely  via  the  Votaccess  platform.  This year,  in  order  to  respect  shareholder  democracy  and encourage dialogue with shareholders, and in addition to the  legal  process  for  written  questions,  L'Or\u00e9al  set  up  a dedicated email address to receive, in the days preceding the  Annual  General  Meeting (1) ,  all  their  questions  to  be made directly to Management. Shareholders also had the opportunity to ask questions by telephone via a dedicated number during the Annual General Meeting. This broadcast was viewed by around 3,000 shareholders.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al participated as a preferred partner at Boursorama's first digital e-show, Bourso'Live, on 28, 29 and 30 June 2021. The  L'Or\u00e9al  virtual  stand  welcomed  more  than  800  visitors who were able to download documents and publications, and  to  interact  with  the  Group's  Individual  Shareholders department. Mr Christophe Babule, Chief Financial Officer of  L'Or\u00e9al,  presented  the  L'Or\u00e9al  model  during  a  web conference  and  answered  questions  from  web  users;  the presentation  was  attended  by  many  shareholders  and recorded around 15,000 views.\n- \u00b7 L'Or\u00e9al  participated  in  the  hybrid  2021  edition  of  Investir Day, in digital  from  15-22  November and in person at the Palais Brongniart in Paris on 23 November 2021. This edition was attended by nearly 15,000 participants, 3,000 of whom attended the Palais Brongniart. Mr Christophe Babule, Chief Financial Officer of L'Or\u00e9al, and Mr Laurent Gilbert, Director of  Environmental  Research  and  Sustainable  Development, talked  respectively  about  the  Group's  strategy  and  the theme 'L'Or\u00e9al: GreenSciences for sustainable innovation'.",

Independence of Directors\n\nEvery  year  the  Nominations  and  Governance  Committee proposes to the Board of Directors that the situation of each of  the  Directors  with  regard  to  their  independence  be reviewed on a case-by-case basis according to the criteria set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Code.\n\nThe  review  of  the  independence  of  these  Directors  was carried out by the Board of Directors on the basis, in particular, of a study of the relationships existing between the Company and the companies in which the Directors hold offices.\n\nIf  the Annual General Meeting approves the appointments and renewals that are proposed by the Board of Directors, the number of Independent Directors would be 7 out of 14, i.e. an  independence  rate  of  50%  (the  two  Directors representing  the  employees  are  not  taken  into  account pursuant to the AFEP-MEDEF Code).\n\n## 3.2. Balanced gender representation in the Board of Directors\n\nIf  the Annual General Meeting approves the appointments and  renewals  submitted  to  it,  the  number  of  women  in\n\nthe  Board  of  Directors  would  be  7  out  of  the  14  Directors appointed  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting, i.e. a percentage  representation  of  women  of  50%  (the  two Directors  representing  the  employees  are  not  taken  into account pursuant to the French Commercial Code).\n\n## 3.3. Length of office and minimum number of shares held\n\nThe term of office of the Directors appointed by the L'Or\u00e9al Annual  General  Meeting  is  four  years  or  less  to  allow  a scheduled  renewal  of  the  terms  of  office  of  Directors.  The term  of  office  of  a  Director  who  is  not  appointed  by  the Annual General Meeting is four years.\n\nDirectors  appointed  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting  must each  hold  a  minimum  of  250  L'Or\u00e9al  shares:  at  least 125 shares on the date of their appointment by the Annual General Meeting, and the balance no later than 24 months after  their  appointment.  The  complete  list  of  the  duties  of the  Directors  is  provided  in  section  2.2.2.  of  the  2021 Universal Registration Document.\n\n8",

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Draft resolutions and Report of the Board of Directors to the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on Thursday 21 April 2022\n\n## Fourth resolution: renewal of the term of office of Mr Jean-Paul Agon as Director\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors,  renews  Mr  Jean-Paul  Agon's  term  of  office  as  a Director for a term of four years.\n\nHis term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2026  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\n## Fifth resolution: renewal of the term of office of Mr Patrice Caine as Director\n\nHis term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2026  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\n## Sixth resolution: renewal of the term of office of Ms Bel\u00e9n Garijo as Director\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors,  renews  the  term  of  office  as  Director  of  Ms  Bel\u00e9n Garijo for a term of four years.\n\nHer term of office will expire at the end of the Annual General Meeting  to  be  held  in  2026  and  called  to  approve  the financial statements for the previous financial year.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors,  renews  Mr  Patrice  Caine's  term  of  office  as  a Director for a term of four years.\n\n## Resolutions 7 and 8: Appointments of Statutory Auditors\n\n## Explanatory statement\n\nThe terms of office of Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s and PricewaterhouseCoopers  Audit,  Statutory  Auditors  of  the Company,  are  due  to  expire  at  the  close  of  this  Annual General Meeting.\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that,  since  the  reform  of  the  statutory audit,  the  maximum  term  of  office  for  Statutory  Auditors  is twenty-four consecutive years.\n\nIn view of the term limit that would be reached for the two Statutory  Auditors  at  the  end  of  the  certification  of  the financial  statements  for  the  2027  financial  year,  the  Audit Committee  examined  the  situation,  particularly  with  the objective  of  ensuring  continuity  of  the  audit  and  robust quality control mechanisms.\n\nAs  a  result,  the  Audit  Committee  recommended  to  the Board of Directors the early appointment in 2022 of a new Statutory  Auditor  that  will  work  alongside  one  of  the Statutory Auditors that has been engaged in this work since 2004, thus facilitating the transition.\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  conducted  a  tender  procedure during  financial  year  2020  to  comply  with  the  one-year period prior to the appointment of a new Statutory Auditor during which it may not perform certain services. An internal validation committee, set up by the General Management, reviewed  the  written  applications,  interviewed  the  various candidates, and carried out additional checks in consultation with the Audit Committee. This transparent and equitably organised selection procedure enabled the Audit Committee,  after  examining  several  proposals,  to  make  a recommendation to the Board of Directors at its meetings on 14 October and 3 December 2020.\n\n## Seventh resolution: renewal of the term of office of Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s as Statutory Auditor\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings,  having  reviewed  the  Report  of  the  Board  of Directors  and  having  noted  the  expiration  of  the  term  of Deloitte  &  Associ\u00e9s  as  Statutory  Auditor  at  the  end  of  this\n\nThe  Audit  Committee  thus  recommended  to  the  Board of Directors that it renew the tenure of Deloitte & Associ\u00e9s as Statutory Auditor. It also recommended the appointment of Ernst & Young, particularly in view of its practical approach based  on  specific  examples  that  demonstrate  a  solid understanding of the Group's activities, its centralised and digital approach, and the expertise of its teams. The term of offices  would  be  for  a  period  of  six  (6)  financial  years expiring at the close of the Annual General Meeting called to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the  2027  financial year.\n\nIt  is  also  noted  that,  since  the  entry  into  force  of  Law  no. 2016-1691  of  9  December  2016  on  transparency,  fight against corruption and modernisation of economic life (the 'Sapin  2'  law),  the  appointment  of  a  substitute  Statutory Auditor  is  required  only  if  the  Statutory  Auditor  is  a  natural person  or  a  sole  proprietorship  (Article  L.  823-1,  I  of  the French Commercial Code).\n\nAs  a  result,  the  Annual  General  Meeting  is  asked  to  note that  the  terms  of  office  of  the  Beas  company  and  of Mr  Jean-Christophe  Georghiou,  the  substitute  Statutory Auditors  of  the  Company,  have  expired  and,  in  view  of the  proposed  renewal  of  the  term  of  office  of  Deloitte &  Associ\u00e9s  and  the  appointment  of  Ernst  &  Young,  to decide  not  to  renew  the  terms  of  the  substitute  Statutory Auditors or replace them.\n\nGeneral Meeting, renews its term for a period of six years. Its term  will  expire  at  the  end  of  the  Annual  Ordinary  General Meeting  called  to  approve  the  financial  statements  for  the financial year ending on 31 December 2027.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting notes that the term of the Beas company  as  substitute  Statutory  Auditor  has  expired,  and votes not to renew or replace the substitute Statutory Auditor.",

The unit price per L'Or\u00e9al share bought back is \u20ac400, for a total price of \u20ac8,904,000,000.\n\nThis agreement was entered into in the following context.\n\nOn  5  November  2021,  the  Board  of  Directors  of  L'Or\u00e9al decided, on the recommendation of a ad hoc committee, with  a  majority  composed  of  independent  Directors,  to voluntarily  designate  the  Ledouble  firm  represented  by  Ms Agn\u00e8s Piniot as an independent expert.\n\nThe  independent  expert  concluded  that  from  a  financial standpoint,  the  buyback  price  was  fair  for  the  Company and its shareholders, that the transaction would not affect the  financial  balance  and  the  investment  capacity  of  the Company  and  that  the  transaction,  carried  in  the Company's interest, would be accretive for its shareholders and  treated  as  a  related-party  transaction.  The ad  hoc committee  reported  the  expert's  work  to  the  Board  of Directors and presented its recommendations to the Board.\n\nAt  its  meeting  of  7  December  2021  and  pursuant  to  the provisions  of  Article  L.  225-38  of  the  French  Commercial Code, the Board of Directors, after reviewing the findings of the independent expert's report, authorised the conclusion of  a  share  repurchase  agreement  between  L'Or\u00e9al  and Nestl\u00e9; the Directors having an interest did not participate in the deliberations or in the vote (1) .\n\nMr Paul Bulcke did not participate in the deliberations and vote  of  the  Board  of  Directors  given  that  he  is  a  Director of  both  L'Or\u00e9al  and  Nestl\u00e9  and  is,  therefore,  considered to be an interested party. Ms B\u00e9atrice Guillaume-Grabisch, a Nestl\u00e9 employee, did not participate in the deliberations and vote because of a potential conflict of interest within the  meaning  of  the  AFEP-MEDEF  Code  and  the  Internal Rules of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe share repurchase transaction was carried out, pursuant to the  sixteenth  resolution  approved  by  the  Annual  General Meeting of 20 April 2021, via the  acquisition  of  an  off-market block. The shares bought back were cancelled on 10 February 2022 by decision of the Board of Directors on 9 February 2022.\n\nThe buyback was funded using \u20ac4.5 billion in available cash from L'Or\u00e9al and through bank financing for the balance.\n\nThis  transaction  with  Nestl\u00e9  constitutes  a  further  strategic step  in  strengthening  L'Or\u00e9al's  shareholder  stability,  in  the interests of the Company and of all its shareholders.\n\nThe  transaction  helps  optimise  L'Or\u00e9al's  balance  sheet benefitting from  excellent  financing  conditions,  while retaining  a  significant  financial  flexibility  to  ensure  the Group's future development. The transaction will also have an accretive effect on L'Or\u00e9al's earnings per share of more than 4% in a full year.\n\nInasmuch as this agreement falls within the scope of Article L.  225-38  of  the  French  Commercial  Code,  it  is  subject  to the approval of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nNestl\u00e9,  which  holds  a  proportion  of  L'Or\u00e9al  voting  rights greater  than  10%  and  which  signed  the  repurchase agreement with L'Or\u00e9al, is considered to be an interested party within the meaning of the applicable regulation.\n\n## Sixteenth resolution: approval of the repurchase agreement for L'Or\u00e9al's acquisition from Nestl\u00e9 of 22,260,000 L'Or\u00e9al shares representing 4% of the capital as part of the procedure for related party agreements\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Ordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the Special Report of the Statutory Auditors on the agreements covered by Articles L. 225-38 et seq. of the French Commercial  Code,  approves  the  agreement  mentioned  therein  regarding  the  Company's  repurchase  of  a  block  of 22,260,000 L'Or\u00e9al shares held by Nestl\u00e9.\n\n8",

These  means  include,  where  applicable, the use of all financial instruments and derivatives.\n\nThis authorisation would take effect on the date of this Annual General Meeting and would expire at the end of a period of 18  months  from  the  date  of  this  Annual  General  Meeting. It would render ineffective from that day onwards any previous authorisation for the unused portion with the same purpose.\n\nThe  purchase  price  per  share  may  not  exceed  \u20ac600 (excluding  expenses).  The  authorisation  would  cover  a maximum of 10% of the capital - a maximum of 5% of the capital  for  the  shares  acquired  to  be  retained  and subsequently  remitted  (for  payment,  exchange,  or  other purposes) in the context of transactions for external growth, merger,  demerger  or  contribution  -  which  is,  as  an indication  at  31  December  2021,  55,767,236  shares  for  a maximum of \u20ac33,460,341,600,  it  being  understood  that  the Company may not, at any time, hold more than 10% of its own capital.\n\nconnection  with  transactions  for  external  growth,  merger, demerger,  or  contribution:  5%  of  the  number  of  shares making  up  the  Company's  capital  on  the  date  of completion  of  these  buybacks, i.e. as  an  indication  at 31 December 2021, 27,883,618 shares for a maximum amount of \u20ac16,730,170,800;\n\n- \u00b7 for shares acquired for another purpose: 10% of the number of  shares  making  up  the  Company's  share  capital  on  the date  of  completion  of  these  repurchases, i.e. as  an indication  at  31  December  2021,  55,767,236  shares  for  a maximum amount of \u20ac33,460,341,600; and\n- \u00b7 it  being  understood  that  the  Company  may  not,  at  any time, hold more than 10% of its own capital.\n\nThe purchase, sale, exchange or transfer of these shares may be carried out by any means on one or more occasions, on or off the stock market, including in whole or in part, through the acquisition,  sale,  exchange  or  transfer  of  blocks  of  shares. These means include, where applicable, the use of all financial instruments and derivatives.\n\nThese  transactions  may  be  carried  out  at  any  time, in  accordance  with  the  regulations  in  force  at  the  time  of the  transactions  concerned,  it  being  specified  that  in  the event of a public offer being filed by a third party with regard to the shares of the Company, the Board of Directors will not be able to use this authorisation during the public offer period without the prior authorisation of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nThe Annual General Meeting decides that this authorisation will take effect on the date of this Annual General Meeting and will expire at the end of a period of 18 months from the date of  this  Annual  General  Meeting.  It  renders  ineffective  from this  day  onwards  any  previous  authorisation  for  the  unused portion with the same purpose.\n\nThe Board of Directors will have the option of allocating and reassigning  to  any  of  these  objectives  all  the  treasury  shares currently held by the Company. Full powers are granted to the Board of  Directors,  with  the  option  for  it  to  delegate,  for  the implementation  of  this  resolution  and,  more  generally,  to  do anything that may be necessary.",

ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING Draft resolutions and Report of the Board of Directors to the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting to be held on Thursday 21 April 2022\n\nManagement and examined by the Human Resources and Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  will  decide  the  identity  of  the beneficiaries  of  the  grants,  the  number  of  shares  allocated to  each  one  and  the  performance  conditions  to  be  met for the final vesting of all or part of the shares.\n\nThe Board of Directors, at its meeting of 9 February 2022 and on  the  recommendation  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration  Committee,  has  now  decided  to  introduce criteria for non-financial performance  in  addition  to financial  performance  within  the  long-term  remuneration plan,  in  order  to  correlate  them  with  L'Or\u00e9al's  strategy  in which  economic  performance  and  environmental  and social performance go hand-in-hand.\n\nThese performance conditions will take into account:\n\n- \u00b7 in part, financial performance criteria on the basis of:\n- \u00b7 growth  in  comparable  cosmetics  sales  of  L'Or\u00e9al  as compared  to  a  panel  of  L'Or\u00e9al's  major  direct competitors; and\n- \u00b7 growth in L'Or\u00e9al's consolidated operating profit;\n- \u00b7 in part, non-financial performance criteria on the basis of:\n- \u00b7 fulfilment  of  environmental  and  social  responsibility commitments  made  by  the  Group  as  part  of  the L'Or\u00e9al  for  the  Future  programme  (%  of  sites  that  are \"carbon neutral\"; % of ingredients of biobased formulas that are traceable and come from sustainable source; %  of  plastic  packaging  that  is  recycled  or  biobased; number of people benefitting from our brands' social engagement programmes), hereinafter \"L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Committements\"; and\n- \u00b7 gender balance within management bodies (strategic positions including the Executive Committee, hereinafter the Management Bodies).\n\nThe figures recorded each year to determine the levels of performance  achieved  are  published  in  the  Annual Financial Report.\n\nThe Board of Directors considers that both of these types of criteria,  assessed  over  a  long  period  of  three  full  financial years, are  complementary,  in  line  with  the  Group's objectives and its specificities, and should make it possible to  promote  balanced,  continuing  and  sustainable  growth over  the  long  term.  They  are  demanding  but  remain  a source of motivation for the beneficiaries.\n\nPursuant to the criterion relating to sales , in order for all free shares granted to be fully vested by the beneficiaries at the end of the vesting period, L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in sales  must  outperform  the  average  growth  in  sales  of  the panel of competitors. This panel comprises Unilever, Procter &  Gamble,  Est\u00e9e  Lauder,  Shiseido,  Beiersdorf,  Johnson  & Johnson, Henkel, LVMH, Kao, and Coty. Below this level, the grant decreases. If L'Or\u00e9al's comparable growth in net sales is  less  than  the  average  growth  in  sales  of  the  panel  of competitors, no share will be allocated for this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to operating profit , a level of growth,  defined  by  the  Board,  but  not  made  public  for confidentiality  reasons,  must  be  met  or  exceeded in order for  all  free  shares  granted  to  be  finally  vested  by  the beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the  vesting  period.  Below  this level, the number of finally vested shares is in decline. If the operating  profit  does  not  increase  in  absolute  value  over the period, no share will finally vest pursuant to this criterion.\n\nPursuant to the criterion related to the fulfilment of  made as L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Commitments, in order for all the free shares  granted to be finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at the  end  of  the  vesting  period,  a  certain  average  level  of achievement of the L'Or\u00e9al for the Future Committements, defined by the Board and made public, must be reached over  the  period.  Below  this  level,  the  grant  decreases.  No shares will vest if the average of the results for the L'Or\u00e9al for the  Future  Committements  falls  below  the  minimum  level defined by the Board and made public.\n\nPursuant  to  the  criterion  relating  to  gender  balance  within Management Bodies , in order for all the free shares granted to  be  finally  vested  by  the  beneficiaries  at  the  end  of  the vesting  period,  the  average  representation  of  one  of  the sexes  must  account  for  at  least  40%  of  employees  on  the Management Bodies. Below this level, the grant decreases. No shares will vest in relation to this criterion if the average representation of one of the sexes is less than 35% over the vesting period.\n\nThese  performance  conditions  will  apply,  for  all  individual grants  greater  than  100  free  shares  per  plan,  to  all  shares above the hundredth share, with the exception of grants to the  directors  and  corporate  officers  and  members  of  the Executive Committee, for which they will apply in total.\n\nThe  free  grant  of  shares  may  be  carried  out  for  all  Group staff without performance  conditions, or for shares allocated on the basis of cash subscriptions carried out as part  of  an  increase  in  share  capital  reserved  for  Group employees  pursuant  to  the  twentieth  and  twenty-first resolutions.\n\nAny  allocations  of  shares  to  the  directors  and  corporate officers  will  be  decided  by  the  Board  of  Directors  on  the basis  of  the  proposals  of  the  Human  Resources  and Remuneration Committee after assessment of their performance.\n\nThe executive corporate officers of L'Or\u00e9al will be required to hold 50% of their fully vested shares in registered form until they cease to hold office.",

it being specified that the cumulative  amount  of  the  share  capital  increases  that may  be  carried  out  under  this  resolution  and  the twenty-first  resolution  may  not  exceed  the  maximum amount of 1% of the share capital existing at the date of this  Annual  General  Meeting,  which  constitutes  a  ceiling applicable  jointly to the twentieth and  twenty-first resolutions;",

The  proposed  amendment  is  aimed  at instituting  an  age  limit  for  serving  as  Chairman  of  the Board  of  Directors  identical  to  the  limit  applied  in principle  to  Directors  under  the  Board  of  Director's Internal Rules;\n- \u00b7 Article  11  of  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association ('General  Management')  to  provide  that  the  Chief Executive  Officer  shall  cease  to  hold  office  at  the  end of the Ordinary Annual General Meeting that follows his 65 th birthday. Pursuant to the French Commercial Code, in  the  absence  of  a  relevant  provision  in  the  current Articles  of  Association,  the  age  limit  applicable  to  the Chief  Executive  Officer  is  65  years  and  is  assessed  on the  basis  of  the  birthday  of  the  person  concerned. The  proposed  amendment  is  intended  to  specify  that the  Chief  Executive  Officer  who  reaches  the  age  limit may continue to serve until the Ordinary Annual General Meeting following his 65 th birthday;\n- \u00b7 Article  2  of  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association ('Corporate  purpose')  to  remove  the  reference  to  the Banking  Law  of  1966  which  has  been  codified  in  the French  Monetary  and  Financial  Code  since  Order  no. 2000-1223 of 14 December 2000;\n- \u00b7 Article  7  of  the  Company's  Articles  of  Association ('Shares')  in  order  to  remove  the  provisions  that  have heretofore  allowed  identification  of  shareholders.  Since French Law no. 2019-486 of 22 May 2019 on the growth and  transformation  of  companies  (the  'Pacte  Law'), these  provisions  are  automatic  and  no  longer  require express stipulation in the Articles of Association (Article L. 228-2 of the French Commercial Code); and\n- \u00b7 Article 8 of the Company's Articles of Association ('Board of  Directors')  to  remove  mention  of  the  requirement for  directors  to  own  5  shares  in  the  Company.  In  fact, the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors provide that each  Director  named  by  the  Annual  General  Meeting must  own  at  least  250  shares  in  the  Company:  at  least 125  shares  on  the  date  of  their  election  by  the  Annual General  Meeting,  and  the  balance  no  later  than 24 months after their election.\n\n## Twenty-second resolution: amendment of Article 9 of the Company's Articles of Association to change the age limit for serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Annual General Meeting, voting in accordance with the quorum and majority conditions required for Extraordinary General Meetings, having reviewed the Report of the Board of Directors, approves the amendment of \u00a7 1 of Article 9 of the Company's Articles of Association to change the age limit for serving as Chairman of the Board of Directors. The rest of the provisions of Article 9 of the Company's Articles of Association remain unchanged.",
