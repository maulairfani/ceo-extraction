We began the year facing the hardships presented by Winter Storm Uri (Uri), but with our t f d di t d l t th team of dedicated employees, we came together to not only confront and mitigate the impact but also grow from the experience. Back in 2016, when Vistra emerged from bankruptcy we embarked on a strategy emphasizing a strong balance sheet as one of the cornerstones of the company. That strategic priority enabled us to withstand Uri and get back on track in a relatively short period of time.\n\nAfter understanding the full impact of Uri, we began a comprehensive process in the second quarter of 2021 to review our strategic direction and approach to capital allocation. As a result of this process, we identified and prioritized four key strategic imperatives:\n\n- 1. Accelerating our zero-carbon growth pipeline with cost-e/ffective capital\n- 2. Returning significant capital to stockholders from our core business\n- 3. Maintaining a strong balance sheet\n- 4. Driving long-term, sustainable value through Vistra's integrated business model\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVistra has established itself as a leader in ESG and the clean energy transition with our Vistra Zero carbon-free generation portfolio and our many green retail products and solutions we o/ffer to customers.\n\nCurt Morgan Chief Executive O/fficer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy year-end, we had delivered squarely on each of these four strategic imperatives, and I'll touch on each in the following pages to highlight our performance in 2021 and the prospects for the future of our company.\n\n## Accelerating our Zero-Carbon Growth Pipeline with Cost-E/ffective Capital\n\nVistra has established itself as a leader in ESG and the clean energy transition with our Vistra Zero carbon-free generation portfolio and our many green retail products and solutions we o/ffer to customers. We continue to focus on opportunities to grow our business responsibly through economically attractive investments that contribute to our decarbonization goals, including achieving net zero by 2050, while also delivering commensurate returns and value for all stakeholders. In 2021, we reinforced our commitment to growing our renewable and battery storage portfolio to support the broader decarbonization of the U.S. economy, maintain the reliability and a/ffordability of electricity, and enhance the long-term sustainability of Vistra.\n\nIn December, we published our Green Finance Framework, which enables us to issue green financial instruments to fund new or existing renewable and energy e/fficiency projects. We then successfully launched an attractively priced and upsized $1 billion of Green Perpetual Preferred",

Ultimately, this capital infusion will fund a portion of the development pipeline of several zero-carbon projects in our Vistra Zero portfolio in a coste/ffective manner.\n\nIn connection with the Green Perpetual Preferred Stock o/ffering, we announced our intention to grow Vistra Zero to at least 7,300 megawatts by 2026, with ~2,900 MW currently online (including our 2,300 MW low-cost nuclear facility, Comanche Peak). The $5 billion investment in Vistra Zero through 2026 is projected to contribute $450-$500 million of Adjusted EBITDA 1 annually by year-end 2026 (in addition to Adjusted EBITDA 1 generated by Comanche Peak). We intend to fund these development projects primarily through project financing, supplemented by Vistra Zero project cash flows and the net proceeds of the Green Perpetual Preferred Stock o/ffering. Vistra's green and sustainable growth strategy through Vistra Zero is bolstered by our ability to use our existing sites, including repurposing retired or to-be-retired sites, which have existing access to transmission infrastructure.\n\n## Key development announcements and progress of our Vistra Zero projects in 2021 include:\n\n## In California:\n\n- \u00b7 Moss Landing Energy Storage Facility continues to expand-Phases I (300 MW) and II (100 MW) both achieved commercial operations in 2021, and in February 2022, we announced further expansion through Phase III (350 MW), bringing the site's total energy storage capacity to 750 MW/3,000 MWh. We have the potential to eventually reach 1,500 MW, supporting the state of California's electricity needs. We experienced certain operational delays as the water-based heat suppression systems improperly leaked water on a small percentage of the battery modules, temporarily taking Phases I and II o/ffline. However, we have identified the issues, are taking corrective actions, and expect to be storing and releasing energy to support California's grid during the all-important 2022 summer season.\n\n## In Illinois:\n\n- \u00b7 A three-year e/ffort culminated in the passage of an omnibus energy package that included our Illinois Coal to Solar & Energy Storage Initiative. As enacted, the legislation supports Vistra's future construction and operation of up to 300 MW of utility-scale solar and 150 MW of battery energy storage facilities at nine retired or to-be-retired coal plant sites across central and southern Illinois. The initiative will also include diverse suppliers while bringing a much-needed property tax base to local communities.\n\n## In Texas:\n\n- \u00b7 Our Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) 1,000 MW Phase I projects, announced in September 2020, took shape with three projects scheduled to achieve commercial operations prior to summer 2022:\n\n50 MW Brightside Solar Facility 108 MW Emerald Grove Solar Facility 260 MW DeCordova Energy Storage Facility\n\n- \u00b7 We also grew the Vistra Zero portfolio in Texas by acquiring the to-be-constructed 110 MW Angus Solar Facility, expected online in 2023.\n\nWe believe Vistra is exactly the kind of company that should be embraced as a leader in the energy transition-our track record includes responsibly and justly retiring carbon-emitting resources, reclaiming sites, and investing in new green technology and resources. Since 2010, Vistra has retired more than 12,000 MW of coal and gas power plants, resulting in a 45% reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through year-end 2020, compared to a 2010 baseline. Additionally, we have announced the expected retirement of nearly 8,000 MW of additional fossil-fueled power plants by 2027, for a total of ~20,000 MW since 2010, with plans to repurpose feasible sites to solar and energy storage developments. We are confident that our diversified asset mix will support the reliability of the electric system while providing customers with a/ffordable energy that meets their sustainable preferences throughout the clean energy transition.",

In October 2021, our board of directors approved a $2 billion share repurchase program, which we are on track to fully execute by year-end 2022. The share repurchase program is partially funded by the $1 billion of 8% preferred equity we issued in October 2021, and as announced on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call, Vistra had repurchased ~$764 million of the $2 billion as of Feb. 22, 2022, resulting in a 7% reduction in shares outstanding since our previously reported share count as of Nov. 2, 2021. Once we conclude this initial $2 billion share repurchase plan, we then expect to allocate at least an average of $1 billion per year toward share repurchases from 2023 through 2026 for a total of at least $6 billion in five years. Vistra's core business is expected to generate on average $3+ billion per year of Adjusted EBITDA 1 and we expect to convert 60-70%+ of Adjusted EBITDA 1 to free cash flow, a/ffording the significant cash flow to return to shareholders, especially since the Vistra Zero growth will be funded by internally generated Vistra Zero cash flow and third-party capital. Hence, our philosophy is simple and straight forward-for as long as we believe our stock is undervalued, we will dedicate significant cash flow from our core business to repurchase our shares. p\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur capital allocation plan also reinforced our O commitment to pay a meaningful and growing c dividend. In October 2021, we announced our d ntent to allocate $300 million per year toward i our common dividend. We anticipate this dividend o policy will o/ffer greater dividend yield growth for p stockholders rather than identifying a target annual s growth rate as we retire shares through our ongoing g repurchases. This $300 million dividend pool will be spread over fewer shares, providing growth in dividend yield on the remaining shares. Our first quarter 2022 dividend of $0.17 per share of Vistra's common stock, represents a ~13% increase in the company's quarterly common stock dividend per share from its first quarter 2021 dividend.\n\n## Maintaining a Strong Balance Sheet\n\nVistra has always focused on a strong balance sheet, and it will remain a priority. A strong balance sheet provided the support we needed to withstand the hardships brought by Uri. Immediately following Uri, we executed financing transactions to support our liquidity needs, increasing our net debt by just over $2 billion. However, just a few months later, we announced as part of our capital allocation plan that we expect to further reduce corporate-level debt by ~$1.5 billion by year-end 2022 with plans to retire up to ~$3 billion of corporate-level debt in five years. By year-end 2021, we had already decreased corporate-level debt by ~$625 million and we believe we will approach pre-Uri debt levels by year-end 2022. We project that we will be able to maintain leverage in our current range of 3-3.5 times net debt to Adjusted EBITDA 1 in the nearterm and reach the mid- to high-2s over the next five years, exclusive of the leverage to support the Vistra Zero growth.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Driving Long-Term, Sustainable Value Through Vistra's Integrated Business Model\n\nVistra's integrated model-a best-in-class generation fleet and premier retail business that we have grown and expanded over the past five years-provides the foundation and cash flow that support the three strategic priorities detailed above.\n\nWe have always believed in the value of our integrated operations, and we remain confident that the pairing of our low-cost, e/fficient, and diversified generation fleet-including our growing zero-carbon business-with our customer-centric retail platform and best-in-class commercial capabilities is the optimal way to maintain resiliency and create value for our stockholders. In fact, the uniquely low maintenance capital and operations and maintenance expense required to produce the $3 billion+ of Adjusted EBITDA 1 a/ffords us a significant amount of free cash flow to support a diverse capital allocation plan with an emphasis on returning capital to financial stakeholders.\n\n## Financial Execution\n\nWe entered 2021 on the heels of an outstanding 2020 where we achieved results above the high end of our raised guidance range and marked the fifth year in a row that our financial results exceeded the midpoint of our Adjusted EBITDA from Ongoing Operations 1 guidance range. Uri led to a confluence of unpredictable events, exposing issues with the integrated natural gas and electric systems in the Texas ERCOT market, including impaired gas deliverability, challenging the financial strength we had worked hard to put in place. We faced the challenge and stabilized the company, and then immediately got back to work significantly o/ffsetting the Uri financial impact and getting the company back on the path of exceptional performance and creating long-term shareholder value.\n\nTo mitigate the financial impact of Uri, we identified various self-help initiatives, including the monetization of certain commercial positions, optimizing spend on our generation O&M project work, retail cost savings and margin performance, and support group cost savings, culminating in value creation that exceeded our $500 million target. In addition, we have also been very active in\n\nthe Texas 2021 legislative and ongoing regulatory deliberations regarding Uri, which, among other accomplishments, resulted in Vistra being allocated ~$544 million in ERCOT securitization payments. The self-help and securitization e/fforts resulted in an improvement following Uri of over $1 billion. These e/fforts also helped de-risk the integrated Texas natural gas and power systems reducing the potential volatility in the Texas ERCOT market and Vistra's financial and operating performance.\n\nIn the end, we reported 2021 Adjusted EBITDA from Ongoing Operations 1 of $1,941 million, including the impacts from Uri-related retail bill credit settlements resulting in high returns to Vistra. Excluding the $53 million related to these settlements, 2021 Adjusted EBITDA from Ongoing Operations 1 was $1,994 million, slightly favorable to the November revised and tightened midpoint of guidance. Under very di/fficult circumstances following Uri, we executed and accomplished exactly what we set out to do: stabilize the company and recover as much lost value as possible in order to put our company back on track to maximize our financial results for our stockholders.\n\n## Generation\n\nDuring the week of Uri, our Texas generation fleet, which makes up 18% of the capacity available in ERCOT, provided between 25-30% of the power on the grid, far exceeding our market share. Unfortunately, the financial results did not match this performance due to the failures of the natural gas system and the uneven allocation of customer curtailments in ERCOT. Our employees went to extraordinary e/fforts, working around-the-clock in sub-freezing temperatures to keep our assets running and to maintain and restore power for the people of Texas. This was achieved while also e/ffectively managing COVID-19 at all plant sites and constantly tracking and adjusting to CDC and OSHA recommendations. Vistra finished the year with commercial availability, a measure of the fleet's ability to meet demand during the highest margin hours, of ~92%-very strong performance for a fleet with the characteristics of ours.\n\nIn 2021, Vistra continued our operations performance improvement (OPI) initiative, realizing",

OPI is now a part of our DNA with continuous idea generation and conversion of ideas to executable opportunities on a regular basis. Focused on learnings from Uri, we enhanced and further de-risked our fleet by investing more than $50 million in 2021, with execution beginning on another $30 million in 2022. These expenditures include the addition of onsite backup fuel at six plants with enough fuel for several days, additional o/ffsite gas storage, and several actions to guard against severe weather impacts on critical equipment.\n\nOur people are our most important asset, and their safety is our highest priority. Vistra's plants operated safely throughout the year-a testament to our 'Best Defense' mindset which puts safety above all else. Through the team's e/fforts, Vistra ended the year without any serious injuries or fatalities to our Vistra employees or business partners working at our sites. Our focus on safety is further highlighted with 12 power plant sites achieving VPP Star status from OSHA, demonstrating superior e/fficacy of their safety and health management systems, and maintaining injury and illness rates below industry average. In 2021, we introduced the VPP process to five new facilities, and four of our power plants submitted VPP applications that are awaiting OSHA review.\n\n## Retail\n\nVistra's retail business rose to the challenge as well while maintaining our customer-centric approach despite the challenges of COVID-19 and Uri. During Uri, we assured customers they would be insulated from storm-related rate increases, donated $5 million to support our communities in need, and provided bill-pay assistance. By year end, Vistra's retail business grew ERCOT residential counts by ~23,000 customers, the highest organic growth we've seen since 2008. Most of this growth was within our flagship retail brand TXU Energy, demonstrating the strength of our brand promise and continued importance to our customers.\n\nThis was also a standout year for our two largest retail brands, with the launch of several first-tomarket customer-centric products and others\n\nVistra's flagship retail brand, TXU Energy, launched a product specifically for electric vehicle owners, giving customers 50% o/ff energy charges every weeknight and all weekend long-times when customers most often charge their vehicles.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur people are our most important asset and their safety is our highest priority.

This first-of-its-kind plan allows customers to earn 30% in free electricity for every dollar they spend on energy charges, automatically, all year long.\n- \u00b7 TXU Energy EV Pass is designed specifically for electric vehicle owners.\n\nInnovation remains a pillar of our retail business. As electric vehicle adoption takes o/ff, we'll continue to develop products and partnerships to attract this important segment of customers. Additionally, we saw an increase in customers buying more than just electricity from us in 2021, growing our business of value-added products such as HVAC maintenance, home warranties, and surge protection plans. Vistra's approach to value-added services has been to partner with companies providing these services, earning a percentage of margin, rather than owning and competing in these businesses which have their own challenges and require their own sets of capabilities. This approach also allows us to be nimble and make changes while improving our o/fferings if the situation dictates. We believe this is the most cost-e/ffective manner to broaden our product o/ffering and protect our balance sheet\n\nand brands.",

The award recognizes companies that achieve the most exemplary coal mine reclamation in the nation.\n- \u00b7 Joined Disability:IN, the leading non-profit resource for business disability inclusion worldwide, reinforcing commitment to equality and inclusion at Vistra.\n- \u00b7 Continued year two of a five-year, $10 million commitment to support organizations that grow minority-owned small businesses, enhance economic development, and provide educational opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds.\n- \u00b7 Advanced diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace through strengthening internal hiring and recruiting practices through numerous initiatives including training for hiring managers and partnerships with minority-serving institutions.\n- \u00b7 Incorporated an ESG Index, with a 10% weighting, into Vistra's compensation scorecard, ensuring accountability all the way to the top of the company.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWe continue to believe that the most e/ffective and sustainable companies have a well-balanced focus on a variety of stakeholders including you-our investors-and our customers, communities, people, and suppliers. We are supplying a vital product to society, and we must balance that crucial role with our environmental footprint. In 2021, we advanced our company in many important ways, especially in the areas represented by ESG. Although we endured an unprecedented weather event that resulted in a significant financial impact and a temporary loss of value, we finished the year strong, fully recovering the loss in value of our stock from Uri by year end. Ultimately, I am most proud of how this company responded to the impacts from Uri, most of which were uncontrollable, and continued to live our core principles of doing business the right way, competing as a team to win, and caring for all of our stakeholders. We never wavered and we did not give up, and we are now back on track with our stock price continuing to respond favorably to our new and improved capital allocation plan. We cannot change what happened during Uri, but we can and did learn from it, de-risking and strengthening our company for the future. We completed 2021 with a clear strategic direction as a leader in the clean energy transition coupled with a capital allocation plan that we believe will provide exceptional value to our stockholders for years to come.\n\nWe begin 2022 from a position of strength for which we can all be proud. It was with this strength in mind that on March 21, 2022, I announced that I will be transitioning the role of CEO to my colleague, Jim Burke. Leading Vistra has been the most rewarding experience of my 40-year career. I remain excited about the long-term opportunity ahead as Vistra returns significant capital to investors while transitioning our fleet to lower carbon resources. Jim is a proven leader who possesses deep experience in our company and industry and understands the company's commitment to all our stakeholders. I'm excited to watch him lead Vistra to continued success.\n\nThank you for your interest in Vistra-as always, we look forward to its future!\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Growth and transforms ation. Vistra'sstrategy is to responsibly and reliablya grow our business through economically attractive investments in retail, renewablea , and energy storage assets thatassist in reducing our carbon footprint and create a more sustainablea and resilient company well positioned togeneratestablea long-term value for allofour stakeholders. Since 2010, Vistra has retired more than12,000 MW of coaland gas power plants resulting in a45% reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG emissions), a45% reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2)emissions, a 55% reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOX)emissions, and a 75% reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions through year-end 2020, compared to a2010 baseline. Now, we are transforming our generation portfolio through investments in zero-carbon resources and new carbon-reducing technologies, targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. By year-end 2026, our Vistra Zero portfolio is expected to grow to 7,300 MW of zero-carbon generation, including solar, energy storage and our Comanche Peaknuclear power plant. Additionally, we have announced the retirement of approximately 7,500 MW of coal-fueledpower plants by 2027, with plans to repurposefeaff sible sites to solar and energy storage developments. Repurposedsites provide a strategic advantage in the development of greener powerdued to the interconnection infrastructuret already available, but additionally, and importantly, they allow us to continue supporting the localcommunities and our employees in those areas. We believe our diversified assetmix will support the reliability of the electric system while providing customers with cost-effeff ctive energy thatmeets their sustainable preferences throughout the clean powertransition. Our growth strategy leverages our core capabia lities of multi-channel retailmarketing in large and competitive markets, operating large-scale,environmentally sensitive, and diverse assets across a variety offuelff technologies, fuel logistics and management, commodity risk management, cost control, and energy infrastructuret investing. To advance our sustainability and energy transition initiatives, in December2021, we adoptedour Green FinanceFramework, pursuant to which we issued$1.0 billion of SeriesB Preferred Stock to finance or refinance, in whole or in part,new or existing eligible green projects. We intend to opportunistically evaluate the acquisition and development of high-quality generation and storage assets and powerrelated businesses, including renewable energy and battery storage assets as well as retail businesses, that complement our core capabia lities and align with our operational,finaff ncialand sustainability goals. We pride ourselvesonour deliberate and responsible approachtogrow and transform, considering impacts on allstakeholders. We make disciplined investments thatare consistent with our focus on maintaining both a strong balancesheetand strong liquidity profile and our commitment to ensuring grid reliabila ity, affordablea power, and pursuit of ajust transition away from carbon-emitting generation assets for the communities inwhich we operate and serve. As a result, consistent with our disciplined capita al allocationapprovaa l process, the growth opportunities we pursue must have compelling economicvalue and alignwith or enhanceour purpose andcore principles.\n- \u00b7 Disciplinedcapital allocation. Vistra takes a disciplined approachtocapital allocation insupport of our commitment to maintain a strong balancesheet. We thoughtfully make capita al allocationdecisions that we believe will lead to attractive cash returnson investment, including returningt capita al to our stockholders through quarterly dividends and our share repurchase program as reflected in our current plans to returnt up to $7.5 billion in capita al to common shareholders and reduceuptu o $3 billion in debt (exclusiveof potential limited recourse project financing) through 2026. In addition to our dedicatedapproaa ch to returningt value to allstakeholders, we invest prudently in the maintenance of our existing assets and potential growth acquisitions. Astrong balancesheet ensures Vistra's interest expense is manageable in a variety ofwholesale power priceenvironments while giving Vistra access to flexible and diverse sourcesofliquidity needed to make prudent capita al investment decisions. Webelieve in cost discipline and strong commercial managementofour assets and commodity positions to deliver long-term value to our stakeholders, to maintainthe safetyat nd reliabila ityofour facilities, allwhile acceleratinggrowth in our Vistra Zero portfolio pipeline with cost-efficient capita aland investment in new technologies when economic, including solar assets and energy storage systems, resulting in a continuedmodernization of Vistra's generation fleet.\n- \u00b7 Integratede businessmodel. Our integratedbusinessmodel is an important component of our businessstrategy. This element of our business provides long-term sustainablesolutions enablea dbyour diversifiedportfolio. This key factor distinguishes us from our electricity competitors by pairing our reliablea and efficient mining, diversified generation fleet and wholesale commodity risk management capabia lities with our retail platform. Coupling retail with generation is a core competitive advantage that reduces the effects of commodity pricemovements and contributes to stableearnings and predictablecashflow,ff a crucialfeaff ture of the strategy as Vistraresponsibly grows itsrenewables portfolio andwinds down itscarbon-emr itting assets.",

Substantially allofthese activities are conducted by TXU Energy, Ambit Energy, Value Based Brands, Dynegy Energy Services, Homefield Energy, TriEagle Energy, PublicPower and U.S. Gas & Electric across 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe largest portion of our retailoperations are in Texas, where we provide retailelectricity to approximately 2.4 million customers in ERCOT. We are an activeparticipant in the competitive ERCOT retailmarketand continue to be amarket leader, whichwebelieve is drivenby, among otherthings, strong brands, innovative products and services and excellent customer service. AsofDecember 31, 2021, we providedelectricity to approximately 30% of the residential customers in ERCOT and for approximately 15% of business customers' demand. We believe thatwe have differentiatedourselvesbyproviding a distinctive customerexperience predicatedondelivering reliablea and innovative power products and solutions to our customers, whichgive our customers choice, convenience and control over how and when theyuse electricity and related services. Our retailbusiness also offers a comprehensive suiteofgreen products and services, including 100% wind and solaroptions, as well as thermostats, dashboards and other programs designed toencourage reducedconsumptim on and increasedenergy efficiency.\n\nOur integratedpower generation and wholesaleoperation allows us to efficiently obtain the electricity needed to serve our customers at the lowest cost. The integratedmodelenablea sus tostructure products and contracts in a way thatoffers significant value compared tostand-alone retailelectric providers. Additionally, our wholesalecommodity risk management operations help protect our retailbusiness from power pricevolatility by allowing us to bypass bid-ask spread in the market (particularly for illiquid products and time periods) and achieve lowercollateral costs for our retailbusiness ascompared to other, non-integratedretailelectric providers. Moreover, our retailbusiness reduces, to some extent, the exposure of our wholesale generation business to wholesale power pricevolatility. This is because the retail loadrequirementsofour retail operations provide anaturalt offset to the length of Luminant's generation portfolio thereby reducing the exposure to wholesale power pricevolatilityascompared to a non-integrated independent power producer.\n\nOutside of ERCOT, we also serve residential,municipal, commercialand industrial customers substantially through our Homefield Energy, Dynegy Energy Services, PublicPower, U.S. Gas & Electric and Ambit Energy retailbusinesses, through which we provide retailelectricity,naturalt gas and related services to approximately 1.9 million customers in 18 states and the DistrictofColumbia.",

See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for a summaryorr four solar andbattery energy storage projects.\n\nERCOT - ERCOT is an ISO thatmanages the flow of electricity from approximately 86,000 MW of summer peak generation capaa city to approximately 26 million Texas customers, representing approximately 90% of thestate's electric load.\n\nAs an energy-only market, ERCOT's market design is distinctfromff othercompetitive electricity markets inthe U.S. Other marketsmaintainaminimum planning reserve margin through regulated planning, resource adequacy requirements and/ or capaca ity markets. In contrast, ERCOT's resource adequacy is predominately dependent on energy-market pricesignals. In 2014, ERCOT implemented the Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC), pursuant to which wholesaleelectricity prices in the real-time electricity market increase automatically as availablea operating reservesdecrease below defined threshold levels, creating aprice adder. The slope of the ORDC curve is determined through amathematical loss of load probability calculation using forecastedreserves and historicaldata. In both March 2019 and March 2020, ERCOT implemented 0.25 standard deviation shifts in the loss of load probability calculation and moved tousing a single blended ORDC curve; these changes resulted in amore rapidescalation in power prices as operating reservesfalff lbelow defined thresholds. Effective January 1, 2022, when operating reservesdrop to 3,000 MW or less, the ORDC automatically adjud sts power prices to the established value of lost load (VOLL), which is set at $5,000/MWh which is equal to the high system-wide offer cap.a ERCOT also calculates the \"peakernet margin\" based on revenues a hypotheticalunhedgedpeaking unit would collect in the market. Ifthe peaker net margin exceeds a certain threshold, the system-wide offer capia sreduced to the low system-wide offer capoa f$2,000/MWh for the remainderofthe calendar year. The peaker net margin exceeded the threshold for the firsttime during WinterStorm Uri, and as aresultthe low system-wideoffer capwa as in place for the balance of 2021. Historically, high demand due to elevated temperaturest in the summer months or high demand due to reduced temperaturest in the winter months, combinedwith underperformance of wind generation, has created the conditions during which the ORDC contributesmeaningfully to power prices. Extreme weather conditions canalso lead to scarcityconditions regardless of season. Otherthan during periods of \"scarcitypricing,\" the priceof power is typically setby naturalt gas-fueled generationfacff ilities(see Item7. Management's Discussion and Analysisll of Financial Condition and Resultsott fO o pe O rations -KeyKK Operational Risksii and Challenges ).\n\nTransactions in ERCOT take place in two key markets: the day-aheadmarketand the real-time market. The day-ahead market is a voluntary, financial electricity market conducted the day before each operating day in which generators and purchasers of electricity may bid for one or more hours of electricity supply or consumption. The real-timemarket is aphysical market in which electricity is dispatched and priced in five-minute intervals. The day-ahead market provides market participants withvisibilityintowhere prices are expected to clear, and the prices are not impactedby subsequent events. Conversely, the real-time market exposes purchasers to the riskof transient operational events and pricespikes. These two markets allow market participants tomanage theirrisk profilebyadjusting their participation in each market. In addition, ERCOT uses ancillary services to maintainsystem reliabia lity, including regulation service, responsive reserve service and nonspinning reserve service. Ancillary services are providedby generators to help maintainthe stablea voltage and frequency requirementsofthe transmission system. Because ERCOT has one of the highest concentrations of wind and solar capaca ity generation among U.S. markets, the ERCOT market is more susceptible toflucff tuations in wholesaleelectricity supply due to intermittent wind and solar production, making ERCOT more vulnerable to periods of generation scarcity. Beginning in July 2021, ERCOT has increased its ancillarysrr erviceprocurement volumes to maintainamore conservative level of operating reserves.",

Market demand, also known as load, faced by electric power systems, suchas those we operate in, varies from moment to moment as aresult of changes in business and residential demand, which is oftendrivenbyweather. Unlike most othercommodities, the production and consumption of electricity must remain balanced on an instantaneous basis. There is a certain baseline demand for electricity across an electric power system that occurs throughout the day, which is typically satisfied by baseload generating unitswith low variable operating costs. Baseload generating unitscan also increase output to satisfy certain incremental demand and reduceoutput when demand is unusually low. Intermediate/load-following generating units, which canmore efficiently change their output to satisfy increases in demand, typically satisfy a large proportion of changes in intraday load as they respond to daily increases in demand or unexpected changes in supply created by reduced generation from renewable resources or othergenerator outages. Peak daily loadsmay be satisfiedff by peaking units. Peaking units are typically the most expensive to operate,but theycan quickly start up and shut down to meet brief peaks in demand. In general,baseload units, intermediate/loadfollff owing units and peaking units are dispatched into the ISO/RTO grid in order from lowestto highest variable cost. Priceformaff tion is typically based on the highest variablecost unit thatclears the market to satisfy system demand atagiven point in time.\n\nOur commodity risk management group also enters into electricity, gas and othercommodity derivative contracts to reduceexposure to changes in prices primarily to hedge future revenues and fuel costs for our generation facilities and purchased powercosts for our Retailsegment.\n\n## Seasonalitll y t t\n\nThe demand for and market prices of electricity and naturalt gas are affectff ed by weather. As aresult, our operating results are impacted by extremeorsustained weather conditions and mayflucff tuate on a seasonal basis. Typically, demand for and the priceofelectricity is higher in the summer and winterseasons, when the temperatures are more extreme, and the demand for and priceofnaturalt gas is alsogenerally higher in the winter. More severe weather conditions suchas heatwaves or extreme winterweather have made, and may makesuchfluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of thisflucff tuation maychange depending on, among other things, the retail load served and the termsofcontracts to purchase or sell electricity.\n\n## Compem titiii on\n\nCompetition in the markets inwhich we operate is impactedby electricity and fuel prices, congestion along the power grid, subsidies providedby state and federal governmentsforff new and existing generation facilities, new market entrants, construction of new generating assets, technologicaladvances in power generation, the actions of environmentaland other regulatory authorities, and otherfacff tors. We primarily competewith otherelectricity generators and retailers basedonour ability to generateelectricsupply, marketand sell electricity at competitiveprices and to efficiently utilize transportation from third-party pipelines and transmission from electric utilities to deliverelectricitytoend-users. Competitors in the generation and retail power markets in which we participate include numerous regulated utilities, industrial companies, non-utility generators, competitive subsidiariesofregulatedutilities, independent power producers, REPs and otherenergy marketers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information concerning therisks faced withrespect to the markets in whichweoperate.\n\n## Brand Value\n\nOur TXU Energy brand, which has beenused to sell electricity to customers in the competitive retailelectricity market in Texas forappa roximately 19years, is registered and protectedbytrademark law and is the only material intellectualt property asset thatweown. We have also acquired the trade namesforff Ambit Energy, Dynegy Energy Services, Homefield Energy, TriEagle Energy, Public Power and U.S. Gas & Electric through the Ambit Transaction, Crius Transaction and the Merger, as thecase may be. As of December31, 2021, we have reflected intangible assets on our balancesheet for our trade namesof approximately $1.341 billion (see Note 6to the FinancialStatements).",

We invest inour people through numerous development and training opportunities, engaging employeeprograms and generous benefit and wellness offerings.\n\nAs of December31, 2021, we had approximately 5,060 full-time employees, including approximately 1,400 employees under collective bargaining agreements.\n\n## Safety\n\nVistra'smindsetaround safetyit sexemplim fiedbyour motto: Best Defenseff .Everyor ne wins.NooNN ne getshtt urt. Our safetyt culture revolves around people and human performance. We place a high importance on continuous improvement, along with a keenfocusff on numerous learning and error-prevention tools. To facilitate alearning environment, our various operating plants share their investigations and learnings of allsafety events with alloperations employees on weekly calls. The information is presented by front-line employees and supported by management. The lessons from each event are shared across the fleet to prevent similar incidents at other locations. All personnel at Vistra locations are encouraged to be actively involved in the safetypt rocess. Managers are required to participate in safetyet ngagementswith staff to enablea constant communication and sustained interaction. In 2021, the generationfleff et conducted more than 57,000 leadership safetyet ngagements across the fleet continuing our employee drivensafetyprogram focused on engagement of allemployees.\n\nOur focus on reducing the severity of injuriesforff both our employees and contractors who work with us has shown positive results. In 2021, we did not have any serious injuries, as determined in accordance with industry standards, or fatalities to our Vistra employees or business partners working at our sites. Although we do not focus on recordable incidents, our Total Recordable Incident rate (TRIR) forthe company was 0.87, betterthanthe second quartile ascompared to the Edison Electric Institutet (EEI) 2020 Total Company Injury Data. Weencourage near-missreporting and review of events to promote alearning environment. In 2021, safetylt earning callswere heldevery week where near-miss and safetyet vents were reviewed by our operating teams to promote learning across thefleff et.\n\nAll Vistra employees are covered by our safetypt rogram. Corporate and retailemployees are required to complete periodic training on safetytt opics through our online learning management system. Employeeswho are located atapower plant are required to complete trainings based on job function, which is also tracked through our central learning management system. Inaddition, the Company engages an independent third-party conformityassessment and certification vendor to manage adherence to our safetyst tandards for allvendors and contractors who work at our plants. In addition, we work closely with our suppliu ers and contractors to ensure our safety practices are upheld.\n\nAll of our power plant facilities have effective healthand safetypt rograms and comply with OSHA regulations. In addition to compliance, our generation fleet has a totalof 12 plants that have beenawarded the Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star designation by the OSHA for superior demonstration of effective safetyat nd healthmanagement systems and for maintaining injury and illness rates below thenationalaveragesforff our industry. Four additional plants have submitted applications and are awaiting review by the OSHA. VPP Star statust is the highest designation of OSHA's Voluntary Protection Programs. The achievement recognizes employers and workers who have implemented effecff tive safetyat nd healthmanagement systems and maintain injury and illness rates below nationalBureauof Labor Statistics averages for their respective industries. These sites are self-sufficient in their ability to control workplace hazards and are reevaluated every three tofiveff years. Additionally, 31 of our power plants and mine locations have adoptedaproactive Behavior Based Safetyat pproa a ch to safetyt which focuses on identifying and providing feedback on at-risk behaviors observed.\n\nIn 2021, we continuedour COVID-19 protections and protocols ensuring thesafety of allofour employees.\n\n## Diversityii ,E y y quityii and Inclusion\n\nWe recognize the value of having a diverse and inclusive workforce. Our diversity includes all the ways we differ, such as age, gender, ethnicity and physical appea arance, as well as underlying differences such as thoughts, styles, religions, nationality, education and numerous othertraits.

With supportu from the company, the wellness team covers the registration costsforff employees to participate in running and cycling events throughout the year.\n\n## Environmental Regulations and RelatedConsiderations\n\nWe are subject to extensive environmental regulation by governmental authorities, including the EPA and the environmentalregulatory bodiesofstates in which we operate. The EPA has recentlyfinaff lized or proposedseveralregulatory actions establia shing new requirements for control of certain emissions from sources, including electricity generation facilities. See Item 1A. Riskii Factors for additional discussion of risks posed to us regarding regulatory requirements. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of litigation related to EPA reviews.\n\nIn January 2021, the Biden administration issued a seriesof Executive Orders, including one titled Protecting Public Healthatt nd the Environment and Restoring SciencetoTacklTT ethe Climate Crisis (the Environment Executive Order) which directed agencies, including the EPA, to review various agency actions promulgated during the prior administration and take action where the previous administration's action conflicts withnational objectives. Severalofthe EPA agency actions discussed below are now subjectto thisreview.\n\n## Climall te Change\n\nThere is continuing attention and interest domestically and internationally about global climate change and how GHG emissions, suchas CO2, contribute toglobalclimate change. GHG emissions from the combustion of fossilfuelff s, primarily by our coal-fueled-generation plants as well as our naturalt gas-fueled generation plants represent thesubstantialmajority of our total GHG emissions. CO2,methane and nitrous oxide are emitted inthiscombustion process, with CO2 representing the largest portion of these GHG emissions. We estimate that our generation facilities producedapproxia mately 108 million short tons of CO2 in the yearended 2021.\n\nTo manage our environmental impactfromff our business activities and reduceour emissions profile, Vistra set emissions reduction targets. Vistra is targeting to achieve a 60% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 equivalent emissions by 2030 as compared to a2010 baseline withalong-term goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, assuming necessary advancements in technology and supportive market constructs and public policy. In furtheranceofVistra's efforts tomeet its net-zero target,Vistra expects todeploy multiple levers to transition the company to operating with net-zero emissions, including decarbonization of existing business lines and diversification into low-emission businesses, primarily renewables and energy storage. We have already taken or announced significant steps to transform our generation portfolio and reduce the emissions profile of our generation fleet, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Solar Developmento Projectstt -Webegancommercial operation of our 180 MW Upton 2 solar facilityin2018.

We expecttoretire an additional 7,486 MW of fossil-fueled generation facilities in Illinois, Ohio and Texas no laterthanyear-end 2027.\n\nSee Note 3 to the Financial Statementsforff discussion of our solarand battery energy storage projects and Note 4to the Financial Statements for discussion of our retirement of generation facilities.\n\n## GHG Emissions\n\nIn July 2019, the EPA finalizedarulerr that repealed the Clean PowerPlan(CPP) that had beenfinaff lized in2015 and establia shed new regulations addressing GHG emissions from existing coal-fueledelectricgeneration units, referred to as the Affordablea Clean Energy (ACE) rule. The ACE ruler developed emission guidelines that states must use when developing plans to regulate GHG emissions from existing coal-fueled electric generating units. In response to challenges brought by Environmentalgroups and certain states, the U.S. Court of Appealsforff the DistrictofColumbia Circuit(D.C.CircuitCourt) vacated the ACE ruler , including the repealofthe CPP in, January 2021 and remanded the rule to the EPA for furtheraction. In October2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted four petitions for certiorari of the D.C. CircuitCourt'sdecision and consolidated the cases forreview. The case is now fully briefed and scheduledforff oral argument in February 2022. Additionally, in January 2021, the EPA, just prior to the transition to the Biden administration, issued afinaff lrulerr settingforthff a significant contribution finding for the purpose of regulating GHG emissions from new, modified, or reconstructedelectricutility generating units. In April 2021, the D.C. CircuitCourt granted the EPA's unopposed motion for voluntary vacaturt and remand of the GHG significant contribution rule. The ACE ruler and the rule on significant contribution are subject to the Environment Executive Orderdiscussedabovea .\n\n## StateRegulation of GHGsHH\n\nMany stateswhere we operate generation facilities have, are considering, or are in some stage of implementing, state-only regulatory programs intended toreduced emissions of GHGs from stationary sources as a means of addressing climatechange.\n\nRegionale Greenhouse Gas Initiative(RGGI)(( -RGGI is a state-drivenGHG emission control program that took effect in 2009 and was initially implementedbyten New England and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. The participating RGGI states implemented a cap-and-trade program. Compliance with RGGIcan be achieved by reducing emissions, purchasing or trading allowances, or securing offsetallowancesfromff an approvedoffset project. We are required to hold allowancesequal to at least50percent of emissions in each of the first two years of the three-year control period.\n\nIn December2017, the RGGI statesreleased an updated modelruler withchanges to the CO2 budget trading program, including an additional 30 percent reduction in the CO2 annual capba ythe year2030, relative to 2020 levels. RGGI is currently conducting its third programreview tobecompleted in 2022 which mayinclude an updated model rule.\n\nOur generating facilities in Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Virginia emitted approximately 8.5 million tons of CO2 during 2021. The spot market priceof RGGI allowances required tooperate these facilities asofDecember31, 2021 was approximately $13.68 per allowance. The spot market priceof RGGI allowances required to operate our affected facilitiesduringd 2022 was approximately $14.01 per allowanceonFebruary 22, 2022. While the cost of allowances required tooperate our RGGI-affectedfacff ilities isexpected to increase in future years, we expectthatthe cost of compliancewould be reflected inthe power market, and the actual impact to gross margin would be largely offsetby an increase in revenue.\n\nMassachusettstt -InAugust 2017, the MassachusettsDepartment of EnvironmentalProtection (MassDEP) adopted final rulesestablia shing an annualdeclining limitonaggregate CO2 emissions from 21 in-state fossil-fueledelectricity generation units. The rulesestablia sh an allowance trading system under which the annual aggregate electricity generation unit sector capa on CO2 emissions declines from 8.96 million metric tons in 2018 to 1.8 million metric tons in 2050. MassDEP allocated emissionallowances to affected facilitiesforff 2018. Beginning in 2019, the allocation process transitioned to a competitive auction process whereby allowances are partially distributed through a competitive auction process and partially distributed based on the process and scheduleestablia shed by the rule. Beginning in 2021, allallowances were distributed through the auction. Limitedbanking of unused allowances is allowed.",

The program is based on the RGGI proposed2017 modelrulerr and linked Virginia to RGGI in 2021. The Governor of Virginia issued an Executive Order in January 2022 to beginthe process of removing the statefromff RGGI; however, the Virginia General Assembly would need tomodify the law toexit the program. Atthis time, no new laws have passed and Virginiaremains in RGGI.\n\nNewJersJJ ey -InJanuary 2018, the Governor of New Jersey signed an executive order directing the state's environmental agency and publicutilities board to beginthe process of rejoining RGGI, and New Jerseyformaff lly rejoined RGGI in June 2019. In June 2019, New Jersey adopted two rules thatgovern New Jersey's reentry into the RGGIauction and distribution of the RGGIauction proceeds.\n\nCalifornia -Our assets in Californiaare subject to the Californiaff Global Warming Solutions Act, which required the Californiff aAir ResourcesBoard (CARB) to develop a GHG emission control program to reduceemissions of GHGs in the state to 1990 levelsby 2020. In April 2015, the Governor of California issued anexecutive order establia shing anew statewide GHG reduction target of 40 percent below 1990 levelsby 2030 to ensure Californiameets its2050 GHG reduction target of 80 percent below 1990 levels. We have participated in quarterly auctions or in secondary markets, as appropriate, tosecure allowances for our affected assets.\n\nIn July 2017, California enacted legislation extending itsGHG cap-and-ta rade program through 2030 and the CARB adopted amendments to its cap-and-ta rade regulations that, among otherthings, establia shed aframff ework for extending the program beyond 2020 and linking the program to the new cap-a and-trade program in Ontario, Canada beginning in January 2018.\n\n## AirEi mi E E ssio i i ns\n\n## The Clean Air Act (CAA)A\n\nThe CAA and comparablea state laws and regulations relating to air emissions impose various responsibilitiesonowners and operators of sources of airemissions, which include requirements to obtain construction and operating permits, pay permit fees, monitor emissions, submit reports and compliancecertifications, and keep records. The CAA requires thatfossil-fueled electricity generation plants meet certain pollutant emission standards and have sufficient emission allowances to coverSO2 emissions and in some regions NOX emissions.\n\nIn order to ensure continuedcompliancewith the CAA and related rules and regulations, we utilize various emission reduction technologies. These technologies include flue gas desulfurizff ation (FGD) systems, dry sorbent injection (DSI), baghouses and activated carbon injection or mercury oxidation systemsonselect units and electrostatic precipitators, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems, low-NOX burners and/or overfire airsystemsonall units.

        "page_content": "In October2017, the EPA issued afinaff lrulerr addressing BART for Texas electricity generationunits, with the rule serving as apartial approval of Texas'2009 State Implementation Plan(SIP) and apartialFederal Implementation Plan (FIP). For SO2, the rule establia shed an intrastate Texas emission allowance trading program as a \"BART alternative\"thatoperates inasimilar fashion to a CSAPR trading program. The program includes 39 generating units(including the Martin Lake, Big Brown, Monticello, Sandow 4, Coleto Creek, Stryker 2 and Graham 2plants). The complianceobligations in the program started on January 1, 2019. For NOX, the rule adopted the CSAPR's ozone program as BART and for particulate matter, the rulerr approved Texas's SIP thatdetermines thatnoelectricity generation units are subject to BARTforff particulate matter. InAugust 2020, the EPA issuedafinaff lruler affirming the prior BART finaff lruler but also included additional revisions thatwere proposed in November2019. Challenges to both the 2017 rule and the 2020 rules have beenconsolidated inthe D.C. Circuit Court, where we have intervened insupport of the EPA. We are in compliancewith therulerr , and the retirements of our Monticello, Big Brown and Sandow 4 plants have enhanced our ability to comply. The BART ruler is subjectto the Environment Executive Order discussed above, and the EPA has stated it isstarting aproceeding for reconsideration of the BART ruler . The challenges in theD.C.Circuit Court have been held in abeyance pending the EPA's action on reconsideration.\n\n## National Ambient Air QualityStt ta S ndards (NAAQS)\n\nThe CAA requires the EPA to regulateemissions of pollutants considered harmful to public healthand the environment. The EPA has established NAAQS for six such pollutants, including SO2 and ozone. Eachstate is responsible for developing a SIP that will attain andmaintainthe NAAQS. These plans may result in the imposition of emission limits on our facilities.\n\n## SO2 Designatii ons for Texasee\n\nIn November2016, the EPA finalized its nonattainment designations for countiessurrounding our Martin Lake generation plant and our now-retired Big Brown and Monticello plants. The finaldesignations require Texas to develop nonattainment plans for these areas. In February 2017, the Stateof Texas and Luminant filed challenges to the nonattainment designations in the U.S. Court of Appealsforff the Fifth Circuit(FifthCircuit Court). Subsequentu ly, in October2017, the Fifth CircuitCourt granted the EPA's motion to hold the case in abeyanceconsidering the EPA's representation that it intended to revisit the nonattainment rule. InDecember2017, the TCEQ submiu tted apetition for reconsideration to the EPA. In August 2019, the EPA issued a proposed Error Correction Rule for all three areas, which, if finalized, would have revised its previous nonattainment designations and eachareaat issue would be designatedunclassifiablea . InAugust 2020, the EPA issued a Finding of Failure for Texas to submit an attainment plan. In May 2021, the EPA finalized a\"CleanData\"determination for the areassurrounding the retired Big Brown and Monticello plants, redesignating those areas as attainment based on monitoring data supporting an attainment designation. In June 2021, the EPA published two notices; one that itwas withdrawing the August 2019 Error Correction Rule and a second separate notice denying petitions from Luminant and the Stateof Texas to reconsider the original nonattainment designations. We, along with the Stateof Texas, challenged that EPA action and have consolidated it withthe pending challenge in the Fifth CircuitCourt, withthe matter likely being fully briefed by March 2022. In September2021, the TCEQ consideredaproposal for itsnonattainment SIP revision for the Martin Lake areaand an agreed order to reduce SO2 emissions from the plant. The proposed agreed order associatedwith the SIP proposal reduces emission limits as of January 2022. Emission reductions required are those necessary to demonstrate attainment withthe NAAQS. The TCEQ's SIP action was finalized inFebruary 2022 and willbesubmitted to the EPAforff review and approval.\n\n## Ozone Designatii ons\n\nThe EPA issuedafinaff lruler in October2015 lowering the ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Areas surrounding our Dicks Creek, MiamiFort and Zimmer facilities inOhio, our Calumetfacff ilityin Illinois and our Wise, Ennis and Midlothianfaciff lities in Texas were designated marginalnonattainment areas inJune 2018 by the EPA with an attainment deadline of August 2021. The EPA is required to take actiononareas thatdid not attain by thatdate by bumping up the region to a \"moderate\" designation with an attainment deadline of August 2024. States willberequired to develop SIPs to address emissions in areaswithahigher(more stringent) classification.\n\nIn 2016, the EPA finalized the Cross-StateAir Pollution Rule Update (CSAPR Update) to address 22 states' obligations with respect to the 2008 ozone NAAQS. In 2019, following challengesby numerous parties, the D.C. Circuit Court found that the CSAPR Updatedid notfully addresscertain states'2008 ozone NAAQS obligations.

At present,CCR is regulatedbythe states as solid waste.\n\n## CoalCombustCC ion Residualsll\n\nThe EPA's CCR ruler , which took effect in October2015, establia shes minimum federal requirements for the construction, retrofitting, operation and closure of, and corrective actionwith respectto, existing and new CCRlandfills and surface impoundments, as wellas inactive CCR surfaceff impoundments. The requirements include location restrictions, structuralt integrity criteria,groundwatermonitoring, operating criteria, liner design criteria, closure and post-closure care, recordkeeping and notification. The deadlines for beginning and completing closure vary depending on several facff tors. The Water Infrastructure Improvementsforff the NationAct (the WIIN Act), which was enacted in December2016, providesforff EPA review and approval of state CCR permit programs.\n\nIn August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a decision thatvacates and remands certain provisions of the 2015 CCR rule, including an applicability exemption for legacy impoundments. In August 2020, the EPA issuedafinaff lruler establishing a deadline of April 11, 2021 to cease receipt of waste and initiateclosure at unlined CCRimpoundments. The finalruler allows a generation plant to seek the EPA's approvaltoextend thisdeadline if no alternative disposal capaca ityis availablea and eithera conversion to comply with the CCR rulrr e isunderway or retirement will occur by either2023 or 2028 (depending on the size of the impoundment at issue). Prior to the November 2020 deadline, we submitted applications to the EPA requesting compliance extensions under both conversion and retirement scenarios. In November2020, environmentalgroups petitionedforff review of thisrulerr in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Vistra subsidiariesfilff ed amotion to intervene in support of the EPA in December2020. Also, in November2020, the EPA finalizedarulerr that would allow an alternative liner demonstration for certain qualifying facilities. In November2020, we submitted an alternate liner demonstration for one CCR unit atMartin Lake. In August 2021, we submitted arequest to transfer our conversion application for the Zimmer facility to aretirement application following announcement that Zimmer will close by May 31, 2022. In January 2022, the EPA determined thatour conversion and retirement applications for our CCRfacff ilities werecompletebut has not yet made afinalff determinationonany of those applications.\n\nMISO - In2012, the Illinois EnvironmentalProtection Agency (IEPA) issuedviolation notices alleging violations of groundwaterstandards onsite at our Baldwin and Vermilion facilities' CCR surface impoundments. These violation notices remainunresolved; however, in 2016, the IEPAapproveda our closure and post-closure care plans for the Baldwin old east, east, andwestfly ashCCR surface impoundments. We have completedclosure activities atthose ponds at our Baldwin facility.\n\nAt our retired Vermilion facility, which was not potentially subjectto the EPA's 2015 CCR rulerr untilthe aforementioned D.C.Circuit Court decision in August 2018, we submitted proposed corrective action plans involving closure of two CCR surface impoundments ( i.e. , the old eastand the north impoundments) to the IEPA in2012, and we submitted revised plans in 2014. In May 2017, in response to arequest from the IEPAforff additional information regarding the closure of these Vermilion surface impoundments, we agreed to perform additionalgroundwatersampling and closure options and riverbank stabilizing options. In May 2018, Prairie Rivers Network (PRN)RR filed a citizen suit in federal court in Illinois against our subsidiary Dynegy Midwest Generation, LLC(DMG), alleging violations of the CleanWater Act foralleged unauthorized discharges. In August 2018, we filed amotion to dismiss the lawsuit. In November2018, the district court granted our motion to dismiss and judgment was entered inour favor. In June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appealsforff the SeventhCircuit affiff rmed thedistrict court's dismissalofthe lawsuit, but stated thatPRN may refile. InApril 2019, PRNaRR lsofilff ed a complaint againstDMG before the IllinoisPollution Control Board (IPCB), alleging thatgroundwaterflowsff allegedly associatedwith the ash impoundments at the Vermilionsite haveresulted in exceedancesboth of surface water standards and Illinoisgroundwaterstandards dating backto 1992.

We are addressing these CCR surface impoundments in accordance with thefedeff ral CCR rulerr . InJune 2018, the IEPA issued a violation notice for alleged seep discharges claimed to be coming from the surface impoundments at our retired Vermilion facility, which is owned by our subsidiary DMG, and thatnotice was referredr to the IllinoisAttorney General. In June 2021, the Illinois Attorney General and the VermilionCounty StateAttorneyfilff ed a complaint in Illinoisstatecourt withanagreed interimconsent order which the court subsequently entered. Given the violation notices and the enforcement action, the unique characteristics of the site, and the proximity of thesite to the only national scenic river in Illinois, we agreed toenter into the interim consent order to resolve this matter. Per the terms of the agreed interim consent order, DMG is required toevaluate the closure alternativesunder the requirements of the newly implemented Illinois CoalAsh regulation (discussed below) and close the site by removal. Inaddition, the interim consent order requires that during the impoundment closure process, impacted groundwaterwill be collected before it leaves the siteorenters the nearby Vermilion riverand, if necessary, DMG will be required to install temporary riverbank protection if the rivermigrateswithin a certain distanceofthe impoundments. These proposed closure costs are reflected in theARO in our condensed consolidated balancesheets (see Note 21 to theFinancial Statements).\n\nIn July 2019, coal ash disposal and storage legislation in Illinois was enacted. The legislation addresses state requirementsforff the proper closure of coalash ponds in the stateof Illinois. The law tasks the IEPAand the IPCBtoset up a seriesofguidelines, rules and permit requirements for closure of ash ponds. Under the finalrulr e, which was finalized and becameeffective in April 2021, coalash impoundment owners would be required to submit a closure alternative analysis to the IEPA for the selectionofthe bestmethod for coalash remediation ataparticular site. Therulerr does not mandateclosure by removal atany site. In May 2021, we filed an appeal in the Illinois Fourth JudicialDistrict over certain provisions of the final rule. r r Wefileff dour opening briefinOctober2021. Other parties have also filed appealsofcertain provisions of the finalrulrr e. In October 2021, we filed operating permit applications for 18 impoundments as required by the Illinois coal ash rule, and filed construction permit applications for threeofour sites in January 2022.\n\nFor allofthe above matters, if certain corrective actionmeasures, including groundwatertreatment or removal of ash, are required atany of our coal-fueledfacff ilities, we mayincur significant costs that could have amaterialadverse effect on our financial condition, resultsofoperations, and cashflows. The Illinoiscoalash rule was finalff ized in April 2021 and does not require removal. However, the rule willrequire us to undertake furthersite-specific evaluations requiredby each program. We willnot know the full range of decommissioning costs, including groundwaterremediation, if any, thatultimately may be required under the Illinois rule until permit applications have beensubmitted and approvedbythe IEPA. However, the currently anticipated CCR surface impoundment and landfillclosure costs, as reflected in our existing ARO liabia lities, reflect the costs of closure methods thatour operations and environmentalservices teamsbelieve are appropriate and protective of the environment for each location.\n\n## Water\n\nThe EPA and the environmental regulatory bodiesofstates in which we operate have jurisdictionover the diversion, impoundment and withdrawal of waterforff cooling and other purposes and the discharge of wastewater (including storm water) from our facilities. We believe our facilities are presently in materialcompliancewith applicable federaland state requirements relating to these activities. Webelieve we hold allrequiredpermits relating to these activities forfacff ilities inoperation and have applied for or obtained necessary permits forff facilities under construction. We also believe we can satisfy the requirements necessary to obtainany requiredpermitsorrenewals.\n\nCoolingWateWW r IntakII eS k k truct S ures -Clean Water Act Section316(b) regulations pertaining to existing water intake structures at large generation facilitiesbecameeffective in 2014. This provision generally requires thatthe location, design, construction and capaca ityofcooling water intake structurest reflecff tthe best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Although the rule does not mandate a certain control technology, it does require site-specificff assessments of technology feasibilityon a case-by-casebasis at thestate level.\n\nAt this time, we estimate thecostofour compliance withthe cooling water intake structurerulerr to be minimal at our Illinois plants due to the planned retirements of those plants by 2027. Our estimate could change materially depending upon a variety of factors, including site-specific determinations made by states in implementing the rule, the results of impingement and entrainment studies requiredbythe rule, the results of site-specific engineering studies and the outcome of litigation concerning therulrr e and potential plant retirements.",

Thesefacff tors, in addition to others specifically addressed in Item7.

There may be furtherff risks and uncertainties thatare not currently known or thatare not currently believed to be materialthatmay adversely affect our business, resultsofoperations, liquidity, financial condition and prospects and the market priceofour common stock in the future. The realization of any of these factors could cause investors in our securities (including our common stock) to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment.\n\n## Market, Financial and Economic Risks\n\n## Our revenues, resultsll of operations and operatingii cashflowff sg w enerallyall re affectedbypb ricefluctff uations in the wholesll ale power market and other marketfacff tors beyond our control.ll\n\nWe are not guaranteed any rateofreturnt on capita al investments inour businesses. We conduct integrated power generation and retailelectricity activities, focusing on powergeneration, wholesaleelectricity sales and purchases, retailsales of electricity and naturalt gas to endusers and commodity risk management. Our wholesale and retailbusinesses are to some extent countercyclical innature,t particularly for the wholesale power and ancillary services supplied to the retailbusiness. However, we do have a wholesale power position that issubject to wholesale power pricemoves, which may besignificant. As aresult, our revenues, resultsofoperations and operating cashflows depend in large part upon wholesalemarket prices for electricity, naturalt gas, uranium, lignite, coal, fuel, and transportation in our regional markets and othercompetitive markets in which we operate and upon prevailing retailelectricity rates, which may be impactedby, among otherthings, actions of regulatory authorities.\n\nMarket prices for power, capaca ity, ancillary services, naturalt gas, coal and fuel oil are unpredictable and mayflucff tuate substantially over relatively short periods of time. Unlike most othercommodities, electric power canonly be stored on a very limitedbasis and generally must be producedconcurrently with itsuse. As aresult, power prices are subjecttosignificant volatility due to supply and demand imbalances, especially inthe day-ahead and spot markets. Demand for electricity can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. Over-supply can occur as a result of the construction of new power generation sources, aswe have observed in recent years. During periods of over-supply, electricity prices might be depressed. For example, the cost of electricity from renewable resources, suchas solar, wind and battery storage systems, has dropped substantially inrecent years. Inmanyinstances, energy from these sources are bid into the relevant spot market atapriceof zeroorclose to zero during certain timesofthe day, lowering the clearing priceforff all power wholesalers in such market. Also, attimes there is political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authoritieswith jurisdiction over wholesale and retailenergy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatilityand other issues in these markets.\n\nExtremeweather events canalso materially impact power prices or otherwise exacerbate conditions or circumstances that result in volatility of power prices. For example, in February 2021, the U.S. experienced WinterStorm Uri and extremecold temperaturest in the centralU.S., including Texas. This severe weatherevent substantially increased the demand for naturalt gas used in our electric power generation business, and the cold further limited the availabila ityofrenewable generationacross the region contributing to extremely high market prices for naturalt gas and electricity, which resulted in substantial increases in the costs to procure sufficient fuelsupply and increased collateral posting requirements.\n\nThe majoa rity of our facilitiesoperate as \"merchant\"facff ilitieswithout long-term power sales agreements. As aresult, we largely sell electric energy, capaca ityand ancillary services into the wholesale energy spot market or intootherwholesale and retail power marketson a short-term basis and are not guaranteed any rateofreturnt on our capita al investments. Consequently, there canbeno assurance that we will be able tosell any or allofthe electric energy, capaca ityorancillary services from those facilities atcommercially attractive rates or thatour facilitieswill be able tooperate profitably. We depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power, capaca ityand fuel. Given thevolatility of commodity power prices, to the extent we are unable to hedge or otherwise secure long-term power sales agreementsforff the output of our power generation facilities, our revenues and profitability will be subjeu ct to volatility, and our financial condition, results of operations and cashflows could be materially adversely affectff ed.",

As aresult, we have experienced, and remain subjectto the risks of disruptions or curtailments inthe production of power at our generation facilities if no fuel is available at any price, ifacounterparty fails to perform or if there is a disruption in the fuel deliveryirr nfrastructure.t Certain of our generation facilitiesrely onalimited numberofcounterparties, suchas naturalt gas suppliers and railcar companies, to provide the necessary fuel. Disputesrelating to or non-performanceofcontractualarrangements, have resulted in, and maycontinue to result in adverse impacts toour costs, revenues, resultsofoperations, financial condition, and cashflows.\n\nWe have sold forward a substantial portion of our expected power sales inthe next one to two years in order to lock in long-term prices. In order to hedge our obligations under these forward power salescontracts, we have entered into long-term and short-term contracts for the purchase and delivery of fuel. Manyofthe forward power salescontracts do not allow us to pass through changes in fuel costs or discharge the power sale obligations in the case of a disruption in fuel supply due to force majea ure events or the default of afuelff supplier or transporter. Fuel costs (including diesel, naturalt gas, lignite, coaland nuclear fuel) are volatile, and the wholesale priceforff electricity does not always change at the same rate aschanges in fuel costs, and disruptions in our fuel supplies maytherefore require us to find alternative fuel sources atcosts which may be higherthan planned, to find othersources of power to delivertocounterparties at a highercost, or to pay damages tocounterparties for failure to deliver power as contracted. Long-term and short-term contracts are subjecttorisk of non-delivery or claims of force majea ure, which mayimpactour ability to economically recover the value of the contract. Inaddition, we purchase and sell naturalt gas and otherenergy related commodities, and volatility in these marketsmay affect costs incurred in meeting our obligations. Further, any changes in the costs of naturalt gas, coal,fuelff oil,nuclearfuelff or transportation rates and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affectour financial results.

We have operated certain of our lignite-and coal-fueled generation assets only during partsofthe yearthat have higherelectricity demand and, therefore, higherrelated wholesaleelectricity prices. In connection with the closure and remediation of retired generation units, we have spent, and mayinthe future spend, a significant amount of money, internalresources and time tocomplete the required closure and reclamation, whichcould have amaterialadverse effect on our financialand operating performance.\n\n## Our assets or positions cannot be fully hedgedagainsta changesincii ommodityptt ricesand market heat rates,as nd hedgingn transactions mayna ot work as plannedorhedgedd counterparttt ie t t s may defaulte on theiroii bligations.tt\n\nOur hedging activitiesdonotfully protect us against the risks associated with changes in commodity prices, most notablya electricity and naturalt gas prices, because of the expecteduseful life of our generation assets and the sizeofour position relative to the duration of availablemarketsforff various hedging activities. Generally, commodity markets thatweparticipate in to hedge our exposure to electricity prices and heatrates have limited liquidity after two to three years. Further, our ability to hedge our revenuesbyutilizing cross-commodity hedging strategieswith naturalgas hedging instruments isgenerally limited to aduratd ion of four to five years. To the extent we have unhedgedpositions, fluctuating commodity prices and/or market heat rates can materially impact our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition, either favoraff bly a or unfavorably.a\n\nTo manage our financial exposure related to commodity priceflucff tuations, we routinely enter intocontracts to hedge portions of purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of naturalt gas, lignite, coal, dieselfuel, uranium and refined products, and othercommodities, withinestablia shed risk management guidelines. As part of thisstrategy, we routinely utilize fixed-price forward physical purchase and sale contracts, futures, financial swaps and option contracts traded in over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. Given our exposure to risks of commodity price movements, we devote a considerablea amount of time and effort to the establishment of risk management policies and procedures, as wellas the ongoing review of the implementationofthese policies and procedures. Additionally, we have processes and controls in place thatare designed to monitor and accurately report hedging activities and positions. The policies, procedures, processes and controls in place may not always function as planned and cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities, including unauthorized hedging activity, or improper reporting thereof, by our employees in violation of our existing risk management policies and procedures. For example, we hedge the expectedneeds of our wholesale and retailcustomers, but unexpected changes due to weather, naturalt disasters, consumerbehavior, market constraints or otherfacff tors could cause us to purchase electricity to meet unexpected demand in periods of high wholesalemarket prices or resellexcess electricity into the wholesale market in periods of low prices. As aresult of these and otherfacff tors, the impacts of our commodity hedging activities and risk management decisions mayhave a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, resultsofoperations and cash flows.",

To the extent we do hedge against commodity pricerisk, those hedgesmay ultimately prove to be ineffective. Additionally, there may bechanges to existing laws or regulations that could significantly impactour ability to effectively hedge, which mayhave amaterialadverse effect on us.\n\nWith the continued tightening of credit markets thatbegan in2008 and expansion of regulatory oversight through various financial reforms, there has been a decline inthe numberofmarket participants in thewholesaleenergy commodities markets, resulting in less liquidity.

GAAP permits anentitytodesignate qualifying derivative contracts as normal purchases and sales. If designated, those contracts are not recorded atfairvalue. GAAP also permits an entityto designate qualifying derivative contracts inahedge accounting relationship. If a hedge accounting relationship is used, a significant portion of the changes in fairvalue is not immediately recognized in earnings.

LIBOR is the interest ratebenchmark used as areferencerateon aportion of our variableratedebt, including our revolving credit facility and interest rateswapsa . InNovember2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), the administrator of LIBOR, with the support of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom's FinancialConduct Authority, announced plans to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December31, 2021 for only the one-weekand two-monthUSD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for allotherUSD LIBOR tenors. While this announcement extends the transition period to June 2023, the U.S. Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuancesbythe end of 2021. In light of these announcements, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain and any changes in the methods by whichLIBOR is determinedorregulatory activity related to LIBOR's phaseout could cause LIBOR to perform differentlff ythan inthe pastorcease to exist.

Additionally, in light of what we believe to be faff vorabla erelationships with lending and financial counterparties, we expecttoseek necessary amendments toour remaining debt instruments and other agreementswhich utilize LIBORas the referenced rate inthe normalcourse. Further, certain of our agreementswhich utilize LIBORas the referenced rate are governedbyNew York law, and certain of these contractsdonot containany fallback provisions or otherwise contain fallback provisions that lead to replacement ratebased on LIBOR or require polling for interbank rates.

Over the last several years, the U.S. Congress has considered and debatedseveral proposals intended to address climatechange using different approaches, including a cap on carbon emissions with emitters allowed to trade unused emission allowances (cap-and-traa de), a tax on carbon or GHG emissions, incentives forff the development of low-carbon technology and federal renewabla eportfolio standards. In July 2019, the EPA finalized the ACE rulerr that developedemissions guidelines that states must use when developing plans to regulate GHG emissions from existing coalfueled electricgenerating units. In January 2021, the ACE rulerr wasvacated by the D.C. Circuit Court and remanded to the EPA for furtherconsideration in accordance withthe court's ruling. The D.C. Circuit's decision has beenappeaa led to the U.S. Supreme Court and oral argument is scheduled forff February 2022. The EPA may develop a more stringent and more encompassing rule to replace the ACE ruler in its remandproceeding and has beendirected by the Biden Administration to review this rule and others promulgated by the EPA during the Trump Administration.

Although the Paris Agreementdoes not create any binding obligations for nations to limittheir GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limitorreducefutureff emissions, and various corporations, investors and U.S. states and local governments have previously pledged to furtherthe goalsofthe Paris Agreement. Additionally, the Biden Administration has directed certain agencies tosubmit a plan to the National Climate Task Force to achieve a carbon-pollr ution-free electricity sector by 2035. The Company's planto transition to clean power generation sources and reduce its GHG emissions may not be completed inthis timeframeff and we may not otherwise achieve our sustainability and emissions reduction targets asexpected.

These emerging technologiesmay also affect the financial viabila ity of utility counterparties and could have significant impacts on wholesale market prices, which couldultimately have amaterialadverse effect on our financial condition, resultsofoperations and cash flows could be materially adversely affecff ted.\n\n## The loss of the services of our key management and personnelcould adversely affectour abilitll yttt os t t uccessfullyll operate our businesseii s.\n\nOur future success will depend on our ability to continue to attractand retain highly qualified personnel. Wecompete for such personnel withmanyothercompanies, in and outside of our industry, government entities and otherorganizations. We may not be successful in retaining current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel inthe future. Further, we are facing an increasingly competitive market for hiring and retaining skilled employees in certain skill areas, which isexacerbated by the effectsofthe COVID-19 pandemic and increased acceptance of hiring remoteworking employeesbyour competitors and othercompanies. Difficulff ties in attracting and retaining highly qualified skilled employeesmay restrictour ability to adequately support our business needs and/or result in increased personnelcosts. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to timely andeffectively ensure transferofknowledge and smooth transitions involving senior management andother key personnel could hinderour strategic planning andexecution.",

AsofDecember 31, 2021, Vistra had long-term agreements to procure renewabla eenergy creditsfromff approximately 915 MW of renewable generation. Theserenewable generationsources deliver electricity when conditions make themavailable, and, whenon-line, they generally competewith baseload units. Because they cannot be relied upon to meet demand continuously due to their dependence on weather and time of day, these generation sources are categorized as non-dispatchablea and create the needforff intermediate/load-following resources torespond to changes in their output.\n\n## FuelSupplSS y l l\n\nNuclear We own and operate two nucleargeneration units atthe Comanche Peak plant site in ERCOT, each of which is designed for a capacityof 1,150 MW. Comanche Peak Unit 1 and Unit 2 went intocommercial operation in 1990 and 1993, respectively, and are generally operated atfullff capaca ity. Refuelff ing (nuclearfuelff assembly replacement) outages for each unit are scheduled tooccur every eighteen months during the spring or falloff-peakdemand periods. Every three years, the refueling cycle results in the refueling of both unitsduringd the same year, which occurred in 2020. Whileone unit is undergoing arefueling outage, the remaining unit is intended tooperate at full capaa city. During arefueling outage, other maintenance,modification and testing activities are completed thatcannot be accomplished when the unit is in operation. The Comanche Peak facility operated atacapacityfacff tor of 96%, 97% and 96% in 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively.\n\nWe have contracts in place for allofour 2022 and 2023 nuclearfuelff requirements.

Maintenanceoutages at theseunits are scheduledduringd the spring or falloff-peakdemand periods. We meet our fuel requirements at our coal-fueled generation facilities in PJMand MISO with coal purchased from multiple suppliers under contracts of various lengths and transported to the facilities by eitherrailcar or barges.

In addition, in anticipation of WinterStorm Uri we tookadditional steps to prepare, including procuring ddi addi iti l onal ddemiine l rali d ized water supplypplyu traililers to ensure ffi sufficiient wateravailil biabilili yty to run for ext d endedd p i eri dods d and i verifyingfying h that freeze protectiion i circ iuitswereoperatiionall.\n\nThissevere weather resulted in surging demand for power, gas supply shortages, operational challenges for generators, and a significant loadshed event ( i.e. , involuntary outages to customers across the system for varying periods of time) thatwas orderedbyERCOT beginning on February 15, 2021 and continuing through February 18, 2021. Despite these challenges, we estimate that our fleet generated approximately 25 to 30% of the power on the grid during the height of the outages, as compared toour approximately 18% market share.\n\nThe weather event resulted in a$2.2 billion negative impactonthe Company's pre-tax earnings in the yearended December 31, 2021 (see Note 1 to the Financial Statements), after taking into account approximately $544 million in securitization proceeds Vistra expects to receive from ERCOTas furtherdescribed below. The primary drivers of the loss were the need to procure power in ERCOT at market prices at or nearthe pricecap due to lower output from our naturalt gas-fueled power plants driven by naturalt gas deliverability issues and our coal-fueled power plants driven by coal fuelff handling challenges, high fuel costs, and high retail load costs.",

        "page_content": "As part of the 2021 regular Texas legislativesessions and in response to extraordinary costs incurredby electricity market participants during WinterStorm Uri, the Texas legislature passed House Bill (HB) 4492 for ERCOT toobtain financing to distribute to load-serving entities(LSEs) thatwerecharged and paid to ERCOT exceptionally high price adders and ancillary servicecosts during WinterStorm Uri. In October2021, the PUCTissued a debt obligation order approving ERCOT's $2.1 billion financing and the methodology for allocation of proceeds to the LSEs. In December2021, ERCOT finalized the amount of allocations to the LSEs, and we expecttoreceive $544 million in proceeds from ERCOT in the second quarter of 2022. We concluded thatthe threshold for recognizing areceivablewas met inDecember2021 as the amounts to be received are determinablea and ERCOT was directed by itsgoverning body, the PUCT, to take allactions required to effectuatt e the $2.1 billion funding approved inthe debt obligation order. Accordingly, we recognized the $544 million in expected proceeds as an expense reduction in the fourth quarter of 2021 withinfuelff , purchased power costs and delivery fees inour consolidated statementsofoperation.\n\nWe continue to be subjectto the outcome of potential litigationarising from thisevent (including any litigation thatwe maypursue or be aparty to); or any corrective actiontaken by the Stateof Texas, ERCOT, the RCT, or the PUCT toresettle pricing across any portion of the supply chain that iscurrently being considered or may beconsidered by any such parties. The Texas legislaturet also continues to consider potential legislation, suchas SenateBill(SB) 1580, which was passed in May 2021. SB 1580 mayimpactthe totalamount of balances owed by electriccooperatives to the market. The potential impactofthis legislation is uncertain as the final details will be specific toeachelectric cooperative.\n\nThere have beenseveral announcedeffortsbythe state and federal governments and regulatory agencies to investigate and determine the causes of thisevent and its impactonconsumers. We have received a civil investigative demand from the Attorney Generalof Texas as well as requests for information from ERCOT, NERC and otherregulatory bodiesrelated to this event and may receive additional inquiries. We are cooperating with these entities and have responded to these requests. Those effortsmay result in changes in regulations that impactour industry including but not limited to additional requirements for winterization of various facetsofthe electricity supplyu chain including generation, transmission, and fuel supply; improvements in coordination among the various participants in the electricity andnaturalt gas supplyu chains during any future event; potential revisions to the method or calculation of market compensation and incentivesrelating to the continued operation of assets that only run periodically, including during extremeweather events or othertimes of scarcity; and restrictions or limitations on the typesof plans permitted to be offered to customers. We are continuing to monitor thissituation as it develops. The full impact of litigation or any impacts of any legislative or regulatory changes or actions (including enforcement actions thatmay be brought against various market participants) that mayoccuras a result of the event could have amaterial impact on our business, financial condition, resultsofoperations, or cash flows, but cannot be estimated atthis time. See Note 13 to the FinancialStatements for furtherdiscussion of these matters.\n\nIn response to the storm, Vistra committed to donate $5million to assistTexas communities and individuals meet their most pressing needs, including support for food banks and food pantries, criticalneeds, bill payment assistance, and more. Vistra also assuredresidential customers across itsretailbrands that they would not see any near-term impactontheir rates due to thewinter weatherevent, though bills could increase due to high usage during thecold weather period in February 2021.\n\nFurthermore, Vistra has taken or intends to take various actions to improve itsrisk profileforff future weather-driven volatility events, including investing in improvements tofurtheff r harden its coalfuelff handling capabia lities and to further weatherize its ERCOTfleet foreven coldertemperaturest and longerduratd ions; carrying more backup generation into the peak seasons after accounting for weatherization investments and ERCOT market improvements implemented going forward; contracting for incremental gas storage to support itsgas fleet; adding additional dual fuel capabila ities at its gas steam units and increasing fuel oil inventory at itsexisting dual fuel sites; participating in processes with the PUCT and ERCOT for registration of gas infrastructure as criticalresources with the transmission and distribution utilities and for enhancedwinterization of both gas andpower assets in thestate; and engaging in processes toevaluate potential market reforms.\n\n## Climate Change, Investmentstt in CleanEneEE rgy and CO2 Reductions\n\nEnvironmental Regulate ions - We are subjeu ct to extensive environmental regulation by governmental authorities, including the EPA and the environmental regulatory bodiesofstates in whichweoperate.

        "page_content": "## Key Operational Risks and Challenges\n\nFollowing is a discussion of certain key operational risks and challengesfacff ing management and the initiatives currently underway to manage such challenges. Thesematters involve risks thatcould have amaterial effeff ct on our business, resultsof operations, liquidity, financial condition, cash flows, reputation, prospects and the market priceforff our securities (including our common stock). See also Item 1A. Riskii Factors in this annual report on Form 10-K for additionaldiscussion on risks that could have amaterial effeff ct on our resultsofoperations, liquidity, financial condition, cash flows, reputation, prospects and the market priceforff our securities(including our common stock).\n\n## Natural Gas Price and MarketHeatHH Rate Exposure\n\nThe priceof power is typically setby naturalt gas-fueled generationfacff ilities, with wholesale prices generally tracking increases or decreases in the priceofnaturalt gas, with exceptions suchas those periods during whichERCOT power prices rise significantly as a result of the scarcity of available generation resourcesrelative to power demand. In recent years,naturalgas supply has outpaceddemand primarily as aresultof development and expansion of hydraulic fracturing in naturalt gas extraction; thissupply/demand environment has resulted in historically low naturalt gas prices, and such prices have historically beenvolatile.\n\nIn contrast to our naturalt gas-fueled generationfacff ilities, changes in naturalt gas prices have no significant effect on the cost of generating power at our nuclear-, lignite-and coal-fueledfacff ilities. Consequently, allotherfacff tors being equal, these nuclear-, lignite-and coal-fueled generation assets increase or decrease in value as wholesale electricity prices change either as aresult of changes in naturalt gas prices or market heatrates, because of the effectonour operating margins. A persistent decline in the priceofnaturalt gas, if not offsetby an increase in market heatrates, would likely have amaterialadverse effect on our resultsofoperations, liquidity and financial condition, predominantly related to the production of power generation volumes in excess of thevolumesutilized to serviceour retail customer load requirements and wholesale hedges.\n\nThe wholesale market priceofelectricity divided by the market priceofnaturalt gas represents the market heatrate. Market heatratecan be affecff tedbyanumber of factors, including generation availability, mix ofassets and theefficiency of the marginalsupplier(generally naturalt gas-fueled generationfacff ilities) in generating electricity. Our market heatrate exposure is impactedbychanges in the availabila ityofgeneration resources, suchas additions and retirements of generation facilities, and mix ofgeneration assets. For example, increasing renewable (wind and solar) generation capaca ity generally depressesmarket heatrates, particularly during periods when total demand is relatively low. However, increasing penetration of renewable generation capaca ity may also contribute to greater volatility of wholesalemarket prices independent of changes in the priceof naturalt gas, giventheir intermittent nature.t Decreases in market heatratesdecrease the value of our generation assets because lower market heatrates result in lower wholesale electricity prices, and viceversa.\n\nAs aresult of our exposure to the variability of naturalt gas prices and market heatrates, retailsales and hedging activities are criticaltoour operating results and maintaining consistent cashflow levels.\n\nOur integratedpower generation and retailelectricity business providesusopportunities to hedge our generation position utilizing retailelectricity markets as a sales channel. In addition, our approach to managing electricity pricerisk focusesonthe following:\n\n- \u00b7 employing disciplined, liquidity-efficient hedging and risk management strategies through physicaland financial energy-relatedcontracts intended to partially hedge gross margins;\n- \u00b7 continuing focus on cost management to betterwithstand gross marginvolatility;\n- \u00b7 follff owing aretail pricing strategy thatappropriaa tely reflects the value of our product offering to customers, the magnitudet andcostsofcommodity price, liquidity riskand retail demand variability; and\n- \u00b7 improving retail customerservice to attractand retain high-value customers.\n\nWe haveengaged in natural gas hedging activities tomitigate the riskoflowerwholesale electricity prices that have corresponded to declines in natural gas prices. When naturalgas prices are depressed, we continue to seekopportunities to manage our wholesale power price exposure through hedging activities, including forward wholesale and retail electricity sales.",

Based on numbers of meters, our total retailcustomercounts increased approximately 3%, 1% and 2% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based upon December31, 2021 resultsdiscussed below in Results of Operations , a1% decline in retailcustomers in ERCOT would result in a decline in annualrevenues of approximately $56 million. In responding to the competitive landscape in the ERCOT market, we have attempted to reduceoverall customer lossesby focusingff on the following key initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintaining competitive pricing initiatives on residential serviceplans;\n- \u00b7 Actively competing for new customers in areas open to competition within ERCOT, while continuing to strive to enhance the experience of our existing customers; we are focused on continuing to implement initiatives thatdeliver world-class customerservice and improve theoverallcustomerexperience;\n- \u00b7 Establishing and leveraging our TXU Energy TM brand in the sale of electricity to residential and commercial customers, as the most innovative retailer inthe ERCOT marketby continuing to develop tailored product offerings to meet customer needs; and\n- \u00b7 Focusing market initiatives largely on programs targeted at retaining the existing highest-value customers and to recapturingt customers who have switched REPs, including maintaining and continuously refining a disciplined contracting and pricing approachand economicsegmentation of the businessmarket to enhance targeted sales and marketing efforts and to more effectively deploy our direct-salesforceff ; tactical programswe have initiated include improved customer service, aided by an enhancedcustomer management system,new product price/serviceofferings and amultichannel approach for thesmall businessmarket.\n\n## ExposuresRelated to Nuclear Asset Outagestt\n\nOur nuclearassets are comprised of two generation units atthe Comanche Peak facility,each with an installednameplate generation capaca ityof 1,150 MW. As of December31, 2021, these unitsrepresentedapproxia mately 6% of our total generation capaca ity. The nucleargeneration unitsrepresent our lowestmarginalcost source of electricity. Assuming both nuclear generation unitsexperienced anoutage at the same time, theunfavorablea impactto pretax earnings is estimated (based upon forward electricity market prices for 2022 atDecember 31, 2021) to be approximately $2 million per day before consideration of any costs to repairthe causeofsuch outages or receipt of any insurance proceeds. Alsosee discussion of nuclear facilities insurance inNote 13 to the FinancialStatements to understand the importance and limits of our insuranceprotection.\n\nThe inherent complexities and related regulations associated with operating nuclear generation facilities result in environmental, regulatory and financial risks. The operation of nucleargeneration facilities issubject to continuing review and regulation by the NRC, covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security, and environmentaland safety protection. The NRCmay implementchanges in regulations thatresult in increased capita al or operating costs and may require extended outages, modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose finesforff failure to comply with itsexisting regulations and the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act. In addition, an unplanned outage at another nucleargeneration facility couldresult in the NRC taking actiontoshut down our Comanche Peak units as aprecautionary measure.\n\nWe participate in industry groups and with regulators to keepcurrent on the latestdevelopments in nuclear safety, operation and maintenance and on emerging threats and mitigating techniques. These groups include,butare not limited to, the NRC, the Institutet of Nuclear PowerOperations (INPO) and the Nuclear Energy Institutet (NEI). We also apply the knowledge gained through our continuing investment in technology, processes and services to improve our operations and to detect, mitigate and protect our nuclear generation assets.

As aresult, our operating results are impacted by extremeorsustained weather conditions and mayflucff tuate on a seasonal basis. Typically, demand for and the priceofelectricity is higher in the summer and winterseasons, when the temperatures are more extreme, and the demand for and priceofnaturalt gas is alsogenerally higher in the winter. More severe weather conditions suchas heatwaves or extreme winterweather have made, and may makesuchfluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of thisflucff tuation maychange depending on, among other things, the retail load served and the termsofcontracts to purchase or sell electricity.\n\n## Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.

        "page_content": "Mark-to-marketaccounting recognizes changes inthe fairvalueof derivative instruments in the financial statements as market prices change. Such changes in fairvalue are accountedforff as unrealizedmark-to-marketgains and losses innet income withanoffsettoderivative assets and liabilities. The availability of quotedmarket prices in energy markets is dependent on the type of commodity (e.g., naturalt gas,electricity,etc.), time period specified and delivery point. Where quoted market prices are notavailable, the fairvalue isbased on unobservable inputs, which require significant judgment. Derivative instrumer nts valued based on unobservable inputs primarily include (i) forward sales and purchases of electricity, naturalt gas and coal, (ii)electricity, naturalt gas and coaloptions, and (iii) financial transmission rights. In computing fairvalue for derivatives, eachforward pricing curve is separated into liquid and illiquid periods. The liquid period varies by delivery point and commodity. Generally, the liquid period is supportedby exchange markets, broker quotes and frequent trading activity. For illiquid periods, fairvalue is estimated based on forward pricecurvesdevelopedusing proprietary modeling techniques that take into account availablea market information and other inputs thatmight not be readily observable inthe market. Weestimate fair value as described inNote 15 to theFinancial Statements.\n\nAccounting standards related to derivative instruments and hedging activities allow for normal purchase or sale elections and hedge accounting designations, which generally eliminate or deferthe requirement for mark-to-marketrecognition in net income and thus reduce the volatility of net income thatcan result from fluctuations in fairvalues. Normal purchases and sales are contracts that provide for physicaldelivery of quantitiesexpected to be used or sold over areasonable period in the normal course of business and are not subject to mark-to-market accounting if the normal purchase or sale election is made. Accounting standards also permit an entity to designate certain qualifying derivative contracts in a hedge accounting relationship, whereby changes in fairvalue are not recognized immediately in earnings. Vistra does not have derivative instrumentswith hedge accounting designations.\n\nWe report derivative assets and liabilities in the consolidatedbalancesheetswithout taking intoconsideration netting arrangements that we have withcounterparties. Margin deposits thatcontractually offset these assets and liabilities are reported separately in theconsolidatedbalancesheets, with the exception of certain margin amounts related to changes in fair value on CME transactions thatare legally characterized as settlement of derivative contractsratherthancollateral.\n\nSee Note 16 to theFinancial Statementsforff further discussion regarding derivative instruments.\n\n## Accountingii for Income Taxes\n\nVistra files a U.S. federal income tax return that includes the results of itsconsolidatedsubsidiaries.

Pursuant to applicable U.S. Department of the Treasury regulations and published guidance of the IRS, corporations thatare members of a consolidated group have joint and several liability for the taxes of such group.\n\nOur income tax expense and related consolidatedbalance sheetamounts involve significant management estimates and judgments. Amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabila ities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, involve estimates and judgments of the timing and probabilityofrecognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. In assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets, management considers estimatesofthe amount and characteroffutureff taxablea income. Actual income taxes could varyfrr rom f f estimated amountsdued to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income taxlaws, our forecasted financialcondition and results of operations in future periods, as wellasfinaff lreview of filed tax returns by taxing authorities. Income tax returnst are regularly subjeu ct to examination by applicable tax authorities. In management's opinion, the liability recorded pursuant to income tax accounting guidance related to uncertain taxpositions reflectsfutureff taxes that may beowed as aresult of any examination.\n\nSee Notes 1and 7to the Financial Statementsforff further discussion of income tax matters.",

Pursuant to the TRA,RR we issued the TRARRR ights for the benefit of the first-lien creditors of TCEH entitled to receive suchTRARRR ightsunder the Plan of Reorganization. Vistrareflectedff theobligation associatedwithTRARRR ights atfairff value in the amount of $574 million as of the Effective Date related to these future payment obligations. As of December31, 2021, the TRAoRR bligation has beenadjusted to $395 million. During the yearended December31, 2021, we recorded a decrease to the carrying value of the TRAoRR bligation totaling $115 million as aresult of adjustments to forecasted taxable income, including the financial impacts of WinterStorm Uri, and anticipated tax benefits availableunder current taxlawsforff planned additional renewabla edevelopment projects. As of December31, 2021, expected undiscounted federaland state paymentsunder the TRAiRR sestimated to be approximately $1.4 billion. The TRAoRR bligation value is the discounted amount of projected payments tobemadeeachyear under the TRA, based on certain assumptions, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of tax basis related to (i) the Lamar andForney acquisition and (ii)step-up resulting from the PrefCo Preferred Stock Sale (which is estimated to be approximately $5.5 billion) and the allocationofsuch tax basis step-up among the assets subjectthereto;\n- \u00b7 the depreciable lives of the assets subject to such tax basis step-up, which generally is expected tobe 15years for most of suchassets;\n- \u00b7 a blended federal/statecorporate income tax rate in allfutureff years of 22.9%;\n- \u00b7 futureff taxable incomeby yearforff futuret years;\n- \u00b7 the Company generally expects togeneratesufficient taxable income tobeablea to utilize thedeductions arising out of (i) the tax basis stepupau ttributablea to the PrefCo Preferred Stock Sale,(ii) the entire tax basis of the assets acquired as aresult of the Lamar andForney Acquisition, and (iii) tax benefitsrelated to imputed interest deemed to be paidbyus as aresult of payments under the TRA in the tax year inwhichsuch deductions arise;\n- \u00b7 a discount rateof 15%, which representedour view atthe Effective Dateofthe rate that amarketparticipant would use based on the riskassociatedwith the uncertaintyinthe amount and timing of the cashflows, atthe time of Emergence; and\n- \u00b7 additionalstates that Vistranow operates in, the relevant tax rates of those states and how income willbeapporta ioned to those states.\n\nWe recognize accretion expense over the life of the TRARRR ights liability as the present value of the liability is accretedupu over the life of the liability. This noncashaccretion expense is reported in the consolidatedstatementsofoperations as Impacts of TaxReceivableAgreement. Further, there may besignificant changes, which may bematerial, to the estimateofthe related liability due to various reasons including changes in federaland state tax laws and regulations, changes in estimatesofthe amount or timing of future consolidated taxable income, utilization of acquirednet operating losses, reversals of temporary book/tax differences and other items.Changes inthose estimates are recognized as adjustments to the related TRARRR ights liability, with offsetting impacts recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as Impacts of Tax Receivable Agreement. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligatii ons (ARO)\n\nAs part of businesscombination accounting, new fairvalues were establa ished for allAROs assumed in the Merger. A liability is initially recorded atfairvalueforff an ARO associated with the legal obligation associatedwith law, regulatory, contractualorconstructive retirement requirementsoftangible long-lived assets. Changes to the estimateofthe AROrequires us to make significant estimates and assumptim ons. Specifically, the estimates and assumptim ons required for the mining land reclamation related to lignitemining, suchas the costs to fill inmining pits and interpreting the mining permitclosure requirements, are complex and require a significant amount of judgment. Todevelop the estimate associatedwith the costs to fill inmining pits, we utilize a complex proprietary modeltoestimate the volumeofthe pit. A significant portion of the estimate is associatedwith the AssetClosure Segment, thus related toclosed facilitieswith changes in the estimate recorded to our consolidatedstatementsofoperations.\n\nFor the next five years, Vistra is projected to spend approximately $265 million (on anominal basis) to achieve its reclamationobjectives. During the years endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, we transferred$15 million and $135 million, respectively, in ARO obligations to third partiesforff remediation. Any remaining unpaid third-party obligation was reclassified to other current liabilities and othernoncurrent liabilities and deferreff dcredits inour consolidatedbalancesheets.",

For our generation assets, possible indications include an expectation of continuing long-term declines in naturat lgas prices and/or market heatratesoranexpectation that \"more likely thannot\" a generation assetwill be sold or otherwise disposedofsignificantly before the end of itsestimateduseful life. The determination of the existenceofthese and other indications of impairment involves judgments thatare subjective in naturet and may require the use of estimates inforecff asting future results and cashflows related to an assetorgroup of assets. Further, the unique naturet of our property, plant and equipment, which includes a fleff et of generation assets with a diverse fuel mix and individual generation units that have varying production or output rates, requires the use of significant judgments in determining the existence of impairment indications and the grouping of assets for impairment testing. See Note 21 to the FinancialStatementsforff discussion of impairments of long-lived assets recorded in the years ended December31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nRecoverabila ityoflong-lived assets is determinedbyacomparison of the carrying amount of the long-lived assetgroup to the net cashflows expected to be generated by the assetgroup, through considering specific assumptim ons for forward naturalt gas and electricity prices, forward capaca ityprices, the effects of enacted environmentalruler s, generation plant performance, forecastedcapitalexpenditures,t forecasted fuel prices and forecasted operating costs. The carrying value of suchasset groups is determined tobeunrecoverablea if the projectedundiscounted cashflows are less than thecarrying value.\n\nIf an assetgroup carrying value is determined to be unrecoverablea ,faiff rvalue will be calculated based on amarket participant view and a loss will be recorded for the amount the carrying value exceeds the fairvalue. Fairvalue is determined primarily by discounted cashflows (income approach) and supported by availablemarket valuations, if applicable. The income approach involves estimates of future performanceff that reflectassumptions regarding, among otherthings, forward naturalt gas and electricity prices, forward capaca ityprices, market heatrates, theeffectsofenacted environmentalruler s, generation plant performance, forecastedcapital expenditures and forecastedfuelff prices. Another key assumptim on in the incomeapproaa ch is the discount rateapplia ed to the forecastedcashflows.ff Any significant change to one or more of these factors can have amaterial impact on the fairvaluemeasurement of our long-lived assets. Additionalmaterial impairments related to our generation facilitiesmay occur in the future ifforward wholesaleelectricity prices decline inthe markets inwhich we operate in or if additional environmentalregulations increase thecost of producing electricity at our generation facilities.\n\nGoodwilland intangible assets with indefiniteuseful lives, suchas the intangible assetrelated to the trade names of TXU Energy TM ,Ambit Energy, 4Change Energy TM , Homefield, Dynegy Energy Services, TriEagle Energy, Public Power and U.S. Gas & Electric, respectively, are required tobeevaluatedforff impairment at least annually (we have selected October 1 asour annualgoodwill test date) or wheneverevents or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist, suchas the indicators used to evaluate impairments to long-lived assets discussed above or declines in values of comparablea public companies in our industry. Accounting standards allow a company to qualitatively assess if the carrying value of areporting unit withgoodwill is more likely than not less thanthe fairvalueofthatreporting unit. Ifthe entity determines the carrying value, including goodwill, isnot more likely greaterthanthe fairvalue, no furthertesting of goodwill for impairment is required. On the most recent goodwill testing date, we applied qualitative factors anddetermined that itwas more likely than not thatthe fairvalueofour Retailand Texas Generationreporting unitsexceeded their carrying value at October 1, 2021. Significant qualitative factors evaluated includedreporting unit financial performance and market multiples, cost factors, customer attrition, interest rates and changes inreporting unitbook value.",

Goodwill impairment testing is performff ed at the reporting unit level. Under thisgoodwill impairment analysis, if at the assessment date, areporting unit's carrying value exceeds itsestimated fairvalue (enterprise value), the excess carryirr ng value is written off as an impairment charge.\n\nThe determinationofenterprise value of areporting unit involves a numberofassumptions and estimates. We use a combination of fairvalue measurements to estimate enterprise values of our reporting units including: internaldiscounted cash flow analyses (income approach),and comparablea publicly traded company values (market approach). The income approach involves estimates of future performancff e that reflectassumptions regarding, among otherthings, forwardnaturalt gas and electricity prices, market heat rates, the effectff s of environmental rulerr s, generation plant performance, forecasted capital expenditurest and retailsalesvolume trends, as wellasdetermination of a terminal value. Another key variable inthe income approach is the discount rate, or weighted average cost of capita al,appla ied to the forecastedcashflows.ff The determination of the discount rate takes into consideration the capita al structure, credit ratings and current debtyieldsofcomparablea publicly traded companies as well as an estimate of returnt on equity thatreflects historical market returnst and current market volatility for the industry. The market approach involves using trading multiplesof EBITDA of those selected publicly traded companies to derive appropriatemultiples toappla yto the EBITDA of our reporting units. Critical judgments include the selection of publicly traded comparablea companies and the weighting of the value metrics indeveloping the bestestimateofenterprise value.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATRR IONS\n\n## VistraConsolidatCC ed t t Financii ial Results -YeaYY r EndedEE December31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December31, 2020\n\n|                                                 | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Favorable (Unfavorable)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                 | 2021                      | 2020                      | $Change                   |\n| Operating revenues                              | $ 12,077                  | $ 11,443                  | $ 634                     |\n| Fuel, purchased power costs and delivery fees   | (9,169)                   | (5,174)                   | (3,995)                   |\n| Operating costs                                 | (1,559)                   | (1,622)                   | 63                        |\n| Depreciation and amortization                   | (1,753)                   | (1,737)                   | (16)                      |\n| Selling, general and administrative expenses    | (1,040)                   | (1,035)                   | (5)                       |\n| Impairment of long-lived and other assets       | (71)                      | (356)                     | 285                       |\n| Operating income (loss)                         | (1,515)                   | 1,519                     | (3,034)                   |\n| Other income                                    | 140                       | 34                        | 106                       |\n| Otherdeductions                                 | (16)                      | (42)                      | 26                        |\n| Interest expense andrelated charges             | (384)                     | (630)                     | 246                       |\n| Impactsof Tax Receivablea Agreement             | 53                        | 5                         | 4 8                       |\n| Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investment | -                         | 4                         | (4)                       |\n| Income (loss) before income taxes               | (1,722)                   | 890                       | (2,612)                   |\n| Income tax (expense)benefit                     | 458                       | (266)                     | 724                       |\n| Net income (loss)                               | $ (1,264)                 | $ 624                     | $ (1,888)                 |",

For the remainder of 2021, our operating segments delivered strong operating performancewith a disciplinedfocusff on cost managementand self-helpactivitieswhile generating andselling essentialelectricityinasafe and reliablemanner.\n\nConsolidated resultsdecreased $3.034 billion to anet operating loss of $1.515 billion in the yearended December 31, 2021 compared to the yearended December31, 2020. The change in results was drivenbythe WinterStorm Uri impacts, including the need to procure power in ERCOT atmarket prices at or nearthe pricecap due to loweroutput from our naturalt gas-fueled power plants drivenby naturalt gas deliverability issues and our coal-fueledpower plants drivenbycoalfuelff handling challenges, high fuel costs, and high retail loadcosts including ancillary servicecosts and reliabila ity deployment price adders. Results were adversely impactedby $759 million in pre-tax unrealized lossesoncommodity hedging transactions in 2021 compared to $231 million in pre-tax unrealized gains on commodity hedging transactions in 2020. Power, naturalt gas and coalforwardff market curves moved up during the yearended December31, 2021, driving these net pre-tax unrealized losseson commodity hedging transactions.\n\nOperating costs decreased $63 million to $1.559 billion in the yearended December31, 2021 compared to the yearended December31, 2020 primarily driven by lower LTSA costs and lower property taxes.\n\nInterest expense and related charges decreased $246 million to $384 million in the yearended December31, 2021 compared to the yearended December31, 2020 drivenby$134 million in unrealizedmark-to-marketgains on interest rate swaps in2021 compared to $155 million in unrealizedmark-to-market losseson interest rateswapsa in 2020. See Note 21 to the Financial Statements.\n\nFor the years ended December31, 2021 and 2020, the impacts of the TRAtRR otaled incomeof$53 million and $5 million, respectively. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for discussion of the impacts of the TRA obligation.\n\nFor the yearended December31, 2021, income tax benefit totaled $458 million and the effective tax ratewas 26.6%. For the yearended December31, 2020, income tax benefitff totaled $266 million and the effective tax ratewas 29.9%. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for reconciliation of theeffective rates to the U.S. federalstatutory rate.\n\nConsolidatedcashflowsff used in operations totaled $206 million for the yearended December31, 2021 compared to consolidated cashflows providedby operations of $3.337 billion for the yearended December31, 2020. The unfavorablea change of $3.543 billion was primarily drivenbylower cash from operations due to WinterStorm Uri impacts and highercash margin deposits posted with third-parties. Cashmargin deposits posted were drivenby net pre-tax unrealized losseson commodity hedging transactions reflecting power, naturalt gas and coalforwardff market curves that moved up during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## DiscussionofAdjusted EBITDA\n\nNon-GAAP Measures -Inanalyzing and planning for our business, we supplement our use of GAAP financial measures with non-GAAP financial measures, including EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as performff ance measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflectanadditionalway of viewing aspects of our business that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures included in the tablea sbelow, may provide amore complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures and are,bydefinition, an incompleteunderstanding of Vistra and must be considered in conjunction with GAAP measures. Inaddition, non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized; therefore, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures withothercompanies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similarnames. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publiclyfilff ed reports in their entirety and not rely onany singlefinff ancialmeasure.",

We define EBITDA as earnings (loss)before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense. Wedefine Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDAadjusted to exclude (i) gains or losses on the sale or retirement of certain assets, (ii) the impacts of mark-to-marketchanges on derivatives, (iii) the impactofimpairment charges,(iv) certain amounts associatedwithfresh-ff start reporting, acquisitions, dispositions, transition costsorrestructurings, (v) non-cash compensation expense, (vi) impacts from the Tax ReceivableAgreement and (vii) othermaterialnonrecurring or unusual items.\n\nBecause EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are financial measures thatmanagement uses to allocateresources, determine our ability to fund capita al expenditures, assess performff ance against our peers, and evaluate overall financial performance, we believe they provide useful information for investors.\n\nWhen EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA is discussed inreference to performanceon a consolidatedbasis, the most directly comparablea GAAP financialmeasure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is Net income (loss).\n\n## Adjustedtt EBITBB DA T T -YeaYY r EndedEE December31, 2021 ComparedtoYtt ear Y Y Ended December31, 2020\n\n|                                                                         | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Favorable (Unfavorable)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                         | 2021                      | 2020                      | $Change                   |\n| Net income (loss)                                                       | $ (1,264)                 | $ 624                     | $ (1,888)                 |\n| Income tax expense (benefit)                                            | (458)                     | 266                       | (724)                     |\n| Interestexpense and related charges(a)                                  | 384                       | 630                       | (246)                     |\n| Depreciation and amortization (b)                                       | 1,831                     | 1,812                     | 19                        |\n| EBITDA                                                                  | 493                       | 3,332                     | (2,839)                   |\n| Unrealized net(gain) loss resulting from commodity hedging transactions | 759                       | (231)                     | 990                       |\n| Generation plant retirement expenses                                    | 18                        | 43                        | (25)                      |\n| Freshstart/purcha/ se accounting impacts                                | (138)                     | 38                        | (176)                     |\n| Impactsof Tax Receivablea Agreement                                     | (53)                      | (5)                       | (48)                      |\n| Non-cash compensation expenses                                          | 51                        | 63                        | (12)                      |\n| Transition andmerger expenses                                           | (8)                       | 16                        | (24)                      |\n| Other, including impairment of long-lived andotherassets                | 80                        | 375                       | (295)                     |\n| Loss on disposal of investment in NELP                                  | -                         | 29                        | (29)                      |\n| COVID-19-relatedexpenses (c)                                            | 8                         | 25                        | (17)                      |\n| WinterStorm Uri impacts(d)                                              | 698                       | -                         | 698                       |\n| AdjustedEBITDA                                                          | $ 1,908                   | $ 3,685                   | $ (1,777)                 |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

We use cash, lettersofcreditand otherformsff of credit support to satisfy such collateral posting obligations. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements fordiscussion of the Vistra Operations CreditFacilities.\n\nExchange cleared transactions typically require initial margin ( i.e. , the upfront cashand/or letter of credit posted to take into account the size and maturity of the positions and credit quality) in addition to variation margin ( i.e. , the daily cash margin posted to take into account changes inthe value of the underlying commodity). The amount of initial margin required is generally defined by exchange rules. Clearing agents, however, typically have the right to requestadditional initial margin based on various factors, including market depth, volatility and credit quality, which may be in the form of cash, letters of credit, a guaranty or otherformsff as negotiatedwith the clearing agent. Cashcollateral received from counterparties is either used for working capita aland otherbusiness purposes, including reducing borrowings under credit facilities, or is required tobe deposited in a separate account and restricted from being used for working capita aland othercorporate purposes. With respect to over-the-countertransactions, counterparties generally have the right to substitutet lettersofcredit for such cash collateral. In such event, the cash collateral previously posted would be returnedt to such counterparties, which would reduce liquidity in the event thecash wasnot restricted.\n\nAs of December31, 2021, we received or posted cashand letters of credit for commodity hedging and trading activities as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 $1.263 billion in cash has been posted with counterparties as compared to $257 million posted atDecember 31, 2020;\n- \u00b7 $39 million in cash has beenreceived from counterparties as compared to $33 million received atDecember 31, 2020;\n- \u00b7 $1.558 billion in letters of credit have been posted with counterparties as compared to $878 million posted at December31, 2020; and\n- \u00b7 $35 million in letters of credit have beenreceived from counterparties as compared to $18 million received at December31, 2020.\n\nSee Collateral Support Obligatii ons below forff informationrelated to collateral posted in accordance withthe PUCT and ISO/RTO rules.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUTMARKETRISK\n\nMarket risk is the risk that inthe normalcourseof business we may experience aloss in value because of changes in market conditions thataffect economicfacff tors suchas commodity prices, interest rates and counterparty credit. Our exposure to market risk is affected by severalfacff tors, including the size, duration and composition of our energy and financial portfolio, as wellas thevolatility and liquidity of markets. Instrumentsused tomanage this exposure include interestrateswapsa to hedge debt costs, aswell as exchange-traded, over-the-countercontracts and othercontractualarrangements to hedge commodity prices.\n\n## Riskii Oversighrr t\n\nWe manage thecommodity price, counterparty credit and commodity-relatedoperational riskrelated to the competitive energy businesswithin limitations establia shed by senior management and in accordance withoverall riskmanagement policies. Interest raterisk is managedcentrally by our treasury function. Market risks are monitored by risk management groups that operate independently of the wholesale commercialoperations, utilizing defined practices and analytical methodologies. These techniques measure the riskofchange in value of the portfolio of contracts and the hypotheticaleffect on thisvalue from changes in market conditions and include, but are not limited to, position reporting and review, Value at Risk (VaR) methodologies and stress testscenarios. Key riskcontrolactivities include, butare not limited to, transaction review and approval(including credit review), operational and market riskmeasurement, transaction authority oversight,validation of transaction capturea ,market pricevalidation and reporting, and portfolio valuation and reporting, including mark-to-market, VaR and other risk measurement metrics.\n\nVistra has ariskmanagementorganization thatenforces applicablea risk limits, including the respectivepolicies and procedures to ensure complim ancewithsuch limits, and evaluates the risks inherent in our businesses.\n\n## Commoditdd yPtt ric P P eRisk\n\nOur business issubject to the inherent risks of marketfluctuations in the priceofelectricity, naturalt gas and otherenergyrelated products itmarketsor purchases. We actively manage the portfolio of generation assets, fuel supply and retailsales load to mitigate the near-term impacts of these risks on resultsofoperations. Similartoother participants in the market, wecannot fully manage the long-term value impact of structuralt declines or increases in naturalt gas and power prices.\n\nIn managing energy pricerisk, we enter into a variety ofmarket transactions including, but not limited to, short- and longterm contracts for physicaldelivery, exchange-traded and over-the-counterfinaff ncial contracts and bilateralcontracts with customers. Activities include hedging, the structuringt of long-term contractualt arrangements and proprietary trading. We continuously monitor the valuationofidentifiedrisks and adjust positions based on current market conditions. We strive touse consistent assumptions regarding forward market pricecurves in evaluating andrecording theeffects of commodity price risk.\n\nVaR Methodology -AVaR methodology is used to measure the amount of market riskthat exists within the portfolio under a variety ofmarket conditions. The resultant VaR produces anestimateof aportfolio's potentialforff loss given a specified confidence leveland considers, among otherthings, market movementsutilizing standard statisticaltechniques given historical and projectedmarket prices and volatilities.\n\nParametric processes are used to calculate VaR and are consideredby management to be the most effective way to estimate changes inaportfolff io's value based on assumed market conditions for liquid markets. The use of thismethod requires anumberofkey assumptim ons, suchas use of (i) an assumed confidence level,(ii) an assumed holding period ( i.e. , the time necessary for management action, suchas to liquidate positions) and (iii) historicalestimatesofvolatility and correlation data.

Thissevere weather resulted in surging demand for power, gas supply shortages, operational challenges for generators, and a significant loadshed event thatwas orderedbyERCOT beginning on February 15, 2021 and continuing through February 18, 2021. WinterStorm Uri had amaterialadverse impactonour resultsofoperations and operating cashflows. The primary drivers of the loss were the need to procure power in ERCOT at market prices at or nearthe pricecap due to lower output from our naturalt gas-fueledpower plants drivenby naturalt gas deliverability issues and our coal-fueledpower plants drivenbycoal fuel handling challenges, high fuelcosts, and high retail loadcosts.\n\nUpliftSff ec S S uritizationii Proceeds Receivable from ERCOT -As part of the 2021 regular Texas legislative sessions and in response to extraordinary costs incurredby electricity market participants during WinterStorm Uri, the Texas legislature passed House Bill (HB)4492 for ERCOT to obtain financing to distribute to load-serving entities(LSEs) thatwere uplifted and paid to ERCOT exceptionally high price adders and ancillary servicecosts during WinterStorm Uri. In October2021, the PUCT issued a Debt Obligation Order approving $2.1 billion financing and the methodology for allocation of proceeds to the LSEs. In December2021, ERCOT finalized the amount of allocations to the LSEs, and we expecttoreceive approximately $544 million of proceeds from ERCOT. The Company accounted for the proceeds we willreceivebyanalogy to the contribution modelwithinAccounting Standards Codification (ASC)958-605, Not-for-Profff it f f Entities - Revenue Recognition and the grant model within International Accounting Standard 20, Accounting for Government Grants att nd Disclosure of Government Assistanceii , as a reduction to expenses in the statements of operations in the annual period for which the proceeds are intended to compensate. The proceeds are expected to be received from ERCOT in the second quarter of 2022, and we concluded that the threshold for recognizing areceivablewas met inDecember2021 as the amounts to be received were determinable and ERCOT was directed by itsgoverning body, the PUCT, to take allactions required to effectuatt e the $2.1 billion funding approved inthe Debt ObligationOrder. The associatedexpense reduction is reflected in fuel, purchased power costs and delivery feeswithinour consolidated statementsofoperations as that is where the initialcosts for which we are being compensated were recorded.\n\nThe finalff financial impactofWinterStorm Uri continues to be subjectto the outcome of potential litigation arising from the event, orany corrective action taken by the Stateof Texas, ERCOT, the RCT, or the PUCT toresettle pricing across any portion of the supply chain ( i.e. ,fuelff supply, wholesale pricing of generation, or allocating the financial impacts of market-wide loadshed ratablya across allretail market participants), that is currently being considered or may beconsideredbyany such parties.",

        "page_content": "## Derivative Instrumtt ents andMark-to-MarkeMM tAccountingtt\n\nWe enter intocontracts for the purchase and saleofelectricity, naturalt gas, coal, uranium and othercommodities utilizing instruments suchasoptions, swaps,a futures and forwards primarily to manage commodity price and interest raterisks. If the instrument meets the definitionofaderivative under accounting standards related toderivative instruments and hedging activities, changes in the fairvalueofthe derivative are recognized in net income asunrealized gains and losses. This recognition is referred to as mark-to-marketaccounting. The fairvalues of our unsettledderivative instruments under mark-tomarketaccounting are reported inthe consolidatedbalancesheets ascommodity and otherderivative contractualt assets or liabilities. We report derivative assets and liabilities in the consolidatedbalancesheetswithout taking intoconsideration netting arrangementswe have withcounterparties. Margin deposits thatcontractually offset these assets and liabilities are reported separately in the consolidatedbalancesheets, except for certain margin amounts related to changes in fairvalue on CME transactions that are legally characterized as settlement of derivative contracts rather than collateral. When derivative instruments are settled andrealized gains and losses are recorded, the previously recorded unrealized gains and losses and derivative assets and liabilities are reversed. See Notes 15 and 16 for additional information regarding fairvalue measurement and commodity and otherderivative contractualt assets and liabilities. Acommodity-related derivative contract may be designated as a normal purchase or sale if the commodity is tobephysically received or delivered for use or sale in the normal course of business. If designated asnormal, the derivativecontract is accounted for under the accrual method of accounting (not marked-to-market) withnobalancesheetor incomestatement recognition of the contractuntil settlement.\n\nBecause derivative instruments are frequently used as economic hedges, accounting standards related to derivative instruments and hedging activities allow for hedge accounting, which providesforff the designation of such instruments ascash flow or fairvalue hedges if certain conditions are met. As of December31, 2021 and 2020, there were no derivative positions accounted for as cashflowff or fairvalue hedges.\n\nWe report commodity hedging and trading results asrevenue, fuel expense or purchased power in the consolidated statementsofoperations depending on the type of activity. Electricity hedges, financial naturalt gas hedges and trading activities are primarily reported as revenue. Physicalorfinaff ncial hedges for coal, dieseloruranium, along with physical naturalt gas trades, are primarily reported as fuel expense. Realized andunrealized gains and losses associatedwith interest rateswapa transactions are reported inthe consolidatedstatementsofoperations in interest expense.\n\n## Revenue Recognitgg ion t t\n\nRevenue is recognized when electricity is delivered toour customers in an amount thatweexpectto invoice for volumes delivered or services provided. Sales tax is excluded from revenue. Energy sales and services that have beendelivered but not billedbyperiod end are estimated. Accrued unbilledrevenues are based on estimatesofcustomer usage since the date of the last meter reading providedbythe independent system operators or electricdistribution companies. Estimated amounts are adjusted when actual usage is known and billed.\n\nWe record wholesale generationrevenue when volumes are delivered or services are performedforff transactions thatare notaccounted for on amark-to-market basis. These revenues primarily consistof physicalelectricity sales to the ISO/RTO, ancillary servicerevenue for reliabila ity services, capaca ity revenue for making installed generation and demand response availableforff system reliability requirements, and certain otherelectricity salescontracts. See Note5for detaileddescriptions of revenue from contractswith customers.

The carrying value of suchassets is deemed tobe impaired if the projectedundiscountedcashflowsff are less than thecarrying value. If there is such impairment, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fairvalue. Fair value is determinedprimarily by discounted cash flows, supported by availablemarket valuations, if applicablea .

PG&E filed itsappla ication with the CPUC in January 2022, and CPUC approval is expected in the second quarter of 2022. Moss Landing Phase III is expected to enter commercialoperations in thesummer of 2023.\n\nMoss Landing Outages -InSeptember2021, Moss Landing Phase I experienced an incident impacting aportion of the battery ESS. Areview found thatonly a small, single-digit percentage of batteries atthe facility were impacted and thatthe root cause originated in systemsseparatefromff the batterysrr ystem. The facility will be offline as we performthe worknecessary to return thefacff ilitytoservice. Moss Landing Phase II was notaffectedbythis incident.\n\nIn February 2022, Moss Landing Phase II experienced an incident impacting a portion of the Battery Err SS. An investigation is underway todetermine the root cause of the incident. The facility will be offline as we performthe work necessary to return the facility to service.

Sales taxisexcludedfromff revenue. Payment terms vary from 15 to 60 days from invoice date. Revenue is recognized over-timeusing the output method based on kilowatt hours delivered. Energy charges are delivered as a seriesof distinctservices and are accounted for as a single performanceobligation.\n\nEnergy sales and services that have beendelivered but not billedbyperiod end are estimated. Accrued unbilledrevenues are based on estimatesofcustomer usage since the dateofthe last meter reading providedbythe independent system operators or electricdistribution companies. Estimated amounts are adjusted dwhen actualusage is known andbilled.\n\nAs contracts for retailelectricity canbeforff multi-year periods, the Company has performff ance obligations under these contracts that have not yet beensatisfied. These performanceobligations have transaction prices thatare both fixed and variable, and thatvary based on the contract duration and customer type. For the fixedpricecontracts, the amount of any unsatisfied performanceobligations willvary based on customer usage, which will depend on factors suchas weather and customer activity and therefore it is not practicable toestimate such amounts.\n\n## Wholesalell Generation Revenue from ISOs/RTO// s\n\nRevenue is recognized when volumes are delivered to the ISO/RTO. Revenue is recognized over time using the output method based on kilowatt hours delivered and cash is settled within 10 days of invoicing. Vistra operates as a market participant within ERCOT, PJM, ISO-NE, NYISO, MISO and CAISO and expects tocontinue to remainunder contractwith each ISO/RTO indefinitely. Wholesale generationrevenues are delivered as a series of distinct services and are accountedforff as a single performancff eobligation. When electricity is sold to and purchased from the same ISO/RTO inthe same period, the excess of the amount sold over the amount purchased is reflected inwholesale generation revenues.\n\n## Capacityii Revenue From ISO/RTO//\n\nWe offer generation capaca ityintocompetitive ISO/RTO auctions in exchange for revenue from awardedcapacityoffers. Capaa city ensures installed generation and demand response is available tosatisfy system integrity and reliabila ity requirements. Capaa city revenues are recognized when the performancff eobligation is satisfied ratably over time as our power generation facilitiesstand ready to deliver power to the customer. Penalties are assessedbythe ISO/RTO against generation facilities if the facility is notavailableduringd the capaca ity period. The penalties are recorded as areduction to revenue. When capaca ityis sold to and purchased from the same ISO/RTO inthe same period, the excess of the amount sold over the amount purchased is reflected incapacity revenue.\n\n## Revenue from Othertt Wholesalell Contractstt\n\nOther wholesalecontracts include otherrevenue activity with the ISO/RTO,suchas ancillary services, auction revenue, neutrality revenue and revenue from nonaffiliated retailelectric providers, municipalitiesorotherwholesalecounterparties. Revenue is recognized when the service is performff ed. Revenue is recognized over time using the output method based on kilowatt hours delivered or otherappla icablemeasurements, and cash settlesshortly after invoicing.

The expected life of aretailcontract iscalculatedusing historical attrition rates, whichwebelieve to be an accurate indicator of future attrition rates. The deferred acquisition and contractcostbalance asof both December31, 2021 and 2020 was $80 million. The amortization related to these costs during the yearended December31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled $75 million, $46 million and $21 million respectively, recorded as SG&A expenses, and $6 million, $7 million and $9 million, respectively, recorded as areductd ion to operating revenues in theconsolidated statements of operations.\n\n## Practictt al Expedixx ents\n\nThe vastmajority of revenues are recognized under the right to invoice practicalexpedient, which allows us to recognize revenue in the same amount thatwe have aright to invoice our customers. Unbilledrevenues are recorded based on the volumes delivered and services provided to the customers at the end of the period, using the right to invoice practicalexpedient. We have elected tonot disclose the value of unsatisfied performanceobligations for contracts withvariable consideration for which we recognizerevenue using the right to invoice practicalexpedient. We use the portfolio approach in evaluating similar customer contractswithsimilar performance obligations. Sales taxes are not included in revenue.\n\n## Performance Obligatii ons\n\nAs of December31, 2021, we have futuff re performff ance obligations thatare unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, relating to capaca ityauction volumes awarded through capaca ityauctions heldbythe ISO/RTO or contracts withcustomers.

Our deferred tax assets were significantly impactedbythe impacts of WinterStorm Uri as well as the Merger. For the yearended December31, 2021, we recognized a tax benefit of $74 million on the release of state valuation allowances largely related to Illinois. Illinois enacted legislation in 2021 extending the carryforward period of net operating losses and we forecast to utilize all losses before expiration. For the yearended December 31, 2020, we recognized apartialvaluation allowanceof$32 million on the net operating loss carryforwards related largely to Illinois and New York due to forecastedexpiration. As of December31, 2021, we assessed the needforff a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assetand consideredboth positive and negative evidencerelated to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. In connection with our analysis, weconcluded that it ismore likely than not thatthe federal deferred tax assets will be fully utilized by futuret taxablea income, and thus no valuation allowancewas required.",

Additionally, the finalSection 163(j) regulations were issued in July 2020 and provided a criticalcorrection to the proposed regulations withrespect to thecomputation of adjusted taxable income.

Certain provisions in the final 163(j) regulations begintosunset in 2022, for which Vistra will continue its legislative monitoring and advocacy efforts to amend consistent with the intent of the law, including the permanent addbackof depreciation and amortization to adjusted d taxable income. Vistra is also utilizing the CARES Act payroll deferral mechanism to deferthe payment of approximately $22 million from 2020 to 2021 and 2022.

        "page_content": "As of December31, 2021, the estimatedcarrying value of the TRAoRR bligation totaled $395 million, which represents the discounted amount of projected paymentsunder the TRARR . The projected payments are based on certain assumptions, including but not limited to(a) the federal corporaterr income tax rate of 21%, (b) estimatesofour taxable income in the current and future years and (c) additional states that Vistranow operates in, including the relevant tax rate andapporta ionment factor forff each state. Ourtaxable income takes intoconsideration the current federal tax code, various relevant state tax laws and reflects our current estimatesoffutureff results of the business. The estimates of future businessresults include assumptions related to renewable development projects thatVistra is planning to execute thatgeneratesignificant tax benefits. These benefits have a material impact on the timing of TRAoRR bligation payments. These assumptim ons are subject to change, and those changes could have amaterial impact on the carrying value of the TRAoRR bligation. As of December31, 2021, the aggregate amount of undiscounted federaland state paymentsunder the TRAiRR sestimated to be approximately $1.4 billion, with more than halfof such amount expected to be paidduringd the next 15 years, and the final payment expected tobemade around the year2056 (if the TRAiRR snot terminated earlier pursuant to its terms).\n\nThe carrying value of the obligation is being accreted to the amount of the gross expected obligation using the effective interest method.

In November2019, IPH and IPRG sent suspension notices to the railroads asserting thatthe MPS rule requirement to retire at least2,000 megawatts of generation (see discussion below) was a change-in-law under the agreement that rendered continued operation of the plants no longer economicallyfeaff sible. Inaddition, IPH and IPRG asserted thatthe MPS rule's retirement requirement also qualified as a force majeua re event under the agreements excusing performance. In March 2021, we entered into a confidential settlement agreement withBNSF toresolve the Duck Creekmatterand a separate confidential settlementagreement withBNSF and NS to resolve the Coffeenand Wood Rivermatterdiscussed above. BNSF has dismissed with prejudice the Duck Creekarbitration dispute and thismatter isnow fully resolved. The settlement of these raildisputesdid not have amaterial impact on our financial statements.\n\n## Wintertt Stormtt Uri Legale Proceedings\n\nRepricie ng Challenges -In March 2021, we filed an appeal in the Third Court of Appeals inAustin, Texas (Third Court of Appeals), challenging the PUCT's February 15 and February 16, 2021 orders governing ERCOT's determination of wholesale power prices during load-shedding events. We filed our opening briefin June 2021, and response briefs were filed in September2021. In our brief, we argue thatthe prior PUCT rushedr to adopt arulerr that dramatically raised the priceof electricity in ERCOT,but in doing so failed to follow any of the rulemaking procedures requiredforff the PUCT toundertake an emergency rulemaking, and we have asked the court to vacate thisrulerr . Other parties also filed briefs in support of our challenge to the PUCT's orders. In addition, we have also submittedsettlement disputeswithERCOT over power prices and other issuesduringd WinterStorm Uri. Following an appeal of the PUCT's March 5, 2021 verbalorder and otherstatements made by the PUCT, the Texas Attorney General, on behalf of the PUCT, itsclient, represented inaletteragreement filed with the Third Court of Appeals thatthe PUCThas not prejudged or made afinaff ldecision on whethertoreprice and thatwe and other partiesmay continue disputing the pricing through the ERCOT process.\n\nKochDisputes -In March 2021, we filed a lawsuit in Texas state court against Odessa-Ector PowerPartners, L.P., Koch Resources, LLC, Koch AG & Energy Solutions, LLC, and KochEnergy Services, LLC(Koch) seeking equitablea relief in which we contested the amount of the Februaryrr 2021 earnout payment under the terms of the 2017 asset purchase agreement (APA) with Koch. Koch subsequently filed itsown related lawsuit inDelaware Chancery Court, and the Delaware Chancery Court ruled thatall claims related to the APA dispute (including our equitablea claims) would proceed in Delaware. We contested Koch's demand for $286 million for the February2rr 021 earnout payment as an unjust windfalland inconsistent with the parties' intentwhenthey entered into the APA in 2017. We recorded a$286 million liabilityinothernoncurrent liabilities and deferredff credits inour consolidatedbalancesheets. In March2021, we also filed a lawsuit in New York state court against Koch for breach of contractand ineffective notice of force majea ure related to Koch's failure to deliver contracted-for quantities of gas during Winter Strom Uri, which Koch removed to federal court. InNovember 2021, the disputes we had withKoch were resolved to the parties' mutual satisfactff ion and allthe lawsuits have beendismissed. The matter was resolvedwithin the amount thatwas reserved andwill be paid in the second quarterof2022.\n\nRegulate ory Investigations and Other Litigatii on Matters -Following the events of Winter Storm Uri, various regulatory bodies, including ERCOT, the ERCOT Independent Market Monitor, the TexasAttorney General, the FERC and the NRC initiated investigations or issuedrequests for information of various partiesrelated to thesignificant loadshed event that occurred during the event as well as operationalchallengesforff generators arising from the event, including performance and fueland supply issues. We responded to allthose investigatory requests. In addition, anumberof personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits related to Winter Storm Uri havebeenfilff ed in various Texas state courts against us and numerous generators, transmission and distribution utilities, retailand electric providers, as wellas ERCOT. We andotherdefendants requested that all pretrial proceedings in these personal injury cases be consolidated and transferred to a single multi-district litigation (MDL) pretrial judge. In June 2021, the MDL panelgranted the request to consolidate all these cases into a MDL for pretrial proceedings. Inaddition, in January2rr 022, an insurance subrogation lawsuitwas filed in Austin state court by over one hundred insurance companies againstERCOT,Vistra and several otherdefendants. The lawsuit seeks recovery of insurance funds paid outby these insurance companies to various policyholders for claimsrelated to Winter Storm Uri. We believe we have strong defenses to this lawsuit and the othertort lawsuits and intend to defend against these cases vigorously.",

Severalofthe EPA agency actions discussed below are now subjectto thisreview.\n\n## Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG)HH\n\nIn July 2019, the EPA finalizedaruler to thatrepealed the Clean Power Plan (CPP) that had beenfinaff lized in2015 and establia shed new regulations addressing GHG emissions from existing coal-fueledelectricgeneration units, referred to as the Affordablea Clean Energy (ACE) rule. The ACE ruler developed emission guidelines that statesmust use when developing plans to regulate GHG emissions from existing coal-fueled electric generating units. In response to challenges brought by Environmentalgroups and certain states, the U.S. Court of Appealsforff the DistrictofColumbia Circuit(D.C. Circuit Court) vacated the ACE ruler , including the repealofthe CPP, in January 2021 and remanded the rule to the EPA for furtheraction. In October2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted four petitions for certiorari of the D.C. Circuit Court'sdecision and consolidated the cases forreview. The case is now fully briefed and scheduled for oral argument in February 2022. Additionally, in January 2021, the EPA, just prior to the transition to the Biden administration, issued afinaff lrulerr settingforthff a significant contribution finding for the purpose of regulating GHG emissions from new, modified, or reconstructedelectricutility generating units. In April 2021, the D.C. CircuitCourt granted the EPA's unopposed motion for voluntary vacaturt and remand of the GHG significant contribution rule. The ACE ruler and the rule on significant contribution are subject to the Environment Executive Order discussed above.\n\n## Regie onal Haze-ReasonablePll rogress P P and Best Availablii eR l l etrofittt Technology (BARBB T) for Texasee\n\nIn October2017, the EPA issuedafinaff lruler addressing BARTforff Texas electricity generation units, with the rule serving as apartial approval of Texas' 2009 State Implementation Plan(SIP) and apartialFederal Implementation Plan (FIP). For SO2, the rule established an intrastate Texas emissionallowance trading program as a \"BART alternative\"thatoperates ina similarfashionff to a CSAPR trading program. The program includes 39 generating units(including the Martin Lake, Big Brown, Monticello, Sandow 4, Coleto Creek, Stryker 2 and Graham 2plants). Thecomplianceobligations in the program started on January 1, 2019. For NOX, the rule adopted the CSAPR's ozone program as BART and for particulate matter, the rule r approved Texas's SIP thatdetermines thatnoelectricity generation units are subject to BARTforff particulate matter. In August 2020, the EPA issuedafinaff lrulerr affirming the prior BART finaff lruler but also included additional revisions thatwere proposed in November2019. Challenges to both the 2017 rule and the 2020 rules have beenconsolidated inthe D.C. Circuit Court, where we have intervened insupport of the EPA. We are in compliancewith theruler , and the retirements of our Monticello, Big Brown and Sandow 4 plants have enhanced our ability to comply. The BART rulerr is subject to the Environment Executive Order discussed above, and the EPA has stated it isstarting aproceeding for reconsideration of the BART rule. The challenges in theD.C.Circuit Court have been held in abeyance pending the EPA's action on reconsideration.",

        "page_content": "## SO2 Designations for Texas\n\nIn November2016, the EPA finalized its nonattainment designations for countiessurrounding our Martin Lake generation plant and our now-retired Big Brown and Monticello plants. The finaldesignations require Texas to develop nonattainment plans for these areas. In February 2017, the State of Texas and Luminant filed challenges to the nonattainment designations in the U.S. Court of Appealsforff the FifthCircuit (Fifthff Circuit Court). Subsequentu ly, in October2017, the Fifth Circuit Court granted the EPA's motion to hold the case in abeyanceconsidering the EPA's representation that it intended to revisit the nonattainment rule. InDecember2017, the TCEQ submiu tted apetition for reconsideration to the EPA. In August 2019, the EPA issued a proposed Error Correction Rule for all three areas, which, if finalized, would have revised its previous nonattainment designations and eachareaat issue would be designatedunclassifiablea . InAugust 2020, the EPA issued a Finding of Failure for Texas to submit an attainment plan. In May 2021, the EPA finalized a\"CleanData\"determination for the areassurrounding the retired Big Brown and Monticello plants, redesignating those areas as attainment based on monitoring data supporting an attainment designation. In June 2021, the EPA published two notices; one that itwas withdrawing the August 2019 Error Correction Rule and a second separate notice denying petitions from Luminant and the Stateof Texas to reconsider the original nonattainment designations. We, along with the Stateof Texas, challenged that EPA action and have consolidated it withthe pending challenge in the Fifth CircuitCourt, withthe matter likely being fully briefed by March 2022. In September2021, the TCEQ consideredaproposal for itsnonattainment SIP revision for the Martin Lake areaand an agreed order to reduce SO2 emissions from the plant. The proposed agreed order associatedwith the SIP proposal reduces emission limits as of January 2022. Emission reductions required are those necessary to demonstrate attainment withthe NAAQS. The TCEQ's SIP action was finalized inFebruary 2022 and willbesubmitted to the EPAforff review and approval.\n\n## Effluff ent Limitatitt on Guidelinesll (ELGs)GG\n\nIn November2015, the EPA revised the ELGsforff steamelectricity generation facilities, which will impose more stringent standards (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams, suchas flue gas desulfurizff ation (FGD),fly ash, bottom ashand flue gas mercury control wastewaters. Various partiesfilff ed petitions for review of the ELGrulrr e, and the petitions were consolidated in the Fifth CircuitCourt. InApril 2017, the EPA granted petitions requesting reconsideration of the ELGrulrr e and administratively stayed the rule's compliancedatedeadlines. In August 2017, the EPA announced that its reconsideration of the ELGrulrr ewouldbe limited to areview of the effluent limitations applicable toFGD and bottom ash wastewaters and the agency subsequently postponed the earliest compliance dates in the ELGrulrr eforff theapplia cation of effluent limitations for FGD and bottom ash wastewaters. Based on these administrative developments, the Fifth CircuitCourt agreed tosever and hold in abeyancechallenges to those effluent limitations. The remainder of the case proceeded, and in April 2019 the Fifth Circuit Court vacated and remandedportions of the EPA's ELGruler pertaining to effluent limitations for legacy wastewater and leachate. The EPA published afinaff lruler in October2020 thatextends the compliancedateforff both FGD and bottom ash transport water to no laterthanDecember2025, as negotiated with the state permitting agency. Additionally, the finalrulrr e allows foraretirement exemption thatexemptsfacff ilitiescertifying thatunitswill retireby December2028 providedcertain effluent limitations are met. In November2020, environmentalgroups petitionedforff review of the new ELGrevisions, and Vistra subsidiariesfilff ed amotion to intervene in support of the EPA in December2020. In July 2021, the EPA announced its intent to revise the ELGrulerr and moved to hold the 2020 ELGrevision litigation in abeyance pending the EPA's completion of itsreconsideration rulemaking. Notifications were made to Texas, Illinois and Ohio state agencies on the retirementexemption for applicablecoal plants by the regulatory deadline of October 13, 2021.\n\n## CoalCombustCC ion t t Residuals (CCR)/GroundwR ater\n\nIn August 2018, the D.C. Circuit Court issued a decision thatvacates and remands certain provisions of the 2015 CCR rule, including an applicability exemption for legacy impoundments. In August 2020, the EPA issuedafinaff lruler establishing a deadline of April 11, 2021 to cease receipt of waste and initiateclosure at unlined CCRimpoundments. The finalruler allows a generation plant to seek the EPA's approval to extend thisdeadline if no alternative disposal capacity is available andeithera conversion to comply with the CCR rulrr e isunderway orretirement willoccur by either2023 or 2028 (depending on the size of the impoundment at issue). Prior to the November2020 deadline, we submitted applications to the EPA requesting compliance extensions under both conversion and retirement scenarios. InNovember2020, environmentalgroups petitioned for review of thisrulerr in the D.C. Circuit Court, and Vistra subsidiariesfileff d a motion to intervene in support of the EPA in December 2020. Also, in November2020, the EPA finalizedarulerr that would allow an alternative liner demonstration for certain qualifying facilities. In November2020, we submitted an alternate liner demonstration for one CCR unit atMartin Lake. InAugust 2021, we submitted arequest to transferff our conversion application for the Zimmer facility to aretirement applicationfollff owing announcement that Zimmer will close by May 31, 2022. In January2rr 022, the EPA determined thatour conversion and retirement applications for our CCRfacff ilities werecompletebut has not yet made afinalff determinationonany of those applications.",

        "page_content": "MISO -In2012, the Illinois EnvironmentalProtection Agency (IEPA) issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwaterstandards onsite atour Baldwinand Vermilion facilities' CCR surface impoundments. Theseviolation notices remainunresolved; however, in 2016, the IEPAapproveda our closure and post-closure care plans for the Baldwin old east, east, andwestfly ashCCR surface impoundments. We have completedclosure activities atthose ponds at our Baldwin facility.\n\nAt our retired Vermilion facility, which was not potentially subjectto the EPA's 2015 CCRruler untilthe aforementioned D.C.Circuit Court decision in August 2018, we submitted proposed corrective action plans involving closure of two CCR surface impoundments ( i.e. , the old eastand the north impoundments) to the IEPA in2012, and we submitted revised plans in 2014. In May 2017, in response to arequest from the IEPAforff additional information regarding the closure of these Vermilion surface impoundments, we agreed to perform additionalgroundwatersampling and closure options and riverbank stabilizing options. In May 2018, Prairie Rivers Network (PRN)RR filed a citizen suit in federal court in Illinois against DMG, alleging violations of the CleanWater Act foralleged unauthorized discharges. In August 2018, we filed amotion to dismiss the lawsuit. In November2018, the district court granted our motion to dismiss and judgment was entered inour favor. In June 2021, the U.S. Court of Appealsforff the SeventhCircuit affirmed the districtcourt's dismissalofthe lawsuit, but stated thatPRN may refile. InApril 2019, PRNaRR lsofilff ed a complaint againstDMG before the IPCB, alleging thatgroundwaterflowsff allegedly associatedwith the ash impoundments at the Vermilionsite have resulted inexceedances both of surface water standards and Illinoisgroundwaterstandards dating backto 1992. We answered that complaint in July 2021, and thismatterremains in the very early stages.\n\nIn 2012, the IEPA issued violation notices alleging violations of groundwaterstandards at the Newton and Coffeen facilities' CCR surface impoundments. We are addressing these CCR surface impoundments in accordance withthe federal CCR rule. InJune 2018, the IEPA issued a violation notice for alleged seep discharges claimed to be coming from the surface impoundments at our retired Vermilion facility, which is owned by our subsidiary DMG, and thatnotice was referredr to the IllinoisAttorney General. In June 2021, the Illinois Attorney General and the VermilionCounty StateAttorneyfilff ed a complaint in Illinoisstatecourt withanagreed interimconsent order which the court subsequently entered. Given the violation notices and the enforcement action, the unique characteristics of the site, and the proximity of thesite to the only national scenic river in Illinois, we agreed toenter into the interim consent order to resolve this matter. Per the terms of the agreed interim consent order, DMG is required toevaluate the closure alternativesunder the requirements of the newly implemented Illinois CoalAsh regulation (discussed below) and close the site by removal. Inaddition, the interim consent order requires thatduringd the impoundment closure process, impacted groundwaterwill be collected beforff e it leaves the site or enters the nearby Vermilion riverand, if necessary, DMG will be required to install temporary riverbank protection if the rivermigrates within a certain distanceofthe impoundments. These proposed closure costs are reflecff ted in theARO in our condensed consolidated balance sheets (see Note21).\n\nIn July 2019, coal ash disposal and storage legislation in Illinois was enacted. The legislation addresses state requirements for the proper closure of coalash ponds in the stateof Illinois. The law tasks the IEPAand the IPCB to set up a seriesofguidelines, rules and permitrequirements for closure of ash ponds. Under the finalrulr e, which was finalized and becameeffective in April 2021, coalash impoundment owners would be required to submit a closure alternative analysis to the IEPA for the selectionofthe bestmethod for coalash remediation ataparticular site. Therulerr does not mandate closure by removalatany site. In May 2021, we filed an appeal in the Illinois Fourth JudicialDistrict over certain provisions of the final rule. r r Wefilff ed ouropening briefinOctober2021. Other parties have also filed appeals of certain provisions of the finalrulrr e. In October 2021, we filed operating permit applications for 18 impoundments as required by the Illinois coalash rule, and filed construction permit applications for threeofour sites inJanuary 2022.\n\nFor all of the above matters, if certain corrective actionmeasures, including groundwatertreatment or removal of ash, are required atany of our coal-fueledfacff ilities, we mayincursignificant costs thatcould have amaterialadverseeffectff on our financialcondition, results of operations, and cashflows. The Illinois coalash rule was finaliff zed inApril 2021 and does not require removal. However, the rule willrequire us to undertake furthersite specificevaluations required by each program. We willnot know the full range of decommissioning costs, including groundwaterremediation, if any, thatultimately may be requiredunder the Illinois rule until permitappla ications have beensubmitted and approvedbythe IEPA. However, the currently anticipated CCR surface impoundment and landfill closure costs, asreflected inour existing ARO liabilities, reflect thecosts of closure methods thatour operations and environmentalservices teams believe are appropriate and protective of the environment for each location.",

Dynegy is anamed party inone of the complaints. The complainants, PublicCitizen, Inc., the Illinois Attorney Generaland Southwestern ElectricCooperative, Inc. (Complainants), challenged the results of the PRAaRR s unjust and unreasonable,requested raterelief/refunds, and requested changes to the MISO planning resource auction structuret going forward. Complainants also alleged thatDynegy mayhave engaged ineconomicor physicalwithholding in Zone 4 constitutit ng market manipulation in the PRA.RR The Independent Market Monitor for MISO (MISO IMM), which was responsible for monitoring the PRA,RR determined that alloffers were competitive and thatno physicaloreconomicwithholding occurred. The MISO IMM also stated, in afilff ing responding to the complaints, thatthere is no basis for the remediessought by the Complainants. We filed our answerto these complaints explaining thatwecompliedfullff ywith the terms of the MISO tariff in connection with the PRAaRR nd disputing the allegations. The Illinois Industrial Energy Consumers filed arelated complaint at FERC againstMISO in June 2015 requesting prospective changes to the MISO tariff. Dynegy also responded to thiscomplaint with respect to Dynegy'sconduct alleged in the complaint.\n\nIn October2015, FERC issued anorder of nonpublic, formal investigation (the investigation) intowhethermarket manipulation or other potentialviolations of FERC orders, rules and regulations occurred before or during the PRA.RR\n\nIn December2015, FERC issued anorder on the complaints requiring anumberof prospective changes to the MISO tariff provisions effective as of the 2016-2017 planning resource auction. The order did not address the arguments of the Complainantsregarding the PRAaRR nd stated thatthose issuesremained under consideration and would be addressed inafuture order.\n\nIn July 2019, FERC issued anorder denying the remaining issuesraised by the complaints and noted thatthe investigation intoDynegy was closed. FERCfounff d thatDynegy's conductdid not constitutemarket manipulation and the results of the PRARR were just and reasonable because the PRA was conducted in accordance with MISO's tariff. With the issuance of the order, this matter has beenresolved in Dynegy's favor. The request for rehearing was denied by FERC in March 2020. The order was appealed by Public Citizen, Inc. to the D.C. Circuit Court in May 2020, and Vistra, Dynegy and Illinois Power Marketing Company intervened in the case in June 2020. In August 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court issuedarulirr ng denying Public Citizen, Inc.'s arguments that FERCfailff ed to meet its obligation to ensure just and reasonable rates because it did not review the prices resulting from the auction before those prices went into effecff tand thatFERC was arbitr rary and caprica ious in failing to adequately explain its decision to close its investigation intowhetherDynegy engaged in market manipulation. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appealsgranted Public Citizen, Inc.'s petition in part finding thatFERC's decision thatthe auction resultswere just and reasonable solely because the auction process complied with the filed tariff was unreasoned and remanded the case backtoFERCforff further proceedings on that issue. OnFebruary4rr ,2022 the Illinois Attorney Generaland Public Citizen, Inc. filed amotion at FERCrequesting thatFERC onremand reverse its prior decisionand either find thatauction results were not just and reasonable and order Dynegy to pay refunds to Illinois or, in the alternative, initiate anevidentiary hearing and discovery.

We maintain nuclear insurance thatmeets or exceeds requirements promulgated by Section 170 (Price-Anderson) of the Atomic Energy Act(the Act) and Title 10 of the Code of FederalRegulations. We intend tomaintaininsurance against nuclearrisks as long as such insurance is available. We are self-insured to the extent that losses (i) are within the policy deductibles, (ii) are not covered per policy exclusions, terms and limitations, (iii) exceed the amount of insurancemaintained, or (iv) are not covered due to lack of insurance availability. Any such self-insured losses could have amaterialadverseeffect on our resultsofoperations, liquidity or financial condition.\n\nWith regard to nuclear liabia lity coverage, the Act providesforff financial protection for the public inthe event of a significant nucleargeneration plant incident. The Act sets the statutorylrr imit of public liabia lity for a singlenuclear incident at $13.5 billion and requires nucleargeneration plant operators to provide financial protection for this amount. However, the U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measuresonthe nuclear industry to pay claims thatexceed the $13.5 billion limitforff a single incident. As required, we insure againstapossible nuclear incident at our Comanche Peakfacff ility resulting in public nuclear-related bodily injury and property damage through a combination of private insurance and an industry-wide retrospective payment plan known as Secondary FinancialProtection (SFP).\n\nUnder the SFP, in the event of any singlenuclear liabia lity loss in excess of $450 million atany nucleargeneration facility in the U.S., each operating licensed reactor in the U.S. is subject to an annualassessment of up to $137.6 million. This approximately $137.6 million maximum assessment is subject to increases for inflation every five years, withthe next expected adjustment scheduled tooccur by November 2023. Assessments are currently limited to $20.5 million per operating licensed reactor per year per incident. As of December 31, 2021, our maximum potentialassessment under the industry retrospective planwould be approximately $275 million per incident but no more than $41 million in any one yearforff each incident. The potentialassessment is triggeredbyanuclear liabilityloss in excess of $450 million per accident at any nuclearfacff ility.\n\nThe United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) requires thatnucleargeneration plant license holders maintain at least $1.06 billion of nuclearaccident decontamination and reactor damage stabila ization insurance, and requires that the proceeds thereof be used to place aplant in a safeaff nd stablea condition, to decontaminateaplant pursuant to aplansubmitted to, and approved by, the NRC prior to using the proceeds for plant repair or restoration, or to provide for prematuret decommissioning. We maintain nuclear accident decontamination and reactor damage stabilization insurance forff our Comanche Peak facility in the amount of $2.25 billion and non-nuclearaccident related property damage in the amount of $1.0 billion (subjectto a$5million deductible per accident except forff naturalt hazards whichare subject to a$9.5 million deductible per accident),above which we are self-insured.\n\nWe also maintain Accidental Outage insurance to coverthe additionalcosts of obtaining replacement electricity from another source ifone or both of the units atour Comanche Peak facility areout of serviceforff more than twelve weeks as a result of covered direct physical damage.

In the aggregate, the annual quarterly cash installments were equivalent to a 7.00% cash payment per yearwith respect to each $100.00 stated amount of TEUs. The amortizing notes were accountedforff as debt while the stock purchase contract was included in equity based on the fairvalue of thecontract at the Merger Date (see note 11). The entire class of TEUs were suspended from trading on the New YorkStockExchange on July 1, 2019 and removed from listing and registration on July 12, 2019. On July 1, 2019, approximately 18.8 million treasury shares of Vistra common stock were issued inconnection with thesettlement of alloutstanding TEUs.\n\n## 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nWe utilize several different valuationtechniques to measure the fairvalueofassets and liabilities, relying primarily on the market approachofusing prices and othermarket information for identicaland/or comparablea assets and liabilities for those items thatare measured on arecurring basis. Weuse amid-market valuationconvention (the mid-point pricebetween bid and ask prices) as apracticalexpedient to measure fairvalue for the majoa rity of our assets and liabilities and use valuation techniques to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our valuation policies and procedures were developed, maintained and validatedbyacentralizedrisk management group thatreports to the Vistra Chief FinancialOfficer.\n\nFair value measurementsof derivative assets and liabilities incorporate an adjustment for credit-related nonperformance risk. These nonperformancerisk adjustments take into consideration master netting arrangements, credit enhancements and the credit risks associated with our credit standing and the creditstanding of our counterparties (see Note 16 for additional information regarding credit risk associated with our derivatives). We utilize credit ratings and default rate factff ors in calculating these fairvalue measurement adjustmd ents.\n\nWe categorizeour assets and liabilitiesrecorded atfaiff rvalue based upon the following fairvalue hierarchy:\n\n- \u00b7 Level1valuations use quotedprices in active marketsforff identicalassets or liabilities thatare accessible at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets and liabilities include CME or ICE (electronic commodity derivative exchanges) futures and options transacted through clearing brokers for which prices are actively quoted. We report thefairff value of CME and ICE transactions without taking intoconsideration margin deposits, with the exception of certain margin amounts related to changes in fairvalue on certain CME transactions thatare legally characterized as settlement of derivative contractsratherthancollateral.\n- \u00b7 Level2valuations utilize over-the-counterbroker quotes, quotedprices for similarassets or liabilities thatare corroboratedbycorrelations or othermathematicalmeans, and othervaluation inputssuchas interest rates and yield curves observable atcommonly quoted intervals. We attempt to obtain multiple quotes from brokers thatare active in themarkets in which we participate and require at least one quote from two brokers to determine apricing input as observablea . The numberof broker quotesreceived for certain pricing inputsvaries depending on the depth of the tradingmarket,each individual broker's publication policy, recent trading volume trends andvarious otherfacff tors.\n- \u00b7 Level3valuations use unobservablea inputs for the assetor liabia lity. Unobservablea inputs are used to the extent observablea inputs are notavailable, thereby allowing for situations in whichthere is little, if any, marketactivity for the assetor liabia lity at the measurement date. We use the most meaningful information availablefromff the market combinedwith internally developedvaluation methodologies todevelop our best estimateoffaiff rvalue. Significant unobservablea inputs used to develop the valuationmodels include volatility curves, correlation curves, illiquid pricing delivery periods and locations and credit-relatednonperformanceriskassumptions. These inputs and valuation models are developed and maintainedby employees trained and experienced inmarket operations and fairvalue measurements andvalidatedbythe Company's risk management group.\n\nWith respect to amounts presented inthe following fair value hierarchy tablea s, the fairvaluemeasurement of an assetor liability( e.g. , acontract) is required to fall in itsentirety in one level,based on the lowest level input that issignificant to the fair value measurement.",

We also utilize short-term electricity,naturalt gas, coal and emissions derivative instruments for fuel hedging and other purposes. Counterparties to these transactions include energy companies, financial institutit ons, electricutilities, independent power producers, fuel oil and gas producers, local distribution companies and energy marketing companies. Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fairvalueof derivative instruments as well as realized gains and losses upon settlement of the instruments are reported inour consolidated statementsofoperations in operating revenues and fuel, purchased powercosts anddelivery fees.\n\nInterestt tRate Swaps -Interest rateswap agreements are used to reduceexposure to interest ratechanges by converting floating-rate interest rates to fixedrates, thereby hedging future interest costs and related cashflows. Unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fairvalueofthe swapsa as wellasrealized gains and lossesuponu settlement of the swapsa are reported in our consolidated statements of operations in interest expense and related charges. During 2019, Vistra entered into $2.12 billion of new interest rateswaps, pursuant to whichVistra will pay a variablerate and receive afixeff drate. The terms of these new swaps were matched against the termsofcertain existing swaps,a effectively offsetting the hedge of the existing swaps and fixing the out-of-the-money position of such swaps.a Thesematched swapsa will settleover time, inaccordance withthe original contractualt terms. The remaining existing swapsa continue to hedge our exposure on $2.30 billion of debt through July 2026.\n\n## Financial Statement Effeff ctsott fD o erivatives\n\nSubstantially all derivative contractualt assets and liabilities are accounted for under mark-to-marketaccounting consistent with accounting standards related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.

Margin deposits received from counterparties are primarily used for working capia talorother generalcorporate purposes.\n\nThe following tablea sreconcile our derivative assets and liabilities on a contractbasis to net amounts aftertaking into consideration netting arrangements with counterparties and financial collateral:\n\n|                              | December 31, 2021                 | December 31, 2021          | December 31, 2021                      | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020                 | December 31, 2020          | December 31, 2020                      | December 31, 2020   |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|\n|                              | Derivative Assets and Liabilities | Offsetting Instruments (a) | Cash Collateral (Received) Pledged (b) | Net Amounts         | Derivative Assets and Liabilities | Offsetting Instruments (a) | Cash Collateral (Received) Pledged (b) | Net Amounts         |\n| Derivative assets:           |                                   |                            |                                        |                     |                                   |                            |                                        |                     |\n| Commodity contracts          | $ 2,739                           | $ (2,051)                  | $ (27)                                 | $ 661               | $ 858                             | $ (667)                    | $ (11)                                 | $ 180               |\n| Interestrateswapsa           | 19                                | (19)                       | -                                      | -                   | 72                                | (72)                       | -                                      | -                   |\n| Total derivative assets      | 2,758                             | (2,070)                    | (27)                                   | 661                 | 930                               | (739)                      | (11)                                   | 180                 |\n| Derivative liabilities:      |                                   |                            |                                        |                     |                                   |                            |                                        |                     |\n| Commodity contracts          | (3,605)                           | 2,051                      | 784                                    | (770)               | (933)                             | 667                        | 138                                    | (128)               |\n| Interestrateswapsa           | (217)                             | 19                         | -                                      | (198)               | (404)                             | 72                         | -                                      | (332)               |\n| Total derivative liabilities | (3,822)                           | 2,070                      | 784                                    | (968)               | (1,337)                           | 739                        | 138                                    | (460)               |\n| Netamounts                   | $ (1,064)                         | $ - $                      | 757                                    | $ (307)             | $ (407)                           | $ - $                      | 127                                    | $ (280)             |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

Afteramendments in2012, employees in the Retirement Plannow consistentirely of participants who were active and retiredcollective bargaining unit employees. The Retirement Plan is a qualified defined benefit pension planunder Section 401(a) of the InternalRevenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code),and is subject to the provisions of ERISA. The Retirement Plan providesbenefits to participants under one of two formulas: (i) a CashBalance Formula under which participants earn monthly contribution creditsbased on their compensation and a combination of their age and years of service, plus monthly interest credits or (ii) aTraditional Retirement Plan Formula based on years of service and the average earnings of the three years of highest earnings. Under the Cash Balance Formula,futureff increases in earnings will not apply to prior servicecosts. It isour policy to fund the Retirement Planassets only to the extent required under existing federal regulations.\n\nVistra and our participating subsidiariesoffer other postretirement employeebenefits(OPEB) in the form of certain healthcare and life insurancebenefits toeligible retirees and their eligible dependents. The retireecontributions requiredforff such coverage vary based on aformff ula depending on theretiree's age and years of service.\n\nEffective January 1, 2018, Vistra entered into a contractualarrangement withOncor whereby the costs associatedwith providing OPEB coverage for certain retirees (Split Participants) whose employment includedservicewith both the regulated businesses of Oncor (or its predecessors) and the non-regulated businesses of Vistra (or its predecessors) are splitbetween Oncor and Vistra.

This plan is aparticipant-directeddefined contribution plan intended toqualify under Section 401(a) of the Code and is subject to the provisions of ERISA. Under the terms of the Thrift Plan, employees who do not earn more than the IRS thresholdcompensation limitused to determine highly compensated employees maycontribute, through pre-tax salary deferrals and/or after-tax payrolldeductions, the lesser of 75% of their regular salary or wages or the maximum amount permittedunder applicable law. Employeeswho earn more than such threshold maycontributefromff 1% to 20% of their regular salary or wages. Employer matching contributions are also made in an amount equalto 100% (75% for employees coveredunder the traditional formula inthe Retirement Plan) of the first6% of employeecontributions. Employer matching contributions are made in cashand may be allocated by participants to any of the plan's investment options.\n\nAt the Merger Date,Vistra assumed Dynegy's participant-directeddefined contribution plan. In January 2019, this plan was merged into the Thrift Plan.\n\nAggregateemployercontributions to the qualified savings plans totaled $34 million, $34 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively.",

Following approvalofthe Board and approvalbythe stockholders at the 2019 annualmeeting of the Company, the 2016 Incentive Planwas amended to increase the maximum numberofshares reserved for issuance under the 2016 Incentive Plan to 37,500,000. The Board or any committee duly authorized by the Board will administerthe 2016 Incentive Planand has broad authority under the 2016 Incentive Planto, among otherthings: (a) select participants, (b) determine the typesofawards that participants are to receive and the numberof shares thatare to be subjecttosuchawards and (c) establia sh the terms and conditions of awards, including the price (if any) to be paidforff the sharesofthe award. The typesofawards that may be granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan include stock options, RSUs, restricted stock, performance awards and otherformsff of awards granted or denominated inshares of Vistra common stock, as wellas certain cash-based awards.\n\nIf any stock option or otherstock-based award granted under the 2016 Incentive Plan expires, terminates or is canceledforff any reason without having beenexercised in full, the numberofshares of Vistra common stock underlying any unexercised award shall againbe availableforff awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan. If any shares of restricted stock, performance awards or other stock-based awards denominated in sharesofVistra common stockawardedunder the 2016 Incentive Planare forfeited for any reason, the numberofforfeiff tedshares shallagain be availableforff purposes of awards under the 2016 Incentive Plan. Any award under the 2016 Incentive Plan settled in cash shall not be counted against the maximum share limitation. No awards under the2016 Incentive Plan have been settled in cash since the Effective Date.\n\nAs is customary in incentive plans of thisnature,t each share limitand the numberand kind of shares availablea under the 2016 Incentive Plan and any outstanding awards, aswell as theexercise or purchase priceofawards, and performance targets under certain typesof performance-based awards, are required tobe adjusted in the event of certain reorganizations, mergers, combinations, recapitalizations, stock splits, stock dividends or othersimilarevents that change the numberor kind of shares outstanding, andextraordinary dividends or distributions of propertytt o the Vistra stockholders.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensationtt Expensexx\n\nStock-based compensatm ion expense is reported asSG&A inthe consolidated statements of operations as follows:\n\n|                                            | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                            | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Total stock-based compensation expense     | $ 51                      | $ 63                      | $ 47                      |\n| Income tax benefit                         | (12)                      | (15)                      | (9)                       |\n| Stockbased-compensation expense,net of tax | $ 39                      | $ 48                      | $ 38                      |\n\n## StockOptionsOO\n\nThe fairvalueofeachstockoption is estimatedonthe dateofgrant using aBlack-Scholesoption-pricing model. The risk-free interestrateused in the option valuation modelwas based on yields availableonthe grant dates for U.S. Treasury Strips with maturity consistent with the expected life assumption. The expected term of the option represents the period of time thatoptions granted are expected tobeoutstanding and is based on the SEC Simplifiedff Method (midpoint of average vesting time andcontractualterm). Expectedvolatility is based on an average of the historical, daily volatility of apeergroup selected by Vistra over aperiod consistent with the expected lifeaff ssumption ending on the grant date. We assumed no dividend yield in the valuationofthe options granted from 2016 through 2018, and assumed 2.3% and 1.9% dividend yields in the valuationof options granted in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These options may beexercised over eitherthree- or four-yeargradedvesting periods and will expire 10 years from the grant date.",

SEGMENTINFORMATION\n\nThe operations of Vistra are aligned intosix reportablebusiness segments: (i) Retail, (ii) Texas, (iii) East,(iv)West, (v) Sunsetand (vi) AssetClosure. In the third quarter of 2020, Vistra updatu ed itsreportablesegments to reflectchanges in how the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) makes operating decisions, assesses performance and allocates resources. Managementbelieves the revised reportablesegments provide enhanced transparency into the Company's long-term sustainable assets and itscommitment to managing the retirementofeconomically and environmentally challengedplants. The following is a summary of theupdau tedsegments:\n\n- \u00b7 The Sunsetsegment represents plants withannounced retirement plans thatwere previously reported in the ERCOT, PJM and MISO segments. Given recent and expected future retirements of certain power plants, management believes it is important to have a segmentwhich differentiff ates between operating plants withdefined retirement plans and operating plantswithout defined retirement plans.\n- \u00b7 The East segment representsVistra's electricity generation operations in the Eastern Interconnection of the U.S. electricgrid, otherthanassets thatare now part of the Sunset or AssetClosure segments, respectively, and includes operations in PJM, ISO-NE and NYISO thatwere previously reported inthe PJM and NY/NE segments, respectively.\n- \u00b7 The West segment representsVistra's electricity generation operations in CAISO and was previously reported in the Corporatr e and Other non-segment. As reflectedbythe Moss Landing and Oakland ESS projects(see Note 3), the Company expects toexpand itsoperations in the West segment.\n\nOur CODM reviews the results of these segments separately and allocates resources to the respectivesegments as part of our strategicoperations. Ameasure of assets is not applicable, as segment assets are not regularly reviewed by the CODM for evaluating performanceorallocating resources.\n\nThe Retailsegment isengaged inretailsalesofelectricity and naturalt gas to residential, commercialand industrial customers. Substantially all of these activities areconductedbyTXU Energy, Ambit,Value Based Brands,Dynegy Energy Services, Homefield Energy, TriEagle Energy, Public Powerand U.S. Gas&Electric across 19 states in the U.S.\n\nThe Texas and East segments are engaged in electricity generation, wholesaleenergy sales and purchases, commodity risk management activities, fuel production and fuel logistics management. The Texas segment representsresultsfromff the ERCOT marketand was referred to as the ERCOT segment prior to the third quarter of 2020. The East segment representsresultsfromff the PJM, ISO-NE and NYISO markets. We determined itwas appropriate to aggregateresultsfromff these markets intoone reportablesegment, East, givensimilareconomiccharacteristics.\n\nThe West segmentrepresentsresultsfromff the CAISO market, including our development of battery ESS projects atour Moss Landing and Oakland power plant sites(see Note 3).\n\nThe Sunset segment consists of generation plants withannouncedretirement plans. Separately reporting the Sunset segment differentiatesoperating plants withannouncedretirement plans from our otheroperating plants in the Texas, East and West segments. We have allocated unrealized gains and lossesonthe commodity risk management activities to the Sunset segment for the generation plants that have announcedretirement plans.\n\nThe AssetClosure segment is engaged inthe decommissioning and reclamation of retired plants and mines (see Note 4). Separately reporting the AssetClosure segment providesmanagement with better information related to the performance and earnings power of Vistra's ongoing operations and facilitates management's focus on minimizing the costassociatedwith decommissioning and reclamation of retired plants and mines. We have not allocated any unrealized gains or lossesonthe commodity risk management activities to the AssetClosure segment for the generation plants thatwere retired in 2018, 2019 and 2020.\n\nCorporater and Other represents the remaining non-segment operations consisting primarily ofgeneral corporate expenses, interest, taxes andotherexpenses related toour support functions that provide sharedservices toour operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in the summary of significff ant accounting policies in Note 1. Our CODM uses more than one measure to assess segment performance, including segment net income (loss), which is the measure most comparablea to consolidatednet income (loss) prepared basedonU.S. GAAP. We account for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales or transfers were to third parties, that is, at market prices. Certain sharedservices costs are allocated to the segments.",

SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\n## Impaim rme i i nt of Long-Lived Assets\n\nIn the second quarter of 2021, we recognized an impairment loss of $38 million related to our Zimmer generation facility in Ohio as aresult of a significant decrease in the estimatedusefulff life of the facilities,reflectinff g adecrease in the economic forecast of thefacilitff yand the inability to secure capaca ityrt evenues for the plant in the latestPJM capaca ityauction held in May 2021. The impairments are reported inour Sunsetsegmentand include a$33 million write-down of property, plant and equipment anda$5million write-down of inventory.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we recognized impairment lossesof $173 million related to our Kincaid coalgeneration facilityin Illinois and $99 million related to our Zimmer coalgeneration facilityinOhio, eachas aresultof a significant decrease in the estimated useful life of the facility, reflecff ting our recently announced planto retire both facilitiesbythe end of 2027 in response to the finalCCR rule (see Notes 4and 13). The impairment losses are reported in our Sunsetsegment and include a$260 millionwrite-down of property, plant and equipment and a$12 million write-down of inventory.\n\nIn the firstquarter of 2020, we recognized an impairment loss of $52 million related to our Joppa/EEI coalgeneration facilityin Illinois as a result of a significant decrease in the estimated useful life of the facility, reflecff ting a decrease in the economicforecff ast of the facilityand changes to the operating assumptim on based on lower forecastedwholesaleelectricity prices. We also recorded a$32 million impairment to a capacitycontractwhich was linked in part to the Joppa/EEIfacff ilityand therefore determined to have a significant decrease in estimateduseful life. The impairments are reported in our Sunset segment and include a$45 million write-down of property, plant and equipment, a$32 million write-down of intangible assets and a$7million write-down of inventory.\n\nIn determining the fairvalueofthe impaired assets, we equally weighted amarket approachbased on transactions of similarassets and an income approach discounting our projected cashflows through the respective plant retirement dates.\n\n## Interestt tExpenseEE and Relatell dChargeCC s\n\n|                                                                     | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   | Year Ended December 31,   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                                                     | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2019                      |\n| Interest paid/accrued                                               | $ 480                     | $ 467                     | $ 576                     |\n| Unrealized mark-to-market net (gains) losseson interest rate swapsa | (134)                     | 155                       | 220                       |\n| Amortization of debt issuancecosts, discounts andpremiums           | 30                        | 18                        | 9                         |\n| Debt extinguishment (gain) loss                                     | 1                         | (17)                      | (21)                      |\n| Capita alized interest                                              | (26)                      | (21)                      | (12)                      |\n| Other                                                               | 33                        | 28                        | 25                        |\n| Total interest expense and relatedcharges                           | $ 384                     | $ 630                     | $ 797                     |\n\nThe weighted average interestrateappla icable to the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities, taking into account the interest rateswapsa discussed inNote 11, was3.90%, 3.88% and 4.03% as of December31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.",

Since thecosts to ultimately decommission that plant are recoverablea through the regulatory ratemaking process as part of Oncor'sdelivery fees, a corresponding regulatory liability has been recorded to our consolidated balance sheet of $325 million in other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits.\n\nThe following tablea summarizes the changes to these obligations, reported as AROs(currentand noncurrent liabilities) in our consolidated balance sheets, for the years endedDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\nNuclear Plant\n\n|                                                         | Decommissioning   | Reclamation   | Other   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|---------|---------|\n| Liability at December31, 2018                           | $ 1,276           | $ 442         | $ 655   | $ 2,373 |\n| Additions:                                              |                   |               |         |         |\n| Accretion                                               | 44                | 22            | 31      | 97      |\n| Adjustment for change in estimates                      | -                 | 16            | (1)     | 15      |\n| Adjustment for obligations assumed through acquisitions | -                 | -             | (3)     | (3)     |\n| Reductions:                                             |                   |               |         |         |\n| Payments                                                | -                 | (70)          | (39)    | (109)   |\n| Liability transfers (a)                                 | -                 | -             | (135)   | (135)   |\n| Liability at December31, 2019                           | 1,320             | 410           | 508     | 2,238   |\n| Additions:                                              |                   |               |         |         |\n| Accretion                                               | 46                | 20            | 23      | 89      |\n| Adjustment for change in estimates (b)                  | 219               | (6)           | 25      | 238     |\n| Reductions:                                             |                   |               |         |         |\n| Payments                                                | -                 | (65)          | (49)    | (114)   |\n| Liability transfers (a)                                 | -                 | -             | (15)    | (15)    |\n| Liability at December31, 2020                           | 1,585             | 359           | 492     | 2,436   |\n| Additions:                                              |                   |               |         |         |\n| Accretion                                               | 50                | 16            | 22      | 88      |\n| Adjustment for change in estimates                      | -                 | 13            | 1       | 14      |\n| Reductions:                                             |                   |               |         |         |\n| Payments                                                | -                 | (68)          | (20)    | (88)    |\n| Liability at December31, 2021                           | 1,635             | 320           | 495     | 2,450   |\n| Less amountsdued currently                              | -                 | (90)          | (14)    | (104)   |\n| Noncurrent liability at December31, 2021                | $ 1,635           | $ 230         | $ 481   | $ 2,346 |\n\nMining Land\n\nCoal Ash and",

Under applicable accounting standards, the liability is remeasuredwhen significant changes inthe amount or timing of cash flows occur, and the PUCT requires anew cost estimate at least every five years. The increase in the liability wasdriven by changes in assumptim ons including increased costs for labor,a equipment and services and a delay in timing of when the U.S. Department of Energy is estimated to beginaccepting spent fueloffsite.\n\n## OtherNoncurreNN nt Liabilii it l l ie t t sand Deferree dCreCC ditstt\n\nThe balanceofother noncurrent liabilities and deferredcreditsconsists of thefolff lowing:\n\n|                                                       | December 31,   | December 31,   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                       | 2021           | 2020           |\n| Retirement and other employee benefits(Note 17)       | $ 276          | $ 312          |\n| WinterStorm Uri impact(a)                             | 261            | -              |\n| Identifiable intangible liabila ities(Note 6)         | 147            | 289            |\n| Regulatory liability                                  | 325            | 89             |\n| Finance lease liabilities                             | 235            | 206            |\n| Uncertain taxpositions, including accrued interest    | 13             | 12             |\n| Liability for third-party remediation                 | 17             | 31             |\n| Accrued severance costs                               | 39             | 54             |\n| Otheraccruedexpenses                                  | 176            | 138            |\n| Total othernoncurrent liabilities and deferredcredits | $ 1,489        | $ 1,131        |\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n## FairVii alue V V of Debt\n\n|                                                              |                      | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Long-term debt (see Note 11):                                | Fair Value Hierarchy | Carrying Amount     | Fair Value          | Carrying Amount     | Fair Value          |\n| Long-term debt under the Vistra Operations Credit Facilities | Level 2              | $ 2,549             | $ 2,518             | $ 2,579             | $ 2,565             |\n| Vistra Operations Senior Notes                               | Level 2              | 7,880               | 8,193               | 6,634               | 7,204               |\n| Forward Capaca ity Agreements                                | Level 3              | 211                 | 211                 | 45                  | 45                  |\n| Equipment Financing Agreements                               | Level 3              | 85                  | 85                  | 59                  | 59                  |\n| Building Financing                                           | Level 2              | 3                   | 3                   | 10                  | 10                  |\n| Otherdebt                                                    | Level 3              | 3                   | 3                   | 3                   | 3                   |\n\ndetermine fairvalue in accordance withaccounting standards as discussed inNote 15.
