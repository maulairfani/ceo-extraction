Many of our colleagues were adversely impacted in their personal or work lives. Even now, we continue to see new COVID-19 variants emerging and we have had to adapt to a constantly changing landscape.\n\nThroughout this period, our colleagues around the world led by our Group Chief Executive Bill Winters and the Management Team - have continued to focus on protecting the interests of shareholders, while ensuring the wellbeing of colleagues and supporting our customers, clients and communit/i.rightes. The spir/i.rightt our colleagues have shown throughout, despite the often diff/i.rightcult circumstances, has been exemplary and I am extremely proud of how we have all come out of 2021.\n\n## Our financ/i.rightal performance is improv/i.rightng\n\nLater in this report, Bill and Andy Halford, our Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer, will set out more detail on our financ/i.rightal performance as we navigated the second year of the pandemic.

The Board has recommended a final div/i.rightdend of 9 cents per share, or $277 mill/i.righton, with the full year div/i.rightdend an increase of onethird from 2020. We have also announced a share buy-back programme and will shortly start purchasing and then cancelling up to $750 mill/i.righton of ordinary shares.\n\nThe Board is committed to operating with/i.rightn the 13 to 14 per cent CET1 ratio range and we are very clear that capital not needed to fund growth will be returned to shareholders. We have returned $2.6 bill/i.righton of capital to shareholders over the last three years through a mix of div/i.rightdends and share buy-backs. This included paying out the maximum amount we were authorised to in 2020 when the emerging pandemic resulted in a suspension of distr/i.rightbutions.\n\n## We are deliver/i.rightng against our strategic prior/i.rightties\n\nWhile the pandemic brought about considerable challenges and, as a result, the turnaround is taking longer than previously antic/i.rightpated, it is clear to us that the refreshed strategic prior/i.rightties we set out at the start of 2021 are right. Our ambit/i.righton of deliver/i.rightng 10 per cent return on tangible equity remains as resolute as ever and we are working to accelerate its achievement by 2024. In Bill's report the actions we are targeting are outlined, which includes active management of the Group's capital, with a target to return in excess of $5 bill/i.righton in the next three years. Our strategy brings the dynamism of our markets to life in our business. Our focus is now on executing against the prior/i.rightties at pace, and we are making progress on each of them.\n\nOur Network and Affluent businesses remain key competit/i.rightve different/i.rightators, both strong generators of high-quality and higher-returning 'capital-lite' income streams.\n\nWe are transforming our abil/i.rightty to onboard, serve and exceed the expectations of our Mass Retail customers, which will help to feed our higher-margin Affluent business, as well as being a sign/i.rightficant source of income.\n\nSustainab/i.rightlity is a moral imperat/i.rightve and an opportunity. Our Sustainable Finance capabil/i.rightties are not only making a difference where it matters the most, but also representing a growing source of income.\n\n## We are accelerating our pathway to net zero\n\nWe have long recognised climate change as one of the greatest challenges of our time, given its widespread and proven impact on the physical environment and human health, as well as its potential to hamper economic growth. The complex trade-offs which come with climate actions mean there are no simple answers. We announced our net zero roadmap in October, following extensive engagement with shareholders, clients and NGOs. The approach was reviewed and approved by the Board and included inter/i.rightm targets to reduce financed emiss/i.rightons and mobil/i.rightse $300 bill/i.righton in green and transit/i.righton finance by 2030. Our approach emphasises the need for a just transit/i.righton to net zero: the impacts of climate change are felt most severely in our footprint, and if we do not meet climate object/i.rightves in a way that recognises the need for markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East to grow and prosper, we will fail.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal KPIs 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim Deliver sustainable improvement in the Group's profitab/i.rightlity as a percentage of the value of shareholders' tangible equity.\n\nAnalysis Underlying RoTE of 6.0 per cent in 2021 was a 300bps improvement on 3.0 per cent in 2020.\n\nThe underlying profit attributable to ordinary shareholders expressed as a percentage of average ordinary shareholders' tangible equity\n\nAim Deliver a posit/i.rightve return on shareholders' investment through share price appreciat/i.righton and div/i.rightdends paid.\n\nAnalysis Our TSR in the full year 2021 was negative 2.0 per cent, compared with negative 34.6 per cent in 2020.\n\nCombines simple share price appreciat/i.righton with div/i.rightdends paid to show the total return to the shareholder and is expressed as a percentage total return to shareholders\n\nAim Mainta/i.rightn a strong capital base and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio.\n\nAnalysis Our CET1 ratio was 14.1 per cent, above our 13-14 per cent target range.\n\nThe components of the Group's capital are summarised on page 288",

The Board was also heavily involved in the key decis/i.rightons ahead of endorsing the Group's net zero white paper, published in October ahead of COP 26.\n\n## We are taking ambit/i.rightous Stands\n\nThe Group has built a unique footprint in the world's most dynamic markets, serving the people and businesses that are the engines of their growth. As the bank for the new economy, we will ensure we continue to shape our business to drive their success - and ours - for the future.\n\nWe have a huge opportunity to build a better future with our customers and communit/i.rightes. We believe that we can fulfil our Purpose - to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique divers/i.rightty - without people being left behind, without the planet being negatively impacted, and without creating div/i.rightsions that dim/i.rightnish our sense of community.\n\nWe're taking a set of Stands to help solve some of the world's most crit/i.rightcal problems - lift/i.rightng economic partic/i.rightpation, helping emerging markets reduce carbon emiss/i.rightons, and supporting a fairer model for globalisat/i.righton. As well as addressing societal challenges, we believe these long-term ambit/i.rightons will stretch and motivate the Group to deliver our strategy faster and better.\n\nWe've rallied together for our communit/i.rightes, reaching more than 300,000 young people through our Futuremakers programme to support education, employabil/i.rightty, and entrepreneurship across our markets during the year.\n\nAll these achievements, and more, speak to the heart and mettle of who we are. They are a testament to our valued behaviours of being Better Together, endeavouring to Do the Right Thing, and putting our best foot forward to Never Settle. These attributes, along with the resil/i.rightence and adaptabil/i.rightty of our colleagues, are crit/i.rightcal for us. We must continue to build on our culture of excellence, which is client-centric, diverse and inclus/i.rightve, to deliver on our aspirat/i.rightons to be truly high-performing.\n\n## Our outlook is bright despite an uncertain environment\n\nWhilst uncertaint/i.rightes persist in relation to COVID-19 and the geopolit/i.rightcal landscape, we see plenty of opportunit/i.rightes that are compelling.\n\nGlobal growth is expected to continue in 2022 albeit somewhat slower after the sharp recovery we saw in 2021. Asia, our largest region, is poised to remain the fastestgrowing area in the world.\n\nWe expect policy support to scale back, as a number of central banks tighten policy to counter inflat/i.righton leading to ris/i.rightng interest rates, and fiscal programmes are eased.\n\nWe continue to see accelerated change across the global business ecosystem, from the dig/i.righttal space, to trade flows and supply chain shifts, and these are just some of the reasons why we are excited at the prospects of the Group.\n\nThe Board will continue to oversee the task of strik/i.rightng the right balance between the opportunit/i.rightes and risks that we see. I am confident that, with the actions we have outlined to continue driv/i.rightng and indeed accelerating our strategic prior/i.rightties, we will create long-term and sustainable value for our stakeholders.\n\nDr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman 17 February 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

We saw a return to income growth, which we believe signals the start of a sustainable recovery, and we fin/i.rightshed the year with good business momentum in Financ/i.rightal Markets, Trade and Wealth Management. Good cost disc/i.rightpline allowed us to generate posit/i.rightve income-to-cost jaws in the second half of the year. Continued low levels of credit impa/i.rightrment have helped us increase profit by 61 per cent on a constant currency basis to $3.9 bill/i.righton and deliver a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 6 per cent.\n\nConfidence in our overall asset quality and earnings trajectory allows us to return sign/i.rightficant capital to shareholders: we are announcing today a $750 mill/i.righton share buy-back, starting imm/i.rightnently, together with a 12 cents per share full-year div/i.rightdend, up a third on 2020. We are also committ/i.rightng to deliver substantial returns to investors over the next few years while managing our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio dynamically with/i.rightn our 13 to 14 per cent range.\n\nWe remain liqu/i.rightd, well capital/i.rightsed and soundly posit/i.rightoned for the year ahead.\n\n## Confidence in our purpose and strategy\n\nThe places Standard Chartered call home are the world's most dynamic markets, setting the pace for global growth. The people and businesses we serve, connect and partner with are the engines of the new economy of trade and innovat/i.righton, and central to the transit/i.righton to a fair and sustainable future. Our Purpose is to drive commerce and prosperity through our unique divers/i.rightty. This infuses everything we do, connecting our strategy with opportunit/i.rightes to drive growth and deliver our societal ambit/i.rightons.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "To help us deliver our Purpose, we have defined three 'Stands', areas where we have long-term ambit/i.rightons: Accelerating Zero, Lift/i.rightng Partic/i.rightpation and Resetting Globalisat/i.righton. Representing some of the main societal challenges of our time, these are not separate from our strategy, but integral to deliver/i.rightng and accelerating it: stretching our think/i.rightng, action and leadership.\n\nWe have managed seism/i.rightc changes over the last two years and these external challenges have helped us understand how we can accelerate our progress. Our strategy is as relevant now as it was pre-pandemic:\n\n- \u00b7 The growth of the Affluent segment in our markets has continued apace and remains one of our greatest opportunit/i.rightes. Since 2018, the number of clients has increased by around 400,000 and assets under management are up $52 bill/i.righton. We see opportunit/i.rightes to accelerate this growth through further dig/i.righttisat/i.righton, partnerships and investment\n- \u00b7 The trade flows across our Network remain as vibrant as ever and our unique physical footprint enables us to serve clients as they continue to trade and expand across borders. Network income has grown by around 6 per cent annually since 2018, excluding the impact of interest rate headwinds\n- \u00b7 The pandemic stress-tested our Mass Retail business and we have fared well. This segment is back on track, and we see opportunit/i.rightes to develop it further with our range of proven dig/i.righttal capabil/i.rightties and growing list of excit/i.rightng partnerships. In 2021, our Credit Cards and Personal Loans business returned to profitab/i.rightlity with a strong improvement in the cost-to-income ratio\n- \u00b7 Our Sustainab/i.rightlity agenda and thought and action leadership remains a key prior/i.rightty as the world continues to face sign/i.rightficant environmental and climate challenges. We see this as both an imperat/i.rightve and an opportunity. We are determined to deliver on our plans - to reach net zero in our operations by 2025 and in our financed emiss/i.rightons by 2050. This year we announced inter/i.rightm targets to reduce financed emiss/i.rightons by 2030 in the most carbonintens/i.rightve sectors. To provide transparency and support collective learning, we published a detailed white paper outlin/i.rightng our methodology and approach. We are also focused on accelerating growth in Sustainable Finance , with plans to mobil/i.rightse $300 bill/i.righton in green and transit/i.righton finance by 2030 and we are strengthening our sustainab/i.rightlity capabil/i.rightties in our Consumer, Private and Business Banking (CPBB) business\n\nCash investment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNetwork income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3%\n\nThe long-term fundamentals of the markets in which we operate have not changed. These markets, notably China and other markets in Asia, will drive future global economic growth over the coming decades. We are confident we have the right strategy to capture the opportunit/i.rightes that will arise from those trends, and we can see evidence that it is working.\n\n## Taking action to simpl/i.rightfy, focus and accelerate our path to 10 per cent RoTE\n\nWhen we presented the Group's refreshed strategy to the market in February 2019, we set out our plan to deliver 10 per cent RoTE by 2021. In the year that followed we grew income and RoTE. But COVID-19 triggered an economic downturn and related reduction in interest rates, inev/i.righttably squeezing our margins and reducing income and returns sharply.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we have not achieved the returns we seek for investors. With this in mind, we have conducted a comprehensive review of our business model and strategy. There are many areas where we have made good progress in recent years despite the pandemic, includ/i.rightng returning CPBB to profitab/i.rightlity in China and Korea, almost trebling the cumulative operating profit from our four large optim/i.rightsation markets and releasing around $15 bill/i.righton of RWA through exits, includ/i.rightng the sale of our Permata jo/i.rightnt venture. But we concluded that we must make changes to accelerate our path to 10 per cent RoTE by 2024. We will accelerate our execution and are implement/i.rightng plans to simpl/i.rightfy our business and sharpen our focus on where we are most different/i.rightated. By 2024 we are targeting:\n\n- \u00b7 About a 160-basis point improvement in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking (CCIB) income return on risk-weighted assets (RWA) through optim/i.rightsation and mix changes, enabled by a $22 bill/i.righton reduction in RWA from exits and effic/i.rightencies combin/i.rightng to hold CCIB RWA at 31 December 2021 levels\n- \u00b7 A cost-to-income ratio in CPBB around 60 per cent, down from 76 per cent in 2021, achieved by growing income and executing a $500 mill/i.righton business expense reduction programme\n- \u00b7 A $300 mill/i.righton investment into our China-related businesses to capture the opportunity from China's continued opening and doubling its profit contribut/i.righton. Our posit/i.rightoning in China has never been better and the opportunit/i.rightes for us never more attractive\n- \u00b7 $1.3 bill/i.righton of gross cost effic/i.rightencies to help offset inflat/i.righton, create room for continued investment and mainta/i.rightn posit/i.rightve jaws of 2 per cent per year on average, excluding interest rate rises\n- \u00b7 Active management of the Group's capital posit/i.righton with a cumulative capital return in excess of $5 bill/i.righton equating to a fifth of our current market capital/i.rightsation and more than double the amount of the previous three years\n\nNumber of active Affluent Clients\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review\n\ncontinued\n\nAs well as these five measures, we have an overarching object/i.rightve to improve returns in markets and business lines which are not meeting our financ/i.rightal object/i.rightves and to continue to simpl/i.rightfy the management of the Group. We review these questions regularly and will take actions as appropriate. For example, we recently announced the merger of the Technology and Operations functions into one global organisat/i.righton, simpl/i.rightfying the structure and driv/i.rightng synergies.\n\n## Our actions are designed to amplify the posit/i.rightve impact of the improv/i.rightng outlook\n\nThe macro-economic environment remains important to the delivery of our financ/i.rightal ambit/i.rightons. By the end of 2021 falling rates over the last two years have driven a greater than $2 bill/i.righton reduction in net interest income which we have been working hard to replace. With the interest-rate cycle showing signs of turning, and given our posit/i.rightve gearing to US-dollar rates, we should recover this lost income.\n\nWe have said that we expect the Group's metabolic rate of income growth to be 5-7 per cent. This reflects our strong and improv/i.rightng market posit/i.rightoning and average GDP growth across our footprint where Asia is expected to outpace growth in the rest of the world by around 2 per cent over the next three years.\n\nThe specif/i.rightc asset and revenue pools that we are targeting with our strategy are also growing. By 2025, Asia Affluent assets and the Asia, Africa and Middle East Mass Retail revenue pool are expected to grow annually by 9 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively, compared to 6 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively, for the rest of the world.\n\nIn addit/i.righton to our metabolic income growth rate, we expect that interest rate rises could add about a further 3 per cent, driv/i.rightng average income growth rates of 8-10 per cent to 2024, accelerating the achievement of our returns aspirat/i.rightons.\n\nThe improvements in external condit/i.rightons, however, are not guaranteed and substantial uncertaint/i.rightes persist, in particular regarding geopolit/i.rightcal tensions and the evolution of inflat/i.righton and interest rates. As such, we are fully committed to taking the operational actions outlined above to underpin attainment of double-dig/i.rightt RoTE.\n\n## Confident in the future\n\nWe are confident we can deliver our strategy, build/i.rightng on the sign/i.rightficant progress we have made over the past several years and the momentum we have coming into 2022.\n\nWhilst uncertainty persists in relation to COVID-19, we also see sign/i.rightficant opportunit/i.rightes emerging:\n\n- \u00b7 Government and Central Bank polic/i.rightes are in transit/i.righton, creating volatil/i.rightty that can benefit our capital-lite Financ/i.rightal Markets and Wealth Management businesses\n- \u00b7 Accelerated trade flows and supply chain shifts across our footprint markets are increas/i.rightng the demand for Trade solutions\n- \u00b7 Sustainab/i.rightlity is crit/i.rightcal and an increas/i.rightng prior/i.rightty for both clients and governments - and we are uniquely posit/i.rightoned to support them\n- \u00b7 Our clients are accelerating their pivot to dig/i.righttal with increas/i.rightng will/i.rightngness and desire for dig/i.righttal-first banking\n- \u00b7 China is opening up at an accelerating pace, supporting the opportunit/i.rightes for which we have posit/i.rightoned for the past decade\n- \u00b7 Expected interest rate rises could add sign/i.rightficant further upside to our income growth rate\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe Group remains in great shape and in an enviable posit/i.righton. We exit the second year of the pandemic rooted in markets with strong growth prospects. We have the right strategy, business model and ambit/i.righton to deliver on this potential. We have shown a resil/i.rightent financ/i.rightal performance in 2021 and have set out clear actions to achieve a RoTE of 10 per cent by 2024.\n\nFinally, I would like to highl/i.rightght the remarkable efforts of our 82,000 colleagues again this year. Their commitment and endurance in challenging circumstances has delivered a seamless service to our customers and communit/i.rightes that we serve.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBill Winters Group Chief Executive 17 February 2022",

access has helped developed markets recover faster than emerging markets. As the pace of vaccinat/i.rightons improves in emerging markets, allowing greater resumption of economic activ/i.rightty, growth in emerging markets will improve over the medium term\n- \u00b7 Inflation concerns are likely to fade over the medium term as energy prices likely moderate and supply chain bottlenecks are resolved. This is likely to mean more lim/i.rightted central bank tighten/i.rightng than markets are currently pric/i.rightng in\n- \u00b7 Fiscal policy might turn from a tailw/i.rightnd to a headwind for growth. High public debt and government defic/i.rightts also mean that most economies are looking to tighten fiscal policy over the medium term following the sign/i.rightficant stimulus that accompanied COVID-19\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 has brought a renewed focus on supply chain concentration risks. Companies are likely to continue to accelerate the shortening and simpl/i.rightfying of supply chains\n- \u00b7 As companies aim to reduce concentration risks, they may divers/i.rightfy production away from China, the world's mega-trader. However, global research surveys of firms in the Greater Bay area ind/i.rightcate that China remains a preferred destinat/i.righton for most, followed by Associat/i.righton of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economies\n\n## Broader global trends\n\n- \u00b7 The world economy could see a permanent loss of economic output or 'scarring' due to the recession that followed the pandemic. This would make it harder for emerging markets to catch up with developed markets\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 has accelerated the pace of dig/i.righttalisat/i.righton of economies. Higher capex and moves towards dig/i.righttalisat/i.righton could boost productiv/i.rightty growth, proving an antidote to economic scarring concerns. With/i.rightn emerging markets, countries in Asia are best placed to take advantage of dig/i.righttalisat/i.righton\n- \u00b7 Long-term growth in the developed world is constrained by ageing populations and high levels of debt, exacerbated by the policy response to COVID-19\n- \u00b7 Relatively younger populations, as well as the adoption of dig/i.righttal technology, will allow emerging markets to become increas/i.rightngly important to global growth\n- \u00b7 Ris/i.rightng national/i.rightsm, anti-globalisat/i.righton and protection/i.rightsm are a threat to long-term growth prospects in emerging markets",

We forecast 2022 growth at 5.3 per cent closer to the lower bound of its estimated potential growth range of 5-6 per cent. We see upside risk from an easing of auto chip shortages and downside risk from prolonged weak housing demand amid expectations of a price correction\n- \u00b7 While innovat/i.righton, decarbonisat/i.righton and common prosperity rank high on China's long-term agenda, the government has put growth stabil/i.rightsation as the top prior/i.rightty in 2022. We expect macro polic/i.rightes to be eased, especially in H1, and the pace and intens/i.rightty of regulatory tighten/i.rightng to be finetuned to bolster domestic demand\n- \u00b7 We expect Hong Kong's economy to grow by 2.3 per cent in 2022 supported by global (and especially China) trade as post-COVID normalisat/i.righton broadens, while domestic consumption looks to face further headwinds given linger/i.rightng local COVID disrupt/i.rightons. We expect South Korea's economy to grow 2.9 per cent in 2022 supported by economic reopening and external trade\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 We expect ASEAN as a region to play catch up in terms of economic growth recovery versus developed markets (DMs) in 2022. Economic growth should improve as restrict/i.rightons are eased and as higher vaccinat/i.righton rates lim/i.rightt the severity of any new lockdowns. The recovery may however be bumpy, especially in economies where current vaccinat/i.righton rates are still below herd immun/i.rightty levels, for example, Indonesia and the Phil/i.rightppines\n- \u00b7 We expect inflat/i.righton in ASEAN to remain manageable for most regional economies although upside risk comes from prolonged supply-side disrupt/i.rightons and as demand recovers in the region through 2022. This should allow monetary policy to remain accommodative in H1 2022\n- \u00b7 India is likely to clock two successive years of high-single-dig/i.rightt growth buoyed by favourable base effects and recovering economic activ/i.rightty. We expect FY23 GDP at 8 per cent as more contact-intens/i.rightve sectors revert to normalised activ/i.rightty with increased vaccinat/i.righton coverage, continued fiscal policy support and better real wages. Inflation has been persistently high since late 2019 and better recovery is likely to push policy rate normalisat/i.righton in 2022",

We do not expect sign/i.rightficant new containment measures in 2022, with earlier lockdowns and curfews having an increas/i.rightngly less severe impact on the economy\n- \u00b7 Despite ris/i.rightng inflat/i.righton owing to higher food and fuel prices, we expect monetary policy in the region to remain largely accommodative, with modest normalisat/i.righton measures in most markets\n- \u00b7 Given that the COVID-shock left most SSA economies with elevated public debt ratios, fiscal policy consolidat/i.righton will remain a key ambit/i.righton, as SSA economies attempt to safeguard market access. In the case of East African economies, adoption of International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes is meant to send a signal on the intent to pursue fiscal consolidat/i.righton in order to stabil/i.rightse debt ratios. Reform in markets like Ghana and Niger/i.righta, with high debt service-to-revenue ratios, will be closely followed\n- \u00b7 The Middle East region is likely to be on a divergent recovery path, with oil-exporting countries bouncing back faster versus oil import/i.rightng countries, which remain constrained by high levels of debt. The pace of vaccinat/i.righton roll-out proved more rapid among oil exporters, with countries like the UAE leading the charge. The strong outlook for hydrocarbon prices and expected relaxation of targets for OPEC members are set to underpin the region's liqu/i.rightdity prospects in 2022. Improvements in oil exporters' fiscal and current account balances will boost the region's reserve posit/i.righton, leading to lower funding needs and preserving US dollar currency pegs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Growth in Europe and the Americas is likely to slow in 2022 as output gaps shrink and policy support is gradually eased back\n- \u00b7 COVID-19 will still present risks in early 2022 given the threat of new variants, and as booster vaccine programmes will take time to fully roll out, but supply chain disrupt/i.rightons (along with higher energy costs and potential shortages in Europe) will be the major headwind to growth\n- \u00b7 We expect inflat/i.rightonary pressures to remain high at least through H1 2022, but dis/i.rightnflation should kick in heading into H2\n- \u00b7 A further escalation in tensions between Russia and Ukraine and the potential introduct/i.righton of sanctions could have a negative impact on European economies and banks\n- \u00b7 The Fed is likely to begin hik/i.rightng rates by Q1 2022, and raise rates four times in 2022- taking the Fed Funds rate higher by 100 bps. The European Central Bank (ECB) is likely to begin rate hikes in H2-2022. Both the Fed and ECB are in the process of tapering their asset purchase programmes\n- \u00b7 The trade environment is likely to continue improv/i.rightng, but there are risks to the EU-UK trade agreement amid a broader rise in polit/i.rightcal tensions\n- \u00b7 In Latin America, we expect growth to moderate in 2022 as domestic demand normalises, while exports are expected to remain strong amid high commodity prices and improved supply-side constraints\n\n<!-- image -->",

In condit/i.rightons that remained challenging the Group delivered strong underlying profit growth of 61 per cent on a constant currency basis, and 300 basis points increase to return on tangible equity (RoTE) to 6 per cent, benefit/i.rightng from sign/i.rightficantly lower credit impa/i.rightrment. Income was broadly flat to 2020 and was down 1 per cent on a constant currency basis, reflecting the $0.7 bill/i.righton income lost in 2021 due to the low interest rate environment. After declin/i.rightng 6 per cent in the first half of the year on a constant currency basis excluding the impact of the debit valuation adjustment (DVA), the Group delivered 4 per cent income growth in the second half. The Group grew loans and advances to customers by 6 per cent and delivered a record level of assets under management with/i.rightn Wealth Management. Expenses were up 3 per cent on a constant currency basis as performance-related pay normalised after an abnormally low 2020 and as the Group continues to increase investment in strategic in/i.righttiat/i.rightves. Credit impa/i.rightrments reduced by $2 bill/i.righton reflecting the non-repeat of prior year stage 3 charges and an improv/i.rightng economic backdrop as markets began an uneven recovery from the effects of COVID-19. The Group remains well capital/i.rightsed and highly liqu/i.rightd with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 14.1 per cent, which translates to a pro forma 13.5% as at 1 January 2022 incorporating upcoming regulatory changes, enabling the Board to announce a further $750 mill/i.righton share buy-back programme to start imm/i.rightnently.\n\nAll commentary that follows is on an underlying basis and comparisons are made to the equivalent period in 2020 on a reported currency basis, unless otherwise stated.\n\n- \u00b7 Operating income was broadly flat and was down 1 per cent on a constant currency basis\n- \u00b7 Net interest income decreased 1 per cent with increased volumes more than offset by an 8 per cent or 10 basis point reduction in net interest margin. The decline in the net interest margin was as a result of the low interest rate environment and is equivalent to $0.7 bill/i.righton of lost income. Net interest income included a posit/i.rightve $171 mill/i.righton IFRS9 interest income catch-up adjustment in respect of interest earned on histor/i.rightcally impa/i.rightred assets, increas/i.rightng the net interest margin by 3 basis points\n- \u00b7 Other income was flat, with a record performance in Wealth Management and strong fee growth in Transaction Banking offset by lower trading income in Financ/i.rightal Markets and lower realisat/i.righton gains in Treasury\n- \u00b7 Operating expenses excluding the UK bank levy increased 5 per cent but were flat on a constant currency basis after adjust/i.rightng for the normalisat/i.righton of performance-related pay in spite of a higher inflat/i.righton environment. Expenses were held flat as the Group funded continued investment in transformational dig/i.righttal capabil/i.rightties through cost effic/i.rightency actions. The cost-to-income ratio on a constant currency basis (excluding the UK bank levy and DVA) increased 272 basis points to 70 per cent, however in the second half of the year the Group delivered 260 basis points of posit/i.rightve operating leverage. The UK bank levy decreased by $231 mill/i.righton to $100 mill/i.righton reflecting a change in the basis of calculation as it is now only chargeable on the Group's UK balance sheet",

The remain/i.rightng elements of the Group's Corporate Finance business - primar/i.rightly M&A Advisory - have been transferred into Lending & Portfolio Management.\n\nTransaction Banking income was down 9 per cent. Trade increased 16 per cent reflecting high single-dig/i.rightt growth in trade volumes from a sign/i.rightficant rebound in global trade as economies recover from COVID-19. Cash Management declined 22 per cent with the low interest rate environment leading to margin compression despite repric/i.rightng in/i.righttiat/i.rightves. This was partly offset by double-dig/i.rightt growth in volumes and fees.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal Markets income was flat, or down 2 per cent excluding the impact of a IFRS9 income adjustment, with strong performances in Credit Markets and Structured Finance offsetting a double-dig/i.rightt decline in Macro Trading income which was impacted by a non-repeat of 2020's exceptional market volatil/i.rightty. Credit Markets income grew 12 per cent, or 7 per cent excluding the impact of a $94 mill/i.righton IFRS9 income adjustment, with increased client demand growing both orig/i.rightnation and distr/i.rightbution volumes. Structured Finance was up 25 per cent benefit/i.rightng from increased leasing income due to new deals and profits from the sale of aircraft. Financ/i.rightng & Securit/i.rightes Services income was up 6 per cent with increased Security Services income partly offset by margin compression and lower demand for corporate term deposits.\n\nLending and Portfolio Management income was up 14 per cent, or 8 per cent excluding the impact of a $55 mill/i.righton IFRS9 income adjustment, with double-dig/i.rightt increase in balances on a constant currency basis and improved margins in Corporate Lending.\n\nWealth Management income grew 12 per cent to a record $2.2 bill/i.righton reflecting sustained growth in client numbers and double-dig/i.rightt growth in assets under management. There was a particularly strong sales performance in Funds, Structured Notes and Wealth Lending. Bancassurance income was up 9 per cent.\n\nRetail Products income declined 6 per cent or 7 per cent on a constant currency basis. Deposits income declined 41 per cent as margin compression from the low interest rate environment more than offset increased volumes and improved balance sheet mix. Strong volume growth and improved margins led to Mortgages & Auto income increas/i.rightng 38 per cent and Other Retail Products income growing 28 per cent. Credit Cards & Personal Loans income was up 5 per cent as balances grew on the back of a recovery in transaction volumes.\n\nTreasury income increased 10 per cent with higher interest income partly offset by a $224 mill/i.righton reduction in realisat/i.righton gains given movements in yield curves.\n\n## Profit before tax by client segment and geographic region\n\n|                                                      | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020   (Restated)\u00b2 $mill/i.righton   | Change  %   | Constant  currency   change\u00b9 %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking | 3,124                   | 1,994                                | 57          | 58                               |\n| Consumer Private & Business Banking                  | 1,071                   | 710                                  | 51          | 55                               |\n| Central & other items (segment)                      | (299)                   | (196)                                | (53)        | (22)                             |\n| Underlying profit before taxation                    | 3,896                   | 2,508                                | 55          | 61                               |\n| Asia                                                 | 3,116                   | 2,814                                | 11          | 11                               |\n| Africa & Middle East                                 | 856                     | 13                                   | nm\u00b3         | nm\u00b3                              |\n| Europe & Americas                                    | 644                     | 386                                  | 67          | 72                               |\n| Central & other items (region)                       | (720)                   | (705)                                | (2)         | 6                                |\n| Underlying profit before taxation                    | 3,896                   | 2,508                                | 55          | 61                               |",

This was partly offset by a 3 per cent increase in expenses.\n\nCentral & other items (segment) losses increased by approximately half to $299 mill/i.righton with a 21 per cent reduction in expenses more than offset by the $300 mill/i.righton impa/i.rightrment of the Group's investment in Bohai.\n\nAsia profits increased 11 per cent with a $1.1 bill/i.righton reduction in impa/i.rightrment partly offset by a $410 mill/i.righton negative movement in other impa/i.rightrment includ/i.rightng the impa/i.rightrment of the Group's investment in Bohai.\n\nAfrica & Middle East profits increased from $13 mill/i.righton to $856 mill/i.righton primar/i.rightly due to a $688 mill/i.righton reduction in impa/i.rightrment. Income was up 3 per cent and 5 per cent on a constant currency basis while expenses decreased 4 per cent.\n\nEurope & Americas profit was up 67 per cent, benefit/i.rightng from impa/i.rightrment releases and 4 per cent income growth partly offset by increased expenses.\n\nCentral & other items (region) recorded a loss of $720 mill/i.righton, with income down $281 mill/i.righton due to lower returns paid to Treasury on the equity provided to the regions in a lower interest rate environment broadly offset by a $231 mill/i.righton reduction in the UK bank levy and lower other impa/i.rightrment.\n\n## Adjusted net interest income and margin\n\n|                                                    | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | Change\u00b9 %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| Adjusted net interest income 2                     | 6,796                   | 6,921                   | (2)         |\n| Average interest-earning assets                    | 559,408                 | 526,370                 | 6           |\n| Average interest-bearing liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes | 515,769                 | 478,051                 | 8           |\n| Gross yield (%) 3                                  | 1.83                    | 2.34                    | (51)        |\n| Rate paid (%) 3                                    | 0.67                    | 1.12                    | (45)        |\n| Net yield (%) 3                                    | 1.16                    | 1.22                    | (6)         |\n| Net interest margin (%) 3,4                        | 1.21                    | 1.31                    | (10)        |\n\nAdjusted net interest income was down 2 per cent driven by an 8 per cent decline in net interest margin which fell 10 basis points year-on-year, reflecting the continued low interest rate environment following the cut in policy rates which occurred in early 2020. Excluding the $171 mill/i.righton benefit from IFRS9 income adjustments booked in the second and third quarter, the net interest margin in 2021 would have averaged 118 basis points. In the fourth quarter, the net interest margin averaged 119 basis points, an increase of 3 basis points in the quarter excluding the impact of the IFRS9 income adjustment booked in the third quarter. This reflects the impact of interest rate rises in certain markets and addit/i.rightonal interest income from structural hedging activ/i.rightties with/i.rightn Treasury Markets.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets increased 6 per cent driven by an increase in loans and advances to customers and higher investment securit/i.rightes balances. Gross yields declined 51 basis points compared to the average in 2020 predominantly reflecting the impact of continued compression of key interest rates. Excluding the impact of the IFRS9 income adjustment, gross yields declined 54 basis points.\n\nAverage interest-bearing liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes increased 8 per cent driven by growth in customer accounts. The rate paid on liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes decreased by 45 basis points year-on-year reflecting interest rate movements. This was partly offset by a shift of customer accounts from higher-paying time deposits to lower-rate current and savings accounts.",

In spite of the challenging condit/i.rightons that remain, the Group has seen improvement in a number of credit metrics with the stock of high-risk assets reducing over 6 consecutive quarters and a $2 bill/i.righton reduction in credit impa/i.rightrment year-on-year. The Group is well posit/i.rightoned to support our clients as economies recover but continues to remain vig/i.rightlant to the continued impact of COVID-19 and to sectors such as China commercial real estate that are under particular id/i.rightosyncratic pressures.\n\nCredit impa/i.rightrment totalled $263 mill/i.righton, a reduction of $2 bill/i.righton, representing a loan loss rate of 7 basis points demonstrating the resil/i.rightence of the overall portfolio.\n\nStage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment charge of $78 mill/i.righton is a decrease of $749 mill/i.righton, reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic variables incorporated into expected credit loss models, addit/i.rightonal collateral and guarantees received on a select number of clients and an improvement in underlying probabil/i.rightty of default metrics. The management overlay relating to stage 1 and 2 assets totals $323 mill/i.righton as at 31 December 2021 compared to $353 mill/i.righton as at 31 December 2020. There was a $125 mill/i.righton reduction in the COVID-19 element of the overlay, partly offset by a $95 mill/i.righton overlay booked in the fourth quarter in relation to the China commercial real estate sector.",

There was a $32 mill/i.righton charge relating to the catch-up of interest earned on histor/i.rightcally impa/i.rightred assets and a $15 mill/i.righton increase in the management overlay of stage 3 assets in CPBB, which now totals $21 mill/i.righton.\n\nGross stage 3 loans and advances to customers of $8.1 bill/i.righton were 12 per cent lower, primar/i.rightly due to repayments, client upgrades and write-offs more than offsetting new inflows. Credit-impa/i.rightred loans represented 2.7 per cent of gross loans and advances, a decrease of 53 basis points.\n\nThe stage 3 cover ratio of 58 per cent was stable, and the cover ratio post collateral at 75 per cent decreased by 1 percentage point. This reflects new inflows into stage 3 where the Group is confident that we have a low probabil/i.rightty of a sign/i.rightficant loss as it benefits from guarantees and insurance which are not included as tangible collateral.\n\nCredit grade 12 balances have decreased by 20 per cent, with client upgrades, downgrades into stage 3 and repayments partly offset by a sovereign ratings downgrade and new inflows.\n\nEarly Alert accounts of $5.5 bill/i.righton have nearly halved, reflecting the net impact of regularisat/i.rightons of accounts back into non-high-risk categories, net impact of downgrades into credit grade 12 and exposure reductions. In the fourth quarter, Early Alert accounts decreased by $1.9 bill/i.righton reflecting improved operating performance in the Aviat/i.righton sector. Early Alert accounts are now broadly in line with the level they were at before COVID-19. The Group is continu/i.rightng to monitor its exposures in the Aviat/i.righton, Metals & Min/i.rightng and Oil & Gas sectors particularly carefully, given the unusual stresses caused by the effects of COVID-19, as well as its exposure to Commercial Real Estate, which, with net loans and advances to customers of $19.8 bill/i.righton is just 7 per cent of the Group's total net loans and advances to customers. The rises in commodity prices have eased credit pressure for certain sectors.\n\nThe proportion of investment grade corporate exposures has increased by 7 percentage points to 69 per cent.\n\n## Restructuring, goodwill impa/i.rightrment and other items\n\n|                                                  | 2021                           | 2021                                         | 2021                         | 2020                           | 2020                                         | 2020                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n|                                                  | Restructuring  $mill/i.righton | Goodwill  impa/i.rightrment  $mill/i.righton | Other items  $mill/i.righton | Restructuring  $mill/i.righton | Goodwill  impa/i.rightrment  $mill/i.righton | Other items  $mill/i.righton |\n| Operating income                                 | (32)                           | -                                            | 20                           | 27                             | -                                            | (38)                         |\n| Operating expenses                               | (487)                          | -                                            | (62)                         | (252)                          | -                                            | 14                           |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment                         | 9                              | -                                            | -                            | (31)                           | -                                            | -                            |\n| Other impa/i.rightrment                          | (17)                           | -                                            | -                            | (113)                          | (489)                                        | -                            |\n| Profit from associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures | 20                             | -                                            | -                            | (13)                           | -                                            | -                            |\n| Loss before taxation                             | (507)                          | -                                            | (42)                         | (382)                          | (489)                                        | (24)                         |\n\nThe Group's statutory performance is adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent, other infrequent and/ or exceptional transactions that are sign/i.rightficant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period and items which management and investors would ordinar/i.rightly ident/i.rightfy separately when assessing underlying performance period-by period.

Excluding the reduction in Treasury Markets, loans and advances to customers grew an underlying 2 per cent in 4Q'21\n- \u00b7 Customer accounts of $475 bill/i.righton increased 8 per cent since 31 December 2020 with an increase in operating account balances with/i.rightn Cash Management and in Retail current and saving accounts partly offset by a reduction in Retail time deposits. Volumes increased $21 bill/i.righton in 4Q'21 primar/i.rightly from growth in operating account balances and corporate term deposits\n- \u00b7 Other assets increased 5 per cent since 31 December 2020 while other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes were 1 per cent higher. The growth in other assets was driven by increased reverse repurchase agreement volumes and an increase in investment securit/i.rightes held with/i.rightn Treasury Markets. The growth in other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes reflects increased repurchase agreements and issued debt securit/i.rightes offset by reduced derivat/i.rightve balances\n\nThe advances-to-deposits ratio decreased to 59.1 per cent from 61.1 per cent at 31 December 2020 reflecting the strong growth in customer accounts. The point-in-time liqu/i.rightdity coverage ratio has remained stable at 143 per cent and remains well above the min/i.rightmum regulatory requirement of 100 per cent.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\n|                  | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   | Change 1 $mill/i.righton   | Change 1 %   |\n|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| By risk type     |                         |                         |                            |              |\n| Credit risk      | 219,588                 | 220,441                 | (853)                      | -            |\n| Operational risk | 27,116                  | 26,800                  | 316                        | 1            |\n| Market risk      | 24,529                  | 21,593                  | 2,936                      | 14           |\n| Total RWAs       | 271,233                 | 268,834                 | 2,399                      | 1            |\n\n- 1 Variance is increase/(decrease) comparing current reporting period to prior reporting periods\n\nTotal risk-weighted assets (RWA) increased 1 per cent or $2.4 bill/i.righton since 31 December 2020 to $271.2 bill/i.righton.\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk RWA decreased $0.9 bill/i.righton to $219.6 bill/i.righton, with an increase of $10.2 bill/i.righton from underlying asset growth more than offset by the aggregate of $4.4 bill/i.righton from favourable FX movements, $3.7 bill/i.righton impact from model enhancements, $2.2 bill/i.righton from the partial unwind of negative credit migrat/i.righton and $1.1 bill/i.righton impact from other RWA effic/i.rightency actions\n- \u00b7 Market risk RWA increased by $2.9 bill/i.righton to $24.5 bill/i.righton primar/i.rightly due to the impact of updated PRA guidance with $3.7 bill/i.righton Structural FX risk now treated as Pillar 1 market risk RWA, partly offset by the benefit of consolidat/i.rightng market risk RWA following the receipt of a Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA) permiss/i.righton to consolidate market risk RWA for SCB Malaysia Berhad, SCB Thai PCL and SCB (Vietnam) Ltd\n- \u00b7 Operational risk RWA increased by $0.3 bill/i.righton mainly due to an increase in average income as measured over a rolling three-year time horizon, with higher 2020 income replacing lower 2017 income",

On a pro forma basis, after the cessation of software relief and other regulatory changes and adjustments detailed below, the CET1 ratio as at 1 January 2022 is 13.5 per cent.\n\nThe CET1 ratio of 14.1 per cent declined in the period as approximately 90 basis points of profit accretion was more than offset by distr/i.rightbutions, RWA growth, movements in reserves and an increase in regulatory deductions. An increase in underlying RWAs, excluding the impact of FX, reduced the CET1 ratio by approximately 40 basis points. This included a 20 basis points impact from higher market RWA following a clarif/i.rightcation of the regulatory treatment of Structural Foreign Exchange risk.\n\nOrdinary shareholder distr/i.rightbutions reduced the CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points. These distr/i.rightbutions included ordinary share buy-backs of $0.5 bill/i.righton completed in the period which reduced the share count by approximately 2.5 per cent during 2021 and a total 2021 ordinary div/i.rightdend of 12 cents a share or $370 mill/i.righton. The total 2021 div/i.rightdend comprised the inter/i.rightm div/i.rightdend of 3 cents per share and the Board recommended final div/i.rightdend of 9 cents per share. Payments due to AT1 and preference shareholders reduced the CET1 ratio by approximately 20 basis points. The net effect of other movements in the period reduced the CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points as higher regulatory deductions, adverse movements in other comprehensive income and reserves offset the reduction in RWA from currency translation effects.\n\nThere are three policy changes expected to impact the calculation of CET1 and/or RWAs in 2022. Firstly, the PRA has confirmed that software relief will be excluded from CET1 from 1 January 2022 which will reduce CET1 by 32 basis points. Secondly, the recent industry wide regulatory changes to align IRB model performance (the IRB model repair program) will add approximately $4.7 bill/i.righton of addit/i.rightonal RWA from 1 January 2022. Finally, the introduct/i.righton of standardised rules for counterparty credit risk on derivat/i.rightves and other instruments (SA-CCR) will add approximately $1.6 bill/i.righton of addit/i.rightonal RWA. The combinat/i.righton of the IRB model repair program and SA-CCR are expected to reduce the CET1 ratio by approximately 31 basis points from 1 January 2022.\n\nThe Board has authorised a share buy-back with a maximum considerat/i.righton of $750 mill/i.righton to start imm/i.rightnently to further reduce the number of ordinary shares in issue by cancelling the repurchased shares. The share buy-back is expected to reduce the CET1 ratio by approximately 30bps.\n\nThe Group's UK leverage ratio of 4.9 per cent, reduced by approximately 30 basis points due to an increase in onbalance sheet exposures but remains sign/i.rightficantly above its min/i.rightmum requirement of 3.7 per cent.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWe have had a solid start to 2022 and we expect income to/uni00A0grow in the 5-7 per cent range with mid-single dig/i.rightt asset growth and an increas/i.rightng likel/i.righthood of some support from interest rates, which should help support margins particularly in the later part of the year.\n\nExpenses are expected to grow $0.4 bill/i.righton includ/i.rightng the impact of inflat/i.righton to $10.7 bill/i.righton, excluding the impact of currency movements.\n\nWhilst we remain vig/i.rightlant to the continued uncertainty in the external environment, our loan portfolios are in good shape and, barring major negative events, we would expect impa/i.rightrments to slowly increase from the exceptionally low levels in 2021. Our medium-term cost of risk is now expected to normalise between 30-35 basis points, slightly lower than our previous medium-term guidance of 35-40 basis points.\n\nAlthough regulatory changes will lead to an increase in RWAs at the start of the year we fully intend to operate dynamically with/i.rightn the 13-14 per cent CET1 range.\n\nLooking beyond 2022, the actions we are undertaking and likely trajectory of interest rates puts us on the path to deliver a 10 per cent return on tangible equity by 2024. With the tailw/i.rightnd of a ris/i.rightng interest rate outlook, we believe we can deliver 8 to 10 per cent income growth per annum between 2022 and 2024, with 5-7 per cent from underlying business growth and a further 3 per cent from ris/i.rightng interest rates.\n\nWe are embarking on a $1.3 bill/i.righton gross structural expense reduction programme, funded by $0.5 bill/i.righton of restructuring charges, which will free up investment capacity and allow us to deliver 2 per cent posit/i.rightve income-to-cost jaws on average per annum before the benefit of ris/i.rightng interest rates.\n\nThe actions we are taking on RWA optim/i.rightsation means we expect RWAs to grow at a low single-dig/i.rightt percentage. We have reiterated our intent to operate with/i.rightn our 13-14% CET1 target range and aim to deliver in excess of $5 bill/i.righton of shareholder returns over the next three years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAndy Halford Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer 17 February 2022",

The COVID-19 recovery has continued to be uneven, with unbalanced vaccine roll-outs between developed markets and emerging markets, and easing of restrict/i.rightons in some markets even as other locations and sectors continued to lag. The potential impact from new variants has also contributed to further uncertainty. Multiple sectors of the global economy have been impacted by the pandemic, and liqu/i.rightdity pressures in the commercial real estate sector in China have arisen during the year, although the long-term impact remains to be seen. A rapid recovery in demand following the easing of restrict/i.rightons and exist/i.rightng supply chain disrupt/i.rightons has in turn contributed to elevated inflat/i.righton levels, with many markets seeing a sign/i.rightficant rise in prices. The accumulation of worldwide debt could also pose further risks to the economic environment.\n\nThe Group has built a strong foundation with solid risk fundamentals, and we are focussed on emerging strongly from the pandemic. We continue to scan the horizon for emerging risks and collaborate with internal and external partners to proactively mit/i.rightgate risks as they are ident/i.rightfied.\n\nAsset quality has improved, with improvements in a number of metrics includ/i.rightng a sign/i.rightficant year-on-year reduction in credit impa/i.rightrments across all stages and an increase in percentage of investment grade corporate exposures (2021: 69 per cent, 2020: 62 per cent), though we remain watchful in the face of ongoing uncertainty. We continue to demonstrate resil/i.rightence as evidenced by strong capital and liqu/i.rightdity metrics. As a result of the changes in internal and external operating environment due to the pandemic, non-financ/i.rightal risks areas such as Fraud, Information and Cyber Security, Privacy, and Conduct remain heightened. We continue to enhance our operational resil/i.rightence and defences against these risks, especially as we adapt to more agile ways of working. We are also working to ensure a successful transit/i.righton from the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) to alternative risk-free rates.\n\nDig/i.righttalisat/i.righton and technological development remain key items on the Group's agenda. We continue to ensure that our control frameworks and Risk Appetite evolve accordingly to keep pace with new business developments and asset classes.\n\nEarlier in the year, we defined three Stands to use our unique abil/i.rightty to work across boundaries and connect capital, people, ideas and best practices to help address some key socioeconomic challenges of our time. Accelerating Zero is one of the Stands, and our aim is to reduce the emiss/i.rightons associated with our financ/i.rightng activ/i.rightties to net zero by 2050, which includes inter/i.rightm 2030 targets for the most carbon-intens/i.rightve sectors. We are supporting our clients in the transit/i.righton to a low-carbon economy by developing transit/i.righton frameworks and sustainable financ/i.rightng solutions. We have integrated Environmental, Social and Governance risk management into our Reputational Risk Type Framework. Sustainab/i.rightlity is a core part of our strategy and our ambit/i.righton to become the world's most sustainable and responsible bank.\n\nTo support Lift/i.rightng Partic/i.rightpation, we are helping our clients by build/i.rightng partnerships to expand their access to financ/i.rightal services. For these new business in/i.righttiat/i.rightves, we have developed new risk management and risk assessment approaches across our Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types to address these unique risks. We further support our clients by promoting financ/i.rightal wellbeing through financ/i.rightal education and personalised services, includ/i.rightng dig/i.righttised solutions for lending and wealth management. We are also focused on driv/i.rightng customer awareness of environmental sustainab/i.rightlity concerns through green products. As part of our aim to Reset Globalisat/i.righton,",

Senior management across the Group promote a healthy risk culture by rewarding risk-based think/i.rightng (includ/i.rightng in remuneration decis/i.rightons), challenging the status quo, and creating a transparent and safe environment for employees to communicate risk concerns.\n\nWe strive to uphold the highest standards of conduct through delivery of conduct outcomes, acknowledging that while inc/i.rightdents cannot be entirely avoided, the Group has no appetite for wilful or negligent misconduct. More broadly, we are continu/i.rightng to focus on strengthening first-line Conduct Risk ownership, includ/i.rightng helping to draw enhanced Conduct Risk ins/i.rightghts through the development of better conduct analytics as part of the new Conduct Risk management approach.\n\nAs part of the Group's Future of Work Now in/i.righttiat/i.rightve, moving to large-scale working from home arrangements has been formalised and rolled out to the major/i.rightty of the Group's markets. Risks aris/i.rightng from the new working model have been assessed, with controls strengthened where appropriate. We remain vig/i.rightlant to the need to increase staff awareness of fraud and cyber security risks, alongside other targeted mit/i.rightgating actions to improve oversight and internal controls.\n\n## Enhancing informat/i.righton and cyber security (ICS) capabil/i.rightties:\n\nThe Group remains focused on pursuing a culture of cyber resil/i.rightence as we progress with more agile ways of working. We are focused on mainta/i.rightning client services and protecting our most crit/i.rightcal assets, remain/i.rightng vig/i.rightlant to evolving cyber threats. Our cyber security framework has been further enhanced to underpin our management and mit/i.rightgation of ICS Risk and support of our businesses and functions in their adoption of key controls. We plan to further enhance our key ICS risk metrics to support strategic oversight and decis/i.rightonmaking. Strengthening our oversight of third-party ICS Risk also remains an area of focus, consider/i.rightng external threats and the continued prevalence of third-party ICS inc/i.rightdents. We are ensuring we develop our internal talent pool and recruit external talent where required to support these crit/i.rightcal capabil/i.rightties.\n\nda\n\nEmbedding Climate Risk management: We have continued to embed Climate Risk management, starting with, among others, understanding the impact of physical and transit/i.righton risks on our credit portfolio and climate-related reputational risks for clients in high transit/i.righton sectors. In 2022, we will extend this to cover other relevant Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types. Climate scenario analysis across our markets, includ/i.rightng the Bank of England's 2021 Bienn/i.rightal Exploratory Scenario, have helped improve our understanding in ident/i.rightfying key portfolios vulnerable to Climate Risk. We reached out to around 2,000 of our clients globally, to understand their transit/i.righton and physical risk profiles, adaptation plans, mit/i.rightgation measures and approach to disclosure, enhancing the granularity of data available for risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and deepening client engagement. Climate Risk assessments are now considered as part of Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity transaction reviews for impacted clients in high-carbon sectors, and a first phase of integrat/i.righton into credit decis/i.rightoning for the transaction review process is under way for our Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking business. As our experience of quantify/i.rightng Climate Risk grows, we are moving from measurement to management, while working closely with external partners, industry and academia to move forward on climate risk together. As part of our ongoing partnership with Imperial College London, we supported new climate research on the potential for nature-based solutions (actions to protect, restore and enhance ecosystems) to tackle the interl/i.rightnkages between agriculture, land-use and climate change. Our 2021 Task Force on Climate-related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures Report provides further details on the Group's progress in managing climate risks and opportunit/i.rightes, includ/i.rightng the Group's net zero target by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore details can be found at sc.com/sustainab/i.rightlity and sc.com/tcfd\n\n## Managing our environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\nrisk: The Group remains committed to being the world's most sustainable and responsible bank. At the start of the year we expanded the Reputational Princ/i.rightpal Risk Type by adding Sustainab/i.rightlity and proposed new Risk Appetite metrics covering environmental and social (E&S) risks as well as ensuring no Modern Slavery risks in our supply chain.\n\nWe continue to invest in infrastructure and technology to keep pace with the emerging ESG regulatory obligat/i.rightons across our markets. We have developed an internal Environmental and Social Risk Catalogue that will be piloted to ensure that risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, assessment and enhanced due dil/i.rightgence, are underpinned by a standard classif/i.rightcation system. Using the Catalogue, an in/i.righttial heatmap of E&S risks has been developed for our clients and suppliers on an industry-portfolio level through a top-down risk assessment approach. The assessment is used to ident/i.rightfy key areas of prior/i.rightty for E&S risks where safeguards could be further strengthened. From 2022 onwards, we plan to incorporate the find/i.rightngs of this risk assessment in our regular review of our posit/i.righton statements and supply chain onboarding to ensure that our businesses and supply chains continue to support our sustainab/i.rightlity ambit/i.righton.\n\nManaging Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk: External developments continue to create new risks and control challenges, particularly with respect to rapidly changing geopolit/i.rightcal events. There is a heightened level of Fraud Risk in the environment due to new methods, schemes and technology, and we continue to increase our investment in fraud prevention and detection capabil/i.rightties to protect the Group",

Our Financ/i.rightal Crime Compliance team continues to ident/i.rightfy and prevent fraud and money laundering using next-generation surveillance and financ/i.rightal crime monitor/i.rightng infrastructure and machine learning. We are focused on strengthening our three lines of defence by transit/i.rightoning certain responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for financ/i.rightal crime surveillance from the second line to the first line while reinforc/i.rightng the oversight and monitor/i.rightng role of the second line.\n\nThe Group continues to partner to lead the fight against financ/i.rightal crime through informat/i.righton sharing about threats to protect clients and the wider financ/i.rightal system. We continue an active industry engagement to address new regulatory and statutory in/i.righttiat/i.rightves, focusing on enhancing the effectiveness of financ/i.rightal crime compliance and contribut/i.rightng useful informat/i.righton to law enforcement. We have made continued progress in resolving long-standing enforcement actions and related remediat/i.righton, and continue to work to strengthen compliance and improve customer experience in areas of greater implementat/i.righton challenge such as records management and transaction monitor/i.rightng.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore informat/i.righton about the Group's commitment to fight/i.rightng financ/i.rightal crime can be found at sc.com/fight/i.rightngfinanc/i.rightalcrime\n\nInnovation - Risk and CFCC infrastructure: We continue to focus on simpl/i.rightfying our approach to enable more effective first-line risk management, supported with SmartBot-enabled self-service platforms. Flexible strategic risk reporting with centralised data and advanced analytical capabil/i.rightties enabled a timely and an agile response to the challenges of COVID-19. Continued integrat/i.righton of our risk aggregation platform with front office data provides near real-time bespoke exposure analysis for financ/i.rightal risks, decis/i.rightoning and reporting, and our stress testing scenarios have been expanded to include the impact of the pandemic and Climate Risks. We are implement/i.rightng an Enterprise GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) platform to integrate data and processes across Operational Risk, polic/i.rightes and standards, compliance and assurance activ/i.rightties, and have made sign/i.rightficant progress in the year. We have clear prior/i.rightties to build a more dig/i.righttal and data-driven control function with scalable self-service solutions and partnerships with our internal innovat/i.righton centre, SC Ventures. Hubs continue to be util/i.rightsed for centralised special/i.rightst knowledge and delivery of data visual/i.rightsation, reporting, change management, model development, validat/i.righton and governance, with automation of supporting processes to reduce operational risks.\n\nEmbedding Model Risk management: Model Risk management has seen a notable step forward in 2021. We enhanced our risk management framework earlier in the year to strengthen model issue management and governance framework for artif/i.rightcial intell/i.rightgence and machine learning. The Group Model Inventory has undergone many enhancements through the year to be an industry-level model inventory tool, enabling increased coverage of informat/i.righton with a higher level of accuracy. Regulatory model delivery has been a key focus area related to new European Banking Authority standards and the cessation of IBOR. We are also progressing well on rolling out the Model Risk Type Framework across our countries, includ/i.rightng train/i.rightng, extension of risk type framework, inventory ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and generation of risk informat/i.righton reports. This will continue to be an area of focus to ensure we effectively embed awareness of Model Risk management at a firm-wide level.\n\n## Our risk profile and performance in 2021\n\nDespite the challenges of the ongoing pandemic, our solid foundation has helped us to deliver a good performance with a resil/i.rightent risk profile and improved asset quality. 2021 demonstrates our commitment to strong and sustainable growth, with continued improvements across several metrics reflecting our robust risk management during the pandemic.\n\nWe remain vig/i.rightlant to the continued impact of COVID-19 and an uneven recovery across markets and industr/i.rightes.\n\nIn 2021, we have seen a 49 per cent decrease in early alerts exposure (2021: $5.5 bill/i.righton, 2020: $10.7 bill/i.righton), mainly due to reductions in counterparty exposure and clients being removed from early alert. While early alerts have decreased compared with December 2020, the Group remains vig/i.rightlant in view of persistent challenging condit/i.rightons in some markets and sectors. Credit Grade 12 balances decreased to $1.7 bill/i.righton (2020: $2.2 bill/i.righton) mainly due to repayments and outflows to non-performing loans, that were partly offset by sovereign rating downgrades.\n\nThe percentage of investment-grade corporate exposure has also increased to 69 per cent compared with 62 per cent a year ago, reflecting an increase in repurchase agreement balances and high-quality orig/i.rightnations.\n\nThe total credit impa/i.rightrment charge sign/i.rightficantly reduced to $0.3 bill/i.righton (2020: $2.3 bill/i.righton), with decreases seen across all stages. Stage 3 impa/i.rightrment charge was $185 mill/i.righton (2020: $1.5 bill/i.righton), major/i.rightty of which was from Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment charge decreased by $749 mill/i.righton to $78 mill/i.righton, over half of which is due to reduction in Stage 2 exposures from lower levels of early alerts, new guarantees and improvement in probabil/i.rightty of default, with the remainder due to improv/i.rightng macroeconomic forecasts and reduction in COVID-19 management overlays.\n\nOverall stage 3 gross loans and advances to customers decreased from $9.2 bill/i.righton to $8.1 bill/i.righton, while stage 3 provis/i.rightons were lower by $0.7 bill/i.righton at $4.7 bill/i.righton (2020: $5.3 bill/i.righton). The stage 3 cover ratio (excluding collateral) in the total customer loan book was stable at 58 per cent (2020: 58 per cent).\n\nAverage Group Value at Risk (VaR) in 2021 was 44 per cent lower at $54.8 mill/i.righton (2020: $97.6 mill/i.righton), driven by the extreme market movements from 2020 dropping out of the one-year VaR time horizon. However, volatil/i.rightty started to increase in the second half of 2021 driven by the impact of new COVID variants. There were three regulatory VaR backtesting negative exceptions in 2021.\n\nThe results of the Bank of England's annual solvency stress test exercise in 2021 shows that the Group is resil/i.rightent under the Bank of England scenario. We have a diverse and liqu/i.rightd balance sheet and these results demonstrate our continued capital strength and resil/i.rightence to stress, supported by a focus on sustainable returns and actions to improve our portfolio quality.\n\nWe have re-assessed the methodology for calculating the Group liqu/i.rightdity coverage ratio (LCR) in 2021, to better reflect the portabil/i.rightty of liqu/i.rightdity across the group while still consider/i.rightng currency convertib/i.rightlity and regulatory intra-Group lim/i.rightts. The Group LCR remained stable at 143 per cent (2020: 143 per cent).\n\nOur Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is 14.1 per cent (2020: 14.4 per cent). Further details, includ/i.rightng explanation of pro forma changes as at 1 January 2022, can be found in the Capital Review section on Page 288.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of the Group's risk performance are set out in the Risk update (pages 196 to 198) and Risk profile (pages 199 to 257)",

        "page_content": "## An update on our risk management approach\n\nOur Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) outlines how we manage risk across the Group, as well as at branch and subsid/i.rightary level 1 . It gives us the structure to manage exist/i.rightng risks effectively in line with our Risk Appetite, as well as allowing for holist/i.rightc risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton. As part of the annual review of the ERMF, we have reposit/i.rightoned our Cross-Cutting Risks to Integrated Risk Types (IRT), which are defined as 'risks that are sign/i.rightficant in nature and material/i.rightse primar/i.rightly through the relevant Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types'. The ERMF sets out the roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes and min/i.rightmum governance requirements for the management of IRTs. Addit/i.rightonally, the Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Princ/i.rightpal Risk Type has been renamed to Treasury Risk and the scope of the risk type has been expanded to cover Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB).\n\nGiven their integrated nature, Dig/i.righttal Asset and Third-Party Risks, have been newly ident/i.rightfied as IRTs in the ERMF, in addit/i.righton to Climate Risk.\n\n## Princ/i.rightpal and Integrated Risk Types\n\nPrinc/i.rightpal risks are risks inherent in our strategy and business model. These are formally defined in our ERMF which provides a structure for monitor/i.rightng and controlling these risks through the Board-approved Risk Appetite. We will not compromise adherence to our Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue growth or higher returns. The table below provides an overview of the Group's princ/i.rightpal and integrated risks and how these are managed.

As part of our continuous risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton process, we have updated the Group's emerging risks from those disclosed in the 2020 Annual Report and 2021 Half Year Report. A detailed explanation of the changes to our emerging risks compared with 2020 can be found on page 280.\n\nThe table below summarises our current list of emerging risks, outlin/i.rightng the risk trend changes since the end of 2020, the reasons for any changes and the mit/i.rightgating actions we are taking based on our current knowledge and assumptions. This reflects the latest internal assessment as ident/i.rightfied by senior management. The list is not exhaustive and there may be addit/i.rightonal risks which could have an adverse effect on the Group. Our mit/i.rightgation approach for these risks may not elim/i.rightnate them but shows the Group's attempt to reduce or manage the risk. As certain risks develop and material/i.rightse over time, management will take appropriate steps to mit/i.rightgate the risk based on its impact on the Group.\n\nRisk trend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Emerging risks                                    | since 2020   | Key risk trend drivers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | How these are mit/i.rightgated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Expanding array of  global tensions               |              | Relations between China and the  West remain fragile and tensions are  increas/i.rightng regarding Russia's presence  on the Ukrain/i.rightan border.

In 2021, we used regular surveys, experience forums and dig/i.righttal channels to continue to strengthen our abil/i.rightty to understand and meet client needs as they emerge.\n\nIn CCIB, we strengthened our annual feedback process by capturing how clients feel about what we offer them (such as advice, service, dig/i.righttal channels) and ensuring our relationsh/i.rightp managers can then engage with their clients to address their feedback. We also launched a 'Voice of Client' e-learning module to train our colleagues to obtain and leverage client ins/i.rightghts and respond with enhanced, innovat/i.rightve proposit/i.rightons.\n\nIn CPBB, we take seriously our responsib/i.rightlity to support our more vulnerable clients. A global framework is in place to help ensure the fair treatment of vulnerable customers in product development and throughout the whole customer journey. Train/i.rightng is provided to frontline staff across our branch, contact centre and dig/i.righttal channels to ident/i.rightfy and appropriately handle vulnerable clients, and we have also implemented an educational train/i.rightng programme for those clients who require assistance in navigat/i.rightng online and mobile/uni00A0channels.\n\nIn order to act in the best interests of our clients, we use our client ins/i.rightghts, alongside our robust polic/i.rightes, procedures and the Group's Risk Appetite, to design and offer products and services which meet client needs, regulatory requirements and Group performance targets while contribut/i.rightng to a sustainable and resil/i.rightent environment.\n\nFor example, through understanding the challenges some of/uni00A0our clients face in balancing their financ/i.rightal management needs with their growing commitments to sustainab/i.rightlity, in 2021 we launched a market-first sustainable trade finance proposit/i.righton to support sustainable supply chains for our clients. We also launched our Sustainable Account in the UK/uni00A0and UAE, a new solution that enables corporate clients to/uni00A0contribute to sustainable development, while mainta/i.rightning daily access to their cash.\n\nAll new products are subject to a comprehensive approvals process to test design effectiveness and robustness of the implementat/i.righton process. For investment products sold to ind/i.rightviduals, this includes risk scores which aid our assessment of client suitab/i.rightlity.\n\nFor ind/i.rightvidual clients, we consider each client's financ/i.rightal needs and personal circumstances to assist us in offering suitable product recommendations.\n\nWe achieve this using a globally consistent methodology that takes into considerat/i.righton local regulatory requirements to review product risks against the client's risk appetite, consider/i.rightng financ/i.rightal object/i.rightves, financ/i.rightal abil/i.rightty, and knowledge. Clients are also provided with clear and simple documentation that outlines key product features and risks prior to executing a transaction.\n\nFees and charges are disclosed to clients in line with regulatory requirements and industry best practice, and where available, benchmarked against competitors. For/uni00A0Personal and Business Banking products, accurate interest/uni00A0rates charged, fees and other charges as billed to/uni00A0clients are monitored and assessed locally, with global oversight. Triggers for outlier prices are defined and subject to/uni00A0annual review. A/uni00A0process is in place to review complaints prior to amendments to annual interest, fees and charges.",

We believe that our integrated approach to ESG issues, as well as a strong risk and compliance culture, is a key different/i.rightator. We delivered a resil/i.rightent financ/i.rightal performance in 2021, reaffirmed our business strategy and have now set out clear actions to accelerate the delivery of our ambit/i.righton of double-dig/i.rightt return on tangible equity.\n\nRegular and transparent engagement with our investors, and the wider market, helps us understand investors' needs and tailor our public informat/i.righton accordingly. In addit/i.righton to direct engagement from our Investor Relations team, we communicate through quarterly, half and full-year results, conferences, roadshows, investor days and media releases. There was continued adoption of virtual mediums during the year due to the pandemic, albeit we hosted the Innovation and Dig/i.righttisat/i.righton event in a hybrid format in our office in Basinghall Avenue, London in October 2021.\n\nInvestor feedback, recommendations and requests are considered by the Board, whose members keep abreast of current topics of interest. Standard Chartered PLC's Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May 2021 was open to shareholders through electronic attendance, where they were able to view a live video feed of the meeting, submit voting instruct/i.rightons and ask direct questions to the Board.

The impact of different methods of returning\n\ncapital to investors was a key considerat/i.righton for the Board, and it recognised that a balance between div/i.rightdend resumption and recommencing a buy-back programme provided good flexib/i.rightlity and sustainable returns.\n\nThe Board continued its careful considerat/i.righton of stakeholder interests during 2021, by approving an inter/i.rightm div/i.rightdend of $0.03 per ordinary share and a further share buy-back programme up to a maximum considerat/i.righton of $250 mill/i.righton, reinforc/i.rightng the sign/i.rightficance of balancing a cautious approach to capital management in light of the continued impact of the pandemic against returns to our shareholders.\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Strong capital base and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton\n- \u00b7 Robust standards for conduct and financ/i.rightal crime\n- \u00b7 Healthy economies and competit/i.rightve markets\n- \u00b7 Posit/i.rightve sustainable development\n- \u00b7 Dig/i.righttal innovat/i.righton in financ/i.rightal services",

Our suppliers must recommit to the charter annually, and performance monitor/i.rightng is built into our contracts, procurement practices and standards.\n\nIn 2021, we made tangible progress against our supply chain sustainab/i.rightlity agenda and began to integrate environmental and social risks into our Third-Party Risk management framework.\n\nIn pursuit of our ambit/i.righton to be net zero in our operations by 2025, we offset emiss/i.rightons from our business flights, and in 2021 we developed a methodology to estimate our Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons from suppliers. Using this, we engaged our 200 highest-emitt/i.rightng vendors - who together represent threequarters of our estimated 2020 emiss/i.rightons - to review their environmental goals and emiss/i.rightons disclosure practices as a pathway for transparent future supply chain emiss/i.rightons measurement. We also began to embed emiss/i.rightons-related clauses into relevant supplier contracts, such as print/i.rightng services, to reduce our consumption and mit/i.rightgate residual emiss/i.rightons.\n\nOur Stands have served to further embed our supplier D&I approach. Seventy per cent of our markets now have supplier D&I object/i.rightves to take action, and accelerate progress and impact, and supplier divers/i.rightty targets have been defined in key global procurement categories. More than 1,500 employees have been trained internally to build capabil/i.rightty\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Safe, strong and sustainable financ/i.rightal performance\n- \u00b7 Facil/i.righttation of sustainable finance to meet the UN SDGs\n- \u00b7 Progress on ESG matters, includ/i.rightng advancing the net zero agenda\n\nto deliver our supplier D&I aims. In addit/i.righton, we established partnerships with multiple local and global non-governmental organisat/i.rightons (NGOs) to ident/i.rightfy and onboard more sustainable and diverse-owned vendors across all our markets. Our efforts were rewarded with internal and external recognit/i.righton, includ/i.rightng the Supplier Divers/i.rightty Programme of the Year in the European Divers/i.rightty Awards.\n\nDuring 2021, we also partnered with several suppliers to provide addit/i.rightonal benefits to our organisat/i.righton and clients. For example, we partnered with Doconomy, an innovat/i.rightve fintech supplier, to pilot a facil/i.rightty in Pakistan which helps ind/i.rightvidual clients track, measure and manage their impact on both carbon emiss/i.rightons and freshwater consumption. The tool provides enriched customer data and automatically calculates the CO2 footprint based on the purchases they have made, as ident/i.rightfied through their credit transactions. With further global release planned for 2022, the Standard Chartered-Doconomy collaboration has the potential to allow mill/i.rightons of consumers over time to learn how their consumption behaviours impact the climate.\n\nIn 2022, supply chain sustainab/i.rightlity will continue to be a primary focus as we roll out in/i.righttiat/i.rightves to address and control social risk, and further reduce carbon emiss/i.rightons with/i.rightn our own operations and supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Supplier Charter can be viewed at sc.com/suppliercharter\n\nRead more about our supplier divers/i.rightty standard: sc.com/supplierd/i.rightversity\n\n## Their interests\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainab/i.rightlity and divers/i.rightty\n- \u00b7 Open, transparent and consistent tendering process\n- \u00b7 Will/i.rightngness to adopt supplier-driven innovat/i.rightons\n- \u00b7 Accurate and on-time payments",

To lead the way in addressing the evolving needs of our clients and the advances in technology, we are developing a workforce that is future-ready and are co-creating with our employees a/uni00A0culture that is inclus/i.rightve and innovat/i.rightve.\n\n## How we serve and engage\n\nBy engaging employees and fostering a posit/i.rightve experience for them, we can better serve our clients and deliver on our Purpose and Stands. An inclus/i.rightve culture enables us to unlock innovat/i.righton, make better decis/i.rightons, deliver our business strategy, live our valued behaviours and embody our brand promise: Here for good. We proactively assess and manage people-related risks, for example, organisat/i.righton, capabil/i.rightty and culture, as part of our Group risk management framework. Our/uni00A0People Strategy, which was approved by the Board in July 2019, continues to stay relevant and future-focused, with the ongoing pandemic having accelerated many of the future of/uni00A0work trends which informed our approach.\n\n## Their interests\n\nIn 2018, we conducted research to understand our Employee Value Proposit/i.righton (EVP) - the value that employees, or potential employees, feel they gain from being part of our organisat/i.righton. Our employees told us they want to: have interest/i.rightng and impactful jobs; innovate with/i.rightn a unique set of markets and clients; cultivate a brand that sustainably drives commerce and offers enrich/i.rightng careers and development; and be supported by great people leaders. They want these elements to be anchored in competit/i.rightve rewards and a posit/i.rightve work-life balance. The EVP is a key input to our People Strategy which supports the delivery of our business strategy.\n\n## Listen/i.rightng to employees\n\nFrequent feedback from employee surveys helps us ident/i.rightfy and close gaps between colleagues' expectations and their experience. In addit/i.righton to our annual survey, in 2021 we have started deploying continuous listen/i.rightng mechanisms that capture colleague sentiment more frequently, such as a continuous listen/i.rightng survey and surveys at moments-thatmatter such as at onboarding and at exit.\n\nThis year our annual My Voice survey was conducted in June and July. 92 per cent of our employees (71,798) took part, which is higher than last year. A further 65 per cent of elig/i.rightble agency workers (2,568) also partic/i.rightpated.\n\nOur key measures of employee satisfact/i.righton ind/i.rightcate that we have continued to improve as a place to work over the duration of deliver/i.rightng on our People Strategy. While key measures of employee satisfact/i.righton fell in 2021, includ/i.rightng the employee engagement index and the employee net promoter score (NPS) (which measures how likely employees are to recommend working for the us), overall employee satisfact/i.righton remained on par with or higher than it was in 2019. Employee engagement had sign/i.rightficantly improved in 2020 as people had rallied to address the challenges created by the pandemic, but the prolonged nature of the cris/i.rights has seen many of these posit/i.rightve emotions balance out again.\n\nWe remain encouraged that 96 per cent of employees feel committed to doing what is required to help the Bank succeed, 89 per cent feel proud about working for the Bank and 83 per cent say that the Bank meets or exceeds their expectations. Externally, our Glassdoor rating (out of five) has continued to increase from 3.7 in 2019 to 3.9 in 2021, and 78 per cent would recommend working at the Bank to friends. Our revamped Global Careers website has had over 4 mill/i.righton unique views.\n\nInvestments in people leader capabil/i.rightty and the way in which our people leaders have responded to the pandemic has also translated into a 2 point increase in our manager NPS score in the 2021 My Voice survey, sustain/i.rightng a trend of ongoing improvement. Build/i.rightng leadership capabil/i.rightty continues to be important as the demands on our people leaders increase.\n\n## Group KPI:\n\nEmployee engagement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee net promoter score (eNPS) -3.9%\n\n|   2021 | 12.94   |          |\n|--------|---------|----------|\n|   2020 |         | 1 7. 5 1 |\n|   2019 | 11.51   |          |\n\neNPS measures the number of promoters (who would recommend the Group as a great place to/uni00A0work) compared with detractors on a scale from -100 to +100. This is reflected in the percentage change calculation.\n\nAim: Increase engagement across the Group by creating a better working environment for our employees that should translate into an improved client experience.\n\nAnalysis: While our eNPS has decreased since 2020, it stays higher than in 2019, and has sign/i.rightficantly increased since 2016 (2.44 in 2016) when we started our culture transformation.",

The model is live in 28 of our markets with 73 per cent of employees in these markets on agreed flexi-working arrangements. This is a sign/i.rightficant step towards being more inclus/i.rightve of the diverse needs of our workforce and supporting their wellbeing by consciously balancing ind/i.rightvidual choice and flexib/i.rightlity with business and client needs. While we continue to roll out the model in other markets, enforced absence from offices during the pandemic has also highl/i.rightghted the benefit of face-to-face interact/i.righton and we continue to value our physical workspaces as hubs of teamwork, collaboration and learning. Toolkits and guidance have been provided to colleagues and leaders to help navigate hybrid ways of working, especially at key moments such as onboarding new team members, returning from parental leave and during performance conversations, as well/uni00A0as to help recreate 'water cooler' moments in hybrid work environments.\n\nAs employees operated in a variety of these hybrid working formats through 2021 - either as part of our flexi-working programmes or due to ongoing pandemic restrict/i.rightons supporting their wellbeing, health, safety and resil/i.rightence continued to be a key prior/i.rightty. In some markets that were acutely impacted by the pandemic during 2021, such as India, the Phil/i.rightppines, Sri Lanka, Niger/i.righta and Zimbabwe, we provided addit/i.rightonal financ/i.rightal assistance to employees, includ/i.rightng access to increased credit facil/i.rightties and extended medical coverage, in some cases also for extended famil/i.rightes. Teams partnered across our markets to organise emergency medical support for colleagues and their extended famil/i.rightes, and at locations where permiss/i.rightble, in partnership with government in/i.righttiat/i.rightves we organised camps to accelerate vaccinat/i.righton.\n\n## Taking care of our leadership health\n\nThrough an experiment launched in 2021, we have supported over 4,600 employees in flexing their leadership muscles, by provid/i.rightng them with regular, simple and practical 'miss/i.rightons' on themes centred around enabling performance, empowering people, driv/i.rightng vis/i.righton and continu/i.rightng self-growth. The 60-day leadership treatment journey is driv/i.rightng a habit of micro-learning and democratis/i.rightng leadership as a capabil/i.rightty for everyone.\n\nFurther, with our aim to provide employees the skills, tools and motivat/i.righton to manage their wellbeing proactively and to deal with challenges effectively, we continue to drive awareness of our wellbeing resources that are available to all globally. These include a mental health app, a physical wellbeing online platform, an upgraded employee assistance programme, wellbeing toolkits, learning programmes on mental health and resil/i.rightence as well as an expanded network of trained Mental Health First Aiders. In parallel, we are seeking to mit/i.rightgate the causes of work-related stress and encourage a focus on supportive behaviours with/i.rightn exist/i.rightng processes and all decis/i.righton-making. These resources and actions are having a posit/i.rightve impact, with fewer employees reporting frequent stress in the annual My Voice survey and 74 per cent of employees saying that they are will/i.rightng to share their concerns about stress with their people leader.\n\nIn addit/i.righton to leveraging inputs from employee surveys, the/uni00A0Board also engages with and listens to the views of colleagues through virtual, interact/i.rightve engagement sessions.

Our employees need a combinat/i.righton of human and technical skills to succeed both today and in the future. We're build/i.rightng a culture of continuous learning, empowering employees to grow, follow their aspirat/i.rightons and embrace the skills needed for the future. Since 2020, the average hours invested by employees in personal development has increased by 20 per cent to 27.7 hours in 2021. Over 74,000 colleagues actively used our online learning platform diSCover, which we launched in 2020, and which is now accessible via a mobile app as well. Almost 30,000 colleagues used one or more of our Future Skills Academies which include the Data & Analytics, Dig/i.righttal, Cyber, Client Advisory, Sustainable Finance and Leadership Academy.\n\nWe have focused over 2021 on design/i.rightng and deploying targeted upskill/i.rightng and re-skill/i.rightng pilot programmes directed towards crit/i.rightcal 'future' roles where our strategic workforce planning analysis has predicted the increas/i.rightng need for talent, includ/i.rightng universal banker, data translator, cloud security engineer and cyber security analyst./uni00A0This approach has united our recruitment, talent management and learning efforts to target, upskill and deploy employees into new roles.",

As the pandemic extended into 2021, the need to lead inclus/i.rightvely in a hybrid working set-up continued to be a key expectation of our people leaders. With the focus on build/i.rightng a culture of inclus/i.righton, over 21,000 colleagues had undertaken the 'When we're all included' learning programme by the end of 2021, centred on increas/i.rightng awareness around divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton princ/i.rightples, tackling issues such as unconscious bias and micro behaviours as well as emphasis/i.rightng the importance of creating an inclus/i.rightve environment. As we listened to employee feedback and responded to the need to better develop psychological safety, we also released an inclus/i.rightve language guide and continue to review business terms to be more inclus/i.rightve moving forward. In our annual My Voice survey, 80.65 per cent of employees reported posit/i.rightve sentiments around our culture of inclus/i.righton.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read our inclus/i.rightve language guide at sc.com/inclus/i.rightvelanguageguide\n\nOur commitment to divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton (D&I) is now supported by more than 60/uni00A0employee resource groups (ERGs) across our markets that/uni00A0help provide learning, development and networking opportunit/i.rightes. The ERGs align to our focus areas of gender, ethnic/i.rightty and national/i.rightty, generations, sexual orientat/i.righton, disab/i.rightlity and/uni00A0wellbeing.\n\nOur gender divers/i.rightty continues to grow with more women leaders moving up to more senior roles. By the numbers, women currently represent 31 per cent of the Board, 14 of our markets have women CEOs, and representation of women in senior leadership roles increased to 30.7 per cent at the end of 2021. We are committed to continuous improvement in this area and aspire to 35 per cent representation of women at the senior level by 2025. This aspirat/i.righton is further supported by programmes such as our IGNITE Coaching programme, which develops our exist/i.rightng female talent in preparation for future roles.\n\n## Creating an internal 'gig' economy\n\nOur virtual talent marketplace uses artif/i.rightcial intell/i.rightgence (AI) to match the skills, experiences and aspirat/i.rightons of employees across 50 markets to short-term projects and mentoring opportunit/i.rightes, enabling their upskill/i.rightng and reskill/i.rightng towards becoming future-ready. The platform also allows us to rapidly deploy talent to areas where it is most needed to deliver business prior/i.rightties, unlocking productiv/i.rightty worth over $1.3 mill/i.righton so far. By the end of 2021, more than 10,000 employees had accessed over 600 cross-functional experiences via the platform, and in/i.righttiated over 300 mentoring relationsh/i.rightps.\n\nWe remain focused on build/i.rightng a workforce that is truly representative of our client base and footprint, with 16.4 per cent of our Global Management Team and their direct reports ident/i.rightfying as Black, Asian or minor/i.rightty ethnic. In the UK, Black representation in senior leadership is 2.4 per cent and Black, Asian and minor/i.rightty ethnic in senior leadership is 15.2 per cent. In/uni00A0the US, Black/African American representation in senior leadership is 2.7 per cent and Hispan/i.rightc/Latinx in senior leadership is 9.7 per cent. We have developed strategic partnerships in the US and extended our Futuremakers RISE programme to increase the divers/i.rightty of our talent pipel/i.rightnes. As we work towards achiev/i.rightng our 2025 UK and US ethnic/i.rightty senior leadership aspirat/i.rightons which were defined last year, we continue focus on nurturing local talent in markets across Asia, Africa and the Middle East to ensure we reflect the divers/i.rightty of our global clients. In 2021, we provided employees, where legally permiss/i.rightble, the abil/i.rightty to self-ident/i.rightfy ethnic/i.rightty data through our online systems and started educating on the value and purpose of collecting this informat/i.righton. We expect increased partic/i.rightpation and self-declaration of ethnic/i.rightty to allow us addit/i.rightonal ins/i.rightghts towards build/i.rightng an even more representative workforce.\n\nWe recognise six key 1 D&I dates across the year and use these as focal points to facil/i.righttate open dialogue on inclus/i.righton internally and externally. Through these global campaigns we have engaged and strengthened relationsh/i.rightps with clients and external stakeholders, collectively rais/i.rightng awareness, promoting best practices and committ/i.rightng to take practical steps to advance the D&I agenda in the community.\n\nOur progress continues to be recognised externally - we are the first financ/i.rightal services organisat/i.righton to achieve the second highest level of EDGE Strategy Certif/i.rightcation in Malaysia and Sri Lanka; we've ranked as a Divers/i.rightty Leader for the second consecutive year in the Financ/i.rightal Times report on Divers/i.rightty and Inclusion in Europe; ranked for the first time with/i.rightn the Top 100 organisat/i.rightons Refin/i.righttiv (formerly Thomson Reuters) Divers/i.rightty and Inclusion Index; ranked as one of the World's Best Employers in Forbes for the first time; and also recognised at the European Divers/i.rightty Awards for our Supplier Divers/i.rightty Programme. In addit/i.righton to the Group being recognised, six of our colleagues feature on the HERoes Women Role Models List, three on the Empower Ethnic Minor/i.rightty Role Models List and two on the OUTstanding LGBTQ+ Role Models Lists.\n\nAs the Bank continues to transform to achieve our strategic ambit/i.rightons, we are refreshing the way we manage and recognise performance. Moving forward, we aim to build an even stronger culture of high performance by focusing on continuous feedback, coaching, and open two-way performance and development conversations. We will place greater emphasis on recognis/i.rightng outperformance driven by collaboration and innovat/i.righton, encourage more flexib/i.rightlity and aspirat/i.righton during goal-setting, and remove ind/i.rightvidual performance ratings. During 2021, we piloted aspects of this refreshed approach with a select first adopter population of employees, and will be further embedding the approach across the organisat/i.righton in 2022.",

The gender pay gap compares the average pay of men and women without accounting for some of the key factors which influence pay, includ/i.rightng different roles, skills, senior/i.rightty and market pay rates.\n\nCompared with last year, our mean hourly pay gaps have remained flat or reduced across the UK, Singapore and US. Our mean bonus pay gaps have increased slightly except for in Singapore. Our gender pay gaps are caused by there being fewer women in senior roles and in business areas where market rates of pay are the highest. We understand it will take time to see the level of change needed to sign/i.rightficantly reduce our gender pay gaps and we remain committed to our in/i.righttiat/i.rightves to support gender divers/i.rightty.\n\nEqual pay is a more detailed measure of pay equality and is a key commitment in our Fair Pay Charter. We analyse equal pay during our annual performance and pay review process to ensure equal pay for equal work.\n\nWe have been reporting our gender pay gaps for several years and support in/i.righttiat/i.rightves that will enable a truly diverse workforce. We responded to the UK Government consultation on ethnic/i.rightty pay gap reporting and are consider/i.rightng potential ways to draw from available data to inform our inclus/i.righton strategy. Obtain/i.rightng sign/i.rightficant enough disclosure of ethnic/i.rightty data remains a challenge and we are taking steps to encourage disclosure, where possible, so we can develop our approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about this in our gender pay gap report at sc.com/genderpaygap\n\nWhen the pay of men and women at the same level and in the same business area are compared, our gender pay gaps remain sign/i.rightficantly smaller. The remain/i.rightng gaps exist due to differences in the market pay level for different types of roles at the same level and in the same business areas, and differences in the relative posit/i.rightoning of the pay of each role holder around the market benchmark.\n\n| 2021 Gender pay gap   | UK   | Hong Kong   | Singapore   | UAE   | US   |\n|-----------------------|------|-------------|-------------|-------|------|\n| Mean hourly pay gap   | 27%  | 21%         | 33%         | 31%   | 23%  |\n| Mean bonus pay gap    | 52%  | 42%         | 44%         | 58%   | 46%  |",

Yet these regions only receive a fraction of the capital flows they need for sustainable economic growth.\n\nAt Standard Chartered, we have the financ/i.rightal expertise, governance frameworks, technology and geographical reach to unlock capital for sustainable development, where it matters most.\n\nWe have set ourselves the vis/i.righton to become the world's most sustainable and responsible bank, committed to sustainable social and economic development through our business, operations and communit/i.rightes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn pursuit of this, and in alignment with stakeholder prior/i.rightties, in 2021 we formally elevated sustainab/i.rightlity to be a pillar of our/uni00A0strategy.\n\nWe have set long-term ambit/i.rightons for our role in tackling the severe impacts of climate change, stark inequal/i.rightty and unfair/uni00A0aspects of globalisat/i.righton that impact everyone and the planet. See pages 24-25 for more detail on how we are taking a stand.\n\nThis enhanced focus ensures sustainab/i.rightlity is embedded across our business and integrated into the Group's decis/i.rightonmaking, with robust governance provided by the Board, Management Team and multiple supporting sub-committees.\n\nThe following pages set out our approach and progress towards our most material sustainable and responsible business topics. Further informat/i.righton on our approach to climate change can also be read in our TCFD report at sc.com/tcfd .\n\nIn 2022, we also intend to provide addit/i.rightonal ESG-related informat/i.righton via our ESG report. This will include alignment index tables for disclosures relevant to the GRI, SASB and World Economic Forum frameworks, and will be available at sc.com/ESGreport in Q1 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 51 to 59 to read how engagement with stakeholders informs our approach to sustainable and responsible business\n\nFor more informat/i.righton on our sustainab/i.rightlity governance see pages 276-277 and sc.com/tcfd\n\n## Group KPI:\n\nSustainab/i.rightlity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Deliver/i.rightng Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons %\n\n+ 4.5 ppt Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons achieved or on track 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2021 | 82.9   |      |\n|--------|--------|------|\n|   2020 | 78.4   |      |\n|   2019 |        | 93.1 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 455 and 466 for a full list of our 2022 Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons\n\nFor more informat/i.righton on our Responsible Business Standards and Polic/i.rightes see sc.com/standardsandpolic/i.rightes\n\n## Our Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons\n\nOur approach is underpinned by our suite of Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons that set out how we aim to promote social and economic development, and deliver sustainable outcomes in/uni00A0the areas in which we can make the most material contribut/i.righton to the delivery of the UN SDGs.\n\nWe review and refresh our Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons annually to ensure they reflect our stakeholders' prior/i.rightties and evolving strategy. For example, in 2021, we committed to consult with shareholders, investors, clients and civ/i.rightl society to develop a defin/i.righttion, methodology, targets and timel/i.rightne to develop our approach to measuring, managing and reducing emiss/i.rightons associated with our financ/i.rightng of clients to support our object/i.rightve to achieve net zero by 2050.\n\nWe measure progress against the targets set out in our Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons and incorporate selected Aspirat/i.rightons into the Group Scorecard to drive widespread awareness and support delivery.\n\nAt the end of 2021, 82.9 per cent of our Aspirat/i.rightons are on track or achieved. This is an increase from 78.4 per cent in 2020; however, COVID-19 continued to impact the delivery of several Aspirat/i.rightons. Further detail on each Aspirat/i.righton can be found between pages 55 and 77. We remain focused on scaling up delivery in subsequent years to achieve our targets.\n\nTo ensure stakeholder confidence in our approach, we have/uni00A0conducted a lim/i.rightted-scope assurance exercise over performance data related to selected Aspirat/i.rightons, see sc.com/aspirat/i.rightonsassurance . The/uni00A0find/i.rightngs of this exercise will contribute towards our continued work to strengthen how we track and report progress on our Aspirat/i.rightons, includ/i.rightng as part of our commitment to the UN Princ/i.rightples for Responsible Banking.",

In 2021, we launched 13 new sustainable finance products, includ/i.rightng sustainable current and savings accounts for both our CCIB clients and retail customers, and green mortgages in some of our key markets, Singapore, Hong Kong and Thailand.\n\nOur Green and Sustainable Product Framework guides our labelling of sustainable assets internally. The Framework was developed, and is reviewed annually, in collaboration with the leading provider of ESG and corporate governance research, Sustainalyt/i.rightcs.\n\nIn 2021, this review led to the Framework being updated to include addit/i.rightonal green build/i.rightngs certif/i.rightcations as well as tighten/i.rightng elig/i.rightbil/i.rightty criter/i.righta where market expectations have evolved.\n\nAlongside our net zero approach in October 2021, we also launched our new Transit/i.righton Finance Framework. This outlines the activ/i.rightties that we consider elig/i.rightble for labelling as 'transit/i.righton' and is intended to support our clients in their journey to a lower-carbon future.\n\nTogether, these Frameworks define the activ/i.rightties that count towards our target to mobil/i.rightse $300 bill/i.righton in green and transit/i.righton finance by 2030, the key driver of our abil/i.rightty to meet our net zero targets.\n\nBetween July 2020 and June 2021, our Sustainable Finance asset base increased by 138 per cent year-on-year to $9.2 bill/i.righton. This increase was driven by organic growth coupled with the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton of exist/i.rightng exposures that had not previously been tagged as green or sustainable. With more than 84 per cent of these assets located in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, our dedicated Sustainable Finance team is focused on accelerating the deployment of sustainable finance to the markets where it matters the most.\n\nOur second Sustainable Finance Impact Report found that our green lending avoided 1.4 mill/i.righton tonnes of CO 2 emiss/i.rightons from July 2020 to June 2021, a 264 per cent increase in CO 2 avoided year-on-year, and equivalent to more than 3 mill/i.righton economy class aeroplane seats from London to Singapore. Our green assets in Organisat/i.righton for Economic Cooperation and Development Development Assistance Committee (OECDDAC) least developed, lower- and lower-middle income markets have achieved sign/i.rightficantly more impact in terms of CO 2 emiss/i.rightons avoided per dollar invested than our green asset base in the rest of the world. This reinforces the find/i.rightngs of our Opportunity2030 Report and emphasises the need to keep finance flowing to the markets in our footprint where it matters most and can have the greatest impact.\n\nWe also made progress towards our Aspirat/i.rightons for small business lending ($15 bill/i.righton, January 2020 to December 2024) and microf/i.rightnance ($3 bill/i.righton, January 2020 to December 2024), enabling more than 885,000 microf/i.rightnance loans and provid/i.rightng nearly 20,000 loans to small and medium enterprises, often the powerhouses of the economy in many of our markets.\n\nIn 2020, we announced that we would commit $1 bill/i.righton of/uni00A0not-for-profit financ/i.rightng for companies that provide goods and services to help in the fight against COVID-19. By the end/uni00A0of 2021, we had approved $930 mill/i.righton of this, and dispersed $782 mill/i.righton. This has helped businesses across our markets manufacture and distr/i.rightbute emergency ventilators, face masks, protective equipment and sanit/i.rightsers, and governments to finance the purchase of World Health Organisat/i.righton approved COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nIn 2022, we expect growth of our Sustainable Finance asset base to continue at pace, both as the market develops and also as we further expand and embed our sustainable finance product offering with our clients.\n\nWe will continue to grow our sustainable finance proposit/i.righton, and increase lending into areas aligned with the SDGs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read our Sustainable Finance Impact Report: sc.com/SFimpactreport\n\nRead our Sustainable Finance Frameworks: sc.com/sustainablef/i.rightnanceframework\n\nRead our Opportunity2030 Report: sc.com/opportunity2030\n\nSee our 2021 Sustainab/i.rightlity Aspirat/i.rightons\n\non\n\npage 62\n\n## Do less harm - managing environmental and/uni00A0social risk\n\nWe have a comprehensive approach to managing environmental and social (E&S) risk. We work with clients, regulators and peers across the finance sector to continuously improve E&S standards and mit/i.rightgate the impact that may stem from our financ/i.rightng decis/i.rightons.\n\nWe have a suite of detailed policy frameworks and Posit/i.righton Statements, approved by the Group Responsib/i.rightlity and Reputational Risk Committee (GRRRC), which draw on global best practice, includ/i.rightng the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards and the Equator Princ/i.rightples (EP), to outline the cross-sector standards we expect of ourselves and our clients. Sector-specif/i.rightc guidance is also provided for clients operating in sectors with high environmental or social impact potential, and our prohib/i.rightted activ/i.rightties list sets out the activ/i.rightties we do not finance. We will not provide financ/i.rightal services to clients who breach, or show insuff/i.rightcient progress in align/i.rightng with, our Posit/i.righton Statements.\n\nIn 2021, we updated our Posit/i.righton Statements covering all sensit/i.rightve sectors. We introduced enhanced requirements which will become effective from 2022, with the exception of addit/i.rightonal restrict/i.rightons placed on thermal coaldependent clients, which were effective immed/i.rightately.",

During 2021, we reviewed 786 clients and 547 transactions that presented potential specif/i.rightc risks against our Posit/i.righton Statements.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to hold the posit/i.righton of Chair of the EP Associat/i.righton, and member of the Board of Governors of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. In addit/i.righton, we adopted the Poseidon Princ/i.rightples.\n\nIn 2022, we will prior/i.righttise our approach to biod/i.rightversity, and update our Environmental and Social Risk Management Framework in support of our ambit/i.righton to become the world's most sustainable and responsible bank. We will also further expand our capacity to conduct E&S due dil/i.rightgence on clients by leveraging our Global Business Service centre in Warsaw.\n\n- Read more about our Posit/i.righton Statements at sc.com/posit/i.rightonstatements\n- Read more about our prohib/i.rightted activ/i.rightties at/uni00A0 sc.com/prohib/i.righttedactiv/i.rightties\n- Read more about our reporting against the/uni00A0Equator Princ/i.rightples at sc.com/ equatorprinc/i.rightples\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver 70 per cent of our Sustainable Finance assets are located in emerging and developing economies.\n\n## Responding to climate change\n\nWe believe that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today and that its impact will hit hardest in the communit/i.rightes and markets where we operate, namely Asia, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nOur climate strategy is structured around three pillars: accelerating sustainable finance; reducing our direct and financed emiss/i.rightons; and managing the financ/i.rightal risk from climate change. These focus areas reflect the ways in which we contribute, and are exposed to, the risks aris/i.rightng from climate change.\n\n## Accelerating sustainable finance\n\nThe need for a just transit/i.righton to an inclus/i.rightve, net zero economy brings with it a huge opportunity for innovat/i.righton and growth for our clients and our Bank. We are uniquely placed to help by/uni00A0direct/i.rightng capital to markets that have both the greatest opportunity to adopt low-carbon technology, and some of the toughest transit/i.righton-financ/i.rightng and climate challenges. As/uni00A0set out on page 64, we plan to mobil/i.rightse $300 bill/i.righton aligned to our Green and Sustainable Product Framework, and Transit/i.righton Finance Framework.\n\n## Reducing our direct and financed emiss/i.rightons\n\nSince 2018, we have been working on align/i.rightng the emiss/i.rightons from both our own operations and our financ/i.rightng activ/i.rightties to/uni00A0the Paris Agreement goal of below two degrees of global warming. During 2021, we announced our plan to reach net zero in our/uni00A0financ/i.rightng by 2050, with ambit/i.rightous inter/i.rightm targets to substantially reduce our financed carbon emiss/i.rightons by 2030.\n\nTo achieve this, we have set out our roadmap to reduce financed emiss/i.rightons, finance transit/i.righton projects and accelerate new solutions.

We are also reducing emiss/i.rightons intens/i.rightty in other high-carbon sectors, setting inter/i.rightm targets for power (-63/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent emiss/i.rightons intens/i.rightty), steel and min/i.rightng (-33/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent emiss/i.rightons intens/i.rightty respectively), and oil and gas/uni00A0(-30/uni00A0per/uni00A0cent emiss/i.rightons intens/i.rightty).\n\nWe continue to innovate and strive to accelerate new solutions to climate change, such as launching and growing sustainable products; reporting on wealth management emiss/i.rightons; and deploying a new Transit/i.righton Acceleration Team to provide our clients in carbon-intens/i.rightve sectors with deep expertise on how to accelerate their low-carbon transit/i.rightons, and tools to measure their progress.\n\nWe are also committed to reducing the emiss/i.rightons we produce, and in 2021 we brought forward our target to achieve net zero in our operations from 2030 to 2025.\n\nWith approximately 12,100 suppliers, we understand that there can be sign/i.rightficant carbon emiss/i.rightons associated with the procurement of goods and services and a potential physical impact on our supply chain that may impact our abil/i.rightty to serve our clients. In 2021, we developed a methodology to measure our supplier Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons and used this to engage our top-emitt/i.rightng suppliers to understand their climate-related actions, goals and overall alignment with our sustainab/i.rightlity agenda.\n\n## Princ/i.rightpal Board decis/i.righton - our pathway to net zero\n\nAs part of the considerat/i.righton process for approving the net zero pathway, the Board had to ensure it was comfortable with the methodology, the potential outcome of applying the methodology and the substance of the pathway, all set with/i.rightn the context of an agreed and robust risk management framework. To achieve this, the Board partic/i.rightpated in several discuss/i.rightons during the year and provided valuable input across a number of areas, taking into account the impact on the Group's stakeholders. Examples of such considerat/i.rightons were:\n\n- \u00b7 the risk that some clients may consider the Group's approach too aggressive, or conversely that it does not go far enough, consider/i.rightng in particular the challenges of the Group's footprint in emerging markets and developing countries and recognis/i.rightng the differ/i.rightng pathways to net zero in different markets and the need to support and facil/i.righttate a just transit/i.righton\n- \u00b7 the impact of the pathway on ongoing discuss/i.rightons with civ/i.rightl society groups, such as NGOs\n- \u00b7 likely stakeholder reaction includ/i.rightng governments, regulators, communit/i.rightes and clients as well as investors and NGOs to the methodology\n- \u00b7 when to announce the pathway and how this would impact certain stakeholders\n\nAs a result, sustainab/i.rightlity factors have been embedded into our Spend Category Plans, includ/i.rightng targeting specif/i.rightc areas to drive emiss/i.righton reductions. We also began to embed emiss/i.rightons-related clauses into relevant supplier contracts to reduce our consumption and mit/i.rightgate remainder emiss/i.rightons.\n\n## Managing the financ/i.rightal risk from climate change\n\nManaging the financ/i.rightal risks from climate change remains a key prior/i.rightty for the organisat/i.righton. Throughout 2021, we continued to embed climate risk management into our ERMF, understanding the impact of physical and transit/i.righton risks on our credit portfolio and climate related reputational risks for clients in high transit/i.righton sectors.\n\nIn 2022, we will extend this to cover other relevant Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types. Climate scenario analysis across our markets, includ/i.rightng the Bank of England's 2021 Bienn/i.rightal Exploratory Scenario, have helped improve our understanding in ident/i.rightfying key portfolios vulnerable to climate risk.\n\nIn partnership with peers, industry and academia, we are transit/i.rightoning from measurement to management of climate risk. Through ongoing partnership with Imperial College London, we supported the publicat/i.righton of a new climate research which revealed the potential for nature-based solutions to tackle the interl/i.rightnkages between agriculture, land-use and climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 the sign/i.rightficant level of engagement the Group had undertaken with some stakeholders, includ/i.rightng investors and NGOs, while formulating the net zero pathway\n- \u00b7 the importance of provid/i.rightng opportunity for feedback from those stakeholders not already consulted once the pathway was published\n- \u00b7 the content of the communicat/i.rightons material to be published to ensure effective readabil/i.rightty for stakeholders\n- \u00b7 future reporting of progress against the pathway to the market\n- \u00b7 the potential opportunit/i.rightes of Transit/i.righton Finance offerings for clients\n- \u00b7 the importance of supporting the transit/i.righton for many clients towards lower-emitt/i.rightng technologies to support a just transit/i.righton\n- \u00b7 the intended plan to put the pathway to an advisory vote at Standard Chartered PLC's 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) in recognit/i.righton of how important this is to our shareholders and other stakeholders\n\nStakeholder considerat/i.rightons were taken into account in the Board's oversight of the net zero pathway among many other factors. As a result, the Board, cognisant of the methodological approach and interest in the pathway by shareholders and other stakeholders, approved the recommended pathway and communicat/i.rightons plan.",

The Code supports all our polic/i.rightes, setting out min/i.rightmum standards and reinforc/i.rightng our valued and expected behaviours. It also outlines a decis/i.righton-making framework to help colleagues make good decis/i.rightons.

In 2021, 99.6 per cent of our colleagues completed this.\n\nIn 2021, Conduct Risk became an integral component of the ERMF, ensuring it is considered with/i.rightn each Princ/i.rightpal Risk Type. A new management approach using targeted metrics, analytics and data to enhance our Conduct Risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and mit/i.rightgation will be rolled out in phases across 2022.\n\nIn October 2021 we updated our operational risk management system, introduc/i.rightng a new field to tag each issue logged with the most appropriate conduct outcome.\n\n<!-- image -->",

During the year, we closed 285 Speaking Up cases. Of the top three substantiated themes closed in 2021, 17 related to sexual harassment, 12 to informat/i.righton and cyber security breaches and 12 related to failure to ensure occupational health and safety. Together, these account for approximately 34 per cent of substantiated cases. In comparison with previous years we saw fewer instances of concerns related to theft of informat/i.righton, personal account dealing and close personal relationsh/i.rightps.\n\nFor the substantiated invest/i.rightgations, a range of corrective actions were recommended includ/i.rightng process improvements, targeted coaching, train/i.rightng, and disc/i.rightplinary sanctions ranging from verbal warnings to dism/i.rightssals.\n\nIn 2021, we united our Conduct and Speaking Up teams to form a new Conduct & Ethics (C&E) team. This enables us to leverage synergies and apply increased focus on the prevention of misconduct alongside our detection capabil/i.rightties. In 2022, we will continue to enhance our conduct polic/i.rightes and standards so that they remain current, clear and effective. We will also roll out C&E engagement in/i.righttiat/i.rightves to unite colleagues and lift partic/i.rightpation across the Group ensuring a Group-wide focus on liv/i.rightng the Group Code of Conduct.\n\nFurthermore, we will continue to develop our Group Conduct Dashboard to derive deeper conduct ins/i.rightghts that will enable us to drive action and remediat/i.righton in a more targeted manner across the Conduct Programme.\n\n## Speaking Up cases\n\n|   Year | Total raised 1   |   In scope 2 |   Closed 3 Substantiated 4 Unsubstantiated |   Closed 3 Substantiated 4 Unsubstantiated |\n|--------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n|   2021 | 1,159            |          256 |                                        119 |                                        166 |\n|   2020 | 1,209            |          273 |                                        115 |                                        135 |\n|   2019 | 1,382            |          294 |                                        179 |                                        189 |\n\nThe data in these reporting periods has been updated as at 31 December 2021.\n\n- 1 Total concerns raised with/i.rightn the reporting year\n- 2 A concern under the FCA whistleblow/i.rightng rules that is raised with/i.rightn the reporting year and considered with/i.rightn the scope of the Speaking Up programme\n- 3 This represents all cases closed with/i.rightn the reporting year.

We safeguard against money laundering (AML), terrorist financ/i.rightng, sanctions, fraud and other risks, applying core controls such as client due-dil/i.rightgence, screening and monitor/i.rightng. In addit/i.righton, anti-bribery and corruption (ABC) controls aim to prevent colleagues, or third parties working on our behalf, from engaging in bribery.\n\nDuring 2021, 41 processes (representing 7.3 per cent of our ident/i.rightfied process universe with/i.rightn the Operational Risk & Technology Framework) were ident/i.rightfied as susceptible to bribery and corruption-related risk. All processes are tracked through enhanced reporting and first- and second-line governance forums to mit/i.rightgate this risk. The Group Risk Assessment found no processes or countries to be operating at a high residual risk level; however, 14 countries were ident/i.rightfied as having a high inherent risk.\n\nNo public legal cases involv/i.rightng allegations of corruption were brought against the Group or its employees during the year. Internally, our Shared Investigat/i.rightve Services (SIS) team conducted 62 invest/i.rightgations classif/i.righted as having an ABC nexus, which resulted in 10 disc/i.rightplinary cases.\n\nA particular focus of our financ/i.rightal crime invest/i.rightgatory teams is the use of data analytics to ident/i.rightfy those clients and cases which generate the greatest financ/i.rightal crime risk. In 2021, we increased coordinat/i.rightng and streamlin/i.rightng the work carried out by these ind/i.rightvidual teams. This has strengthened the second line of defence in support of colleagues in business lines and country teams across the Bank.\n\nTo mit/i.rightgate the risk of financ/i.rightal crime, particularly laundering the proceeds of corruption, in the lead-up to, during and after major polit/i.rightcal elections in certain footprint markets, the Group conducts enhanced monitor/i.rightng designed to ident/i.rightfy and invest/i.rightgate transactions of potential concern. In 2021, enhanced monitor/i.rightng was conducted during major elections held in Uganda, Zambia and The Gambia. CFCC also invest/i.rightgated risks to the Group aris/i.rightng from a number of prominent financ/i.rightal crime stories in the press, conducting invest/i.rightgations prompted by events such as the FinCEN Files and Pandora Papers leaks, among others.",

Through 12 live sustainab/i.rightlity events across four days, we engaged more than 7,000 colleagues in sessions ranging from our sustainable finance proposit/i.rightons to our net zero approach, the science behind climate change to our approach to carbon offsetting. Colleagues who partic/i.rightpated in over four hours of learning were given the opportunity to complete a short assessment to attain a certif/i.rightcation linked directly to their ind/i.rightvidual performance review. More than 700/uni00A0colleagues completed this course and certif/i.rightcation.\n\nIn 2022, we intend to continue to grow our Sustainab/i.rightlity Network and introduce a global sustainab/i.rightlity learning programme on the Bank's diSCover platform. In addit/i.righton, we will build on a pilot carried out during 2021, and roll out a global dig/i.righttal solution to enable colleagues to analyse and reduce their carbon footprint both at home and at work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCase study\n\n## [[ Sierra Leone solar PV/uni00A0array]]\n\nDuring 2021, our Sierra Leone Property team installed more than 300 solar photovoltaic (PV) panels on the roof of our headquarters build/i.rightng in Freetown.

The directors will continue to monitor and consider the appropriateness of this period.\n\nThe directors have reviewed the corporate plan, the output of the Group's formalised process of budgeting and strategic planning. For the 2022 Corporate Plan, the forward-looking cash flows and balances continue to include the longer-term impact of COVID-19, specif/i.rightcally with regards to expected credit loss. The Corporate Plan further includes the antic/i.rightpated impact of global interest rates on revenues. The corporate plan is evaluated and approved each year by the Board with confirmat/i.righton from the Group Chief Risk Officer that the Plan is aligned with the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and Group Risk Appetite Statement and considers the Group's future project/i.rightons of profitab/i.rightlity, cash flows, capital requirements and resources, liqu/i.rightdity ratios and other key financ/i.rightal and regulatory ratios over the period. The corporate plan details the Group's key performance measures, of forecast profit, CET 1 capital ratio forecast, return on tangible equity forecasts, cost to income ratio forecasts and cash investment project/i.rightons. The Board has reviewed the ongoing performance management process of the Group by comparing the statutory results to the budgets and corporate plan.\n\nThe Group performs enterprise-wide stress tests using a range of bespoke hypothetical scenarios that explore the resil/i.rightence of the Group to shocks to its balance sheet and business model.\n\nTo assess the Group's balance sheet vulnerabil/i.rightties and capital and liqu/i.rightdity adequacy, severe but plausible macro-financ/i.rightal scenarios explore shocks that trigger one or more of:\n\n- \u00b7 Global slowdowns includ/i.rightng recessions in China, Asian and Western economies that can be acute or more protracted\n- \u00b7 Sharp falls in world trade volumes and disrupt/i.righton to global supply chains, includ/i.rightng the severe worsening of trade tensions and rise of protection/i.rightsm.\n- \u00b7 Material and persistent declines in commodity prices\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal market volatil/i.rightty, includ/i.rightng a sharp fall in asset prices driven by a drop in risk appetite amongst financ/i.rightal market partic/i.rightpants\n\nThis year, the primary focus has continued to be on macrofinanc/i.rightal stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Scenario analysis has explored the impact of new virus variants that lead to further restrict/i.rightons and tighter financ/i.rightng condit/i.rightons across the Group's footprint markets, particularly countries with lower rates of vaccinat/i.righton.\n\nThe Group further performed the 2021 Climate Bienn/i.rightal Exploratory Scenario to explore key risks from climate change, being transit/i.righton risk of the economy moving away from carbon and the physical risks of higher global temperatures. For the Group this Focussed on credit risk in the loans and advances portfolio to corporate and inst/i.righttutional clients as well as personal customers over a thirty year time horizon.\n\nUnder this range of scenarios, the results of these stress tests demonstrate that the Group has suffic/i.rightent capital and liqu/i.rightdity to continue as a going concern and meet regulatory min/i.rightmum capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements.\n\nTo assess the Group's business model vulnerabil/i.rightties, extreme and unlikely scenarios are explored that, by design, result in the Group's business model no longer being viable these scenarios have included for the Group extreme geopolit/i.rightcal tensions disrupt/i.rightng capital flows with/i.rightn the Group's footprint and cyber security attacks. Insights from these reverse stress tests can inform strategy, risk management and capital and liqu/i.rightdity planning.\n\nThe directors further considered the Group's Internal Liqu/i.rightdity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which considers the Group's liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton, its framework and whether suffic/i.rightent liqu/i.rightdity resources are being mainta/i.rightned to meet liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes as they fall due. Funding and liqu/i.rightdity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics, includ/i.rightng the ADR and LCR ratios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther informat/i.righton on stress testing is provided in the Risk management approach section (pages 260 and 261).",

The Board continued to monitor the impact of COVID-19, alongside geopolit/i.rightcal and internat/i.rightonal developments, and sustained the 2020 approach to meeting more often, given restrict/i.rightons on travel and usual meeting patterns. This ensured that effective Board oversight and strong corporate governance were mainta/i.rightned.\n\nIt was clear to the Board how important continued discuss/i.righton, review and approval of our Corporate Plan and strategic prior/i.rightties were, especially in light of an ever-evolving landscape. Our oversight focused on driv/i.rightng profitab/i.rightlity while continu/i.rightng to strengthen resil/i.rightence, setting targets that balanced business opportunit/i.rightes against risks and controls. The Board remained resolute on deliver/i.rightng our strategic object/i.rightves through a culture that promotes transparency, good conduct and trust. The importance of resil/i.rightence in deliver/i.rightng these object/i.rightves cannot be underestimated, with the Board focused on further strengthening our risk and control culture with the help of the Board Risk, Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk and Audit committees.\n\nThe Board also spent sign/i.rightficant time during the year discuss/i.rightng the Group's sustainab/i.rightlity approach. We recognise that climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today and appreciate the complex trade-offs which come with climate action, meaning there are no simple answers. The Group's net zero pathway announced in the year was reviewed and approved at Board level, and consequently the Group has mobil/i.rightsed resources dil/i.rightgently to support these commitments. We plan to put the pathway to an advisory vote at Standard Chartered PLC's 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) in recognit/i.righton of how important this is to our shareholders and other stakeholders. In addit/i.righton, the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee (BVCC) was renamed the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee (CSC) following a refocus of its remit. Greater weight has been given to environmental, social and governance matters, and areas of duplicat/i.righton have been addressed. The CSC has been actively involved in supporting the Board and the business in relation to our net zero proposals. Further detail can be found in the Strategic report on pages 61 to 77 and the CSC report on pages 130 to 132 respectively.\n\nThe Board has continued to drive the transformational agenda. As the Group's Innovation and Dig/i.righttisat/i.righton event made clear, dig/i.righttal transformation is fundamental to establish/i.rightng a solid\n\nfoundation for exponential growth and to driv/i.rightng posit/i.rightve change in some of the world's fastest-growing economies. New business models create shareholder value and provide a best-in-class experience for our clients. Alongside this, the Board continued to review, challenge and advise management on the Group's technology and innovat/i.righton strategy more broadly.\n\nThe 2021 Board and committees' effectiveness review was conducted internally, facil/i.righttated by the Group Company Secretary, and in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code. The results were ins/i.rightghtful and were reviewed with the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee ahead of Board discuss/i.righton. Key find/i.rightngs, recommendations and an Action Plan for 2022 were then presented and approved. Further detail is given on page 108.\n\nThe Board and its committees invested time in review/i.rightng and approving the Group's Resolvabil/i.rightty Assessment Report ahead of submiss/i.righton to the Bank of England in October 2021, with Resolvabil/i.rightty remain/i.rightng a focus area throughout 2022. Further detail can be found in the key areas of Board discuss/i.righton section of this report on page 99 and in the Board Risk Committee report starting on page 123.\n\nStakeholder engagement is vital to Board discuss/i.righton and decis/i.righton-making. In addit/i.righton to our net zero pathway being proposed to shareholders at the 2022 AGM, we are also requesting approval of our new directors' remuneration policy. Following consultation with major shareholders, the Remuneration Committee reviewed the exist/i.rightng policy, concluding it remains appropriate to support the delivery of our strategy, with no sign/i.rightficant change proposed to the overall structure or quantum of the current executive directors' remuneration. Further detail can be found in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 160 to 166. During the year, we held our first ever AGM offering virtual partic/i.rightpation, where our shareholders were able to vote on resolutions and engage with the Board. I also hosted a virtual stewardship event in November 2021 alongside several Board colleagues, allowing us to update inst/i.righttutional investors and shareholder representative bodies on key areas of focus for the Board as well as respond to their questions.\n\nOverall, despite being unable to meet in our key markets this year, the Board has remained actively involved by virtually attending subsid/i.rightary board, committee and management meetings, and through employee and other stakeholder engagement sessions. Good progress was made to enhance and mainta/i.rightn effective subsid/i.rightary linkages through events such as our subsid/i.rightary chair meetings, as well as via formal reporting mechanisms. In addit/i.righton to this, we continued to strengthen the Group's corporate structure through the creation of our consolidated ASEAN hub under Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Lim/i.rightted. Further detail on the Board's engagement with stakeholders can be found on pages 110 to 115.\n\nWe continued to make good progress with succession planning and evolution of the Board and its committees. Maria Ramos jo/i.rightned the Board, Audit Committee and Board Risk Committee in January 2021, and was appointed as a member of the Remuneration Committee in July 2021. Divers/i.rightty remains key in succession planning, especially consider/i.rightng our business, network and footprint. While our female and ethnically diverse representation on the Board dropped following Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala's departure last year, we remain committed to achiev/i.rightng our target of at least 33 per cent female and our ambit/i.righton of 30 per cent from an ethnic minor/i.rightty background. Further detail on both Board changes and divers/i.rightty can be found in the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee report starting on page 133. Amanda Mellor left the Group on 23 December 2021 after nearly three years as our Group Company Secretary, and her contribut/i.rightons have been greatly appreciated, particularly in navigat/i.rightng complex governance arrangements throughout the pandemic's evolution. Scott Corrigan, Global Head of Disputes and Government Investigat/i.rightons, has been appointed as Interim Group Company Secretary until a permanent successor is confirmed.\n\n2021, as with 2020, has been an exceptional year. The Board remains cautiously optim/i.rightstic for the future and is committed to our strategy, our purpose, and is laser focused on improv/i.rightng returns.\n\nDr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als Group Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board recognised the sign/i.rightficance of balancing a cautious approach to capital management in light of the continued impact of the pandemic against returns to our shareholders, and this was reinforced by the decis/i.righton to approve a further buy-back programme that completed in September 2021.

The Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer comment on current trading, business performance, the market, colleagues, relevant stakeholders, and regulatory and external developments at each scheduled meeting, and present comparative data and client ins/i.rightght.

The most appropriate format for each Board meeting was assessed by the Group Chairman, with support from the Group Company Secretary, on a case-by-case basis.

In 2021, Sir Iain's appointment was renewed for a further 12-month term.\n\n## Our Board committees\n\nThe Board places sign/i.rightficant reliance on its committees by delegating a broad range of responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes and issues to them. It therefore remains crucial that effective linkages are in place between the committees and the Board as a whole, not least as it is impract/i.rightcable for all INEDs to be members of all of the committees. Mechanisms are in place to facil/i.righttate these linkages, includ/i.rightng ensuring that there are no gaps or unnecessary duplicat/i.rightons between the remit of each committee and overlapping membership between Board committees where necessary. Alongside interconnected committee membership, the Board receives a written summary of each of the committee's meetings and verbal updates at the Board, where appropriate.\n\nFurther details on each committee, includ/i.rightng their oversight and focus during 2021, can be found in the Board committee reports starting on page 116.\n\nOverall, the Board adjusted well to a fluid approach to meeting formats, and irrespect/i.rightve of physical location and time zone, each director was able to interact effectively with other Board members.\n\nAs was the case last year, the length of scheduled Board meetings was adjusted and a number of ad hoc meetings and informal sessions were organised.

In light of the continued impact of the pandemic, vis/i.rightts to key markets across our footprint have been restricted and typically replaced with virtual engagements.\n\nThe Group Corporate Secretariat function supports the INEDs as they undertake their induct/i.righton programmes, which are typically completed with/i.rightn the first six to nine months of an INED appointment. The programmes are regularly reviewed and take into account directors' feedback to ensure continuous development and improvement.\n\nOne new director, Maria Ramos, was appointed to the Board in January 2021. Maria brings highly applicable skills and a range of knowledge relevant to Board debate and discuss/i.righton. She possesses deep CEO, banking, commercial, financ/i.rightal, policy and internat/i.rightonal experience, as well as considerable non-executive experience, having served on internat/i.rightonal boards. Prior to being appointed to the Board, the Audit and Board Risk committees, and later the Remuneration committee, Maria was given a number of induct/i.righton sessions to ensure a smooth transit/i.righton into taking up her roles. On jo/i.rightning the Board and committees, she undertook a detailed induct/i.righton programme. Further detail can be found on pages 106 and 107.\n\n## Ongoing development plans\n\nContinuous train/i.rightng and development beyond a director's induct/i.righton plan is essential to mainta/i.rightning a highly engaged, effective and well-informed Board. Ongoing development plans also help ensure directors lead with integr/i.rightty and promote the Group's culture, purpose and values.\n\nMandatory learning and train/i.rightng are important elements of directors' fit and proper assessments as mandated under the Senior Managers Regime. During the year, all directors received a combinat/i.righton of mandatory learning and train/i.rightng, internal and external brief/i.rightngs, presentations from guest speakers, and papers on a wide range of topics to ensure the directors are well-informed and that the Board remains highly effective. The Board committee members also received specif/i.rightc train/i.rightng relevant to the work of their respective committees. The format of ongoing train/i.rightng varied, includ/i.rightng formal refresher sessions and informal meetings. The train/i.rightng covered a variety of topics throughout the year, the major/i.rightty of which were held virtually in light of the continued impact of the pandemic. The table below gives further detail on who received these brief/i.rightngs.\n\nThe Group Chairman reviews with each director their train/i.rightng and development needs both in real time and as part of the annual performance cycle. Where it is recognised that the Board or ind/i.rightvidual directors need further train/i.rightng or development in key areas, addit/i.rightonal sessions are arranged with subject matter experts.\n\nAll of the directors have access to the advice of the Group Company Secretary, who provides support to the Board and is responsible for advis/i.rightng the Board on governance matters. Directors also have access to independent professional advice at the Group's expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes as directors.\n\n## 2021 director train/i.rightng overview\n\n|                   | Induction 1   | Directors'  duties and  regulatory  updates 2   | Activ/i.rightsm 3   | Dig/i.righttal  currencies   | Technology   | Climate- related  matters   | Climate Risk   | Global  economic  outlook   |\n|-------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| J Vi\u00f1als          | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| W T Winters       | N/A           |                                                 | N/A                 |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| A N Halford       | N/A           |                                                 | N/A                 |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| D P Conner        | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| B E Grote         | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| C M Hodgson, CBE  | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| G Huey Evans, CBE | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| N Kheraj          | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| N Okonjo-Iweala 4 | N/A           | N/A                                             | N/A                 | N/A                          | N/A          |                             | N/A            | N/A                         |\n| M Ramos 5         |               |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| P G Rivett        | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| D Tang            | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| C Tong            | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n| J M Whitbread     | N/A           |                                                 |                     |                              |              |                             |                |                             |\n\n- 1 Applicable to directors who received induct/i.righton train/i.rightng during 2021\n- 2 Train/i.rightng took place via circulat/i.righton of material and opportunity to raise questions with external counsel and the Group Company Secretary\n- 3 Train/i.rightng was specif/i.rightcally designed for non-executive directors\n- 4  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala stepped down from the Board on 28 February 2021.

In light of the continued impact of the pandemic your induct/i.righton programme had to be undertaken remotely. How did you find that worked?\n\nA. The extensive challenges includ/i.rightng travel restrict/i.rightons imposed by COVID-19 meant that the induct/i.righton programme for an INED such as myself had to be adapted to new ways of working. The extensive programme of induct/i.righton was structured so that it could be undertaken entirely remotely through the use of electronic facil/i.rightties. The programme was completed over a six month period.\n\nA sign/i.rightficant amount of thought and planning went into the design of the programme to prior/i.righttise the key areas of work and responsib/i.rightlity so that I could partic/i.rightpate appropriately in Board and committee work, no matter where I was physically located.",

How successful did you view your induct/i.righton programme in preparing you for Board and committee discuss/i.rightons?\n\nA. The induct/i.righton programme was exceedingly successful in preparing me for the work of the Board and committees. The materials prepared were focused and dealt with relevant issues. Importantly, I had the opportunity to meet (virtually) a lot of the executive leadership of the Bank around the world and interact with them.\n\n## Q. To what extent did your induct/i.righton programme provide an ins/i.rightght into the Group's culture?\n\nA . Although the interact/i.rightons were all virtual, they provided me with important ins/i.rightghts into the Bank's culture. The sense of purpose was vis/i.rightble, the commitment to sustainab/i.rightlity, the resil/i.rightence, care and respect for people were evident. Moreover, a culture of openness and transparency prevailed in my interact/i.rightons with everyone I engaged with.\n\n## Q. How flexible did you find the induct/i.righton programme?\n\nA. The programme is flexible and each director elects topics for deep dives as necessary. I was able to balance this against a broad range of subjects.\n\n## Q. How effectively has your induct/i.righton programme transit/i.rightoned into ongoing engagement?\n\nA. The programme provided me with the necessary base for engagement with key stakeholders, both internal and external.",

        "page_content": "## Board effectiveness\n\nThe 2021 Board and committees' effectiveness review was conducted internally, facil/i.righttated by the Group Company Secretary, and in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Progress against the 2021 Action Plan\n\nThe 2021 Action Plan set out a number of actions to be achieved following the internal Board evaluation conducted in 2020 and built on those ambit/i.rightons set following the externally facil/i.righttated reviews by Independent Board Evaluation and the PRA in 2019. The 2021 Action Plan was regularly reviewed during the year and good progress had been made against many of the actions as evidenced by this year's internal Board effectiveness review. The continued lim/i.righttations to travel during the year have impacted on the delivery of some specif/i.rightc actions which have been carried forward to 2022.\n\n## 2021 Board effectiveness review\n\nQuestionna/i.rightres were sent to each director for completion in respect of the Board and relevant committees. These questionna/i.rightres sought to draw out and explore some of the themes for the previous year's review as well as pose some more wide-ranging and probing questions. The results were compiled into a detailed report and conclusions were discussed with the Group Chairman and by the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee ahead of a Board discuss/i.righton. At the Board, the key find/i.rightngs and recommendations were presented along with an Action Plan for 2022, which was then approved. Details of the key observations from this year's review and the agreed Action Plan are set out on this page.\n\nThe Board's six committees were also included as part of the effectiveness review. The observations and key themes were shared with the relevant committee Chairs before being circulated to each of the committees and action plans for 2022 approved. Details of the key observations and action plans for each of the committees can be found with/i.rightn each of the committees' reports.\n\n## Internal evaluation process\n\n## Key observations from the 2021 internal effectiveness review\n\n- \u00b7 The Board has continued to remain effective in meeting its prior/i.rightties despite the continued COVID-constrained environment\n- \u00b7 Recognit/i.righton of the posit/i.rightve challenge provided to the strategy and helpful addit/i.rightonal perspective on a range of issues from guest speakers and the 'blue sky sessions'\n- \u00b7 Good progress made on understanding of the Group's Resolvabil/i.rightty plans but a need to ensure they continue to develop and remain part of the forward agenda\n- \u00b7 Support for the reallocation of the work of the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee (BFCRC) into a combinat/i.righton of the Audit Committee, Board Risk Committee (BRC) and Board\n- \u00b7 Scope to continue train/i.rightng on the rapidly changing landscape of emerging technology and risks\n\n## 2022 Action Plan\n\n- \u00b7 Enhance the Board's ins/i.rightghts into what customer/ product numbers drive revenue growth, how customers view the Bank and its brand, and how our in/i.righttiat/i.rightves are perceived relative to competitors\n- \u00b7 Devote Board time to a broader discuss/i.righton of the business enabling greater considerat/i.righton of social trends, demographics and technology, as well as our competitors and trends from non-bank/financ/i.rightal services competitors\n- \u00b7 Consider reallocating the work of the BFCRC to the BRC, Audit Committee and Board in 2022, mainta/i.rightning strong oversight of financ/i.rightal crime risks\n- \u00b7 Continue to focus on Resolvabil/i.rightty and ensure this is embedded into the Board's forward agenda\n- \u00b7 Review the key performance ind/i.rightcators and their scope to ensure new drivers of business growth and sustainab/i.rightlity are measured, with/i.rightn an appropriate dashboard\n- \u00b7 Continue to build the Board's train/i.rightng programme, scheduling further sessions on emerging technology and risks, dig/i.righttal assets, data, and current uses of artif/i.rightcial intell/i.rightgence (AI). Explore the use of online modules and podcasts to enable greater flexib/i.rightlity and maxim/i.rightse the use of directors' time\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' performance\n\nThe Group Chairman led the evaluation of ind/i.rightvidual director performance during 2021. These one-to-one sessions provided an important opportunity for each of the INEDs to discuss with Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, among other things:\n\n- \u00b7 their performance against core competencies and their ind/i.rightvidual effectiveness\n- \u00b7 their time commitment to the Group, includ/i.rightng (where relevant) the potential impact of any outside interests\n- \u00b7 their ongoing development and train/i.rightng needs\n- \u00b7 the Board's composit/i.righton, taking into account when each INED envisaged stepping down from the Board\n- \u00b7 the current and future committee membership and structure\n- \u00b7 their engagement across the Group\n\nThese performance reviews are used as the basis for recommending the re-election of directors by shareholders at the 2022 AGM and to assist the Group Chairman with his assessment of the INEDs' competencies. In addit/i.righton, the Group Chairman has responsib/i.rightlity for assessing annually the fitness and propriety of the Company's INEDs and the Group Chief Executive Officer under the Senior Managers Regime. These assessments were carried out in respect of each INED and the Group Chief Executive at the end of 2021.\n\n## Group Chairman's performance\n\nThe Senior Independent Director, Christ/i.rightne Hodgson, oversaw the process of review/i.rightng the Group Chairman's performance.\n\nWithout the Group Chairman present, she spoke with the INEDs separately to evaluate his performance, taking into account the views of the executive directors. The feedback was collated, and consolidated feedback was shared with Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als.\n\n## Director independence\n\nThe Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee reviews the independence of each of the non-executive directors, taking into account any circumstances likely to impa/i.rightr, or which could impa/i.rightr, their independence. Recommendations are then made to the Board for further considerat/i.righton.\n\nIn determin/i.rightng the independence of a non-executive director, the Board considers each ind/i.rightvidual against the criter/i.righta set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules and also considers their contribut/i.righton and conduct at Board meetings, includ/i.rightng how they demonstrate object/i.rightve judgement and independent think/i.rightng.\n\nThe Board considers all of the non-executive directors to be independent of Standard Chartered, concluding that there are no relationsh/i.rightps or circumstances likely to impa/i.rightr any INED's judgement.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOur INEDs commit suffic/i.rightent time in discharg/i.rightng their responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes as directors of Standard Chartered. In general, we estimate that each INED spent approximately 35 to 70 days on Board-related duties, and considerably more for those who chair or are members of multiple committees.\n\n## External directorsh/i.rightps and other business interests\n\nBoard members hold external directorsh/i.rightps and other outside business interests. We recognise the sign/i.rightficant benefits that broader boardroom exposure provides for our directors. However, we closely monitor the nature and quantity of external directorsh/i.rightps our directors hold, in order to satisfy ourselves that any addit/i.rightonal appointments will not adversely impact their time commitment to their role at Standard Chartered, and to ensure that all of our Board members remain compliant with the PRA directorsh/i.rightp requirements, as well as the shareholder advisory groups' ind/i.rightvidual guidance on 'over-boarding'. These requirements impose a lim/i.rightt on the number of directorsh/i.rightps both executive and independent non-executive directors are permitted to hold.\n\nDetails of the directors' external directorsh/i.rightps can be found in their biograph/i.rightes on pages 91 to 94. Before committ/i.rightng to an addit/i.rightonal appointment, directors confirm the existence of any potential or actual conflicts, that the role will not breach their lim/i.rightt as set out by the PRA, and provide the necessary assurance that the appointment will not adversely impact their abil/i.rightty to continue to fulfil their role as a director of the Company. All directors continue to hold no more than the maximum number of directorsh/i.rightps permitted under the PRA rules.\n\nOur established internal processes ensure that directors do not undertake any new external appointments without first receiv/i.rightng formal approval of the Board. The Board has delegated authority to make such approvals to the Group Chairman, with the exception of his own appointments. Of those INEDs who took on new external directorsh/i.rightps during the year, three were regarded as sign/i.rightficant directorsh/i.rightps (appointed to the board of a listed company) and as such were announced to the market in line with our list/i.rightng obligat/i.rightons. Further detail on the specif/i.rightc appointments are provided below:\n\n- \u00b7 Jasmine Whitbread, independent non-executive director, was appointed Chair of the board of Travis Perkins plc with effect from 31 March 2021, and to the board of Compagnie Financ/i.right\u00e8re Richemont SA as a non-executive director and a member of its nominat/i.rightons committee with effect from 8 September 2021\n- \u00b7 Following Petershill Partners plc's Init/i.rightal Public Offering in London on 28 September 2021, Naguib Kheraj, Deputy Chairman, became Chairman of another public quoted company\n\nBoth directors ind/i.rightvidually discussed their respective appointments with the Group Chairman in advance of accepting the posit/i.rightons and each provided assurance that their appointments would not impact their abil/i.rightties to devote suffic/i.rightent time and focus to both their Board and committee responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes. Naguib Kheraj streamlined his committee responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes by stepping down as a member of the Remuneration and Audit committees.\n\nThe Board's executive directors are permitted to hold only one non-executive directorsh/i.rightp. Of our executive directors, Andy Halford is the Senior Independent Director, Chair of the Audit Committee and member of the Nominat/i.righton Committee at Marks and Spencer Group plc, listed on the FTSE 250, and Bill Winters is a non-executive director of Novartis International AG, listed on SIX Swiss Exchange.",

This was a key enabler of stakeholder engagement as it provided detailed understanding of the markets, opportunit/i.rightes and risks the Group faces, as well as the opportunity to meet internal and external stakeholders. The Board hopes to be able to engage with stakeholders in person during 2022.\n\n## Ensuring authentic engagement across our markets\n\nBoard vis/i.rightts to markets were replaced with virtual engagements in 2021 due to the continued restrict/i.rightons on travel. However, the Board recognises the mutual benefits to both stakeholders and itself from engagement activ/i.rightties.\n\nWhile facil/i.righttating two-way dialogue via interact/i.rightve technology was productive and effective, in some areas it did prevent the breadth of engagement which the Board would usually undertake. Despite this, authentic engagement led to a number of invaluable opportunit/i.rightes for the Board to meet with stakeholders across the Group's diverse network, includ/i.rightng those ident/i.rightfied on the following pages. Directors did not just engage collectively with stakeholders, but also communicated with some of them ind/i.rightvidually. External adviser members to the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee also engaged directly with stakeholders.\n\nInformal and formal sessions with ind/i.rightvidual stakeholders and stakeholder groups across our footprint help provide INEDs and external adviser members with a comprehensive understanding of the Group's market operations, implementat/i.righton of strategy, and the external and internal impact of the Group's services.\n\nFurther detail regarding the Board's engagement with our stakeholders can be found on the following pages. Detail regarding how Board Committees and their members engaged with stakeholders can be found in the committee report sections starting from page 116.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Engagement with investors\n\n## Our approach\n\nIncreasing shareholder value by deliver/i.rightng robust returns and a long-term, sustainable share price is of key importance to the Board. Continuously looking to improve engagements helps support the Board's focus on developing open and trusted relationsh/i.rightps with investors. This is underpinned by openly seeking feedback and review/i.rightng previous activ/i.rightties.\n\nAs was the case for all forms of stakeholder engagement, the pandemic lim/i.rightted the Board's abil/i.rightty to physically meet with shareholders during the year. A virtual approach in most instances was taken. This restricted the on-the-ground benefits of Board members engaging with shareholders face-to-face but did offer shareholders the opportunity to partic/i.rightpate in events where extensive travel may have restricted them in the past.\n\nDuring the year, we mainta/i.rightned a comprehensive programme of engagement with investors and other key stakeholders, includ/i.rightng investor advisory bodies and credit rating agencies, and provided updates on progress made to transform our business for improved returns.\n\nThe Group Chairman and other Board directors mainta/i.rightn direct contact with investors and advisory voting bodies, and receive regular updates from the Investor Relations team, includ/i.rightng reports on market and investor sentiment. The Group Chairman, as part of his role, leads engagement with shareholders and hosted the 2021 AGM alongside fellow Board members. The Group Chairman and certain Board members also held an Investor Stewardship Event sim/i.rightlar to last year.\n\nChrist/i.rightne Hodgson, Chair of the Remuneration Committee, continued to discuss with and collect feedback from shareholders on a range of remuneration matters, includ/i.rightng the Group's new Directors Remuneration Policy. In her role as Senior Independent Director she is also available to shareholders should they have concerns that cannot be resolved or for which the normal channels would be inappropr/i.rightate.\n\nBill Winters and Andy Halford are the primary spokespeople for the Group. Throughout the year they engaged extensively with exist/i.rightng shareholders and potential new investors during ind/i.rightvidual or group virtual meetings and conferences. In addit/i.righton, each member of the Management Team responsible for a client segment or a geographic region, as well as the Group Treasurer, virtually met with investors to promote greater awareness and understanding of the strategy in their respective areas, as well as taking the opportunity to receive investor feedback first hand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Institut/i.rightonal shareholders\n\nThe Group mainta/i.rightns a diverse, high-quality and predominantly inst/i.righttutional shareholder base. The Investor Relations team has primary responsib/i.rightlity for managing day-to-day communicat/i.rightons with these shareholders and provides support to the Group Chairman, Group Chief Executive, Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer, other Board members and senior management in conducting a comprehensive engagement programme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPresentation material and webcast transcripts are made available on the Group's website and can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\n## Investor stewardship event\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group Chairman; Deputy Chairman and Chair of the Board Risk Committee; the Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Remuneration Committee; and the Chair of the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee hosted the stewardship event on 22 November 2021. The event was attended by investors representing a sizeable proportion of our equity as well as several shareholder representative bodies. As a result of feedback last year, the opening section of the event was streamlined, with the Group Chairman provid/i.rightng a strategic update regarding Board and committee activ/i.rightties during the year, as well as opening remarks from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee. This was followed by a question and answer session (Q&A). The event was held virtually, with live Q&A facil/i.righttated through a web-based platform, which permitted written and verbal communicat/i.rightons.\n\n## Debt investors and credit rating agencies\n\nOur Debt Investor Relations team has primary responsib/i.rightlity for managing the Group's relationsh/i.rightps with debt investors and the three major rating agencies, with local market chief executives and chief financ/i.rightal officers leading on smaller subsid/i.rightary ratings. In 2021, management met virtually with debt investors across Europe, North America and Asia, and mainta/i.rightned a regular dialogue with the rating agencies. It is important that the Group, as an active issuer of senior unsecured and non-equity capital, mainta/i.rightns regular contact with debt investors to ensure continued appetite for the Group's credit. The Group's credit ratings are a key part of the external perception of our financ/i.rightal strength and creditworth/i.rightness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther informat/i.righton can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\n## Engagement with investors: what we did during 2021\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Engagement with investors continued\n\n## Retail shareholders\n\nThe Group Company Secretary oversees communicat/i.righton with our retail shareholders.\n\n## AGM\n\nThe Board's intent/i.righton was to inv/i.rightte shareholders to attend the 2021 AGM in person, especially as this is seen as an important opportunity for shareholders to engage with the Board in a face-to-face setting. However, due to the continued challenge of the pandemic, includ/i.rightng prevail/i.rightng government guidel/i.rightnes on non-essential travel and public gatherings at the time, the Company's AGM on 12 May 2021 was held as a combined physical and electronic meeting. Shareholders were not permitted physical entry into the AGM venue.\n\nShareholders were able to attend the AGM electronically via a live web-portal. The meeting format ensured that shareholders could engage with the Board regarding the Company's recent performance and strategic prior/i.rightties, while also protecting the health and safety of our shareholders, colleagues and other stakeholders. With/i.rightn this portal, shareholders were able to view a live video feed of the AGM, submit voting instruct/i.rightons and questions in writ/i.rightng or ask them through an audio line.\n\n## Engagement with clients and suppliers\n\nClients are central to everything we do in the Group and the Board recognises the importance of promoting productive, sustainable relationsh/i.rightps with them. Prior to the pandemic, a large proportion of key customer engagements were built into Board and director vis/i.rightts to the Group's markets. Continued lim/i.righttations on internat/i.rightonal travel meant that our usual approach could not be carried out during 2021. Instead, certain Board members engaged with clients virtually to keep abreast of developing client trends,\n\nexperiences and needs. In addit/i.righton, updates on clients' ins/i.rightghts formed part of deep dives into product segment strategy at Board meetings. Suppliers provide effic/i.rightent and sustainable goods and services for our business and certain members of the Board also virtually engaged with them during the year. Detail on how the Group more generally engaged with clients and suppliers can be found on pages 51, 52 and 54 of the Strategic report.\n\n## Engagement with regulators and governments\n\nThe Board, either collectively or ind/i.rightvidually, engages with relevant authorit/i.rightes both in the UK and across our footprint on a regular basis. During 2021 this took place via a number of virtual forums. Topics varied, includ/i.rightng recovery from the pandemic, internat/i.rightonal trade, climate-related matters, cyber security and dig/i.righttal and technological developments.\n\nCertain regulators attended Board meetings during the year, which provided the opportunity to discuss key items and developments. Further detail on how the Group engaged with regulators and governments more generally can be found on pages 52 and 53 of the Strategic report.\n\n## Engagement with society\n\nThe Board receives regular updates from management concerning the communit/i.rightes and environment in which we operate. This year the Board reviewed, discussed, and approved the Group's pathway to net zero. As part of this decis/i.righton the Board took into account the potential impact of the pathway on civ/i.rightl society, includ/i.rightng those from nongovernmental organisat/i.rightons, as well as other stakeholder groups. Further detail can be found regarding the Board's princ/i.rightpal decis/i.righton on page 66 of the Strategic report.\n\nDue to continued travel restrict/i.rightons in place throughout most of 2021, the Board was unable to vis/i.rightt many of the Group's markets. As such, external and internal speakers provided input to the Board's discuss/i.righton throughout the year, which covered some key societal issues such as climate-related matters, the evolving geopolit/i.rightcal landscape in certain markets, and the impact of the pandemic on the health and wellbeing of the communit/i.rightes in which the Group operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nQuestions received from shareholders covered a diverse range of matters, includ/i.rightng climate/environmental issues, geopolit/i.rightcal developments, strategy, shareholder engagement and share price. All proposed resolutions were passed, with shareholder support for each ranging from 95.22 per cent to 99.97 per cent.\n\nShareholder uptake for the AGM was low in comparison to our last purely physical AGM in 2019; however, the Board received posit/i.rightve feedback regarding the web-portal functional/i.rightty.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe results of the voting at the 2021 AGM can be viewed at sc.com/investors\n\nA summary of responses to questions on key themes was made available on our website to shareholders after the meeting and can be found at sc.com/agm\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Engagement with employees\n\nThe Board values the opportunity to engage with our workforce. It is acutely aware of the importance of possessing a comprehensive understanding of issues that are important to colleagues in each market, learning more about the on-the-ground realit/i.rightes of working at Standard Chartered, hearing about what is working well and understanding the challenges that need to be addressed.\n\nThe Board also recognises the role it has in upholding a genuine and transparent two-way dialogue with the workforce. As it is dist/i.rightnct to the role of management, and composed of diverse members with ind/i.rightvidual voices, it is uniquely placed to oversee, guide, support and, where necessary, challenge the Management Team in implement/i.rightng the Bank's strategy. This dist/i.rightnction was a key point communicated by Board members to colleagues as part of engagement throughout 2021.\n\nSim/i.rightlar to last year, the Board continued to adopt an alternative approach to the workforce engagement methods set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The primary reason for taking a different approach was that, as a global organisat/i.righton with more than 88,000 colleagues across 59 diverse markets, it is vital that any Board engagement should gather unfiltered feedback which is representative of the whole workforce in order to be truly effective.\n\nThe Board took every opportunity to engage with employees, either collectively or ind/i.rightvidually during the year, in order to gain a true understanding of their views, ideas and concerns. As with other forms of stakeholder interact/i.righton this year and last year, tradit/i.rightonal forms of employee engagement were adapted in light of the pandemic.\n\n## Board engagement sessions with employees\n\n## Africa and Middle East\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Africa cluster\n\n## 30 November 2021\n\nAngola, Botswana, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Maurit/i.rightus, Niger/i.righta, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe\n\nPartic/i.rightpating Board members: Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, Maria Ramos and David Conner\n\n## Europe and the Americas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Asia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## EA markets\n\n## 15 July 2021\n\nEurope and the Americas\n\nPartic/i.rightpating Board members: Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, Phil Rivett and Gay Huey Evans\n\n## India and South Asia\n\n## 24 November 2021\n\nIndia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka\n\nPartic/i.rightpating Board members: Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, Christ/i.rightne Hodgson and Naguib Kheraj\n\n## Asia cluster\n\n## 12 July 2021\n\nAustralia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Phil/i.rightppines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam\n\nPartic/i.rightpating Board members: Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, Jasmine\n\nWhitbread and Naguib Kheraj\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe events were facil/i.righttated through a videoconference with a live Q&A session accessed via a web-based platform.

The composit/i.righton of the INEDs who attended was carefully considered in order to ensure a good balance of skills, experience, knowledge and perspectives for each geographical group, promoting ins/i.rightghtful and tailored engagement.\n\n## Review of employee engagement\n\nChanges to the framework of formal Board engagement with colleagues was enhanced during the year, based on Board and employee feedback and experience in 2020. These changes included using video technology (rather than audio-only) so that colleagues could see Board members, using a moderator outside of management to help ensure the questions were asked in an authentic and unfiltered way, and breaking up four regions into six more granular geographical groups to enable closer discuss/i.righton of local topics.\n\nThe Board was encouraged by the level of interest employees had shown in engaging directly with Board members and remains committed to evolving and refin/i.rightng this form of engagement to ensure they remain genuine, authentic interact/i.rightons.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther detail regarding employee engagement this year can be found with/i.rightn the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee report starting on page 131\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## MENAP markets\n\n## 23 November 2021\n\nMiddle East, North Africa and Pakistan\n\nPartic/i.rightpating Board members: Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, Maria Ramos and Byron Grote\n\n## GCNA markets\n\n## 28 September 2021\n\nChina, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Macau, Taiwan\n\nPartic/i.rightpating Board members: Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als, Carlson Tong and David Tang",

Sim/i.rightlar to 2020, the Board's abil/i.rightty to physically meet with people from across the Group's footprint remained lim/i.rightted. Despite this, the Group Chairman and INEDs engaged with the Group's subsid/i.rightaries through a number of forums. This included chair and committee chair engagement sessions, as well as other forms of interact/i.righton.\n\nThe Group Chairman hosted three subsid/i.rightary chair engagement sessions during 2021, all held virtually. Each event opened with remarks from the Group Chairman, followed by a Q&A session, with Bill Winters jo/i.rightning one of the sessions. The Group Chairman was encouraged by the high level of interact/i.righton and sharing of best practices by our subsid/i.rightary chairs. Items discussed across the three sessions included:\n\n- \u00b7 Group performance and strategy\n- \u00b7 sustainab/i.rightlity and the Group's net zero pathway\n- \u00b7 Resolution Framework\n- \u00b7 areas of focus for the Group's boards\n- \u00b7 Board effectiveness\n- \u00b7 governance best practice.\n\nThe Audit Committee held its annual conference call during the year, which was hosted by the Audit Committee Chair and attended by the chairs of subsid/i.rightary audit committees. The Group Chairman; Group Head, Central Finance; Group Financ/i.rightal Controller; Group Head of Internal Audit; Global Head, Audit, Quality Assurance; Group Head, Conduct, Financ/i.rightal Crime and Compliance; members of the Group's statutory auditor, EY, includ/i.rightng the lead audit partner; and the Group Company Secretary also partic/i.rightpated in the call.

Items discussed during the call included:\n\n- \u00b7 2021 Board Risk Committee and Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee focus areas\n- \u00b7 Group Chief Risk Officer's 2021 prior/i.rightties\n- \u00b7 financ/i.rightal crime compliance 2021 prior/i.rightties.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee Chair held a conference call attended by the subsid/i.rightary remuneration committee chairs and the chairs of subsid/i.rightary boards that have remuneration responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes. The Group Chairman; members of the Remuneration Committee; the Global Head, Performance, Reward & Employee Relations; Head, Executive Compensation and Reward Governance; regional heads of Performance, Reward & Benefits; and the Group Company Secretary also partic/i.rightpated in the call. These annual calls are important as remuneration governance continues to be under the spotlight as the regulatory landscape evolves across our markets. The calls also foster knowledge sharing and best practice between the PLC Remuneration Committee and the subsid/i.rightary remuneration committees and raise awareness as remuneration committees are increas/i.rightngly expected to have oversight over the approach to remuneration for the wider workforce. The topics that were discussed included:\n\n- \u00b7 2021 Remuneration Committee focus areas\n- \u00b7 2021 to 2022 Performance, Reward and Benefits prior/i.rightties\n- \u00b7 continu/i.rightng to monitor the long-term impact of the pandemic\n- \u00b7 renewing the directors' remuneration policy, which will be subject to a shareholder vote at the AGM in May 2022\n- \u00b7 the impact of regulatory changes on remuneration\n- \u00b7 our refreshed approach to performance management\n- \u00b7 ensuring progress with ongoing performance and reward in/i.righttiat/i.rightves (for example embedding of the Fair Pay Charter, Wellbeing, Benefits Transformation).\n\nOther activ/i.rightties which took place during 2021 to further strengthen the linkages across the Group included:\n\n- \u00b7 the Group Chairman attended a number of subsid/i.rightary board meetings includ/i.rightng banking subsid/i.rightaries in Hong Kong, Singapore, Pakistan, Kenya and Malaysia\n- \u00b7 the Group Chairman attended the East Africa Cluster Board Forum and the Southern Africa Cluster Board Forum\n- \u00b7 the Chairs of the Group Audit Committee and the Board Risk Committee attended some of the subsid/i.rightary audit and risk committee meetings and some of the subsid/i.rightary audit and risk committee Chairs attended a meeting of the respective Group Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther detail regarding how the Group engages with its stakeholders can be found on pages 50 to 77",

This has comprised review/i.rightng and challenging credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons, includ/i.rightng overlays to deal with the impact of COVID-19, key accounting issues and sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements made by management, to ensure they are suffic/i.rightent, appropriate and that the Group's public disclosures in regard to this are transparent. The Committee reviewed and considered judgemental post model adjustments (PMAs) and management overlays in both the wholesale and retail portfolios on a quarterly basis, required in order to estimate expected credit loss (ECL), intended to take into account the impacts of COVID-19. Focus has also been placed on accounting treatment and value in use (VIU) of the Group's equity accounted investment in China Bohai Bank.\n\nCognisant of the ever-increas/i.rightng importance of data, the Committee has kept a close watch on the Group's approach to data management, the challenges in place and action plans to address these. Towards the end of 2021, the Committee held a deep dive discuss/i.righton into data management. The Committee recognised the pace of regulatory change pertain/i.rightng to this and probed into how the businesses and functions are prior/i.righttis/i.rightng their data management action plans and the governance in place to manage this. Data management will remain an area of focus for the Committee and the Board in 2022 and beyond.\n\nIn mid-2021, with the renaming of the Brand, Values and Conduct Committee to the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee (CSC), Conduct Risk was transferred to this Committee. Cognisant of the overarching nature of this risk, the Committee discussed the progress made during 2021 to bring together the new Conduct Risk management approach, areas of emerging risk and the roadmap for 2022. The Financ/i.rightal Conduct Authority's (FCA) consultation on a new Consumer Duty was discussed and this will feature in the Committee's deliberat/i.rightons in 2022.\n\nFollowing on from 2020, the Committee has been receiv/i.rightng regular updates from management and EY on the work under way to improve the Group's Information Technology (IT) access controls and remediate weaknesses ident/i.rightfied during prior year audits. The Committee has been monitor/i.rightng the progress being made on this, given its importance in protecting the Group's systems security. This will be a continued prior/i.rightty for 2022.\n\nThis is EY's second year as the Group's Statutory Auditor and it has been useful to have input from regional and special/i.rightst partners on the Committee's agenda. By way of example, discuss/i.rightons on regional/ country overviews, the Group's IT access controls and tax have all benefitted from EY partner input. EY continues to provide fresh perspective, independent challenge and subject matter expertise to the Committee's deliberat/i.rightons.\n\nThe Committee has exercised its authority delegated by the Board for ensuring the integr/i.rightty of the Group's published financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton by discuss/i.rightng and challenging the judgements and disclosures made by management, and the assumptions and estimates on which they are based. The Committee has exercised judgement in decid/i.rightng which of the issues it considered to be sign/i.rightficant in the financ/i.rightal statements, and this report sets out the material matters that it has considered in these deliberat/i.rightons. Management reporting to the Committee from across the business, functions and the Group's network has provided the opportunity for the Committee to challenge, probe, discuss and seek assurance from management, enabling the Committee to provide an independent perspective.\n\nAs a result of the Committee's work in 2021, assurance has been provided to the Board on the quality and appropriateness of the Group's financ/i.rightal reporting, in particular taking account of COVID-19 impacts, and on internal audit, compliance and regulatory matters, to continue to safeguard the interests of the Group's broader stakeholders.\n\nThe following pages provide ins/i.rightght and context into the Committee's work and activ/i.rightties during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Phil Rivett\n\nChair of the Audit Committee",

The overviews also provided ins/i.rightght into local regulatory developments, the Group's standing and engagement with local regulators and areas of focus for 2021. These EY regional partner overviews will continue in 2022 and beyond\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal regulatory reporting: Received and discussed updates on the Group's financ/i.rightal regulatory reporting remediat/i.righton programme.

A sub-committee was formed to final/i.rightse oversight of the Group's written response to the BEIS consultation paper\n- \u00b7 Data management: Received and discussed papers on the Group's Data Management Framework, following on from discuss/i.rightons held in 2020.

In Group markets where COVID-19 impacts were felt more heavily during the year, such as the Delta variant impact on India from May 2021, GIA focused, as required, on the revised approach that had been adopted during 2020, util/i.rightsing short, sharp reviews to provide timely opin/i.rightons on the Group, incorporating agile princ/i.rightples into ways of working. The Committee was updated with these required changes in a timely manner. This enabled the Committee to be provided with assurance that the Group's response to and operations during COVID-19 remained appropriate for our shareholders, customers and colleagues and aligned to the Group's Here for good brand promise. The Committee sought and received assurance from management that this agile approach was adding value to the business, continued to focus on the effectiveness of controls and processes, and factored in emerging risks.\n\nThe Committee also monitored, on an ongoing basis, that travel restrict/i.rightons and WFH arrangements were not impact/i.rightng the quality or integr/i.rightty of audit work or the internal controls infrastructure of the Group.\n\nIn 2019, an external assessor, Grant Thornton (selected by the Committee from a competit/i.rightve request for proposal process), conducted an external quality assurance review on the GIA function, which assessed the requirements of GIA against key professional and regulatory bodies governing the practice of internal audit. While it was recognised that GIA 'generally conforms' to the requirements of these standards, some recommendations were made. During the course of 2020, the Committee received updates on progress against these recommendations and in 2021 it noted that all actions were closed with no further addit/i.rightonal work required.\n\nIn 2021, for the most sign/i.rightficant matters ident/i.rightfied by GIA, business and/or regional management were inv/i.rightted to attend Committee meetings to provide updates on the steps being taken to enhance the control environment and address internal audit find/i.rightngs.\n\nThe Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewed the adequacy of resourcing and proposed work plans for GIA and is satisf/i.righted that these are appropriate in light of proposed areas of focus, expertise and skills that are required\n- \u00b7 assessed the role and effectiveness of the GIA function, and reviewed and monitored GIA's progress against the 2021 Audit Plan and the review and monitor/i.rightng of post-audit actions. Changes to the Audit Plan, in particular COVID-19-related changes, and people changes, were also discussed by the Committee\n- \u00b7 reviewed and approved GIA's 2022 Audit Plan and budget\n- \u00b7 reviewed and approved the refreshed GIA Charter\n- \u00b7 received and discussed reports from the Global Head, Audit Quality Assurance (QA) on the QA function's view of the control environment in GIA\n- \u00b7 scrutin/i.rightsed any long overdue GIA issues and requested management to develop risk reduction plans for items with long closure periods to be monitored by GIA.\n\nThe Committee is satisf/i.righted with the independence of the GIA function.\n\nOver the course of the year, Phil Rivett met regularly with the Group Head of Internal Audit and the GIA Management Team. Phil Rivett will engage with the incom/i.rightng Group Head of Internal Audit, due to take up the role as Group Head of Internal Audit with effect from 1 April 2022.\n\nRegular compliance reporting to the Committee sets out the work carried out by the CFCC function, sign/i.rightficant compliance and regulatory risks and issues facing the Group, and key actions being taken to address and mit/i.rightgate these matters.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee was updated on and discussed:\n\n- \u00b7 key supervisory areas of focus, regulatory updates and forward-looking themes, the status of the Group's core college regulatory relationsh/i.rightps and enforcement matters\n- \u00b7 the importance of continu/i.rightng to strengthen the Group's risk culture\n- \u00b7 the function's operating model, includ/i.rightng an overview of the CFCC budget and organisat/i.rightonal changes to simpl/i.rightfy the function. In conjunct/i.righton with the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, the Committee has discussed the Group's Risk and CFCC Productiv/i.rightty Programme, and the Financ/i.rightal Crime Surveillance Operations (FCSO) Transformation\n- \u00b7 conduct, with a focus on WFH arrangements and the risk and control environment in place in response to COVID-19\n- \u00b7 updates from CFCC Assurance.\n\nThe Committee reviewed a paper on compliance resourcing and confirmat/i.righton was received from management that the function is adequately resourced and that a close watch was being kept on this, given the buoyant external hir/i.rightng market in some of the Group's territor/i.rightes.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the 2022 Compliance Plan, budget and prior/i.rightties.\n\nPhil Rivett met regularly throughout the year with the Group Head, CFCC.\n\nThe Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee received reports on financ/i.rightal crime compliance-related matters.",

The Committee discussed the linkages between Speaking Up and data with/i.rightn the Group's My Voice (employee engagement survey) results and the focus areas for 2022.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee Chair received updates on Speak Up issues and inc/i.rightdents as necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on Speaking Up can be found on page 72\n\nTypically, the Committee meets with the PRA on an annual basis, without members of management being present. The purpose of such meetings is to enable a discuss/i.righton between the Committee and the PRA concerning areas of focus for both the Committee and the PRA. This meeting did not occur in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrict/i.rightons; however, it is antic/i.rightpated that this will resume once things return to normality.\n\nPhil Rivett attended trilateral meetings with EY and the PRA over the course of the year and also met with the PRA in his capacity as Audit Committee Chair.\n\nThere are strong linkages and interact/i.rightons in place between the Committee, regional hub audit committees and banking subsid/i.rightary audit committees. In 2021, Phil Rivett attended a Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Lim/i.rightted (SCB Hong Kong) audit committee meeting and a Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Lim/i.rightted (SCB Singapore) audit committee meeting. The audit committee chair of SCB Hong Kong and SCB Singapore respectively attended one Standard Chartered PLC Audit Committee meeting.

It reviews the Group's Risk Appetite Statement and Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) and makes recommendations to the Board. Its responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes also include review/i.rightng the appropriateness and effectiveness of the Group's risk management systems, consider/i.rightng the impl/i.rightcations of material regulatory change proposals, review/i.rightng reports on princ/i.rightpal risks, includ/i.rightng Climate Risk, to the Group's business, and ensuring effective due dil/i.rightgence on material acquis/i.righttions and disposals.\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nI am pleased to present the Board Risk Committee's report for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe Committee was again very active this year and engaged across a wide range of risk management issues. From a regulatory perspective, the Committee has held a number of discuss/i.rightons on important topics. These included the Bank of England's (BoE) Resolvabil/i.rightty Assessment Framework, the Climate Bienn/i.rightal Exploratory Scenario (CBES) stress test, operational resil/i.rightence includ/i.rightng Important Business Services and Impact Tolerance Statements, the BoE Solvency stress test and the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transit/i.righton.\n\nIn particular, the Committee invested time and focus to review, discuss, probe and challenge the Group's Resolvabil/i.rightty Assessment Report, includ/i.rightng the key assumptions made by management, ahead of the Board-approved submiss/i.righton to the BoE in October 2021. Resolvabil/i.rightty will remain a key area of focus, scrutiny and discuss/i.righton for the Committee and the Board throughout 2022.\n\nSim/i.rightlarly, the Committee reviewed, discussed and challenged the CBES submiss/i.righton to the BoE. As a result of this, the Committee requested management to consider how the outcomes from this useful exercise can be leveraged further by the Group and incorporated into exist/i.rightng risk management and stress testing processes, which management has taken onboard. Climate Risk remains an important area of focus for the Committee and the Group more broadly.\n\nICS remained a key prior/i.rightty in 2021, with continued reporting from management in the first, second and third lines of defence. The ICS Board Risk Appetite metrics have been pivotal this year in enabling the Committee to track the progress being made and delve deeper into areas that require continued focus. ICS remains an ongoing prior/i.rightty for the Committee.\n\nThere has been a good level of representation from the businesses and functions at Committee meetings, and also from a regional and country level, which has enabled the Committee to explore how risks are being managed on the ground in this ever-changing environment. In particular, the risks associated with working from home (WFH) have been assessed in a number of different areas, given the impacts of COVID-19 and also the Group's transit/i.righton to a hybrid working model.\n\nThe Committee met virtually throughout 2021, due to COVID-19 restrict/i.rightons; however, regular meetings and careful review of all agendas and papers have ensured that the Committee has been able to focus on the right areas and mainta/i.rightn engagement in the virtual environment. Outside of Committee meetings, I held regular calls with the Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO), a wide range of other members of the Risk function, and the senior management of the Group, to ensure that I was kept abreast of key risks and emerging developments as they occurred, which in turn, ensured that Committee members were notif/i.righted of sign/i.rightficant events in a timely manner.\n\nIn March 2021, we held a blue sky think/i.rightng/horizon scanning session, which considered the potential risks that the Group might be or could become exposed to. This session informed our forward-looking agenda and resulted in the Committee review/i.rightng papers and holding deeper discuss/i.rightons involv/i.rightng key markets such as: China, includ/i.rightng the outlook for the Chinese banking sector and challenges faced; operational stabil/i.rightty issues and remediat/i.righton under way in Hong Kong; and Korea, includ/i.rightng the Group's mortgage portfolio. All of these discuss/i.rightons focused on the controls in place to manage the key risks and impacts aris/i.rightng from COVID-19. We also covered matters such as Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk, Interest Rate Risk includ/i.rightng the Group's structural hedging programme, Exchange Rate Risk and Credit Fraud Risk. We have just held our 2022 blue sky think/i.rightng/horizon scanning session, which will assist in prior/i.righttis/i.rightng our 2022 agenda.\n\nIn 2021, the Committee held informal sessions covering Model Risk and x-valuation adjustment (XVA). These brief/i.rightng sessions were opened up to all Board members, and provided dedicated time and space to engage on these topics in a more informal setting.\n\nCognisant of the rapidly evolving external environment, the Committee continues to discuss key macroeconomic and geopolit/i.rightcal risks and challenges faced by the Group, and assess how these are being managed and mit/i.rightgated by management.\n\nThe following pages provide ins/i.rightght and context into the Committee's work and activ/i.rightties during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Naguib Kheraj\n\nChair of the Board Risk Committee",

All breaches would continue to be reported to the Committee in line with the current approach, in order that the Committee and Board continue to have vis/i.rightbil/i.rightty of this\n- \u00b7 Integration of new categories of risks: Considerat/i.righton was given to specif/i.rightc parameters for Climate, Dig/i.righttal Asset and Third-Party risks , and addit/i.rightonal metrics for Technology & Innovation. Discuss/i.righton is under way on the inclus/i.righton of Dig/i.righttal Asset related metrics.\n\nMonitored actual exposures relative to Risk Appetite lim/i.rightts using regular Board Risk Information reports.

        "page_content": "## Risk informat/i.righton provided to the Committee\n\nThe Committee is authorised to invest/i.rightgate or seek any informat/i.righton relating to an activ/i.rightty with/i.rightn its terms of reference, receives regular reports on risk management, and tracks a wide range of risk metrics through a Board Risk Information report. This report provides an overview of the Group's risk profile against the Group's Risk Appetite Statement. The GCRO's report covers the macroeconomic environment, geopolit/i.rightcal outlook, material disclosures and ongoing risks. Coverage of Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types and regulatory matters are also included in this report. Regular updates on COVID-19 impacts, country risk and geopolit/i.rightcal tensions have been reported on and discussed throughout the year.\n\nThe Committee has the authority to request and receive relevant informat/i.righton consistent with the requirements of BCBS 239 that will allow the Committee to fulfil its governance mandate relating to risks to which the Group is exposed, and alert senior management when risk reports do not meet its requirements.\n\n## Risk management disclosures\n\nThe Committee has reviewed the risk disclosures in the Annual Report and the Half Year Report, and has also reviewed the disclosures regarding the work of the Committee.\n\n## Interaction with the Group Chief Risk Officer\n\nThe Committee Chair meets ind/i.rightvidually with the GCRO regularly in between formal Committee meetings. These meetings allow open discuss/i.righton of any matters relating to issues aris/i.rightng from the Committee's formal discuss/i.rightons and inform the forward-looking agenda.\n\n## Interaction with management\n\nThe Committee is mindful of the need to hold management directly accountable when issues have arisen and have been reported by the GCRO. Senior management has attended Committee meetings for deeper discuss/i.rightons in such instances. The Committee Chair also meets ind/i.rightvidually with senior leaders of the Risk function.\n\n## Interaction with regulators\n\nTypically, the Committee meets with the PRA on an annual basis, without members of management being present. The purpose of such meetings is to enable a discuss/i.righton between the Committee and the PRA concerning prudential-focused topics. This meeting did not occur in 2021 due to COVID-19 restrict/i.rightons; however, it is antic/i.rightpated that this will resume once things return to normality.\n\nNaguib Kheraj attended calls with the PRA and the BoE over the course of the year.\n\n## Interaction between Board committees on risk-related issues\n\nIn the few instances where it does not have primary oversight for a given type of risk, the Committee interacts closely with other Board Committees where the remit of these other Committees clearly covers risk-related matters. For example, the Audit Committee has oversight of the Group's internal financ/i.rightal controls and regulatory compliance; the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee has oversight of the responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes in relation to financ/i.rightal crime compliancerelated matters; and the CSC has oversight of culture and sustainab/i.rightlity-related matters. The interact/i.righton assists the Committee in ensuring that it is well informed on discuss/i.rightons held, and the close collaboration of the Committee Chairs helps to ensure that there are no gaps and any potential for unnecessary duplicat/i.righton is avoided.\n\n## Risk function resourcing\n\nThe Committee has sought and received assurance that the Risk function is adequately resourced to perform its function effectively. The Committee reviewed and discussed a paper setting out an overview of the changes to the Risk function in 2021, management's assessment of the adequacy of people resources and the forward-looking view of the Risk function.\n\n## Linkages with subsid/i.rightary board risk committees\n\nIn conjunct/i.righton with the Chair of the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, Naguib Kheraj co-hosted an annual video-conference call with the chairs of subsid/i.rightary board risk committees and INEDs in July 2021. Naguib Kheraj also attended a board risk committee of Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Lim/i.rightted as an observer. The board risk committee chairs of our subsid/i.rightaries in China, Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore attended a number of Standard Chartered PLC Board Risk Committee discuss/i.rightons on matters such as resolvabil/i.rightty and Hong Kong operational stabil/i.rightty. The chair of Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore) Lim/i.rightted attended one Standard Chartered PLC Board Risk Committee meeting as an observer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of this call can be found on page 115",

This evolution resulted in a change of name to the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee, the Committee's remit now represents the Group's heightened focus on deliver/i.rightng sustainab/i.rightlity as a strategic prior/i.rightty.\n\nThe Committee will monitor the development and implementat/i.righton of the framework to align financ/i.rightal services with net zero emiss/i.rightons by 2050 and will oversee the Group's progress to deliver on intermed/i.rightate targets. The Committee will keep under review the Group's overall sustainab/i.rightlity strategy based on the three pillars of the sustainab/i.rightlity framework: Business, Operations and Communit/i.rightes, and will assess progress against the Group's externally committed targets, sustainab/i.rightlity aspirat/i.rightons and delivery against key sustainab/i.rightlity prior/i.rightties.\n\nWhile the Committee has retained its oversight of the Group's culture, includ/i.rightng values, divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton and employee engagement and workforce polic/i.rightes; oversight of brand posit/i.rightoning now sits with/i.rightn the remit of the Management Team. The Audit Committee has taken responsib/i.rightlity for Conduct Risk.\n\nThe latest chapter of the Group's transformation agenda includes a focus on becoming truly purpose-led, by defin/i.rightng three Stands of focus: Accelerating Zero (the Climate Stand), Lift/i.rightng Partic/i.rightpation (the Equality Stand) and Resetting Globalisat/i.righton (the Globalisat/i.righton Stand). The Stands are not an add-on or separate from the strategy, but instead are aligned and executed through the strategy and business prior/i.rightties. During the year, the Committee reviewed and supported the Management Team's proposals on how the Stands would be embedded across the organisat/i.righton and will continue to monitor the progress of leaders in deliver/i.rightng on the Stands.\n\nThis year, the Committee organised an addit/i.rightonal session to focus on climate change. This session provided Committee members the opportunity to gain further ins/i.rightght into the global challenges faced in achiev/i.rightng net zero and, in particular, the challenges faced by the Group given its unique footprint across emerging markets. To achieve success will mean sign/i.rightficant change for all and the Committee will have a key role to play in supporting delivery of the Group's targets as well as monitor/i.rightng progress of cultural change across the organisat/i.righton in order to achieve this target.\n\nThe Committee oversees the Group's commitment to upholding human rights and this year reflected on how the Group should respond to human rights issues in jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons across our footprint. The Committee hosted a session on ethics and ethical decis/i.righton-making that was delivered by a pre-eminent industry expert in this field. All Board directors were inv/i.rightted to attend this thought-provoking session.\n\nThe Committee continued to focus on the Group's culture and its divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton in/i.righttiat/i.rightves, and I am pleased to report that the Group has achieved its commitment to the UK HM Treasury Women in Finance Charter with over 30 per cent women in senior leadership roles. The Group has, this year, further expanded its commitment to increas/i.rightng representation of underrepresented groups in senior leadership roles and the Committee will continue to monitor the delivery and outcomes of these in/i.righttiat/i.rightves.\n\nDuring the year, we agreed that the Group must ensure all generations of colleagues are fully engaged, motivated and supported during pivotal life stages in order to fully contribute to the success of the organisat/i.righton. As such, the Committee supported the launch of a new in/i.righttiat/i.rightve that addresses generational divers/i.rightty in order to increase the retention and development of older colleagues as well as to become an employer of choice for younger generations.\n\nThe Committee also reflected on the inclus/i.rightve leadership in/i.righttiat/i.rightve which empowers employees to challenge cognit/i.rightve bias to enable such biases to be raised and addressed. The Committee was encouraged to see such management in/i.righttiat/i.rightves that will ensure that the Group's culture continues to evolve to support delivery of strategic prior/i.rightties.\n\nThe following report provides further ins/i.rightght into the Committee's work during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Jasmine Whitbread\n\nChair of the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee",

This provided committee members with the opportunity to gain further ins/i.rightght into the global challenges faced in achiev/i.rightng net zero and, in particular, the challenges faced by the Group given its unique footprint across emerging markets\n- \u00b7 The Committee hosted a session on ethics and ethical decis/i.righton-making that was delivered by a pre-eminent industry expert in this field. All Board directors were inv/i.rightted to this session. In addit/i.righton, a number of speakers are also being lined up for 2022 and beyond\n- \u00b7 As a result of the Committee's revised remit, responsib/i.rightlity for Conduct and the conduct dashboard were transferred to the Audit Committee.

As part of the Committee's succession planning for the Board, it takes into account the Group's strategy and challenges, and makes recommendations to the Board in respect of any adjustments to the Board's composit/i.righton.\n\nThe Committee also: keeps under review the leadership needs of, and succession plans for, the Group in relation to both executive directors and other senior executives; has oversight of the process by which the Board, its committees and ind/i.rightvidual directors assess their effectiveness; keeps the divers/i.rightty of the Board under review and monitors progress towards achiev/i.rightng its object/i.rightves in this area; considers any potential situat/i.rightonal conflicts of interest declared by Board members; considers the impact of material changes to corporate governance regulation and legislat/i.righton affecting the Group; and has oversight of the Group's approach to subsid/i.rightary corporate governance.\n\nThe Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nDuring the year, the Committee has been focused on the medium to long-term composit/i.righton of the Board, cognisant that a number of the Board's independent non-executive directors (INEDs) will be reaching their nine-year tenure over the course of the next few years. At the beginn/i.rightng of the year, we carried out a comprehensive formal assessment of search firms that could assist the Committee in undertaking this next phase of the Board's succession planning. This process resulted in the appointment of Russell Reynolds to assist us in ident/i.rightfying candidates with a diverse range of skills, experience, backgrounds, gender and capabil/i.rightties to enhance the Board's effective oversight of the strategy.\n\nMaria Ramos jo/i.rightned the Board at the start of January 2021, and has extensive CEO, banking, commercial, financ/i.rightal, policy and internat/i.rightonal experience. Maria's induct/i.righton onto the Board and the Board Risk and Audit committees, although conducted almost entirely virtually, remained robust and effective and Maria is adding sign/i.rightficant value to the Board and committee discuss/i.rightons. Further ins/i.rightght into Maria's induct/i.righton programme can be found on pages 106 and 107.\n\nIn light of Naguib Kheraj's decis/i.righton to step down from the Audit and Remuneration committees in the summer, we undertook a refresh of the committees' membership and recommended the appointment of Maria to the Remuneration Committee. In addit/i.righton to the sign/i.rightficant focus on Board and committee succession planning we also spent a great deal of time discuss/i.rightng succession readiness and plans for the executive directors, the Management Team and other key senior executives, as well as programmes under way to develop talent internally. Despite the number of roles which have recently been filled externally, we looked at and assured ourselves that all key roles have credible succession plans with suitable flexib/i.rightlity for the immed/i.rightate to longer term.\n\nDetail of the Committee's annual review of the Board Divers/i.rightty Policy and its assessment of progress against it can be found on pages 135 and 136. Following the realignment of the Policy last year, no further changes were recommended in 2021; however, we did discuss the importance of further balancing female representation on the Board and the Financ/i.rightal Conduct Authority's (FCA) consultation on changes to the List/i.rightng Rules in this area and agreed to keep our current target under review.\n\nAs part of the Committee's governance oversight role, we continued to receive updates from the three regional CEOs who each have responsib/i.rightlity for the subsid/i.rightary governance processes across their regions, and provide a holist/i.rightc view of the governance framework and challenges faced across the Group's footprint. The Committee also spent time review/i.rightng the governance structures around the growing SC Ventures entit/i.rightes.\n\nOnce again the Committee oversaw progress made in meeting the actions recommended in last year's internally conducted Board effectiveness review and agreed the approach for another internally run evaluation this year. Details of both are set out on page 108. We also spent time discuss/i.rightng the progress the Committee has made against those actions highl/i.rightghted in its own effectiveness review. A summary of those reflections and of this year's Committee effectiveness review and actions for 2022 can be found on page 137.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDr Jos\u00e9 Vi\u00f1als\n\nChair of the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee",

We strive to mainta/i.rightn a diverse Board, recognis/i.rightng the benefits of having a Board made up of ind/i.rightviduals with a diverse mix of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, knowledge, personal attributes, skills and experience. We also aim to reflect the Group's aspirat/i.rightons in relation to its employees and its values and to posit/i.righton the Group as a global leader in these areas. This divers/i.rightty provides a range of perspectives which we believe contribute to the effective Board dynamics.\n\nWhile posit/i.rightve progress has been made in improv/i.rightng the balance of female directors on the Board in recent years, female representation on the Board remains just below the current industry target of 33 per cent. We are cognisant of the growing pressure on boards to set longer-term and more ambit/i.rightous gender aspirat/i.rightons, includ/i.rightng moving towards 40/uni00A0per cent female representation or gender parity and as a Committee we spent time discuss/i.rightng the FCA's consultation on changes to the List/i.rightng Rules in this area. While acknowledging the importance of gender divers/i.rightty around the board table and ultimately gender parity on the Board, we also recognise the importance of balancing gender divers/i.rightty with/i.rightn the broader context of divers/i.rightty, which is particularly relevant given the Group's diverse geographical representation. While we remain committed to do more to increase the gender divers/i.rightty on the Board, the Committee took the decis/i.righton not to raise its target in this area above the current 33 per cent, pending the outcome of ongoing external consultations and to ensure progress is sustainable.",

        "page_content": "## Committee effectiveness review\n\nAs part of the 2021 internal Board evaluation, a review of the Committee was conducted. Broadly, members felt that the Committee had made good progress in a number of areas this year, highl/i.rightghting progress with executive and non-executive succession plans, more thorough reviews of induct/i.righton plans and oversight of progress, and a more systematic review and tracking of Board and Committee effectiveness review action plans. A summary of the key observations and the subsequent recommendations can be found below.\n\nProgress against the actions set out in the Committee's 2021 Action Plan has been posit/i.rightve; a summary of the progress against each of the actions is set out below.\n\n## Progress against the 2021 Action Plan:\n\n- \u00b7 Continued to enhance and tailor the Board induct/i.righton programme for new Board and Committee members, provid/i.rightng greater oversight of progress. Mainta/i.rightned a sign/i.rightficant programme of ongoing train/i.rightng for directors during the year\n- \u00b7 While effort was made during the year to continue build/i.rightng in time with/i.rightn the Board calendar for members to meet internal high-potential ind/i.rightviduals in person, continued COVID-19 restrict/i.rightons impacted Committee members' abil/i.rightty to reach as many across the business as they had hoped. Despite this, many of the ind/i.rightviduals continued to have exposure to the Board through presentations to the Board and its committees. In person contact will resume once vis/i.rightts to markets allow for interact/i.righton and more informal sessions\n- \u00b7 As part of the Committee's succession planning process, provided oversight of an external market mapping of candidates for key management roles\n- \u00b7 Refreshed the Board skills matrix, to assist the succession planning process, giv/i.rightng particular focus to the succession plans for the Chairs of the Board committees\n\n## Key observations from the 2021 internal effectiveness review\n\nThe feedback from the 2021 internally conducted Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee effectiveness review was broadly posit/i.rightve. The overall feeling was that good progress had been made in many areas, includ/i.rightng succession for key executive roles and plans for non-executive succession, oversight and progress against induct/i.righton plans, and a more systematic review and tracking of Board and committee effectiveness review action plans. Some of the key find/i.rightngs highl/i.rightghted that:\n\n- \u00b7 the Committee was well chaired and that communicat/i.rightons and follow-ups on the outcomes from meetings had improved\n- \u00b7 the new search consultant had strengthened the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton process of new INEDs as part of succession planning; however, there was a feeling that further pace and decis/i.rightveness could be in/j.rightected into the process\n- \u00b7 the Committee saw a benefit to spending more time on ensuring suitable succession plans are in place for key Management Team roles, with a greater focus on enhancing an internal pipel/i.rightne of candidates\n- \u00b7 the Committee is broadly happy with its composit/i.righton, which it considered to be balanced and collegiate with a good cross-section of skills and divers/i.rightty of views and perspectives. However, there was a sense that the Committee would further benefit from addit/i.rightonal CFO and financ/i.rightal services experience\n- \u00b7 the Committee was keen to have further external ins/i.rightght on the senior talent pool in the global banking sector\n\n## 2022 Action Plan\n\nThe 2022 Action Plan for the Committee reflects suggestions from the evaluation and continues to build on the solid progress made last year:\n\n- \u00b7 Schedule a session with an external party to gain some external ins/i.rightght on the broader senior talent pool in the global banking sector\n- \u00b7 Schedule a focused session on Management Team succession plans, particularly focused on a number of key posit/i.rightons\n- \u00b7 Ensure the pace is mainta/i.rightned in the INED succession planning process, focusing on increas/i.rightng the level of banking/CEO experience\n- \u00b7 Continue to review emergency succession plans for key Board roles",

The Committee reports to the Board on its key areas of focus following each Committee meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written Terms of Reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\nAs Chair of the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, I am pleased to present the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee's report for the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\nThe Committee is pleased to note the progress made against the Group's oversight of financ/i.rightal crime prior/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng the expiry of the Group's 2019 US Deferred Prosecution Agreements and completion of the Group's Financ/i.rightal Crime (FC)-related remediat/i.righton programmes. While this progress is notable, we shall not become complacent and recognise that Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk (FCR) remains an important ongoing risk for the Group.\n\nThe Committee has kept a close watch on the progress being made to enhance financ/i.rightal crime compliance (FCC)-related technology. The Group began work to upgrade core data and technology infrastructure for Customer Due Dil/i.rightgence and FC in 2013, and the Committee was pleased to note at the end of 2021 that the major enhancements have now been deployed to all relevant markets across the Group. The Committee was assured that the Group continues to assess how to improve the effectiveness of its tools and consider next-generation surveillance and FC monitor/i.rightng infrastructure and machine learning.\n\nThe Committee has received and discussed the FCR environment, controls in place and ongoing risks for a number of the Group's key markets includ/i.rightng: India, Bangladesh, Germany and the US. The local CEOs were inv/i.rightted to attend these discuss/i.rightons, which provided opportunit/i.rightes for the Committee to probe how the challenges are being managed on the ground.\n\nFollowing discuss/i.rightons held in 2020, the Committee discussed the Group's Risk and CFCC Productiv/i.rightty Programme, with Audit Committee members being inv/i.rightted to jo/i.rightn this discuss/i.righton. Focus was placed on the need to ensure that the right balance is struck between achiev/i.rightng cost-effic/i.rightencies and mainta/i.rightning effective risk management.\n\nA key prior/i.rightty for the Committee this year has been the Financ/i.rightal Crime Surveillance Operations (FCSO) Transformation Programme, which was discussed at each meeting. This Transformation Programme is responsible for transferring agreed in-scope surveillance activ/i.rightties from the second line of defence to the first line, with the object/i.rightve of moving risk management closer to the source of risk and to promote better decis/i.righton-making.\n\nThe Committee has regularly discussed external developments, emerging risks and threats, includ/i.rightng how COVID-19-related FCR is evolving. Furthermore, focus has been placed on the impacts of colleagues working from home (WFH) and the associated risks. Regular reporting from management and Group Internal Audit (GIA) has provided assurance as to the effectiveness of controls in place, which will be important as the external environment normalises and as the Group transit/i.rightons to a hybrid working model. The Committee has continued to monitor the Group's control capabil/i.rightty and probed that the Group is well protected against FCR.\n\nAt the request of the Committee, a paper on FCR in new technologies includ/i.rightng crypto assets was received and discussed. The capabil/i.rightties, skills and resources required to manage these risks were discussed and management was able to provide assurance that opportunit/i.rightes are being assessed in a measured way, ensuring that all relevant stakeholders are engaged. Furthermore, a paper was received on the Group's Sanctions Compliance Programme. The Committee sought and received assurance that the Group continues to build this programme to be sustainable and adapt to the evolving risks that the Group faces. The Committee also discussed a paper on the Group's Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) Programme, includ/i.rightng an analysis of key risks and management actions.\n\nThe Group continues to partner to lead the fight against financ/i.rightal crime through informat/i.righton-sharing and public-private partnerships. Despite restrict/i.rightons on physical meetings during COVID-19, the Committee was pleased to note that management continued to partic/i.rightpate in informat/i.righton partnerships and industry work to address FCR, includ/i.rightng through United for Wildl/i.rightfe hosted webinars focusing on illegal wildl/i.rightfe trade (IWT), the work of the Wolfsberg Group of which the Group is an active member, and with public-private partnerships in multiple markets. The Committee fully supported these virtual forums to enable the Group to continue to play a leading role in FCC sharing in/i.righttiat/i.rightves.\n\nThe following pages provide ins/i.rightght and context into the Committee's work and activ/i.rightties during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gay Huey Evans",

The report provides an overview of the Committee's work in the year on remuneration for the executive directors and the wider workforce.\n\nDuring 2021 we have continued to support colleagues through the COVID-19 pandemic, recognis/i.rightng the fatigue and ongoing challenges created by the prolonged nature of the cris/i.rights. We are sensit/i.rightve to the diff/i.rightculties many continue to face and are invest/i.rightng heavily in our people and culture, being committed to developing the bank for the new economy - one that is inclus/i.rightve, collaborative and innovat/i.rightve.\n\nAcross more than 50 markets we have built a bank with diverse experience, capabil/i.rightties and culture. We are dedicated to making remuneration decis/i.rightons that are fair, transparent and competit/i.rightve in order to enable a future-ready workforce and build a workplace that helps our colleagues perform at their best. Our Fair Pay Charter continues to guide our performance and reward decis/i.righton-making globally. Our 2021 Fair Pay Report provides an update on the progress made and summarises how we meet the princ/i.rightples of our Fair Pay Charter. Highl/i.rightghts this year include taking the first steps to incorporate liv/i.rightng wages into our supply chain and continu/i.rightng to increase consistency of benefits across our markets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The 2021 Fair Pay Report can be viewed at sc.com/fairpaycharter\n\nAs part of this report we are presenting our new directors' remuneration policy (the policy) which, if approved, will apply from the date of the 2022 AGM for up to three years. No material changes are proposed to the policy as the Committee is confident that it remains fit for purpose and continues to support the delivery of our strategy. In arriv/i.rightng at this conclusion, we have consulted with shareholders and considered the experience of our wider stakeholder group. A summary of the proposed changes is included below and the full policy is set out on pages 161 to 166.",

        "page_content": "## Our performance in 2021\n\nThroughout the year, the Group has demonstrated resil/i.rightent performance against a challenging backdrop. Underlying profit before tax is up 55 per cent on 2020, driven by low levels of credit impa/i.rightrment and good progress across our strategic prior/i.rightties. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) is up 300 basis points to 6.0 per cent and the Group remains strongly capital/i.rightsed, with the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio at 14.1 per cent, demonstrating resil/i.rightence.\n\nThe formulaic Group scorecard outcome was 64 per cent with 37 per cent based on financ/i.rightal achievements includ/i.rightng effective cost management, low levels of credit impa/i.rightrment and growth in high-performing liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and 27 per cent based on non-financ/i.rightal achievements, includ/i.rightng dig/i.righttal adoption, increased innovat/i.righton, speed to market (from idea formation to client delivery) and delivery on our commitment to the Women in Finance Charter.\n\n## Group-wide remuneration\n\n## 2021 annual discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves\n\nFollowing sign/i.rightficantly reduced discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves and lim/i.rightted pay increases in 2020, remuneration outcomes have increased in 2021 in line with performance.\n\nThe Group scorecard assessment of 64 per cent was used as a starting point for determin/i.rightng discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves. The Committee also considered carefully risk, control and conduct matters, review/i.rightng material issues and fines, includ/i.rightng the penalty received from the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in respect of liqu/i.rightdity reporting issues.\n\nConsider/i.rightng all factors, and to ensure the outcome reflects underlying performance, the Committee determined that a reduction of 7 percentage points was appropriate, resulting in an outcome of 57 per cent for the purposes of discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves. This results in aggregate incent/i.rightves of $1,367 mill/i.righton, which is 38 per cent higher than 2020 and slightly above 2019. Further detail is set out on page 153.\n\n## 2022 salaries\n\nAt the start of 2021 we lim/i.rightted salary increases in recognit/i.righton of the prevail/i.rightng circumstances. However, through the year we saw an increase in competit/i.righton for talent in the global labour market. In response to this, and wage inflat/i.righton across several of the markets we operate in, our average global salary increase is 4.8 per cent for 2022.\n\n## Executive director remuneration in 2021\n\n## Annual incent/i.rightves for executive directors\n\nAnnual incent/i.rightves for Bill and Andy reflect the Group scorecard outcome with potential to adjust upwards or downwards based on personal performance. For 2021, the Committee determined that the annual incent/i.rightve for Bill and Andy should be unadjusted from the Group outcome, at 57 per cent of the maximum.\n\nIn 2020, the Group scorecard outcome was 37 per cent, which was then reduced by Bill's and Andy's voluntary waiver of the cash portion (i.e. 50 per cent), resulting in an overall annual incent/i.rightve outcome of 18.5 per cent of the maximum.\n\nThe 2021 scorecard results in annual incent/i.rightve outcomes for the executive directors that are 54 per cent higher than 2020 (before the voluntary waiver of the cash portion) and slightly lower than 2019, which is a more comparable year given the material impact of COVID-19.\n\n## 2019-21 LTIP awards vesting in March 2022\n\nThe 2019-21 long-term incent/i.rightve plan (LTIP) awards are due to vest in March 2022. Following an assessment of the performance condit/i.rightons, the expected levels of vesting are:\n\n- \u00b7 RoTE - 0% vesting\n- \u00b7 Total shareholder return (TSR) - 0% vesting\n- \u00b7 Strategic prior/i.rightties - 23% vesting\n\nWe have not adjusted the performance targets as a result of the pandemic. The value delivered by the 23 per cent vesting outcome and included in the single total figure of remuneration is based on a share price of \u00a34.55 (the threemonth average to 31 December 2021) compared with the share price of \u00a36.11 at grant in 2019. This reduces the award outcome value by 25 per cent.\n\n## Single total figure of remuneration for 2021\n\nThe 2021 annual incent/i.rightve and expected 2019-21 LTIP vesting results in a 2021 single figure for Bill of \u00a34,657,000 and for Andy of \u00a32,979,000. This represents a year-on-year increase of 19 and 21 per cent respectively, which partially reflects the impact of the executive directors' voluntary waiver of the cash portion of their annual incent/i.rightve in 2020.\n\n## 2021 single total figure of remuneration (\u00a3000)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Executive directors' shareholdings\n\nA sign/i.rightficant portion of Bill's and Andy's total remuneration is delivered in shares which will be released over the next eight years. The deferral, retention and recovery provis/i.rightons of their pay reinforce continued alignment with shareholder interests and the Group's long-term performance. As of 31 December 2021, both Bill and Andy had exceeded their shareholding requirements as outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration policy\n\nThe Committee is seeking shareholder approval for a new remuneration policy for the executive directors, as the term for the exist/i.rightng policy comes to an end at the 2022 AGM. We have undertaken an extensive review of the exist/i.rightng policy, includ/i.rightng consulting with our major shareholders, and we believe it remains appropriate to support the delivery of our strategy. As such, no sign/i.rightficant change to the overall structure or quantum of the current executive directors' remuneration is being proposed in the new policy. Further detail is set out on pages 160 to 166.\n\nAs a reminder, at the AGM in 2019 the directors' remuneration policy received the support of 63.8 per cent of shareholders. The Committee re-engaged with shareholders to seek feedback and address concerns relating to the pension allowance. Following these discuss/i.rightons, with effect from 1 January 2020, the pension allowance for the current executive directors was reduced from 20 per cent of salary to 10 per cent of salary, align/i.rightng with UK employees. The subsequent directors' remuneration reports received shareholder support of 97.0 per cent and 98.6 per cent at the 2020 and 2021 AGMs respectively.\n\nTwo developments to the directors' remuneration policy are proposed to align with market practice, which has evolved since 2019:\n\n- \u00b7 Without changing the value of the maximum opportunity, the calculation of variable pay will be based on salary (cash and shares) only and will no longer include the pension allowance. This is purely a presentational change.\n\n| Basis of calculation                    | Maximum opportunity Annual  incent/i.rightve   | LTIP   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Current: fixed pay - salary and pension | 80%                                            | 120%   |\n| Proposed: salary                        | 88%                                            | 132%   |\n\n- \u00b7 The post-employment shareholding requirement will be increased to 100 per cent of the shareholding requirement for two years following the cessation of employment.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, to recognise market practice and the views of some of our shareholders, the pension allowance for new directors will be based on the cash element of salary only. The Committee considered carefully whether the pension allowance for Bill and Andy should also be based on the cash element of salary only. However, the pension reductions in 2020 had a direct impact on the variable pay opportunity (8 per cent lower for both Bill and Andy) in addit/i.righton to the reduction in fixed pay. Therefore, to avoid further reducing the opportunity, we believe the current policy (10 per cent of salary) continues to be appropriate for Bill and Andy and remains consistent with the approach for the rest of the UK workforce. In making this decis/i.righton, the Committee also took into account the high level of shareholder support expressed for the current arrangements at the 2020 and 2021 AGMs, and in recent engagement sessions.\n\n## Executive directors' remuneration in 2022\n\nFor 2022, the assessment of personal performance will be embedded into the annual incent/i.rightve scorecard assessment, accounting for a maximum weight/i.rightng of 10 per cent. Financ/i.rightal measures will continue to make up 50 per cent of the annual incent/i.rightve scorecard. Further detail is set out on page 169.\n\nUnder the remuneration policy, the Committee considers salary increases annually for the executive directors and takes account of increases in scope or responsib/i.rightlity, the ind/i.rightvidual's development in role, market competit/i.rightveness, and salary increases across the Group. This is in line with the approach taken for all Group employees.\n\nTaking into account the average 2022 salary increase awarded to the Group's UK and global workforce, the Committee has determined that an increase is appropriate. The Committee has awarded salary increases of 2.7 per cent to Bill and Andy, from \u00a32,370,000 to \u00a32,434,000 and from \u00a31,515,000 to \u00a31,556,000 respectively. This is the second salary increase awarded to Bill and the third to Andy since their appointments in 2015 and 2014 respectively.\n\n## 2022-24 LTIP awards to be granted in March 2022\n\nAfter consider/i.rightng 2021 performance, 2022-24 LTIP awards will be granted to both Bill and Andy with a value of 120 per cent of fixed pay, in line with our current policy. Subject to performance over the next three years, awards will vest pro rata over years three to seven with an addit/i.rightonal retention period of 12 months after vesting. Performance will be assessed based on RoTE with a CET1 underpin, TSR relative to a peer group, and the achievement of measures that are aligned with the Group's strategic prior/i.rightties.\n\nLast year we adjusted the weight/i.rightngs of the performance measures and included a standalone sustainab/i.rightlity pillar to recognise its importance. This year we are retain/i.rightng this pillar and increas/i.rightng the focus on the broader impact of client activ/i.rightty, rather than on our internal operations. To enhance the alignment between executive remuneration and our strategy, measures relating to all three Stands are included in the 2022-24 LTIP.  More informat/i.righton on our Stands is set out on pages 24 and 25.\n\nDiscuss/i.rightons with shareholders were held in January 2022 on the development of these performance measures and targets, and were factored into final decis/i.rightons made by the Committee. Further details on the 2022-24 LTIP and the performance targets are set out on pages 157 and 158.\n\nThis directors' remuneration report is subject to two shareholder votes at the 2022 AGM:\n\n- \u00b7 An advisory vote on the applicat/i.righton of the exist/i.rightng directors' remuneration policy in 2021.\n- \u00b7 A bind/i.rightng vote on the proposed directors' remuneration policy which, if approved, will apply from the date of the AGM. The policy sets out the framework for directors' remuneration for up to three years.\n\nIn the rest of this report we present the disclosures required by regulations, as well as addit/i.rightonal informat/i.righton to explain how remuneration for our executives aligns with our strategy, shareholder interests and wider workforce pay.\n\nAll disclosures in the directors' remuneration report are unaudited unless otherwise stated. Disclosures marked as audited should be considered audited in the context of the financ/i.rightal statements as a whole.\n\nIn making remuneration decis/i.rightons for 2021 and beyond, we have been mindful of the experience of our wider stakeholder group. I would like to thank personally our shareholders and my fellow Committee members for their ongoing support and engagement as we sought to strike the appropriate balance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Christ/i.rightne Hodgson\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

        "page_content": "## Summary of the proposed new executive directors' remuneration policy\n\nOur policy on remuneration for directors was last reviewed in 2018 and approved by shareholders at the May 2019 AGM. During 2021 we have carried out a review of executive director remuneration and at our May 2022 AGM we will propose a new directors' remuneration policy.\n\nTaking into account feedback received from our major shareholders and proxy advisers, the Committee considers that the current directors' remuneration policy remains appropriate and continues to support the delivery of our strategy. Therefore, no sign/i.rightficant changes to the overall structure or quantum of the current executive directors' remuneration packages are being proposed. The key elements of the proposed policy and an explanation of the proposed changes are set out below. Full details of the new directors' remuneration policy are set out on pages 160 to 166.\n\n| Element                                                            | Current policy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Proposed changes to policy and rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed remuneration                                                 | Fixed remuneration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Fixed remuneration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Salary                                                             | Delivered part in cash (paid monthly)  and part in shares (20 per cent released  annually over five years)                                                                                                                                                                               | No change Why?

This reduced the variable pay opportunity by   8 per cent for both Bill and Andy. To avoid a further reduction in  remuneration, pension for the current executive directors is being  mainta/i.rightned as a percentage of the cash and share elements of salary. Change:  For new directors pension will be based on the cash element of  salary only. |\n| Benefits                                                           | A range of benefits are provided which  support directors to carry out their   duties effectively                                                                                                                                                                                        | No change Why?

The Committee also oversees workforce remuneration and the alignment of reward, culture and the strategic prior/i.rightties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Committee has written terms of reference that can be viewed at sc.com/termsofreference\n\n## Shareholder voting\n\nThe table below shows the votes cast 1 at our AGM in May 2021 on the 2020 directors' remuneration report. The resolution on the directors' remuneration policy at the May 2019 AGM received a bind/i.rightng vote in favour of 64 per cent.\n\n|                           | For         | Against   | Withheld   |\n|---------------------------|-------------|-----------|------------|\n| Advisory vote on the      | 596,685,018 | 8,508,938 | 7,673,691  |\n| 2020 remuneration  report | (98.59%)    | (1.41%)   | 7,673,691  |\n\n## Advice to the Committee\n\nThe Committee was assisted in its considerat/i.rightons by PwC, who was formally reappointed by the Committee as its remuneration adviser in June 2021 following a review of potential advisors and the quality of advice received. It is the Committee's practice to undertake a detailed review of potential advisers every three to four years.\n\nPwC is a signatory to the voluntary Code of Conduct in relation to remuneration consulting in the UK. PwC also provides professional services to the Group in the ordinary course of business includ/i.rightng assurance, advisory, tax advice and certain services relating to Human Resources. The Committee considered PwC's role as an adviser to the Group and determined that there was no conflict or potential conflict aris/i.rightng. The Committee is satisf/i.righted that the advice the Committee receives is object/i.rightve and independent. The total fee paid to PwC (on an agreed fee basis) was \u00a3137,450 which includes advice to the Committee relating to executive directors' remuneration and regulatory matters.\n\nThe Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer and Group Chief Risk Officer provided the Committee with regular updates on finance and risk matters, respectively. The Committee recognises and manages any conflicts of interest when receiv/i.rightng views from executive directors or senior management on executive remuneration proposals and no ind/i.rightvidual is involved in decid/i.rightng their own remuneration.\n\n## Committee effectiveness review\n\nThis year the Board effectiveness review comprised an internally facil/i.righttated, questionna/i.rightre-based evaluation for the Board and its Committees completed by every Board member.\n\n## Key observations from the 2021 internal effectiveness review\n\nThe review outcomes for the Remuneration Committee, which are summarised below, were very posit/i.rightve:\n\n- \u00b7 Members highl/i.rightghted the good process around preparation for the 2022 policy vote.\n- \u00b7 Members rated the Committee composit/i.righton as strong with a good understanding of remuneration. The Committee welcomes the addit/i.righton of Maria Ramos and the skills and experience she brings.\n- \u00b7 Information received by the Committee is considered clear and comprehensive. Meetings are considered effic/i.rightent and proactively managed with well-structured agendas.\n- \u00b7 Management incent/i.rightves are considered well aligned with the Group's strategic aims and investor expectations, with metrics clearly defined and measurable.\n\n## 2022 Action Plan\n\nThe 2022 Action Plan for the Committee reflects suggestions from the evaluation and continues to build on the further progress made last year:\n\n- \u00b7 Implement the 2022 directors' remuneration policy for executive directors.\n- \u00b7 Continue to review the implementat/i.righton of the Group's Fair Pay Charter and alignment of workforce polic/i.rightes and practices with its princ/i.rightples.\n- \u00b7 Monitor market trends to ensure that the Group's remuneration remains competit/i.rightve, in the context of improv/i.rightng performance and productiv/i.rightty.\n- \u00b7 Continue to assess the alignment between Group incent/i.rightves and the delivery of the strategy and our desired performance-orientated, innovat/i.rightve culture, underpinned by conduct and sustainab/i.rightlity.\n- \u00b7 Oversee compliance with the PRA and Financ/i.rightal Conduct Authority (FCA) remuneration rules, includ/i.rightng applicable elements of the Capital Requirements Direct/i.right v e  V.\n- \u00b7 Consider jo/i.rightnt horizon-scanning sessions with the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee.",

This year, 92 per cent of colleagues responded to the Group's engagement survey, which sought to understand colleague sentiment in respect of reward, flexible working and wellbeing. Key ins/i.rightghts were presented to the Committee for discuss/i.righton, and results were shared with the workforce along with a summary of actions being taken.\n\nThe Board engages with and listens to the views of employees. In 2021, six interact/i.rightve engagement sessions took place virtually, with partic/i.rightpation from more than 2,600 colleagues. A range of people-related topics were discussed, includ/i.rightng new ways of working, divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton, remuneration and work-life balance.\n\nFurther informat/i.righton on our workforce engagement framework is included in our Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee report on pages 130 to 132.",

Implementation continues as new ways of working evolve; work in 2021 has been in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 On an annual basis we complete assurance activ/i.rightty to ensure that all colleagues are paid a liv/i.rightng wage, as measured by the benchmarks in place through our work with the Fair Wage Network.\n- \u00b7 We have taken in/i.righttial steps to integrate fair pay into our supply chain, which is a multi-year undertaking. This year we published the Standard Chartered Supplier Charter which sets out how suppliers can develop their understanding of liv/i.rightng wages and encourages the adoption of fair pay practices.\n- \u00b7 In some markets that were acutely impacted by the pandemic during 2021, such as India, the Phil/i.rightppines, Sri Lanka, Niger/i.righta and Zimbabwe, we provided addit/i.rightonal financ/i.rightal assistance to employees, includ/i.rightng access to increased credit facil/i.rightties.\n- \u00b7 During the pandemic, we have raised lim/i.rightts on medical benefits in several markets in Asia and Africa and the Middle East to supplement state coverage for COVID-19 treatment, and procure vaccines for colleagues and their dependents in support of government-led in/i.righttiat/i.rightves.\n- \u00b7 To improve the transparency and fairness of fixed pay decis/i.righton-making, we provide people leaders with Groupwide princ/i.rightples guided by market data and salary ranges. We have continued to expand the coverage of salary ranges in 2021, up to 76 per cent. This reduces the potential risk of bias by shift/i.rightng focus away from an ind/i.rightvidual's past or current compensation.\n- \u00b7 We continue to improve consistency in our benefits approach for colleagues across 50 markets. Flexible benefits was launched in Malaysia in March 2021, enabling greater freedom of choice based on ind/i.rightvidual circumstances.\n\n## Fair Pay Charter princ/i.rightples\n\n|   1 | We commit to pay a liv/i.rightng wage in all our markets  and seek to go beyond compliance with min/i.rightmum  wage requirements.                                                                                                                   |\n|-----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|   2 | We provide an appropriate mix of fixed and variable  pay and a core level of benefits to ensure a min/i.rightmum  level of earnings and security to colleagues and to  reflect the Group's commitment to wellbeing.                                  |\n|   3 | We support colleagues in working flexibly, in ways  that balance both business needs and their personal  circumstances, and provide colleagues with the  opportunity to select the combinat/i.righton and level of  benefits that is right for them. |\n|   4 | Pay is well admin/i.rightstered with colleagues paid  accurately, on time and in a way that is convenient   for them.                                                                                                                                |\n|   5 | We provide a competit/i.rightve total fixed and variable  pay opportunity that enables us to attract, motivate  and retain colleagues based on market rates for their  role, location, performance, skills and experience.                           |\n|   6 | The structure of pay and benefits is consistent for  colleagues based on their location and role, with a  clear rationale for exceptions.                                                                                                            |\n|   7 | We are committed to rewarding colleagues in a way  that is free from discr/i.rightminat/i.righton on the basis of  divers/i.rightty, as set out in our Group Code of Conduct.                                                                        |\n|   8 | We ensure pay decis/i.rightons reflect the performance   of the ind/i.rightvidual, the business they work in and   the Group, and recognise the potential, conduct,  behaviours and values demonstrated by each  ind/i.rightvidual.                  |\n|   9 | We set clear expectations for how colleagues are  rewarded and the princ/i.rightples guid/i.rightng decis/i.rightons,  includ/i.rightng clear personal object/i.rightves and feedback.                                                               |\n|  10 | We provide clear communicat/i.righton of pay and  performance decis/i.rightons, and seek feedback and input  from colleagues on our pay structures and outcomes.                                                                                     |",

In 2020, we committed to implement/i.rightng a hybrid working approach, combin/i.rightng virtual and office-based working with greater flexib/i.rightlity in working patterns and locations, balancing colleague preference and business demands.\n\nAs we emerge from the pandemic, the office is becoming a space where we will go to connect, collaborate, innovate and learn with others - clients and colleagues alike. At the root of these changes is an appetite for autonomy, flexib/i.rightlity and choice. We are transforming our spaces into communit/i.rightes curated to enhance business performance, connectiv/i.rightty, collaboration and wellbeing. We have also created a Near Home solution to implement colleagues' hybrid working arrangements, giv/i.rightng choices about when, where and how we work.\n\nDriven by the continuat/i.righton of pandemic-related restrict/i.rightons and by our new flexible working in/i.righttiat/i.rightve, based on the results of the 2021 My Voice survey, 42 per cent of colleagues were working fully from home, 26 per cent fully from the office, and 32 per cent a combinat/i.righton of home and office (hybrid).\n\nIn 2021, our flexi-working model went live in 28 markets: 73 per cent of colleagues in these markets agreed formal flexi-working arrangements. The Group's remain/i.rightng countries will transit/i.righton over 2022 and 2023.\n\nWe continue to monitor feedback received and provide support to colleagues working both in the office, at home, or both. Plans are in place to collect ins/i.rightghts from the programme in order to support leadership decis/i.rightons. To ident/i.rightfy ways to work more effectively, ins/i.rightghts will be sought to understand how work is being performed in the new hybrid world and whether there is a correlation with performance, productiv/i.rightty, people and culture.\n\n## Redefin/i.rightng performance management\n\nSim/i.rightlar to last year, there was no formulaic link between performance ratings and annual incent/i.rightve outcomes for colleagues. People leaders continued to have the flexib/i.rightlity to adjust outcomes for ind/i.rightviduals with very strong performance and for ind/i.rightviduals whose performance fell short of expectations, with management reviews of decis/i.rightons for fairness and consistency.\n\nAs we continue to transform the Group to achieve our strategic ambit/i.rightons, we are making changes to the way we manage and recognise performance in 2022, to help create the culture needed for success. Our new approach to performance and talent management hinges upon continuous performance conversations and will further support our princ/i.rightple of clear communicat/i.righton of expectations and regular, real-time feedback. We will place greater emphasis on recognis/i.rightng outperformance driven by collaboration and innovat/i.righton, encourage more flexib/i.rightlity and aspirat/i.righton during goal setting and remove ind/i.rightvidual performance ratings. During 2021, we piloted facets of our new approach with a population of first adopters, which helped us refine the design and implementat/i.righton.\n\n## Upskill/i.rightng/reskill/i.rightng\n\nIn today's rapidly changing world, we want to build a workforce for the future by enabling colleagues to develop their skills and their own career path in a more transparent, agile and inclus/i.rightve way. To enable this, we have been experiment/i.rightng with an internal virtual marketplace where colleagues can connect skills, experience and aspirat/i.rightons with suitable short-term, on-the-job learning opportunit/i.rightes, creating possib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for upskill/i.rightng and reskill/i.rightng. We will roll out our internal virtual talent marketplace to the rest of the Group in 2022.\n\n## Wellbeing\n\nOur ambit/i.righton is to create a workplace and culture that has a posit/i.rightve impact on colleague wellbeing, enabling colleagues to manage their wellbeing proactively and bring their best selves to work.\n\nInit/i.rightatives launched in the first year of our three-year wellbeing strategy have started to have a posit/i.rightve impact. The number of colleagues experienc/i.rightng a high level of work-related stress reduced between 2019 and 2020, and nearly three-quarters of all colleagues feel comfortable sharing these concerns with their people leaders. To understand more about the cause of work-related stress, we introduced new questions into the 2021 engagement survey, enabling us to take further meaningful action.\n\nIn 2021 the following wellbeing in/i.righttiat/i.rightves were progressed:\n\n- \u00b7 Launch of Mental Wellbeing Philosophy and Aspirat/i.rightons, to underpin our three-year wellbeing strategy, to support colleagues in developing the skills needed for the future, (e.g. build/i.rightng resil/i.rightence, supporting others and inclus/i.rightve leadership).\n- \u00b7 Embedding Unmind, a dig/i.righttal applicat/i.righton and platform that enables colleagues to assess their wellbeing needs and receive personalised recommendations and coaching on simple steps to develop healthier habits.\n- \u00b7 Partnering with clin/i.rightcal psychiatr/i.rightsts and psychologists to launch the Build/i.rightng Resil/i.rightence programme, helping colleagues to understand the neuroscience of common mental health issues, teaching how to build resil/i.rightence to cope with disrupt/i.righton and rapid change.\n- \u00b7 Expansion of the mental health first aider (MHFA) programme, increas/i.rightng the number of trained MHFAs to offer in-country coverage to 98 per cent of the our colleagues.\n- \u00b7 Launch of Wellbeing Experiments to spark fun, inclus/i.righton and collaboration around wellbeing at team level. The experiments align with our focus on preventative and proactive wellbeing support in order to create healthier and more sustainable habits for the future.\n- \u00b7 Driv/i.rightng local in/i.righttiat/i.rightves through Wellbeing Weeks in countries and regions.\n\nWe are increas/i.rightng the prominence of wellbeing further in 2022 with an emphasis on financ/i.rightal wellbeing in/i.righttiat/i.rightves. Prior/i.rightties include encouraging uptake amongst colleagues of new and exist/i.rightng wellbeing programmes; further listen/i.rightng and measurement of in/i.righttiat/i.rightves through feedback channels; and increased localisat/i.righton to maxim/i.rightse effectiveness in countries and regions.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration in 2021\n\nThis section, which is subject to an advisory vote at the 2022 AGM, sets out how remuneration was delivered to the executive directors in 2021 under the remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2019. It also sets out the 2021 fees paid to the Group Chairman and the independent non-executive directors (INEDs).\n\n## Annual incent/i.rightve awards for the executive directors (audited)\n\nAnnual incent/i.rightve awards for executive directors are based on the assessment of the Group scorecard and an assessment of ind/i.rightvidual performance. The Group scorecard is used for all elig/i.rightble employees, includ/i.rightng the executive directors, to mainta/i.rightn alignment and a shared sense of purpose.\n\nFor Bill and Andy, the Committee considered Group performance, ind/i.rightvidual performance, and risk, control and conduct-related matters (with input from Risk and other control functions). The Committee follows a three-step process for determin/i.rightng annual incent/i.rightve awards.\n\n- 1.  Consider elig/i.rightbil/i.rightty: The Committee considered that each director had exhib/i.rightted an appropriate level of conduct and was deemed to have met the gateway requirement to be elig/i.rightble for an incent/i.rightve.\n- 2. Evaluate performance against the Group's scorecard: The Group reported steady progress against both financ/i.rightal and strategic measures in the scorecard, demonstrating resil/i.rightent performance throughout 2021 despite a challenging backdrop. Underlying profit before tax is up 55 per cent on 2020, helped by low levels of credit impa/i.rightrment and strong underlying business momentum. RoTE is up 300 basis points to 6.0 per cent and the Group's capital remains strong, with the CET1 ratio at 14.1 per cent, demonstrating resil/i.rightence. Full details of the scorecard outcome can be seen on page 145.\n- 3. Assess personal performance and final/i.rightse awards: As outlined in the policy, the Committee can make an upwards or downwards adjustment to the scorecard outcome for personal performance (usually in the range of +/- 10 per cent), consistent with the approach for other employees who are elig/i.rightble to be considered for discret/i.rightonary incent/i.rightves. When consider/i.rightng whether such an adjustment is appropriate, the Committee considers areas of responsib/i.rightlity together with progress against key object/i.rightves for the year and personal contribut/i.righton to the Group scorecard outcome.\n\n## Assessment of personal performance and final/i.rightsed awards\n\n## Bill Winters\n\nA summary of key achievements against Bill's personal object/i.rightves is set out as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Throughout the challenging circumstances of 2021, Bill has demonstrated exceptional leadership, navigat/i.rightng the Group and its colleagues through this uncertain period with skill and determinat/i.righton.\n- \u00b7 Bill has delivered steady progress on financ/i.rightal performance, although it is noted that there is the need to continue to improve the RoTE to achieve a sign/i.rightficantly better valuation. This should be accompanied by further strengthening of the Group's risk and control framework in light of the evolving landscape.\n\n- \u00b7 Bill remains committed to the achievement of the Group's ambit/i.rightous medium and long-term goals; a key prior/i.rightty for Bill during 2021 has been delivery against the strategic prior/i.rightties. Progress has been made in pushing forward the agenda on our Stands and setting the roadmap for achiev/i.rightng our net zero ambit/i.righton.\n- \u00b7 Bill continues to drive innovat/i.righton and collaboration, ensuring that new ways of working are becoming gradually embedded across the organisat/i.righton to support this.\n- \u00b7 During 2021, Bill has been focused on strengthening the Management Team through key strategic hires.\n- \u00b7 Bill consistently role-models our valued behaviours in his interact/i.rightons with the Management Team and Board. His transparency and loyalty insp/i.rightre a shared sense of purpose and vis/i.righton during challenging times.\n\nThe Committee determined that neither an upwards nor downwards adjustment to the overall Group scorecard outcome was appropriate for 2021. Bill's annual incent/i.rightve is aligned with the Group scorecard outcome at 57 per cent of the maximum opportunity, which equates to \u00a31,188,792 and is 46 per cent of fixed pay (15 per cent in 2020 and 44 per cent in 2019).\n\n## Andy Halford\n\nA summary of key achievements against Andy's personal object/i.rightves is set out as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Andy has played an instrumental part in achiev/i.rightng steady progress across a range of financ/i.rightal and strategic object/i.rightves which has in turn enabled the Group to demonstrate resil/i.rightent performance despite continu/i.rightng adverse operational and economic challenges.\n- \u00b7 Andy has been key to the delivery of new ways of working, enabling our drive for productiv/i.rightty by improv/i.rightng the synchronisat/i.righton of financ/i.rightals with the concept of clientcentred end-to-end processes.\n- \u00b7 Andy continues to demonstrate strong leadership in the restructuring of the Group's legal entit/i.rightes and the delivery of a radical change programme with/i.rightn the Property function.\n- \u00b7 Andy has supported structural improvements in Treasury management with further work planned.\n- \u00b7 Andy has been a great partner to the Management Team, provid/i.rightng balanced perspectives across strategy, investment, productiv/i.rightty and transformation in/i.righttiat/i.rightves. Andy consistently demonstrates object/i.rightvity, transparency and integr/i.rightty.\n- \u00b7 Andy will continue to refine our dialogue with stakeholders to effectively communicate our strategy and execution progress.  Consistent with that, Andy will continue to evolve internal performance measures to align with our strategic prior/i.rightties.\n\nThe Committee considered Andy's performance against his key object/i.rightves in the year and areas for further improvement, determin/i.rightng that neither an upwards nor downwards adjustment to the overall Group scorecard outcome was appropriate for 2021. Andy's annual incent/i.rightve is 57 per cent of the maximum opportunity, which equates to \u00a3759,924 and is 46 per cent of fixed pay (15 per cent in 2020 and 44 per cent in 2019).",

        "page_content": "## Performance outcome for 2019-21 LTIP awards (audited)\n\nThe single total figure of remuneration table shows that LTIP awards will vest in March 2022 with an estimated value of \u00a3696,000 and \u00a3445,000 for Bill and Andy, respectively. These LTIP awards were granted to Bill and Andy in 2019 with a face value of 120 per cent of fixed pay, to incent/i.rightvise the continued execution of the strategy over the three-year period 2019 to 2021. The awards are share-based and subject to the satisfact/i.righton of stretching performance measures over three years. The conduct gateway requirement must be met before any awards vest. The awards are then subject to RoTE and relative TSR targets and a qualitat/i.rightve and quantitat/i.rightve assessment of the strategic measures.\n\nThe Committee concluded that Bill and Andy exhib/i.rightted appropriate conduct during the performance period and therefore the conduct gateway was met. The threshold RoTE target has not been achieved and the relative TSR threshold target will be measured in March 2022 but is estimated not to have been achieved and, therefore, there will be no vesting of the 66.6 per cent of the awards subject to these measures.\n\nThe Committee considered performance against the proof points as set out in the table below and determined that the overall vesting of the LTIP would be 23 per cent. The table below sets out the performance required, the 2019-21 performance achieved and the LTIP vesting outcome. The share price used to estimate the value of vesting of the 2019-21 LTIP awards is lower than the share price on the award date of \u00a36.11 and, therefore, the value attributable to share price growth is nil. The value of the awards vesting is reduced by 25 per cent when compared with the value at grant.\n\nNo discret/i.righton has been applied to the vesting outcome of the LTIP in respect of performance targets or share price movement. The awards will vest pro rata over 2022 to 2026 and the shares will be subject to a 12 month retention period post-vesting.

        "page_content": "## LTIP awards for the executive directors to be granted in 2022\n\nThe size of the LTIP award has been determined on Group and ind/i.rightvidual performance during the year. Awards for the 2021 performance year will be granted to Bill and Andy in March 2022 with a value of 120 per cent of fixed pay (\u00a33.1 mill/i.righton and \u00a32.0 mill/i.righton, respectively), the maximum amount under the 2019 directors' remuneration policy. The amount that the executive directors will receive at the end of the three-year performance period will be based on the level of performance achieved against the performance measures and the future share price.\n\nThe performance measures and targets are aligned with our strategic prior/i.rightties, and we have also incorporated measures that reflect our three Stands - our long-term ambit/i.rightons on societal challenges: Accelerating Zero; Lift/i.rightng Partic/i.rightpation; Resetting Globalisat/i.righton.\n\nWe are retain/i.rightng the standalone sustainab/i.rightlity measure introduced last year and increas/i.rightng the focus on the broader impact of client activ/i.rightty, rather than on our internal operations.  The sustainab/i.rightlity measures have been selected carefully from our broader range of sustainab/i.rightlity aspirat/i.rightons based on their level of impact for the Group and wider society and abil/i.rightty to drive financ/i.rightal returns in the medium term.\n\nDetails of the sustainab/i.rightlity and other strategic measures and targets are shown in the table below and are disclosed prospectively, except where the internal targets are considered commercially sensit/i.rightve. Details of achievement against targets will be disclosed retrospectively at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe RoTE target range for 2022-24 LTIP awards is 7 to 11 per cent which retains a 4 percentage point range as for the prior year award, but is further stretched by 1 percentage point at both the threshold and maximum target levels. This reflects the progress in RoTE achieved in 2021 and our target to deliver returns above 10 per cent in the medium term.\n\nThe peer group of companies selected for the calculation of the relative TSR performance are companies with generally comparable business activ/i.rightties, size or geographic spread to Standard Chartered or companies with which we compete for investor funds and talent. The peer group is intended to be representative of our geographic presence and business operations. The companies that make up the peer group are reviewed annually, prior to each new LTIP grant.\n\nThe TSR peer group for the 2022-24 LTIP awards will be the same as for the 2021-23 LTIP and is detailed below. TSR is measured in sterling for each company and the TSR data is averaged over a month at the start and end of the three-year measurement period which starts from the date of grant.\n\nRemuneration regulations for UK banks prohib/i.rightt the award of div/i.rightdend equivalent shares on vesting. The number of shares awarded in respect of the LTIP will take into account the lack of div/i.rightdend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield) such that the overall market value of the award is mainta/i.rightned.\n\nThese awards will vest in five annual tranches beginn/i.rightng after the third anniversary of the grant (i.e. March 2025 to March 2029) subject to meeting the performance measures set out below at the end of 2024.

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration policy\n\nThis section sets out the revised directors' remuneration policy which will be put forward to shareholders at the 2022 AGM for a bind/i.rightng vote and, if approved, will apply from 4 May 2022 for up to three years.\n\nThe current remuneration policy for executive directors, the Chairman and independent non-executive directors was approved at the AGM held on 8 May 2019 and has applied for three years from that date. The policy has continued to support the delivery of our strategy.\n\n## Changes made to the current policy since the 2019 shareholder vote\n\nAt the AGM in 2019 the directors' remuneration policy received the support of 64 per cent of shareholders. The Committee re-engaged with shareholders to seek feedback and address concerns relating to the pension allowance. Following these discuss/i.rightons, with effect from 1 January 2020 the pension allowance for the current executive directors was reduced from 20 per cent of salary to 10 per cent of salary, align/i.rightng with all UK employees. The subsequent directors' remuneration reports received support from shareholders of 97.0 per cent and 98.6 per cent of shareholders at the 2020 and 2021 AGMs respectively.\n\nThe Board and Committee conducted a detailed review of the policy in 2021 consider/i.rightng the views of stakeholders, the strategic object/i.rightves of the Group, the remuneration framework applicable to all colleagues, market benchmarking and best practice. Following careful considerat/i.righton, the Committee decided to retain a broadly unchanged policy, making some small changes in order to align with market practice, increase shareholder alignment and reinforce sustained long-term focus on our strategic goals. Mainta/i.rightning a sim/i.rightlar policy will continue to support the delivery of the Group's purpose and strategy, reinforce the achievement of shareholder value creation, and ensure continued regulatory compliance.\n\nTo recognise shareholder views and further align with market practice, the pension allowance for new directors will be based on the cash element of salary only. The Committee considered carefully whether the pension allowance for the current directors should also be based on the cash element of salary only. However, the pension reductions in 2020 had a direct impact on the variable pay opportunity (8 per cent lower for both Bill and Andy), in addit/i.righton to the reduction on fixed pay. Therefore, to avoid further reducing remuneration, for the current directors the pension is not changing and will continue to be based on the cash and share elements of salary.\n\nThe basis of calculation of variable remuneration will be re-expressed as a percentage of salary (cash and shares) only changing from a percentage of fixed pay (salary and pension). This is purely a presentational change with no impact on the value of opportunity.\n\nThe Committee Chair mainta/i.rightns regular contact with the Group's major shareholders on remuneration and informs the Committee of their views. In 2021, shareholders representing approximately 55 per cent of our share register and the main proxy advisory agencies were engaged to discuss the proposals for the new directors' remuneration policy. Considerat/i.righton was given to the views expressed and the proposed policy reflects the feedback received.\n\nThe remuneration of the Group Chairman, executive directors, senior management and all colleagues was considered in the development of the refreshed policy. Alignment with the wider workforce and with Group-wide remuneration arrangements was crit/i.rightcal in the development of the policy which is designed to reflect the Group's purpose as well as following the princ/i.rightples of our Fair Pay Charter which guides reward decis/i.rightons.\n\nDuring the review and development of the refreshed remuneration policy, no ind/i.rightvidual partic/i.rightpated in decis/i.rightons that would impact the determinat/i.righton of their own remuneration.",

This change is to  recognise feedback from shareholders and to align with market practice. For the current executive directors pension is not changing. This is to avoid a further reduction in fixed pay   and variable pay opportunity following the reduction in pension implemented in 2020.

The pension allowance is set as a percentage of salary (both the cash and shares components).\n\nThe Committee reviews the salaries of the executive directors on an annual basis, after consider/i.rightng any changes to the scope or responsib/i.rightlity of the role, the ind/i.rightvidual's development in the role, alignment with market-competit/i.rightve levels, and considerat/i.righton of the average salary increases made across the Group.\n\nTaking into account the average 2022 salary increase awarded to the Group's UK and global workforce, the Committee determined to increase salary for Bill from \u00a32,370,000 to \u00a32,434,000 and to increase salary for Andy from \u00a31,515,000 to \u00a31,556,000 (increases of 2.7 per cent), effective from 1 April 2022.\n\nDetails of fixed pay for Bill and Andy with effect from 1 April 2022 are set out below.\n\nBill Winters\n\nAndy Halford\n\n| \u00a3000                                         | 2022   | 2021   |   % change | 2022   | 2021   |   % change |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Salary                                       | 2,434  | 2,370  |        2.7 | 1,556  | 1,515  |        2.7 |\n| of which cash                                | 1,217  | 1,185  |        2.7 | 1,043  | 1,015  |        2.7 |\n| of which shares                              | 1,217  | 1,185  |        2.7 | 513    | 500    |        2.7 |\n| Pension                                      | 243    | 237    |        2.7 | 156    | 151    |        2.7 |\n| Total fixed pay                              | 2,677  | 2,607  |        2.7 | 1,712  | 1,666  |        2.7 |\n| Proportion of total fixed pay paid in cash   | 55%    | 55%    |        0   | 70%    | 70%    |        0   |\n| Proportion of total fixed pay paid in shares | 45%    | 45%    |        0   | 30%    | 30%    |        0   |\n\n## Illustration of applicat/i.righton of the 2022 remuneration policy\n\nThe charts below illustrate the potential outcomes under the proposed directors' remuneration policy being put to shareholders for approval at the AGM in May 2022 (i.e. for awards that would be made in March 2023, based on 2022 performance and fixed remuneration with effect from 1 April 2022).\n\n## Executive director remuneration (\u00a3000)\n\nThe charts show potential remuneration outcomes for each executive director in four performance scenarios: min/i.rightmum, on-target, maximum and maximum with 50 per cent share price appreciat/i.righton, in line with reporting requirements.

The targets are set annually by the Committee and take into account the Group's annual financ/i.rightal plan and strategic prior/i.rightties for the next few years which reflect the evolving macroeconomic outlook. The Committee will also consider progress demonstrated against the Stands in the determinat/i.righton of the overall scorecard outcome.\n\nFor 2022, to simpl/i.rightfy the process, the Committee has determined to embed the assessment of personal performance into the annual incent/i.rightve scorecard assessment, accounting for a maximum weight/i.rightng of 10 per cent. Financ/i.rightal measures continue to make up 50 per cent of the annual incent/i.rightve scorecard. Previously, personal performance was assessed independently following the assessment of the scorecard when the Committee could apply an adjustment of +/- 10 percentage points to the award outcome. Strategic and personal measures are assessed by the Committee using a quantitat/i.rightve and qualitat/i.rightve framework.\n\nThe Committee considers such targets to be commercially sensit/i.rightve and that it would be detrimental to the interests of the Group to disclose them before the end of the financ/i.rightal year. As such, targets will be disclosed retrospectively in the 2022 Annual Report alongside the level of performance achieved.\n\n## Step 1: Conduct gateway requirement to be met in order to be

Our scorecard includes financ/i.rightal and strategic measures and all employees' performance is assessed by what is achieved and how it is achieved in line with our valued behaviours.\n- \u00b7 In combinat/i.righton with our risk procedures, our remuneration structure ensures that our valued behaviours are appropriately recognised and rewarded.\n\n## Proportional/i.rightty\n\n- \u00b7 In line with our commitment to pay for performance, a sign/i.rightficant proportion of executive director pay is delivered through incent/i.rightves based on performance metrics aligned with our strategy.\n- \u00b7 Executive directors are further aligned with long-term shareholder interests through the deferred release of salary, annual incent/i.rightve and LTIP share awards over a period of one to eight years with incent/i.rightve awards also being subject to clawback for up to 10 years from grant.\n- \u00b7 Addit/i.rightonal shareholding requirements are in place for executive directors to build and mainta/i.rightn a sign/i.rightficant shareholding in Company shares while in employment and post-employment for two years. Both executive directors currently exceed the shareholding requirements.\n\n## Predictab/i.rightlity\n\n- \u00b7 The range of possible rewards to ind/i.rightvidual executive directors is set out in the scenario charts on page 167 where we also demonstrate the impact of a 50 per cent share price appreciat/i.righton over the three-year performance period of the LTIP.\n- \u00b7 Maximum awards levels under all incent/i.rightves are capped at two times fixed pay. Other than vesting levels which are driven by performance outcomes, the only source of variat/i.righton in final payouts is the fact that a sign/i.rightficant part of incent/i.rightve awards is delivered in shares and linked to the share price.\n\n## Simpl/i.rightcity and clarity\n\n- \u00b7 Simpl/i.rightcity is a key driver for the structure of our executive pay as far as possible, notwithstand/i.rightng the complexity of operating as a UK regulated bank.\n- \u00b7 Addit/i.rightonal informat/i.righton is included on the alignment of executive and wider workforce pay on page 147 in support of our commitment to clarity.",

Total pay is calculated in line with the single figure methodology (i.e. fixed remuneration accrued during the financ/i.rightal year and variable remuneration relating to the performance year) and data for insured benefits are based on notional premia. No other calculation adjustments or assumptions have been made.\n- \u00b7 CEO pay is as per the single total figure of remuneration for 2021 and restated for 2020 to take account of the actual LTIP vesting in 2021. Further informat/i.righton on the single total figure is on page 155. The 2021 ratio will be restated in the 2022 directors' remuneration report to take account of the final LTIP vesting data for elig/i.rightble employees and for the CEO.\n- \u00b7 The Committee has considered the data for the three ind/i.rightviduals ident/i.rightfied at the lower quartile, median and upper quartile for 2021 and believes that it is a fair reflection of pay among the UK employee population. Each of the ind/i.rightviduals ident/i.rightfied was a full-time employee during the year and received remuneration in line with the Group remuneration policy, and none received exceptional pay.\n- \u00b7 Our LTIP is intended to link total remuneration to the achievement of the Group's long-term strategy and to reinforce alignment between executive remuneration and shareholder interest. Partic/i.rightpation is typically senior employees who have line of sight to influence directly the performance targets on the awards. The lower quartile, median and upper quartile employees ident/i.rightfied this year are not partic/i.rightpants in the LTIP.\n- \u00b7 The year-on-year increase is due to the CEO receiv/i.rightng a higher annual incent/i.rightve for 2021 (57 per cent of maximum compared with the reduced award of 18.5 per cent in 2020 following the voluntary waiver of the cash portion).\n\n## Group performance versus the CEO's remuneration\n\nThe graph below shows the Group's TSR performance on a cumulative basis over the past 10 years alongside that of the FTSE 100 and peer banks. The graph also shows histor/i.rightcal levels of remuneration of the CEO over the 10 years ended 31 December 2020 for comparison.

As no ind/i.rightviduals are employed by Standard Chartered PLC (they are employed by legal entit/i.rightes which sit below the parent company), we voluntarily disclose the comparisons against UK employees as we feel this provides a representative comparison.\n\n1\n\n|                                            | Salary/fees % change   | Salary/fees % change   | Taxable benefits % change   | Taxable benefits % change   | Annual incent/i.rightve % change   | Annual incent/i.rightve % change   |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                            | 2021                   | 2020                   | 2021                        | 2020                        | 2021                               | 2020                               |\n| CEO  B Winters                             | 0.0                    | 0.7                    | (26.5)                      | (2.9)                       | 208.1                              | (69.2)                             |\n| CFO  A Halford                             | 0.7                    | 3.7                    | (5.6)                       | 30.2                        | 208.9                              | (68.2)                             |\n| Group Chairman  J Vi\u00f1als                   | 0.0                    | 0.0                    | (61.5)                      | (11.7)                      | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Current INEDs                              |                        |                        |                             |                             |                                    |                                    |\n| D P Conner                                 | (6.7)                  | (0.6)                  | 5.9                         | ( 5 7. 5 )                  | -                                  | -                                  |\n| B E Grote                                  | 0.0                    | 0.0                    | 0.0                         | 0.0                         | -                                  | -                                  |\n| C M Hodgson, CBE                           | 0.0                    | 0.0                    | (100.0)                     | 28.2                        | -                                  | -                                  |\n| G Huey Evans, CBE                          | 0.0                    | 0.0                    | (100.0)                     | 233.9                       | -                                  | -                                  |\n| N Kheraj                                   | (9.0)                  | 0.0                    | (100.0)                     | 7.9                         | -                                  | -                                  |\n| N Okonjo-Iweala 2                          | -                      | 0.0                    | -                           | 63.6                        | -                                  | -                                  |\n| M Ramos 2                                  | -                      | -                      | -                           | -                           | -                                  | -                                  |\n| P G Rivett 3                               | -                      | -                      | -                           | -                           | -                                  | -                                  |\n| D Tang                                     | 18.3                   | -                      | (82.3)                      | -                           | -                                  | -                                  |\n| C Tong                                     | 0.0                    | -                      | (100.0)                     | -                           | -                                  | -                                  |\n| J M Whitbread                              | 0.0                    | 0.0                    | (100.0)                     | (49.2)                      | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Workforce  Average FTE UK employee 4, 5, 6 | 3.1                    | 3.8                    | (2.0)                       | 2.9                         | 38.2                               | (22.1)                             |\n\n- 2 In 2021: Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala stepped down from the Board on 28 February and Maria Ramos was appointed to the Board on 1 January\n- 3 In 2020: Phil Rivett was appointed to the Board on 6 May\n- 4  Employee data is based on full-time equivalent pay for UK employees as of 31 December of the relevant year. This data excludes leavers, jo/i.rightners and employee transfers in or out of the UK during the year to help ensure data is on a like-for-like basis. Salary percentage change reflects increases decided at the end of 2020 and implemented in 2021\n- 5 Average FTE UK employee percentage change has been calculated on a mean basis. As the employee population will change yearly and the mean average considers the full range of data, it is expected this will provide a more consistent year-on-year comparison. Any percentage changes impacted by extremes at either end of the data set will be explained in the supporting commentary\n- 6  The reduction in taxable benefits for UK employees reflects the impact of leavers during 2021, who would have typically received higher legacy benefits arrangements. On a matched sample basis, benefits increased by 1.6 per cent year-on-year\n\nFor the CEO and CFO and the Group Chairman and INEDs, the data the changes relate to are set out on pages 155 and 159, respectively. The change in taxable benefits relates to the change in the values for the 2020/21 and 2019/20 tax years.\n\nDue to the low value of the taxable benefits received by INEDs, which have not exceeded \u00a31,000 in 2021 (set out on page 159), small changes to these values are expected to cause the percentage change to fluctuate year-on-year.\n\n## Scheme interests awarded, exercised and lapsed during the year\n\nEmployees, includ/i.rightng executive directors, are not permitted to engage in any personal investment strategies with regards to their Company shares, includ/i.rightng hedging against the share price of Company shares.

The number of shares awarded in respect of the LTIP took into account the lack of div/i.rightdend equivalents (calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield) such that the overall value of the award was mainta/i.rightned. Performance measures apply to 2021-23 LTIP awards. The closing share price on the day before grant was \u00a34.901 (further details are included in Note 31, Share-based payments on pages 403 to 407)\n- 2 On 31 March 2020 Standard Chartered announced that in response to the request from the PRA and as a consequence of the unprecedented challenges facing the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board decided to withdraw the recommendation to pay a final div/i.rightdend for 2019. 1,200 div/i.rightdend equivalent shares allocated to Bill's 2017-19 LTIP award tranche which vested in March 2020 and 742 allocated to Andy's 2017-19 LTIP award tranche which vested in March 2020 relating to the cancelled div/i.rightdend were deducted from the calculation of div/i.rightdend equivalent shares allocated to shares vesting in March 2021. Div/i.rightdend equivalent shares allocated to the 2016-18 LTIP award tranche vesting in May 2021 did not include any shares relating to the cancelled div/i.rightdend\n- 3 On 15 March 2021, Bill Winters exercised the 2017-19 LTIP award over a total of 46,404 shares and Andy Halford exercised the 2017-19 LTIP award over a total of 28,726 shares. The closing share price on the day before the exercise was \u00a34.901. On 17 March 2021, Bill Winters exercised the 2018-20 LTIP award over a total of 28,178 shares and Andy Halford exercised the 2018-20 LTIP award over a total of 17,448 shares. The closing share price on the day before the exercise was \u00a34.913. On 4 May 2021, Bill Winters exercised the 2016-18 LTIP award over a total of 35,421 shares and Andy Halford exercised the 2016-18 LTIP award over a total of 21,150 shares. The closing share price on the day before the exercise was \u00a35.196\n- 4  The unvested share awards held by Bill Winters and Andy Halford are condit/i.rightonal rights under the 2011 Plan. They do not have to pay towards these awards\n- 5 The unvested Sharesave option held by Andy Halford is an option granted on 1 October 2019 under the 2013 Plan - to exercise this option, Andy has to pay an exercise price of \u00a34.98 per share, which has been discounted by 20 per cent\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, none of the directors had registered an interest or short posit/i.righton in the shares, underlying shares or debentures of the Company or any of its associated corporations that was required to be recorded pursuant to section 352 of the Securit/i.rightes and Futures Ordinance, or as otherwise notif/i.righted to the Company and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Lim/i.rightted pursuant to the Model Code for Securit/i.rightes Transactions by Directors of Listed Issuers.\n\n## Shareholder dilut/i.righton\n\nAll awards vesting under the Group's share plans are satisf/i.righted by the transfer of exist/i.rightng shares or, where appropriate, the issuance of new shares. The Group's share plans contain monitored lim/i.rightts that govern both the aggregate amount of awards that may be granted and the amount of shares that may be issued to satisfy any subsequent exercise of awards. These lim/i.rightts are in line with those stated in the Investment Associat/i.righton's Princ/i.rightples of Remuneration and the terms of our list/i.rightng on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Lim/i.rightted.\n\nThe Group has two employee benefit trusts that are admin/i.rightstered by independent trustees and which hold shares to meet various obligat/i.rightons under the Group's share plans. As each executive director is with/i.rightn the class of benefic/i.rightary of these trusts, they are deemed, for the purposes of the Companies Act 2006, to have an interest in the trusts' shares.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDetails of the trusts' shareholdings are set out in Note 28 to the financ/i.rightal statements on page 392\n\n## Histor/i.rightcal LTIP awards\n\nThe current posit/i.righton on vesting for unvested LTIP awards from the 2019 and 2020 performance years based on current performance and share price as of 31 December 2021 is set out in the tables below.

The amount of corporate tax, includ/i.rightng the bank levy, is included in the table because it is a sign/i.rightficant payment and illustrates the Group's contribut/i.righton through the tax system.\n\nActual\n\nAllocation\n\n|                                            | 2021  $m   | 2020  $m   | 2019  $m   | 2018  $m   | 2017  $m   |   2021  % |   2020  % |   2019  % |   2018  % |   2017  % |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Staff costs                                | 7,668      | 6,886      | 7,1 2 2    | 7, 074     | 6,758      |        84 |        85 |        74 |        75 |        83 |\n| Corporate taxation   includ/i.rightng levy | 1,138      | 1,193      | 1,720      | 1,763      | 1,367      |        12 |        15 |        18 |        19 |        17 |\n| Paid to shareholders   in div/i.rightdends | 375        | 0          | 720        | 561        | 0          |         4 |         0 |         8 |         6 |         0 |\n\n## Approach to risk adjustment\n\nIndiv/i.rightdual remuneration is aligned with our long-term interests and the time frame over which financ/i.rightal risks crystallise:\n\n- \u00b7 For relevant colleagues, a proportion of variable remuneration is delivered in the form of awards that are deferred for a suffic/i.rightent period of time during which risk adjustments can be applied.\n- \u00b7 The abil/i.rightty to apply performance adjustment through the reduction in the value of any deferred variable remuneration award through non-vesting due to performance considerat/i.rightons and share price movement over the deferral period.\n\nThe operation of in-year adjustments, malus and clawback is summarised in the following table:\n\n|                                   | Criter/i.righta includes                                                                                                                                       | Applicat/i.righton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Indiv/i.rightdual level           | \u00b7  \u00b7  The ind/i.rightvidual failed to meet appropriate standards  of fitness and propriety                                                                     | Deemed to have: (i) caused in full or in part a  material loss for the Group as a result of reckless,  negligent or wilful actions, or (i/i.right) exhib/i.rightted  inappropr/i.rightate behaviours, or (i/i.righti) applied a lack   of appropriate supervis/i.righton and due dil/i.rightgence \u00b7  In-year adjustment, malus and clawback may   be applied to all or part of an award at the  Committee's discret/i.righton |\n| Business unit and/or  Group level | \u00b7  Material restatement of the Group's financ/i.rightals \u00b7  Sign/i.rightficant failure in risk management \u00b7  Discovery of endemic problems in financ/i.rightal | \u00b7  In-year adjustment, malus and clawback may   be applied to all or part of an award at the  Committee's discret/i.righton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |",

For the 2021 performance year, the following structure applies:\n\n- \u00b7 At least 40 per cent of a material risk taker's variable remuneration will be deferred over a min/i.rightmum period of four years depending on the category of material risk taker.\n- \u00b7 Non-deferred variable remuneration will be delivered 50 per cent in shares, subject to a min/i.rightmum 12 month retention period, and 50 per cent in cash.\n- \u00b7 At least 50 per cent of deferred variable remuneration will be delivered entirely in shares, subject to a min/i.rightmum 12 month retention period (with the exception of deferred shares awarded to risk managers, which are subject to a six month min/i.rightmum retention period in line with the regulations).\n- \u00b7 For some material risk takers, part of their 2021 variable remuneration may be in share awards which vest after a min/i.rightmum of four years, subject to the satisfact/i.righton of performance measures.\n- \u00b7 Variable remuneration awards are subject to remuneration adjustment provis/i.rightons. This provides the Group with the abil/i.rightty to reduce or revoke variable remuneration in respect of a risk, control or conduct issue, event or behaviour.\n- \u00b7 Material risk takers are subject to a 2:1 maximum ratio of variable to fixed remuneration.",

This enables prior assessment of any conflict or potential conflict of interest and any impact on time commitment. On behalf of the Board, the Governance and Nominat/i.righton Committee reviews exist/i.rightng conflicts of interest annually to consider if they continue to be conflicts of interest, and also to revis/i.rightt the terms upon which they were determined to be. The Board is satis/fi.righted that our processes in this respect continue to operate effectively.\n\nSubject to company law, the Articles of Associat/i.righton and the authority granted to directors in general meeting, the directors may exercise all the powers of the Company and may delegate authorit/i.rightes to committees.

Newly appointed directors retire at the AGM following appointment and are elig/i.rightble for election. All directors are nominated for annual re-election by shareholders subject to continued satisfactory performance based upon their annual assessment.\n\nNon-executive directors are appointed for an in/i.righttial period of one year and subject to (re)election by shareholders at AGMs, in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018.\n\nThe Company has granted indemn/i.rightties to all of its directors on terms consistent with the applicable statutory provis/i.rightons. Qualify/i.rightng third-party indemn/i.rightty provis/i.rightons for the purposes of section 234 of the Companies Act 2006 were accordingly in force during the course of the financ/i.rightal year ended 31/uni00A0December 2021 and remain in force at the date of this report.\n\n## Qualify/i.rightng pension scheme indemn/i.rightties\n\nQualify/i.rightng pension scheme indemn/i.rightty provis/i.rightons (as defined by section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) were in force during the course of the financ/i.rightal year ended 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021 for the benefit of the UK's pension fund corporate trustee (Standard Chartered Trustees (UK) Lim/i.rightted), and remain in force at the date of this report.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant agreements\n\nThe Company is not party to any sign/i.rightficant agreements that would take effect, alter or terminate following a change of control of the Company. The Company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a takeover, except that provis/i.rightons of the Company's share schemes and plans may cause options and awards granted to employees under such schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.\n\n## Future developments in the business of the Group\n\nAn ind/i.rightcation of likely future developments in the business of the Group is provided in the Strategic report.\n\n## Results and div/i.rightdends\n\n2021: paid inter/i.rightm div/i.rightdend of 3 cents per ordinary share (2020: no inter/i.rightm div/i.rightdend paid)\n\n2021: proposed final div/i.rightdend of 9 cents per ordinary share (2020: paid final div/i.rightdend of 9 cents per ordinary share)\n\n2021: total div/i.rightdend of 12 cents per ordinary share (2020: total div/i.rightdend, 9 cents per ordinary share)\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe issued ordinary share capital of the Company was reduced by a total of 77,063,162 over the course of 2021.

Unless transactions between the Group and Temasek or its associates are specif/i.rightcally exempt under the Rules or are subject to a specif/i.rightc waiver, they may require a combinat/i.righton of announcements, reporting and independent shareholders' approval.\n\nOn 12 November 2021, the HKSE extended a waiver (the 'Waiver') it previously granted to the Company for the revenue banking transactions with Temasek which do not fall under the passive investor exemption (the 'Passive Investor Exemption') under Rules 14A.99 and 14A.100 of the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules. Under the Waiver, the HKSE agreed to waive the announcement requirement, the requirement to enter into a written agreement and set an annual cap, and the reporting (includ/i.rightng annual review) requirements under Chapter 14A for the three-year period ending 31 December 2024 on the condit/i.rightons that:\n\n- a)  The Company will disclose details of the Waiver (includ/i.rightng nature of the revenue banking transactions with Temasek and reasons for the Waiver) in subsequent annual reports; and\n- b)  The Company will continue to monitor the revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2024 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded.\n\nThe main reasons for seeking the Waiver were:\n\n- \u00b7 The nature and terms of revenue banking transactions may vary and evolve over time; having fixed-term written agreements would not be suitable to accommodate the various banking needs of the Company's customers (includ/i.rightng Temasek) and would be impract/i.rightcal and unduly burdensome.\n- \u00b7 It would be impract/i.rightcable to estimate and determine an annual cap on the revenue banking transactions with Temasek as the volume and aggregate value of each transaction are uncertain and unknown to the Company as a banking group due to multiple factors includ/i.rightng market driven factors.\n- \u00b7 The revenues generated from revenue banking transactions were ins/i.rightgnif/i.rightcant. Without a waiver from the HKSE or an applicable exemption, these transactions would be subject to various percentage ratio tests which cater for different types of connected transactions and as such may produce anomalous results.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the Group provided Temasek with money market and capital markets products and services that were revenue transactions in nature.\n\nAs a result of the Passive Investor Exemption and the Waiver, the vast major/i.rightty of the Company's transactions with Temasek and its associates fall outside of the connected transactions regime. However, non-revenue transactions with Temasek or any of its associates continue to be subject to monitor/i.rightng for connected transaction issues. The Company confirms that:\n\n- \u00b7 The revenue banking transactions entered into with Temasek in 2021 were below the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio test under the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules; and\n- \u00b7 It will continue to monitor revenue banking transactions with Temasek during the three years ending 31 December 2024 to ensure that the 5 per cent threshold for the revenue ratio will not be exceeded.\n\nThe Company therefore satisf/i.righted the condit/i.rightons of the Waiver.\n\n## Fixed assets\n\nDetails of addit/i.rightons to fixed assets are presented in Note 18 to the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Loan capital\n\nDetails of the loan capital of the Company and its subsid/i.rightaries are set out in Notes 22 and 27 to the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Debenture issues and equity-linked agreements\n\nDuring the financ/i.rightal year ended 31 December 2021, the Company made no issuance of debentures or equity-linked agreements.\n\n## Risk management 1\n\nThe Board is responsible for mainta/i.rightning and review/i.rightng the effectiveness of the risk management system. An ongoing process for ident/i.rightfying, evaluating and managing the sign/i.rightficant risks that we face is in place. The Board is satisf/i.righted that this process constitutes a robust assessment of all of the princ/i.rightpal risks, emerging risks and material cross-cutting risks facing the Group, includ/i.rightng those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liqu/i.rightdity.\n\n- 1 The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsid/i.rightaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entit/i.rightes of the Group.\n\nKey areas of risk on financ/i.rightal instruments for the directors included the impa/i.rightrment of loans and advances and valuation of financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value. This risk assessment and management is explained further in the Audit Committee Key areas and Action taken on page 120.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Risk review and Capital review on pages 194 to 293 sets out the princ/i.rightpal risks, emerging risks and integrated risks, our approach to risk management, includ/i.rightng our risk management princ/i.rightples, an overview of our Enterprise Risk Management Framework and the risk management and governance practices for each princ/i.rightpal risk type. The Boardapproved Risk Appetite Statement can be found on pages 264 to 279\n\nIn accordance with Article 435(1)(e) of the UK onshored Capital Requirements Regulation, the Board Risk Committee, on behalf of the Board, has considered the adequacy of the risk management arrangements of the Group and has sought and received assurance that the risk management systems in place are adequate with regard to the Group's profile and strategy.",

Its effectiveness is reviewed regularly by the Board, its committees, the Management Team and Group Internal Audit.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the Board Risk Committee has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal control. As part of this review, affirmat/i.righton was received that the Group Chief Risk Officer is satisf/i.righted that the Group's risk management and internal control framework is materially effective and adequately highl/i.rightghts risks and improvement areas for management attention. Group Internal Audit represents the third line of defence and provides independent assurance of the effectiveness of management's control of business activ/i.rightties (the first line) and of the control processes mainta/i.rightned by the Risk Framework Owners and Policy Owners (the second line). The audit programme includes obtain/i.rightng an understanding of the processes and systems under audit review, evaluating the design of controls, and testing the operating effectiveness and outcomes of key controls. The work of Group Internal Audit is focused on the areas of greatest risk as determined by a risk-based assessment methodology. The Board considers the internal control systems of the Company to be effective and adequate.\n\nGroup Internal Audit reports regularly to the Audit Committee, the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive; and the Group Head, Internal Audit reports directly to the Chair of the Audit Committee and admin/i.rightstratively to the Group Chief Executive. The find/i.rightngs of all adverse audits are reported to the Audit Committee, the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive where immed/i.rightate corrective action is required.\n\nThe Board Risk Committee has responsib/i.rightlity for overseeing the management of the Company's princ/i.rightpal risks as well as review/i.rightng the effectiveness of the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework. The Audit Committee monitors the integr/i.rightty of the Company's financ/i.rightal reporting, compliance and internal control environment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe risk management approach starting on page 258 describes the Group's risk management oversight committee structure.\n\nOur business is conducted with/i.rightn a developed control framework, underpinned by policy statements and standards. There are written polic/i.rightes and standards designed to ensure the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and management of risk, includ/i.rightng Credit Risk, Traded Risk, Treasury Risk, Operational and Technology Risk, Information and Cyber Security Risk, Compliance Risk, Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk, Model Risk and Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk. The Board has established a management structure that clearly defines roles, responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes and reporting lines.\n\n- 1 The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsid/i.rightaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entit/i.rightes of the Group.\n\nDelegated authorit/i.rightes are documented and communicated. Executive risk committees regularly review the Group's risk profile. The performance of the Group's businesses is reported regularly to senior management and the Board. Performance trends and forecasts, as well as actual performance against budgets and prior periods, are monitored closely. Financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton is prepared using appropriate accounting polic/i.rightes, which are applied consistently.\n\nOperational procedures and controls have been established to facil/i.righttate complete, accurate and timely processing of transactions and the safeguarding of assets. These controls include appropriate segregation of duties, the regular reconcil/i.rightation of accounts and the valuation of assets and posit/i.rightons. In respect of handling ins/i.rightde informat/i.righton, we have applied relevant controls on employees who are subject to handling ins/i.rightde informat/i.righton, includ/i.rightng controls over the dissem/i.rightnation of such informat/i.righton and their dealings in the Company's shares. Such systems are designed to manage rather than elim/i.rightnate the risk of failure to achieve business object/i.rightves and can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\n## Employee polic/i.rightes and engagement\n\nWe work hard to ensure that our employees are kept informed about matters affecting or of interest to them, but more importantly to provide opportunit/i.rightes for feedback and dialogue.\n\nWe continue to listen and act on feedback from colleagues to ensure internal communicat/i.rightons remain impactful and meaningful, in support of the Group's strategy and transformation. In addit/i.righton to the Bridge (our internal business collaboration platform) which allows colleagues to receive key updates, exchange ideas and provide feedback, we also leverage a range of channels includ/i.rightng email broadcasts, newsletters with customised content for each employee segment, audio and video calls, town halls and other staff engagement and recognit/i.righton events. To continue to improve the way we communicate and ensure our employee communicat/i.rightons remain relevant, we also period/i.rightcally analyse and measure the impact of our communicat/i.rightons through a range of survey and feedback tools.\n\nOur senior leaders and People Leaders continue to play a crit/i.rightcal role in engaging our teams across the network, ensuring that they are kept up to date on key business developments related to our performance and strategy. Our People Leaders also provide guidance and help colleagues understand their role in executing and deliver/i.rightng on the Bank's strategy. With the ongoing impact of the global pandemic, the Bank has also endeavoured to dissem/i.rightnate timely informat/i.righton that has enabled our colleagues to stay informed of the various national/internat/i.rightonal developments and more importantly, to ensure they are supported in terms of their physical and mental safety and wellbeing.\n\nAcross the organisat/i.righton, regular team meetings with People Leaders, one-to-ones and various management meetings provide an important platform for colleagues to discuss and clarify key issues. Regular performance conversations provide the opportunity to discuss how ind/i.rightviduals, the team and the business area have contributed to our overall performance and, in year-end conversations, how any compensation awards relate to this. The Bank's senior leadership (Group Chairman, CEO, Board) also regularly shares global, regional and country updates on financ/i.rightal performance, strategy, structural changes, HR programmes, performance reviews and campaigns.",

More informat/i.righton can be found on pages 113 and 114 in the Directors' report.\n\nEmployees, past, present and future can follow our progress through the Group's LinkedIn network and Facebook page, and other social network channels, which collectively have over 2.2 mill/i.righton followers.\n\nThe diverse range of communicat/i.righton tools and channels we have put in place, ensures that all our colleagues regardless of where they sit with/i.rightn our organisat/i.rightonal network receive timely and relevant informat/i.righton (in channels of their choosing) to support them in being effective in their various roles.\n\nThe wellbeing of our employees is central to our think/i.rightng about benefits and support, so that they can thrive at work and in their personal lives. Our Group min/i.rightmum standards provide employees with a range of flexible working options, and, in terms of leave, at least thirty days' leave (through annual leave and public holidays), a min/i.rightmum of twenty calendar weeks' fully paid maternity leave, a min/i.rightmum of two calendar weeks of leave for spouses or partners, and two calendar weeks for adoption leave. Combined, this is above the International Labour Organisat/i.righton min/i.rightmum standards.\n\nWe seek to build productive and enduring partnerships with various employee representative bodies (includ/i.rightng unions and work councils). In our recognit/i.righton and interact/i.rightons, we are heavily influenced by the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), and several International Labour Organisat/i.righton (ILO) conventions includ/i.rightng the Right to Organise and Collective Bargain/i.rightng Convention, 1949 (No. 98) and the Freedom of Associat/i.righton and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention, 1948 (No. 87). 14.3 per cent of employees across 21 markets are covered by collective bargain/i.rightng agreements and for employees not covered by collective bargain/i.rightng agreements, their working condit/i.rightons and terms of employment are based on the Bank's Group & Country polic/i.rightes and as per ind/i.rightvidual employment contracts issued by the Bank.\n\nThe Group Grievance Standard provides a formal framework to deal with concerns that employees have in relation to their employment or another colleague, which affects them directly, and cannot be resolved through informal mechanisms, such as counselling, coaching or mediat/i.righton. This can include issues of bullying, harassment, discr/i.rightminat/i.righton and vict/i.rightmisat/i.righton, as well as concerns around condit/i.rightons of employment (for example, health and safety, new working practices or the working environment). Employees can raise grievances to their People Leader or a Human Resources (HR) Representative. The global process to address grievances involves an HR representative and a member of the business review/i.rightng the grievance, conducting fact find/i.rightng into the grievance and provid/i.rightng a written outcome to the aggrieved employee. If a grievance is upheld, the next steps might include remedying a policy or process, or in/i.righttiat/i.rightng a disc/i.rightplinary review of the conduct of the subject of the grievance. The Group Grievance Standard and accompanying process is reviewed on a period/i.rightc basis in consultation with stakeholders across HR, Legal, Compliance and Shared Investigat/i.rightve Services. Grievance trends are reviewed on a quarterly basis and action plans are developed to address any concerning trends.\n\nThere is a dist/i.rightnct Group Speaking Up Policy which covers instances where an employee wishes to 'blow the whistle' on actual, planned or potential wrongdoing by another employee or the Group.\n\nThe Group is committed to creating a fair, consistent, and transparent approach to making decis/i.rightons in a disc/i.rightplinary context. This commitment is codif/i.righted in our Fair Accountabil/i.rightty Princ/i.rightples, which underpin our Group Disc/i.rightplinary Standard.\n\nDism/i.rightssals due to misconduct issues and/or performance (where required by law to follow a disc/i.rightplinary process) are governed by the Group Disc/i.rightplinary Standard. Where local law or regulation requires a different process with regards to dism/i.rightssals and other disc/i.rightplinary outcomes, we have country variances in place.\n\nOur Group Divers/i.rightty and Inclusion Standard has been developed to ensure a respectful workplace, with fair and equal treatment, divers/i.rightty and inclus/i.righton, and the provis/i.righton of opportunit/i.rightes for employees to partic/i.rightpate fully and reach their full potential in an appropriate working environment. The Group aims to provide equality of opportunity for all, protect the dign/i.rightty of employees and promote respect at work. All ind/i.rightviduals are entitled to be treated with dign/i.rightty and respect, and to be free from harassment, bullying, discr/i.rightminat/i.righton and vict/i.rightmisat/i.righton. This helps to support productive working condit/i.rightons, decreased staff attrit/i.righton, posit/i.rightve employee morale and engagement, mainta/i.rightns employee wellbeing, and reduces people-related risk. All employees and contractors are required to take personal responsib/i.rightlity to comply with the Standard, includ/i.rightng conducting themselves in a manner that demonstrates appropriate, non-discr/i.rightminatory behaviours.\n\nThe Group is committed to provide equal opportunit/i.rightes and fair treatment in employment. We do not accept unlawful discr/i.rightminat/i.righton in our recruitment or employment practices on any grounds includ/i.rightng but not lim/i.rightted to: sex, race, colour, national/i.rightty, ethnic/i.rightty, national or ind/i.rightgenous orig/i.rightn, disab/i.rightlity, age, marital or civ/i.rightl partner status, pregnancy or maternity, sexual orientat/i.righton, gender ident/i.rightty, expression or reassignment, HIV or AIDS status, parental status, mil/i.righttary and veterans status, flexib/i.rightlity of working arrangements, relig/i.righton or belief.\n\nWe strive for recruitment, appraisals, pay and condit/i.rightons, train/i.rightng, development, succession planning, promotion, grievance/disc/i.rightplinary procedures and employment terminat/i.righton practices that are inclus/i.rightve and accessible; and that do not directly or ind/i.rightrectly discr/i.rightminate.\n\nRecruitment, employment, train/i.rightng, development and promotion decis/i.rightons are based on the skills, knowledge and behaviour required to perform the role to the Group's standards. Implied in all employment terms is the commitment to equal pay for equal work. We will also make reasonable workplace adjustments (includ/i.rightng during the hir/i.rightng process) to ensure all ind/i.rightviduals feel supported and are able to partic/i.rightpate fully and reach their potential. If employees become disabled, we will proactively seek to support them with appropriate train/i.rightng and workplace adjustments where possible and explore every opportunity to ensure their employment continues.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nOur Health, Safety and Wellbeing (HSW) programme covers both mental and physical health and wellbeing. The Group complies with both external regulatory requirements and internal policy and standards for HSW in all markets. It is Group policy to ensure that the more stringent of the two requirements is always met, ensuring our HSW practices meet or exceed the regulatory min/i.rightmum. Compliance rates are reported at least biannually to each country's Management Team.",

Our global Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program offers help to someone developing a mental health problem, experienc/i.rightng a worsening of an exist/i.rightng mental illness or a mental health cris/i.rights. The mental health support is given until appropriate professional help is received, or the cris/i.rights resolved.\n\nIn 2021, we worked with an external certif/i.righted provider to develop our previously classroom-based MHFA train/i.rightng program into a virtual program which can be accessed by any colleague regardless of their location. To date we have trained over 400 mental health first aiders in 42 markets, covering 95 per cent of colleagues.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded no work-related fatalit/i.rightes or serious long-term work-related health issues in our staff, although 68 colleagues passed away from COVID-19 in non-workrelated situat/i.rightons. Whilst not mandatory, we 'strongly encourage' vaccinat/i.righton against COVID-19 for employees and have held vaccinat/i.righton drives where possible to assist colleagues and their famil/i.rightes to access vaccinat/i.rightons.\n\nMajor in/j.righturies (per the UK Health & Safety Executive defin/i.righttion) increased slightly from 23 in 2020 to 24, with fractures the most common type of major in/j.rightury (52 per cent). Overall, reported in/j.righturies reduced by six per cent, with 'slips/trips/falls' and 'transport/commuting' remain/i.rightng the most common causes of in/j.rightury. Our in/j.rightury rates remain aligned to, or better than industry benchmarks.\n\nHazards and near miss reports decreased 42 per cent between 2020 and 2021, and all premises are inspected at least annually to ident/i.rightfy any hazards, risks and inc/i.rightdences of non-compliance.\n\nThroughout 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact health, safety and wellbeing. With lockdowns and restrict/i.rightons continu/i.rightng across our markets throughout the year, we accelerated our Future Workplace Now plans and approximately 80 per cent of colleagues adopted working from home arrangements. Workplace closures and restricted operations resulted in a reduction in workplace accidents and inc/i.rightdents; however, home working introduced new and emerging risks to manage across health, safety and wellbeing. A H&S inspect/i.righton checklist is available for staff to assess their working area for hazards, and virtual assessments by H&S experts are organised if required. All staff opting to work flexibly receive an allowance to purchase ergonomic office equipment. Our work in/j.rightury insurance covers all staff working from home.\n\n## Major customers\n\nOur five largest customers together accounted for 1.7 per cent of our total operating income in the year ended 31 December 2021.\n\n## Major suppliers\n\nIn 2021, $4.1 bill/i.righton was spent with approximately 12,100 first tier suppliers. Of this, 73 per cent of the total spend was spent in the Asia region, with 19 per cent in Europe and the Americas, and eight per cent in Africa and the Middle East.\n\nOur five largest suppliers together accounted for 16 per cent of total spend, with the largest ten amounting to 24 per cent of total spend.\n\n## Supply chain management\n\nTo support the operation of our branches, offices, businesses and functions we source a variety of goods and services. The major/i.rightty of our expenditure is on services and is managed through a third-party governance framework which ensures that we follow the highest standards in terms of sourcing, awarding and onboarding suppliers.\n\nFor informat/i.righton about how the Group engages with suppliers on environmental and social matters, please see our Supplier Charter and Supplier Divers/i.rightty and Inclusion Standard.\n\nAs set out under the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, the Group is required to publish a Modern Slavery Statement annually. The Group's 2021 Modern Slavery Statement will be issued at the same time as the Annual Report. This document will give further detail on how the Group has prevented modern slavery and human traffick/i.rightng in its operations, financ/i.rightng and supply chain during 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Supplier Charter and Supplier Divers/i.rightty and Inclusion standard can be viewed at sc.com/en/group/suppliers/\n\nDetails of how we create value for our suppliers and other stakeholder groups can be found on pages 51 to 59\n\n## Product responsib/i.rightlity\n\nWe aim to design and offer products based on client needs to ensure fair treatment and outcomes for clients.\n\nThe Group has in place a risk framework, compris/i.rightng polic/i.rightes and standards, to support these object/i.rightves in alignment with our Conduct Risk Framework. This framework covers sales practices, client communicat/i.rightons, appropriateness and suitab/i.rightlity, and post-sales practice. As part of this, we ensure products sold are suitable for clients and comply with relevant laws and regulations. The Group does not manufacture products and therefore does not have a defined quality assurance process or recall procedures; nor does it sell or ship products that would be liable for return on heath and safety grounds.\n\nWe have processes and guidel/i.rightnes specif/i.rightc to each of our client businesses, to promptly resolve client complaints, understand and respond to client issues. Conduct considerat/i.rightons are given sign/i.rightficant weight/i.rightng in front-line incent/i.rightve structures to drive the right behaviours.\n\nFor more informat/i.righton on our approach to product design, product pric/i.rightng, treating customers fairly and protecting vulnerable customers, and incent/i.rightvis/i.rightng our frontline employees, see pages 51 and 52.

The Group has complied with applicable intellectual property laws and regulations.\n\n## Group Code of Conduct\n\nThe Board has adopted a Group Code of Conduct (the Code) relating to the lawful and ethical conduct of business and this is supported by the Group's valued behaviours. This has been communicated to all directors and employees, all of whom are expected to observe high standards of integr/i.rightty and fair dealing in relation to customers, employees and regulators in the communit/i.rightes in which the Group operates. Directors and employees are asked to recommit to the Code annually, and 99.6 per cent have completed the 2021 recommitment. All Board members have recommitted to the Code.\n\n## Managing environmental and social risk\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring that high standards of responsible business are mainta/i.rightned and that an effective control framework is in place. This encompasses risk associated with clients' operations and their potential impact on the environment, includ/i.rightng climate change, and local communit/i.rightes.\n\nThe Board recognises its responsib/i.rightlity to manage these risks and that failure to manage them adequately could have adverse impact on stakeholders as well as the Group. The Board, via the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee, reviews sustainab/i.rightlity prior/i.rightties, and oversees the development of, and delivery against, public commitments regarding the activ/i.rightties and/or businesses that the Group will or will not accept in alignment with our Here for good brand promise.\n\nAt a management level, the CEO, CCIB is responsible for sustainable finance, which incorporates E&S risk management. Led in 2021 by the Group Head, Conduct, Financ/i.rightal Crime and Compliance, a cross-business Sustainab/i.rightlity Forum is responsible for developing and deliver/i.rightng the Group's broader sustainab/i.rightlity strategy.\n\nStandard Chartered has publicly committed to the recommendations of the Financ/i.rightal Stabil/i.rightty Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations since 2017.\n\nOur comprehensive TCFD disclosure is published in a standalone report which provides informat/i.righton in a readily ident/i.rightfiable and accessible format for all interested stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA summary of the TCFD report can be found on pages 67 to 69, with the full report available at sc.com/tcfd\n\n## Community engagement\n\nWe collaborate with local partners to support social and economic development in communit/i.rightes across our markets.

As an office-based financ/i.rightal services provider, we generate min/i.rightmal hazardous waste or packaging material. As such, these issues are not material and we do not report them.\n\n## Environmental impact of our operations\n\nWe aim to min/i.rightmise the environmental impact of our operations as part of our commitment to be a responsible company. We report on energy, water and non-hazardous waste data which become the basis of our Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emiss/i.rightons management, as well as the targets we have set to reduce energy, water and waste consumption.\n\nDisclosures related to the Group's environmental polic/i.rightes as well as GHG, energy effic/i.rightency, water and waste performance metrics are included in the sustainable and responsible business section of the Strategic report on pages 74 and 75, and in the supplementary environment data table on page 451.\n\nOur reporting methodology is based upon the World Resources Institute/ World Business Council for Sustainable Development Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edit/i.righton). We report on all emiss/i.righton sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Reports) Regulations.\n\nUsing conversion factors from the International Energy Agency 2021 Emiss/i.rightons Factors and the UK Government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy, emiss/i.rightons are reported in metric tonnes of carbon diox/i.rightde equivalent (CO 2 e), encompassing the six Kyoto gases.\n\nScope 1 emiss/i.rightons are defined as aris/i.rightng from the consumption of energy from direct sources, during the use of property occupied by the Group. On-site combustion of fuels includ/i.rightng diesel, liquef/i.righted petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gas, is recorded using meters, or where metering is not available, collated from fuel vendor's invo/i.rightces. Emiss/i.rightons from the combustion of fuel in Group-operated transportation devices, as well as fugit/i.rightve emiss/i.rightons, are excluded as being immater/i.rightal.\n\nScope 2 emiss/i.rightons are defined as aris/i.rightng from the consumption of ind/i.rightrect sources of energy, during the use of property occupied by the Group. Energy generated off-site in the form of purchased electric/i.rightty, heat, steam or cooling, is collected as kilowatt hours consumed using meters or where metering is not available, collated from vendor's invo/i.rightces.\n\nApplicable to both Scope 1 and 2 emiss/i.rightons, we include all ind/i.rightrect and direct sources of energy consumed by build/i.rightng services (amongst other activ/i.rightties) with/i.rightn the space occupied by the Group, leased or owned. This can include base build/i.rightng services under landlord control, but over which we typically hold a reasonable degree of influence.\n\nAll data centre facil/i.rightties with condit/i.rightoning systems and hardware remain/i.rightng under the operational control of the Group are included in the reporting. This does not include energy used at outsourced data centre facil/i.rightties which are captured under Scope 3.\n\nScope 3 emiss/i.rightons occur as a consequence of the Group's activ/i.rightties but aris/i.rightng from sources not controlled by us. Business air travel data is collected as person kilometres travelled by seating class, by employees of the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Non-audit services\n\nThe Group's non-audit services policy ('the policy') was reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee on 28 October 2021. The policy is based on an overrid/i.rightng princ/i.rightple that, to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, the Group's auditor should only be used when either there is evidence that there is no alternative in terms of quality and there is no conflict with their duties as auditor. EY can be used where the work is required by a regulator or competent authority.\n\nThe policy clearly sets out the criter/i.righta for when the Audit Committee's prior written approval is required. The policy requires a conservative approach to be taken to the assessment of requests for EY to provide non-audit services. Subject to the overrid/i.rightng princ/i.rightple, the Audit Committee's view is that EY can be of value in a range of non-audit service activ/i.rightties and should be allowed to tender subject to the terms of the policy. The Group is required to take a conservative approach to interpret/i.rightng the potential threats to auditor independence and requires commensurately robust safeguards against them.\n\nUK legislat/i.righton and guidance from the FRC sets out threats to audit independence includ/i.rightng self-interest, self-review, famil/i.rightarity, taking of a management role or conducting advocacy. In particular, mainta/i.rightning EY's independence from the Group requires EY to avoid taking decis/i.rightons on the Group's behalf. It is also recognised as essential that management retains the decis/i.righton-making capabil/i.rightty as to whether to act on advice given by EY as part of a non-audit service. This means not just the abil/i.rightty to action the advice given, but to have suffic/i.rightent knowledge of the subject matter to be able to make a reasoned and independent judgement as to its valid/i.rightty. All of this is contained with/i.rightn the policy.\n\nBy way of (non-exhaustive) illustrat/i.righton of the applicat/i.righton of the princ/i.rightples set out in the policy, the following types of non-audit services are likely to be permiss/i.rightble under the policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of inter/i.rightm financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton and verif/i.rightcation of inter/i.rightm profits - the Group would also extend this to work on investor circulars in most foreseeable circumstances\n- \u00b7 Extended audit or assurance work on financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton and/or financ/i.rightal or operational controls, where this work is closely linked to the audit engagement\n- \u00b7 Agreed upon procedures on materials with/i.rightn or referenced in the annual report of the Group or an entity with/i.rightn the Group\n- \u00b7 Internal control review services\n\nStrictly prohib/i.rightted under the policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Bookkeeping, informat/i.righton technology and internal audit services\n- \u00b7 Corporate finance services, valuation services or lit/i.rightgation support\n- \u00b7 Tax or regulatory structuring proposals\n- \u00b7 Services where fees are paid on a contingent basis (in whole or in part)\n- \u00b7 Consulting services that actively assist in running the business in place of management as opposed to provid/i.rightng or validat/i.rightng informat/i.righton, which management then util/i.rightses in the operation of the business\n\nThe policy is not a prescribed list of non-audit services that EY is permitted to provide. Rather, each request for EY to provide non-audit services will be assessed on its own merits. The Audit Committee believes that such a case-by-case approach best accommodates (i) the need for the appropriate rigour and challenge to be applied to each request for EY to provide non-audit services while (i/i.right) preserving suffic/i.rightent flexib/i.rightlity for the Group to engage EY to provide non-audit services where they are able to deliver particular value to the Group and where the proposed services can be provided without compromis/i.rightng EY's object/i.rightvity and independence. To ensure that the Group will comply with a cap that lim/i.rightts fees on non-audit services provided by EY to under 70 per cent of the average Group audit fee from the previous three consecutive financ/i.rightal years, (which will apply from EY's fourth year of being the Group's external auditor), the policy requires that annual non-audit service fees are lower than 70 per cent of the average annual Group audit fee up to this time. The caps exclude audit related non-audit services and services carried out pursuant to law or regulation. For 2021, without deducting non-audit service fees which were required by law or regulation and performed by EY, the ratio was 0.4:1. Details relating to EY's remuneration as the Group statutory auditor and a descript/i.righton of the broad categories of the types of non-audit services provided by EY are given in Note 38 to the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the appointment of the Group's statutory auditor, its effectiveness and its relationsh/i.rightp with the Group, which includes monitor/i.rightng our use of the auditors for non-audit services and the balance of audit and non-audit fees paid.\n\nFollowing an annual performance and effectiveness review of EY, it was felt that EY is considered to be effective, object/i.rightve and independent in its role as Group statutory auditor.\n\nEach director believes that there is no relevant informat/i.righton of which our Group statutory auditor is unaware. Each has taken all steps necessary as a director to be aware of any relevant audit informat/i.righton and to establish that the Group statutory auditor is made aware of any pertinent informat/i.righton.\n\nEY will be in attendance at the 2022 AGM. A resolution to re-appoint EY as auditor was proposed at the Company's 2021 AGM and was successfully passed.\n\nEY is a Public Interest Entity Auditor recognised in accordance with the Hong Kong Financ/i.rightal Reporting Council Ordinance.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scott Corrigan\n\nInterim Group Company Secretary\n\n17 February 2022\n\nStandard Chartered PLC\n\nRegistered No. 966425",

Our key highl/i.rightghts from the past year are shown here.\n\n## Key highl/i.rightghts 2021\n\n- \u00b7 Asset quality has continued to improve in a challenging macroeconomic environment\n- \u00b7 Credit impa/i.rightrment sign/i.rightficantly reduced across all/uni00A0stages\n- \u00b7 The Group has mainta/i.rightned a strong liqu/i.rightdity and capital posit/i.righton\n\n## Our portfolio quality\n\nWide-ranging disrupt/i.righton to supply chains and ris/i.rightng inflat/i.righton levels, in addit/i.righton to the human cost of the pandemic, continued to place intense pressure on the major/i.rightty of our markets. Despite these extreme challenges, we have built a solid foundation that has helped us to deliver a good performance with a resil/i.rightent risk profile. This year demonstrated our commitment to strong and sustainable growth, with continued improvements seen in a number of our metrics since the end of 2020. Credit Risk remains elevated as the Group continues to monitor the impact of the pandemic and ongoing volatil/i.rightty in the real estate sector in China. Through our stress testing capabil/i.rightties and extensive portfolio reviews, we ident/i.rightfied and proactively managed a number of portfolios that were at risk, especially areas with higher vulnerabil/i.rightty to COVID-19 and volatile commodity prices, such as Aviat/i.righton, Hospital/i.rightty and Oil & Gas. To support our clients, we continued to enact comprehensive support schemes for retail and corporate customers, includ/i.rightng loan and interest repayment holidays, covenant relief, fee waivers or cancellations, loan extensions and new facil/i.rightties.\n\nIn the second half of the year, we began to see signs of recovery in some markets as actions taken by governments and vaccine roll-outs helped to alleviate the economic effects of the pandemic. However, the resurgence of COVID-19 infect/i.rightons and new variants saw increased cases as 2021 came to a close, and lockdowns were reintroduced in a number of territor/i.rightes. We remain vig/i.rightlant as the recovery remains uneven globally, with some countries increas/i.rightng reliance on vaccines as a means of managing the pandemic and other countries using a wider range of measures. The threat of prolonged weak economic outlooks may lead to a sustained period of increased risk aversion, uncertainty and emerging risks.\n\nThe Group's total gross loans and advances in 2021 were $304.1 bill/i.righton, an increase of $15.8 bill/i.righton from 2020. Stage 2 and 3 loans have improved since 2020 by $7 bill/i.righton to $24.9 bill/i.righton, as we continue to focus on high-quality orig/i.rightnation. Stage 3 loans decreased to $8.1 bill/i.righton (2020: $9.2 bill/i.righton), with the overall contribut/i.righton to the total remain/i.rightng unchanged at 3 per cent.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, stage 1 gross loans increased by $11.4 bill/i.righton to $122.4 bill/i.righton, representing 85 per cent of the portfolio (2020: 80 per cent), on the back of transfers from stage 2 and continued focus on orig/i.rightnation of investment grade lending. Compared to 2020, exposure in early alerts decreased by 49 per cent to $5.5 bill/i.righton (2020: $10.7 bill/i.righton), mainly due to reductions in counterparty exposure and clients being removed from early alert. While early alerts have decreased, the Group remains vig/i.rightlant in view of persistent challenging condit/i.rightons in some markets and sectors. Credit Grade 12 balances decreased to $1.7 bill/i.righton (2020: $2.2 bill/i.righton) mainly due to repayments and outflows to non-performing loans, that were partly offset by sovereign rating downgrades. The percentage of investment grade corporate exposure has also increased to 69 per cent compared to 62 per cent a year ago, reflecting an increase in repurchase agreement balances and high-quality orig/i.rightnations. Exposure to our top 20 corporate clients as a percentage of Tier 1 capital has increased by 1 per cent to 61 per cent (2020: 60 per cent), driven by increased exposure to investment grade clients. The Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking portfolios remain predominantly short-tenor and continue to be divers/i.rightfied across industry sectors, products, and geographies.\n\nOur Consumer, Private and Business Banking portfolio remains stable and resil/i.rightent despite ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic, with stage 1 gross loans increas/i.rightng by $8.0 bill/i.righton in 2021 driven by growth in Mortgage and Secured wealth products. Stage 1 loans represent 97 per cent of the Consumer, Private and Business Banking portfolio (2020: 97 per cent) with 96 per cent rated as 'Strong'. Stage 2 loans reduced by $0.7 bill/i.righton, mainly driven by mortgage loans movement from stage 2 to stage 1 due to forward-looking macroeconomic outlook improvement. Stage 3 loans remain stable at 1 per cent of the portfolio. The major/i.rightty of Consumer, Private and Business Banking products continue to be fully secured loans at 86 per cent of total loans (2020: 86 per cent). The overall average loan-to-value of the mortgage portfolio remains low at 41 per cent. The unsecured portfolio has remained flat compared to the previous year and continues to make up a small proportion of total Consumer, Private and Business Banking exposure.\n\nAverage Group Value at Risk (VaR) in 2021 was $54.8 mill/i.righton, a sign/i.rightficant decrease compared to the previous year (2020: $97.6 mill/i.righton) due to extreme market movements from 2020 dropping out of the one-year VaR time horizon. However, volatil/i.rightty started to increase in the second half of 2021, driven by the impact of new COVID-19 variants. Trading activ/i.rightties have remained relatively unchanged and primar/i.rightly client driven.",

We have re-assessed the methodology to better reflect the portabil/i.rightty of liqu/i.rightdity across the Group, while still consider/i.rightng currency convertib/i.rightlity and regulatory intra group lim/i.rightts. The Group's advances-to-deposits ratio has decreased by 2 per cent to 59.1 per cent, driven by an 8 per cent growth in customer\n\ndeposits, most of which came from corporate customers. Customer loan growth was mainly from mortgages in Singapore and Hong Kong, and corporate loans across the Group.\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital decreased by 28 basis points to 14.1 per cent (2020: 14.4 per cent).

Various short-term relief measures were implemented and we have increased engagement with our customers to find appropriate financ/i.rightng options where available. This includes enhancing our monitor/i.rightng of facil/i.rightty drawdowns, loan and interest repayment holidays, covenant relief, fee waivers or cancellations, loan extensions and new facil/i.rightties.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, 0.2 per cent of the portfolio are subject to relief measures. Around 68 per cent of the amounts approved are for tenor extensions of 90 days or less and approximately 17 per cent of the reliefs granted are to clients in vulnerable sectors.\n\nIn Consumer, Private and Business Banking, less than 1 per cent of total Consumer, Private and Business Banking exposure has had relief measures approved as at 31 December 2021, of which 51 per cent is fully secured. Through the use of customer surveys and analysis of the COVID-19 impact and delinquency trends, we have ident/i.rightfied a higher-risk cohort of Business Banking customers which are being actively managed. 56 per cent of the Business Banking portfolio is fully secured by property or government guarantees.\n\nWhile the macroeconomic environment has stabil/i.rightsed for the major/i.rightty of the markets in our footprint, we continue to be cognisant of the potential longer-term impact, especially as relief measures have now been eased in most of our major markets.\n\nWe are managing exposures to a set of ident/i.rightfied vulnerable sectors includ/i.rightng Aviat/i.righton, Oil & Gas, Commodity Traders, Metals & Min/i.rightng, Commercial Real Estate and Hotels & Tourism particularly closely. These sectors represent 28 per cent (31 December 2021: 27 per cent) of the total net exposure in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, with the increase of 10 per cent to $72.5 bill/i.righton (2020: $65.6 bill/i.righton) largely due to higher levels of undrawn commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees, particularly in the Commodity Traders and Commercial Real Estate sectors.\n\n## Stage 3 loans\n\nOverall, stage 3 gross loans and advances to customers decreased by 12 per cent in 2021, from $9.2 bill/i.righton to $8.1 bill/i.righton. Stage 3 provis/i.rightons decreased by $0.7 bill/i.righton to $4.7 bill/i.righton.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, gross stage 3 loans decreased by $1.1 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2020 due to debt sales and repayments in Asia, and Africa and Middle East regions. Provis/i.rightons decreased by $0.7 bill/i.righton to $3.9 bill/i.righton driven by repayments and write-offs. Inflows into stage 3 were lower by 53 per cent at $1.7 bill/i.righton, compared with $3.6 bill/i.righton in 2020. The new inflows in 2021 were mainly in Asia, and Africa and the Middle East.\n\nGross stage 3 loans in Consumer, Private and Business Banking remained broadly stable at $1.6 bill/i.righton.",

        "page_content": "The stage 3 cover ratio (excluding collateral) in the total customer loan book remained at 58 per cent. Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking cover ratio decreased by 1 per cent to 59 per cent as a result of write-offs and new accounts with a lower coverage than exist/i.rightng stage 3 loans. The Consumer, Private and Business Banking cover ratio is 51 per cent (2020: 47 per cent) primar/i.rightly due to a new provis/i.righton taken on a Business Banking client. The cover ratio includ/i.rightng collateral decreased to 75 per cent (2020: 76 per cent).\n\n## Credit impa/i.rightrment\n\nAt Group level, total credit impa/i.rightrment charge includ/i.rightng the restructuring portfolio sign/i.rightficantly reduced to $0.3 bill/i.righton (2020: $2.3 bill/i.righton) representing a loan loss rate of 7 basis points (bps) of average customer loans and advances (2020: 66 bps). Decreases were seen across all stages, with stage 3 impa/i.rightrment down by $1.3 bill/i.righton, major/i.rightty of which was from Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment decreased by $749 mill/i.righton, partly due to reduction in stage 2 exposures from lower levels of early alerts, addit/i.rightonal collateral and improvement in probabil/i.rightty of default, and partly due to improv/i.rightng macroeconomic forecasts and reduction in COVID-19 management overlays.\n\nCorporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking saw a release of $44 mill/i.righton, a sign/i.rightficant improvement compared with the credit impa/i.rightrment charge of $1.5 bill/i.righton last year. Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment is a net charge of $23 mill/i.righton mainly driven by charges from a post model adjustment for multiple economic scenarios and the sovereign downgrade of Sri Lanka. The COVID-19 management overlays also reduced by $95 mill/i.righton although this was offset by a new, separately assessed management overlay of $95 mill/i.righton over the end of 2021 for the Commercial Real Estate exposures in China. Stage 3 credit release of $67 mill/i.righton was due to sign/i.rightficant recoveries during the year.\n\nConsumer, Private and Business Banking credit impa/i.rightrment has decreased (2021: $285 mill/i.righton, 2020: $741 mill/i.righton). Stage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment were sign/i.rightficantly lower compared with 2020 at $32 mill/i.righton, mainly due to ECL reversals as the forward-looking macroeconomic outlook improved in relative terms. Stage 3 credit impa/i.rightrment of $253 mill/i.righton decreased by 23 per cent driven by better recoveries.\n\nCentral and other items saw a total impa/i.rightrment of $22 mill/i.righton primar/i.rightly due to multiple economic scenario post model adjustments.\n\nThere was a net $9 mill/i.righton impa/i.rightrment release from the Group's discont/i.rightnued businesses.\n\n|                                                                | 2021                         | 2021                     | 2021                   | 2020                         | 2020                     | 2020                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                | Stage 1 & 2  $mill/i.righton | Stage 3  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Stage 1 & 2  $mill/i.righton | Stage 3  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Ongoing business portfolio                                     |                              |                          |                        |                              |                          |                        |\n| Corporate, Commercial &  Institut/i.rightonal/uni00A0Banking 1 | 23                           | (67)                     | (44)                   | 390                          | 1,139                    | 1,529                  |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking 1                         | 32                           | 253                      | 285                    | 413                          | 328                      | 741                    |\n| Central & other items                                          | 23                           | (1)                      | 22                     | 24                           | -                        | 24                     |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment charge/(release)                      | 78                           | 185                      | 263                    | 827                          | 1,467                    | 2,294                  |\n| Restructuring business portfolio                               |                              |                          |                        |                              |                          |                        |\n| Others                                                         | (2)                          | (7)                      | (9)                    | -                            | 31                       | 31                     |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment charge/(release)                      | (2)                          | (7)                      | (9)                    | -                            | 31                       | 31                     |\n| Total credit impa/i.rightrment charge/ (release)               | 76                           | 178                      | 254                    | 827                          | 1,498                    | 2,325                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details of the risk performance for 2021 is set out in the Risk profile section (pages 199 to 257)",

Identif/i.rightcation and assessment of potentially adverse risk events is an essential first step in managing the risks of any business or activ/i.rightty and in order to facil/i.righttate that, the Group mainta/i.rightns a dynamic risk-scanning process with inputs from the internal and external risk environment, as well as potential threats and opportunit/i.rightes from the business and client perspectives, enabling us to proactively manage our portfolio. The Group mainta/i.rightns a taxonomy of the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types (PRTs), Integrated Risk Types (IRTs) and risk subtypes that are inherent to the strategy and business model; as well as an emerging risks inventory that includes near-term risks as well as longer-term uncertaint/i.rightes.\n\n## We have a robust risk management approach supported through our well-established ERMF\n\n- \u00b7 Cross-cutting risks have been reposit/i.rightoned as IRTs and are defined as risks that are sign/i.rightficant in nature and material/i.rightse primar/i.rightly through the relevant PRTs\n- \u00b7 Given their integrated nature, Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk and Third-Party Risk, in addit/i.righton to Climate Risk, have been categorised as IRTs in the ERMF\n- \u00b7 The Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity PRT has been renamed to Treasury Risk and the scope of the risk type has been expanded to cover Interest Rate Risk in the banking book\n- \u00b7 Self-assessments performed in our footprint markets reflect the maturing ERMF adoption with emphasis on first-line ownership of risks\n- \u00b7 The more mature financ/i.rightal risks continued to be more effectively managed on a relative basis compared to non-financ/i.rightal risks in 2021, and other aspects of the ERMF are established and operating to a more consistent standard\n- \u00b7 The Group aims to further strengthen its risk management practices in 2022, through further improv/i.rightng on the management of non-financ/i.rightal risks with/i.rightn its businesses, functions and across the footprint, as well as management of risks which are integrated in nature\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details on the ERMF can be found in the Risk management approach section on page 258\n\nDespite the challenges of the ongoing pandemic, our solid foundation has helped us to deliver a good performance with a resil/i.rightent risk profile. Our corporate portfolios remain predominantly short-tenor and divers/i.rightfied across industry sectors, products and geographies. We have seen improvements in a number of our metrics that reflect our robust risk management during the pandemic. We remain vig/i.rightlant to the continued impact of COVID-19 and an uneven global recovery.

The overall stage 3 cover ratio remained stable at 58 per cent (2020: 58 per cent)\n- \u00b7 The major/i.rightty of our Consumer, Private & Business Banking products continue to be fully secured loans (stable at 86 per cent of the portfolio). The overall average loan-to-value of the mortgage portfolio is low at 41 per cent\n\n## Our capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.rightons continue to be at healthy levels\n\n- \u00b7 We remain well capital/i.rightsed and our balance sheet remains highly liqu/i.rightd\n- \u00b7 The Group liqu/i.rightdity coverage ratio has remained stable at 143 per cent\n- \u00b7 We continue to have a strong advances-to-deposits ratio\n- \u00b7 Our customer deposit base is divers/i.rightfied by type and maturity\n- \u00b7 Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is 14.1 per cent (2020: 14.4 per cent).

Cash and balances at Central banks increased by $6 bill/i.righton and loans and advances to customers grew by $17 bill/i.righton. Of the $17 bill/i.righton increase, $6 bill/i.righton was in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking. Consumer, Private and Business Banking increased by $7.4 bill/i.righton largely in Mortgage and Secured wealth products, and Central and other items increased by $3 bill/i.righton. There was an increase of $21 bill/i.righton in fair value through profit and loss instruments and an increase of $10 bill/i.righton in investment securit/i.rightes debt, offset by a $17 bill/i.righton decrease in derivat/i.rightve exposures.\n\n|                                                                                          | 2021 Credit Risk management        | 2021 Credit Risk management   | 2021 Credit Risk management                  | 2021 Credit Risk management    | 2020 Credit Risk management        | 2020 Credit Risk management   | 2020 Credit Risk management                  | 2020 Credit Risk management    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                                                          | Maximum  exposure  $mill/i.righton | Collateral 8 $mill/i.righton  | Master  netting  agreements  $mill/i.righton | Net  exposure  $mill/i.righton | Maximum  exposure  $mill/i.righton | Collateral 8 $mill/i.righton  | Master  netting  agreements  $mill/i.righton | Net  exposure  $mill/i.righton |\n| On-balance sheet                                                                         |                                    |                               |                                              |                                |                                    |                               |                                              |                                |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                                       | 72,663                             |                               |                                              | 72,663                         | 66,712                             |                               |                                              | 66,712                         |\n| Loans and advances to banks 1                                                            | 44,383                             | 1,079                         |                                              | 43,304                         | 44,347                             | 1,247                         |                                              | 43,100                         |\n| of which -

Total stage 1 balances increased by $47 bill/i.righton, of which around $23 bill/i.righton was in loans and advances to customers. Of the $23 bill/i.righton increase in loans to customers, $11 bill/i.righton was in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking and $8 bill/i.righton was in Consumer, Private and Business Banking across Mortgage and Secured wealth products. Off-balance sheet exposures increased by $11.3 bill/i.righton due to an increase of $5.8 bill/i.righton in undrawn commitments and a $5.4 bill/i.righton increase in financ/i.rightal guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letter of credit.\n\nStage 2 financ/i.rightal instruments reduced to $34.6 bill/i.righton (2020: $39.9 bill/i.righton) due to exposure changes and partly due to transfers to stage 1 in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking as early alert balances reduced.

Only the ECL is recorded on-balance sheet as a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity and therefore there is no 'net carrying amount'.

All loans are assigned a CG, which is reviewed period/i.rightcally and amended in light of changes in the borrower's circumstances or behaviour. CGs 1 to 12 are assigned to stage 1 and stage 2 (performing) clients or accounts, while CGs 13 and 14 are assigned to stage 3 (defaulted) clients. The mapping of credit quality is as follows.\n\n## Mapping of credit quality\n\nThe Group uses the following internal risk mapping to determine the credit quality for loans.\n\n|                                    | Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking   | Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking   | Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking   | Private Banking 1      | Business Banking                                  |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit quality  descript/i.righton | Internal grade mapping                                 | S&P external ratings  equivalent                       | Regulatory PD range (%)                                | Internal ratings       | Number of days past due                           |\n| Strong                             | 1A to 5B                                               | AAA to BB+                                             | 0 to 0.425                                             | Class I and Class IV   | Current loans (no past  dues nor impa/i.rightred) |\n| Satisfactory                       | 6A to 11C                                              | BB to B-/CCC 2                                         | 0.426 to 15.75                                         | Class II and Class III | Loans past due till   29 days                     |\n| Higher risk                        | Grade 12                                               | CCC/C                                                  | 15.751 to 99.999                                       | GSAM managed           | Past due loans   30 days and over   till 90 days  |\n\nConsumer &\n\nThe table overleaf sets out the gross loans and advances held at amortised cost, expected credit loss provis/i.rightons and expected credit loss coverage by business segment and stage. Expected credit loss coverage represents the expected credit loss reported for each segment and stage as a proportion of the gross loan balance for each segment and stage.\n\n## Stage 1:\n\nStage 1 gross loans and advances to customers increased by $23 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2020 and represent an increase of 3 per cent. Stage 1 gross balances represent 92 per cent of loans and advances to customers (2020: 89 per cent). The stage 1 coverage ratio remained at 0.2 per cent compared with 31 December 2020.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, the proportion of stage 1 loans has increased to 85 per cent (2020: 80 per cent), and the percentage of stage 1 loans rated as strong is higher at 64 per cent (2020: 58 per cent) as the Group continues to focus on the orig/i.rightnation of investment grade lending. Stage 1 loans increased by $11 bill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly in the Government, Manufacturing and Consumer durables sectors.\n\nConsumer, Private and Business Banking stage 1 loans increased by $8 bill/i.righton primar/i.rightly driven by new lending in Mortgage and Secured wealth products. The proportion rated as strong remained stable at 96 per cent.\n\n## Stage 2:\n\nStage 2 gross loans and advances to customers decreased by $6 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2020, and the proportion of stage 2 loans also reduced to 5.5 per cent from 7.9 per cent per cent due to changes in exposures and also due to transfers to stage 1 in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking.\n\nConsumer, Private and Business Banking stage 2 loans saw a decrease of $0.7 bill/i.righton, mainly driven by mortgage loans movement from stage 2 to stage 1 due to forward-looking macroeconomic outlook improvement.\n\nStage 2 loans to customers classif/i.righted as 'Higher risk' decreased by $0.9 bill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly driven by lower inflows from early alert non-purely precautionary, offset by outflows to stage 3.\n\nThe overall stage 2 cover ratio reduced from 3.3 per cent to 3.1 per cent.\n\n## Stage 3:\n\nStage 3 gross loans and advances to customers decreased by 12 per cent to $8.1 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2020 of $9.2 bill/i.righton. Stage 3 provis/i.rightons decreased by $0.7 bill/i.righton to $4.7 bill/i.righton. The stage 3 cover ratio (excluding collateral) remained stable at 58 per cent.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, gross stage 3 loans decreased by $1.1 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2020 due to debt sales and repayments in Asia and Africa and the Middle East regions. Provis/i.rightons decreased by $0.7 bill/i.righton to $3.9 bill/i.righton also driven by repayments and write-offs. Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking cover ratio decreased by 1 per cent as a result of write-offs and new accounts with a lower coverage than exist/i.rightng stage 3 loans.\n\nIn Consumer, Private and Business Banking, stage 3 loans remained stable at 1 per cent of the portfolio while the cover ratio improved by 4 per cent to 51 per cent (2020: 47 per cent) due to a new provis/i.righton taken on a Business Banking client.",

        "page_content": "## Movement in gross exposures and credit impa/i.rightrment for loans and advances, debt securit/i.rightes, undrawn commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees (audited)\n\nThe tables overleaf set out the movement in gross exposures and credit impa/i.rightrment by stage in respect of amortised cost loans to banks and customers, undrawn commitments, financ/i.rightal guarantees and debt securit/i.rightes classif/i.righted at amortised cost and FVOCI. The tables are presented for the Group, debt securit/i.rightes and other elig/i.rightble bills.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe movement lines with/i.rightn the tables are an aggregation of monthly movements over the year and will therefore reflect the accumulation of multiple trades during the year. The credit impa/i.rightrment charge in the income statement comprises the amounts with/i.rightn the boxes in the table below less recoveries of amounts previously written off. Discount unwind is reported in net interest income and related to stage 3 financ/i.rightal instruments only.\n\nThe approach for determin/i.rightng the key line items in the tables is set out below.\n\n- \u00b7 Transfers - transfers between stages are deemed to occur at the beginn/i.rightng of a month based on prior month closing balances\n- \u00b7 Net remeasurement from stage changes - the remeasurement of credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons aris/i.rightng from a change in stage is reported with/i.rightn the stage that the assets are transferred to. For example, assets transferred into stage 2 are remeasured from a 12-month to a lifet/i.rightme expected credit loss, with the effect of remeasurement reported in stage 2. For stage 3, this represents the in/i.righttial remeasurement from specif/i.rightc provis/i.rightons recognised on ind/i.rightvidual assets transferred into stage 3 in the year\n- \u00b7 Net changes in exposures - new business written less repayments in the year. With/i.rightn stage 1, new business written will attract up to 12 months of expected credit loss charges. Repayments of non-amortis/i.rightng loans (primar/i.rightly with/i.rightn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking) will have low amounts of expected credit loss provis/i.rightons attributed to them, due to the release of provis/i.rightons over the term to maturity. In stages 2 and 3, the amounts princ/i.rightpally reflect repayments although stage 2 may include new business written where clients are on non-purely precautionary early alert, are credit grade 12, or when non-investment grade debt securit/i.rightes are acquired.\n- \u00b7 Changes in risk parameters - for stages 1 and 2, this reflects changes in the probabil/i.rightty of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) of assets during the year, which includes the impact of releasing provis/i.rightons over the term to maturity. It also includes the effect of changes in forecasts of macroeconomic variables during the year and movements in management overlays. In stage 3, this line represents addit/i.rightonal specif/i.rightc provis/i.rightons recognised on exposures held with/i.rightn stage 3\n- \u00b7 Interest due but not paid - change in contractual amount of interest due in stage 3 financ/i.rightal instruments but not paid, being the net of accruals, repayments and write-offs, together with the corresponding change in credit impa/i.rightrment\n\nChanges to ECL models, which incorporates changes to model approaches and methodologies, is not reported as a separate line item as it has an impact over a number of lines and stages.\n\n## Movements during the year\n\nStage 1 gross exposures increased by $42 bill/i.righton to $685 bill/i.righton when compared with 31 December 2020. Half of this increase in exposures was in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, from new orig/i.rightnations and transfers from stage 2 in part due to upgrades of accounts from non-purely precautionary early alert. There was a $9 bill/i.righton increase in Consumer, Private and Business Banking which was mainly driven by new orig/i.rightnations in mortgage and secured wealth products. Addit/i.rightonally, there was a $8 bill/i.righton increase in debt securit/i.rightes in stage 1.\n\nTotal stage 1 provis/i.rightons decreased by $54 mill/i.righton to $609 mill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly in Consumer, Private and Business Banking unsecured lending, due to an improvement in macroeconomic forecasts for Singapore and Hong Kong. Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking provis/i.rightons increased by $9 mill/i.righton primar/i.rightly due to an overlay taken for China Commercial real estate exposures of $31 mill/i.righton offset by improvement in probabil/i.rightty of default.\n\nStage 2 gross exposures decreased by $5 bill/i.righton to $35 bill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly driven by $6 bill/i.righton of net outflows from exposure changes and transfers to stage 1 in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, particularly in the Manufacturing and Commercial Real Estate sectors. Consumer, Private and Business Banking exposures decreased by $0.9 bill/i.righton, of which $0.7 bill/i.righton was from the secured portfolio (mainly mortgages in Asia), and $0.2 bill/i.righton was from unsecured portfolios. Debt securit/i.rightes increased by $1.8 bill/i.righton mainly due to the Sri Lanka sovereign downgrade.\n\nStage 2 provis/i.rightons decreased by $229 mill/i.righton compared to 31 December 2020, $174 mill/i.righton of which was in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking as a result of exposure changes and transfers to stage 1, repayment of exposures, increased collateral and a net reduction of $31 mill/i.righton in judgemental management overlays (which are reported in 'Changes in risk parameters' in the table). The COVID-19 management overlay reduced by $95 mill/i.righton as early alert balances fell, this was partly offset by an overlay taken for China Commercial Real Estate exposures of $64 mill/i.righton. Consumer, Private and Business Banking provis/i.rightons decreased by $72 mill/i.righton, mainly in unsecured lending from improvement in macroeconomic forecasts, and lower delinquenc/i.rightes as condit/i.rightons normalised in a number of our markets.\n\nThe impact of changes in macroeconomic forecasts decreased provis/i.rightons by $5 mill/i.righton (2020: increase of $81 mill/i.righton), which includes a $51 mill/i.righton multiple economic scenario post model adjustment.\n\nNew ECL models implemented during the year decreased provis/i.rightons by $3 mill/i.righton.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, gross stage 3 loans decreased by $1.1 bill/i.righton compared with 31 December 2020 due to debt sales and repayments in Asia and Africa and the Middle East regions. Provis/i.rightons decreased by $0.7 bill/i.righton to $3.9 bill/i.righton also driven by repayments and write-offs. Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking cover ratio decreased by 1 per cent as a result of write-offs and new accounts with a lower coverage than exist/i.rightng stage 3 loans. Consumer, Private and Business Banking total stage 3 loans remained broadly stable at $1.6 bill/i.righton.",

This may not be the same driver that caused the in/i.righttial transfer into stage 2.\n\nWhere multiple drivers apply, the exposure is allocated based on the table order. For example, a loan may have breached the PD thresholds and could also be on non-purely precautionary early alert; in this instance, the exposure is reported under 'Increase in PD'.\n\n|                                         | 2021                                                  | 2021                                                  | 2021                                                  | 2021                                   | 2021                                   | 2021                                   | 2021                   | 2021                  | 2021                  | 2021                   | 2021                 | 2021        |\n|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------|\n|                                         | Corporate, Commercial &  Institut/i.rightonal banking | Corporate, Commercial &  Institut/i.rightonal banking | Corporate, Commercial &  Institut/i.rightonal banking | Consumer, Private &   Business Banking | Consumer, Private &   Business Banking | Consumer, Private &   Business Banking | Central & other items  | Central & other items | Central & other items |                        |                      |             |\n|                                         | Gross  $mill/i.righton                                | ECL  $mill/i.righton                                  | Coverage  %                                           | Gross  $mill/i.righton                 | ECL  $mill/i.righton                   | Coverage  %                            | Gross  $mill/i.righton | ECL  $mill/i.righton  | Coverage  %           | Gross  $mill/i.righton | ECL  $mill/i.righton | Coverage  % |\n| Increase in PD                          | 14,737                                                | 187                                                   | 1.3%                                                  | 2,704                                  | 122                                    | 4.5%                                   | 4,691                  | 22                    | 0.5%                  | 22,132                 | 331                  | 1.5%        |\n| Non-purely  precautionary   early alert | 5,000                                                 | 26                                                    | 0.5%                                                  | 83                                     | -

Although 'Higher risk' lending balances decreased compared to 2020, the portion of exposures in stage 2 with a 'High risk' driver increased, as a higher proportion of CG12 accounts were included with/i.rightn 'Increase in PD' in 2020.\n\n10 per cent of the provis/i.rightons held against stage 2 Consumer, Private and Business Banking exposures arise from the applicat/i.righton of the 30 days past due backstop, although this represents only 5 per cent of exposures. The proportion of PD driven exposures in stage 2 has reduced compared to 2020 as the impact of COVID-19 measures reduced in the Group's major Consumer Banking markets.\n\nThe Central and other items segment has seen a sign/i.rightficant increase in the 'Higher risk' category at 31 December 2021 primar/i.rightly due to newly downgraded sovereign counterparties in Sri Lanka.\n\n'Others' primar/i.rightly incorporates exposures where orig/i.rightnation data is incomplete and the exposures are allocated into stage/uni00A02.\n\n## Credit impa/i.rightrment charge (restated 1 ) (audited)\n\nThe ongoing credit impa/i.rightrment is a net charge of $263 mill/i.righton (2020: $2,294 mill/i.righton). The net charge of $263 mill/i.righton is div/i.rightded across Consumer, Private and Business Banking $285 mill/i.righton and $22 mill/i.righton in Central and other items, partly offset by release of $44 mill/i.righton in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking.\n\nStage 1 and 2 impa/i.rightrment is a net charge of $78 mill/i.righton.",

Measures in most markets have now expired, although moratoria schemes in certain Africa and the Middle East countries have been extended to 30 June 2022.\n\nThese schemes are generally in/i.righttiated by country regulators and governments. Measures include princ/i.rightpal and/or interest moratoria and term extensions, and are generally available to elig/i.rightble borrowers (those that are current or less than 30 days past due, unless local regulators have specif/i.righted different criter/i.righta). Certain schemes may be restricted to those in industr/i.rightes sign/i.rightficantly impacted by COVID-19, such as aviat/i.righton or consumer services, but are not borrower-specif/i.rightc in nature.\n\nRelief measures are generally mandated or supported by regulators and governments and are available to all elig/i.rightble customers who request it. However, in a number of countries, particularly in Asia and Africa and the Middle East, compulsory (regulatory approved) moratoria reliefs are applied to all elig/i.rightble loans unless a customer has specif/i.rightcally asked to opt out.\n\nIn most major Consumer, Private and Business Banking markets, the in/i.righttial period of relief provided was between 6 and 12 months. In some smaller markets, the in/i.righttial period of relief was for 3 months.\n\nCOVID-19 related tenor extensions have also been made available to Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking clients, primar/i.rightly for periods between 3 to 9 months, if they are expected to return to normal payments with/i.rightn 12 months.\n\n## Assessment for expected credit losses\n\nCOVID-19 payment reliefs that are generally available to a market or industry as a whole and are not borrower-specif/i.rightc in nature have not, on their own, resulted in an automatic change in stage (that is, ind/i.rightvidual customers are not considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk or an improvement in credit risk) nor have they been considered to be forborne.\n\nA customer's stage and past due status reflects their status immed/i.rightately prior to the granting of the relief, with past due amounts assessed based on the new terms as set out in the temporary payment reliefs.\n\nIf a customer requires addit/i.rightonal support after the expiry of generally available payment reliefs, these will be considered at a borrower level, after taking into account their ind/i.rightvidual circumstances. Depending on the type of subsequent support provided, these customers may be classif/i.righted with/i.rightn stage 2 or stage 3.\n\nWhere client level government guarantees are in place, these do not affect staging but are taken into account when determin/i.rightng the level of credit impa/i.rightrment.\n\nof 2021 (2020: $413 mill/i.righton) mainly due to ECL reversals as the forward-looking macroeconomic outlook improved in relative terms.\n\nThe Central and other items segment stage 1 and 2 is a net charge of $23 mill/i.righton primar/i.rightly due to multiple economic scenario post model adjustments.\n\nStage 3 impa/i.rightrment is a net charge of $185 mill/i.righton.\n\nThere was a release of $67 mill/i.righton from Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking stage 3 credit impa/i.rightrment due to sign/i.rightficant recoveries during the year. Consumer, Private and Business Banking stage 3 credit impa/i.rightrment of $253 mill/i.righton decreased from $328 mill/i.righton, driven by better recoveries.",

        "page_content": "## Impact from temporary changes to loan contractual terms\n\nThe granting of COVID-19 payment-related relief measures may cause a time value of money loss for the Group where interest is not permitted to be compounded (that is, interest charged on interest) or where interest is not permitted to be charged or accrued during the relief period. As set out above, such reliefs do not impact a customer's stage and are not considered to be forborne even though a time value of money loss arises. As the relief periods are relatively short-term in nature, and a small percentage of the total loans outstanding, this has not resulted in a material impact for the Group.\n\nThe table below sets out the extent to which payment reliefs are in place across the Group's loan portfolio based on the amount outstanding at 31 December 2021.\n\nThe Consumer, Private and Business Banking portfolio under moratoria reduced to $1,182 mill/i.righton compared to $2,372 mill/i.righton at the end of 2020 and a peak of $8.9 bill/i.righton in the first half of\n\n2020, with the remain/i.rightng balance primar/i.rightly concentrated in Asia. This represents less than 1 per cent of the Group's gross loans and advances to banks and customers. 51 per cent of relief measures are fully secured. 31 per cent of the total amounts approved are to Business Banking customers, concentrated in industr/i.rightes that have been materially disrupted. 79 per cent of the total amounts approved are in stage 1 and 2 per cent in stage 2, the latter mainly in Malaysia where compulsory (regulatory mandated) relief measures are in place. 79 per cent of stage 2 accounts under relief measures are collateralised by immovable property.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, 0.2 per cent of the portfolio are subject to relief measures. Around 68 per cent of the amounts approved are for tenor extensions of 90 days or less and approximately 17 per cent of the reliefs granted are to clients in vulnerable sectors.\n\n## COVID-19 relief measures\n\n|                                                        | Total                        | Total              | Asia                         | Asia               | Africa & Middle East 1       | Africa & Middle East 1   | Europe & Americas            | Europe & Americas   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|\n| Segment/Product                                        | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of   portfolio 2 | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of   portfolio 2 | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of   portfolio 2       | Outstanding  $mill/i.righton | % of   portfolio 2  |\n| Credit cards &   Personal loans                        | 217                          | 1.2%               | 74                           | 0.5%               | 143                          | 7.7%                     |                              |                     |\n| Mortgages & Auto                                       | 600                          | 0.7%               | 590                          | 0.7%               | 10                           | 0.6%                     |                              |                     |\n| Business banking                                       | 365                          | 4.3%               | 365                          | 4.4%               | -                            | 0.0%                     |                              |                     |\n| Total Consumer, Private   and Business Banking         | 1,182                        | 0.9%               | 1,029                        | 0.9%               | 153                          | 3.1%                     |                              |                     |\n| Corporate, Commercial &   Institut/i.rightonal Banking | 511                          | 0.2%               | 388                          |                    | 113                          |                          |                              | 10                  |\n| Total at 31 December 2021                              | 1,693                        | 0.5%               | 1,417                        |                    | 266                          |                          |                              | 10                  |\n| Total Consumer, Private   and Business Banking         | 2,372                        | 1.8%               | 2,206                        |                    | 166                          |                          |                              |                     |\n| Corporate, Commercial &  Institut/i.rightonal Banking  | 1,195                        | 0.6%               | 746                          |                    | 429                          |                          |                              | 20                  |\n| Total at 31 December 2020                              | 3,567                        | 1.0%               | 2,952                        |                    | 595                          |                          |                              | 20                  |\n\n- 1 Bahrain's moratoria scheme expired on 31 December 2021.

Just under half of the total decrease in forborne loans was in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, primar/i.rightly driven by cures out of performing forborne loans in Africa and the Middle East, with the remainder of the decrease due to lower performing forborne loans in Consumer, Private and Business Banking mainly driven by full repayment of a sign/i.rightficant outstanding loan account in Private Banking.",

The reduction in loans was primar/i.rightly driven by Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking debt sales and repayments in Asia and Africa and the Middle East regions.\n\nInflows into stage 3 for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking were lower by 53 per cent at $1.7 bill/i.righton, compared with $3.6 bill/i.righton in 2020 and remain low compared to histor/i.rightcal norms. The new inflows in 2021 were mainly in Asia and Africa and the Middle East.\n\nGross stage 3 loans in Consumer, Private and Business Banking remained broadly stable at $1.6 bill/i.righton.\n\n## Stage 3 cover ratio (audited)\n\nThe stage 3 cover ratio measures the proportion of stage 3 impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons to gross stage 3 loans, and is a metric\n\ncommonly used in consider/i.rightng impa/i.rightrment trends.

Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking (audited)\n\nCollateral held against Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking exposures amounted to $29 bill/i.righton.\n\nCollateral taken for longer-term and sub-investment grade corporate loans improved to 49 per cent (2020: 46 per cent).\n\nOur underwrit/i.rightng standards encourage taking specif/i.rightc charges on assets and we consistently seek high-quality, investment-grade collateral.\n\n75 per cent of tangible collateral (2020: 82 per cent) held comprises physical assets or is property based, with the remainder largely in cash and investment securit/i.rightes. The reduction in tangible collateral is due to decrease in property\n\ncollateral from repayments in Asia. Overall collateral remained largely flat at $29 bill/i.righton as the decrease in tangible collateral held that comprises physical assets or is property based, was offset by increases in cash and investment securit/i.rightes by $1.4 bill/i.righton, and in financ/i.rightal guarantee and insurance by $1.1 bill/i.righton.\n\nNon-tangible collateral, such as guarantees and standby letters of credit, is also held against corporate exposures, although the financ/i.rightal effect of this type of collateral is less sign/i.rightficant in terms of recoveries. However, this is considered when determin/i.rightng the probabil/i.rightty of default and other credit-related factors. Collateral is also held against offbalance sheet exposures, includ/i.rightng undrawn commitments and trade-related instruments.\n\nIn the Consumer, Private and Business Banking segment, a secured loan is one where the borrower pledges an asset as collateral of which the Group is able to take possession in the event that the borrower defaults. Total collateral for Consumer, Private and Business Banking has increased to $103 bill/i.righton (2020: $100 bill/i.righton) due to an increase in Mortgages and Secured wealth products.\n\nStage 2 collateral reduced by $2.9 bill/i.righton to $6.1 billon, due to a decrease in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Consumer, Private and Business Banking loan balances.\n\nTotal collateral for Central and other items increased by $4.3 bill/i.righton to $6.4 bill/i.righton compared with 2020 due to an increase in lending under reverse repurchase agreements.",

These credit default swaps are accounted for as financ/i.rightal guarantees as per IFRS 9 as they will only reimburse the holder for an incurred loss on an underlying debt instrument. The Group continues to hold the underlying assets referenced in the credit default swaps and it continues to be exposed to related Credit Risk and Foreign Exchange Rate Risk on these assets.\n\n## Credit linked notes\n\nThe Group has issued credit linked notes for portfolio management purposes, referencing loan assets with a notional value of $10.0 bill/i.righton (2020: $8.0 bill/i.righton). The Group continues to hold the underlying assets for which the credit linked notes provide mit/i.rightgation.\n\n## Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the posit/i.rightve and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivat/i.rightve transactions. These are set out in more detail under Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation (page 248).\n\n## Off-balance sheet exposures\n\nFor certain types of exposure, such as letters of credit and guarantees, the Group obtains collateral such as cash depending on internal Credit Risk assessments, as well as in the case of letters of credit holding legal title to the underlying assets should a default take place.\n\n## Other portfolio analysis\n\nThis section provides maturity analysis by credit quality by industry and industry and retail products analysis by region.\n\n## Maturity analysis of loans and advances by client segment\n\nLoans and advances to the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking segment remain predominantly short-term, with $95.5 bill/i.righton or 66 per cent (2020: $84.6 bill/i.righton or 61 per cent) maturing in less than one year. 98 per cent (2020: 94 per cent) of loans to banks mature in less than one year, an increase compared with 2020 as net exposures increased by $1.8 bill/i.righton. Shorter maturit/i.rightes give us the flexib/i.rightlity to respond promptly to events and rebalance or reduce our exposure to clients or sectors that are facing increased pressure or uncertainty.\n\nThe Consumer, Private and Business Banking short-term book of one year or less and long-term book of over five years are stable at 26 per cent (2020: 25 per cent) and 62 per cent (2020: 62 per cent) of the total portfolio respectively.\n\n|                                                      | 2021                              | 2021                               | 2021                             | 2021                   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Amortised cost                                       | One year or less  $mill/i.righton | One to five years  $mill/i.righton | Over five years  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking | 95,454                            | 36,953                             | 11,299                           | 143,706                |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking                 | 35,991                            | 16,783                             | 85,093                           | 137,867                |\n| Central & other items                                | 22,318                            | 224                                | 7                                | 22,549                 |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers                | 153,763                           | 53,960                             | 96,399                           | 304,122                |\n| Impairment provis/i.rightons                         | (5,057)                           | (462)                              | (135)                            | (5,654)                |\n| Net loans and advances to customers                  | 148,706                           | 53,498                             | 96,264                           | 298,468                |\n| Net loans and advances to banks                      | 43,274                            | 955                                | 154                              | 44,383                 |\n\n|                                                        | 2020 (Restated)                   | 2020 (Restated)                    | 2020 (Restated)                  | 2020 (Restated)         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Amortised cost                                         | One year or less  $mill/i.righton | One to five years  $mill/i.righton | Over five years  $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking 1 | 84,554                            | 41,133                             | 12,962                           | 138,649                 |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking 1                 | 33,037                            | 16,002                             | 81,474                           | 130,513                 |\n| Central & other items                                  | 18,704                            | 443                                | 3                                | 19,150                  |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers                  | 136,295                           | 57,578                             | 94,439                           | 288,312                 |\n| Impairment provis/i.rightons                           | (5,722)                           | (743)                              | (148)                            | (6,613)                 |\n| Net loans and advances to customers                    | 130,573                           | 56,835                             | 94,291                           | 281,699                 |\n| Net loans and advances to banks                        | 41,524                            | 2,821                              | 2                                | 44,347                  |",

Of the $23 bill/i.righton, $15 bill/i.righton were corporate loans, mainly due to new lending in Manufacturing and primar/i.rightly stage transfers in the Transport, telecom and util/i.rightties, Commercial real estate and Manufacturing sectors. Consumer, Private and Business Banking increased by $8 bill/i.righton, mainly from the mortgage book and secured wealth products from new orig/i.rightnations largely from Asia. Stage 2 loans decreased by $6 bill/i.righton largely due to Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, in part due to transfers to stage 1. Stage 3 loans reduced by $1.1 bill/i.righton to $8.1 bill/i.righton due to Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking debt sales and repayments in Asia and Africa and the Middle East regions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                              | 2021                            | 2021                                                | 2021

amortised cost loan portfolio, net of provis/i.rightons, by industry and region.\n\nIn the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking segment, our largest industry exposures are to Financ/i.rightng, insurance and non-banking, Government and Manufacturing sectors, with each constitut/i.rightng at least 15 per cent of Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking loans and advances to customers.\n\nFinanc/i.rightng, insurance and non-banking industry clients are mostly investment-grade inst/i.righttutions and this lending forms part of the liqu/i.rightdity management of the Group. The Manufacturing sector group is spread across a diverse range of industr/i.rightes, includ/i.rightng automobiles and components, capital goods, pharmaceuticals, biotech and life sciences, technology hardware and equipment, chemicals, paper products and packaging, with lending spread over 3,500 clients.\n\nLoans and advances to the Energy sector remained largely stable at $13.5 bill/i.righton or 8 per cent (2020: $13.0 bill/i.righton or 8 per cent) of total loans and advances to Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking. The Energy sector lending is spread across five sub-sectors and over 190 clients.\n\nThe Group provides loans to commercial real estate counterparties of $20 bill/i.righton, which represents 7 per cent of total customer loans and advances. In total, $8.4 bill/i.righton of this lending is to counterparties where the source of repayment is substantially derived from rental or sale of real estate and is secured by real estate collateral. The remain/i.rightng commercial real estate loans comprise working capital loans to real estate corporates, loans with non-property collateral, unsecured loans and loans to real estate entit/i.rightes of divers/i.rightfied conglomerates. The average LTV ratio of the commercial real estate portfolio has decreased to 50 per cent, compared with 51 per cent in 2020. The proportion of loans with an LTV greater than 80 per cent has decreased to 2 per cent, compared with 4 per cent in 2020. The China Commercial Real Estate portfolio is being closely monitored and a management overlay of $95 mill/i.righton has been taken to account for risks not reflected in the ECL models.\n\nThe Mortgage portfolio continues to be the largest portion of the Retail Products portfolio, at $89.4 bill/i.righton. CCPL and other unsecured lending remained largely stable at $17.8 bill/i.righton.",

at risk from COVID-19 and volatile energy prices, and we continue to monitor exposures to these sectors particularly carefully.\n\nTotal net on balance sheet exposure to vulnerable sectors increased by $0.5 bill/i.righton to $33 bill/i.righton compared to 31 December 2020 and the total net on and off-balance sheet exposure increased to 28 per cent (2020: 27 per cent) of the total net exposure in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking. The increase is largely due to higher levels of undrawn commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees, particularly in the Commercial real estate and Commodity traders sectors respectively.\n\nStage 2 loans decreased by $1.9 bill/i.righton of loans to vulnerable sectors, as compared to 31 December 2020. This was primar/i.rightly driven by a decrease in Commercial real estate portfolio due to transfers to stage 1.\n\nStage 3 loans to vulnerable sectors increased by $0.6 bill/i.righton compared to 31 December 2020, mainly due to Commercial real estate and Oil and gas sectors from new downgrades from 'High risk' accounts.\n\nThe Group has net exposure of $4.0 bill/i.righton (2020: $3.5 bill/i.righton) to China Commercial Real Estate counterparties which are primar/i.rightly booked in Hong Kong and China. $3.1 bill/i.righton of this exposure is to property developers whose cashflows have been particularly impacted by policy changes to deleverage the property sector and $2.1 bill/i.righton of these are on purely precautionary and non-purely precautionary early alert. As a result of ongoing uncertaint/i.rightes affecting this sector, the Group has taken a $95 mill/i.righton (2020: $nil) management overlay on credit impa/i.rightrment for the exposures on early alert at 31 December 2021 (see page 240). The Group is further ind/i.rightrectly exposed to China Commercial Real Estate through its associate investment in China Bohai Bank.

securit/i.rightes and treasury bills.\n\nThe standard credit ratings used by the Group are those used by Standard & Poor's or its equivalent. Debt securit/i.rightes held that have a short-term rating are reported against the long-term rating of the issuer. For securit/i.rightes that are unrated, the Group applies an internal credit rating, as described under the credit rating and measurement section (page 265).\n\nTotal gross debt securit/i.rightes and other elig/i.rightble bills increased by $9.8 bill/i.righton to $162.8 bill/i.righton. The increase in holdings of debt securit/i.rightes and other elig/i.rightble bills is mainly due to Treasury Markets util/i.rightsing excess liqu/i.rightdity from the growth in the Group's balance sheet. Of the total increase, 82 per cent is in stage 1 with the remain/i.rightng 18 per cent in stage 2. Most securit/i.rightes held are highly rated to meet liqu/i.rightdity regulatory requirement. This can be observed in the increase of stage 1 securit/i.rightes rated A- and above of $9.4 bill/i.righton.",

For the major/i.rightty of\n\nexposures this equates to the maximum contractual period. For retail credit cards and corporate overdraft facil/i.rightties however, the Group does not typically enforce the contractual period, which can be as short as one day. As a result, the period over which the Group is exposed to Credit Risk for these instruments reflects their behavioural life, which incorporates expectations of customer behaviour and the extent to which Credit Risk management actions curtail the period of that exposure. The average behavioural life for retail credit cards is between 3 and 6 years across our footprint markets.\n\nIn 2021, the behavioural life for corporate overdraft facil/i.rightties was re-estimated using recent data, and it was confirmed that the exist/i.rightng lifet/i.rightme of 24 months remains appropriate.\n\n## Composit/i.righton of credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons (audited)\n\nThe table below summarises the key components of the Group's credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.righton balances at 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020.\n\nModelled ECL provis/i.rightons, which includes post model adjustments, management overlays and the impact of multiple economic scenarios, were 23 per cent (31 December 2020: 24 per cent) of total credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons at 31 December 2021. 24 per cent of the modelled ECL provis/i.rightons at 31 December 2021 related to judgemental management overlays compared with 21 per cent at 31 December 2020. Post model adjustments (PMAs) reduced sign/i.rightficantly compared with 31 December 2020 as the volatil/i.rightty in macroeconomic forecasts subsided which removed the need for PMAs to correct for a model's overreaction to the macroeconomic forecast.\n\n| 31 December 2021                                       | Corporate,  Commercial  & Institut/i.rightonal  Banking  $ mill/i.righton   | Consumer,  Private &   Business   Banking  $ mill/i.righton   | Central & other  items  $ mill/i.righton   | Total  $ mill/i.righton   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Modelled ECL provis/i.rightons (base forecast)         | 365                                                                         | 539                                                           | 103                                        | 1,007                     |\n| Impact of multiple economic scenarios 1                | 32                                                                          | 14                                                            | 9                                          | 55                        |\n| Total ECL provis/i.rightons before management overlays | 397                                                                         | 553                                                           | 112                                        | 1,062                     |\n| Of which: Post model and other model adjustments       | 24                                                                          | (8)                                                           | 8                                          | 24                        |\n| Management overlays 2                                  |                                                                             |                                                               |                                            | -

PMAs will be removed when the models are updated to correct for the ident/i.rightfied model issue or the estimates return to being with/i.rightn the monitor/i.rightng thresholds.\n\nThe unprecedented volatil/i.rightty in the quarterly macroeconomic forecasts that was seen over 2020 meant that a number of the Group's IFRS 9 ECL models were operating outside the boundaries to which they were calibrated. Over the COVID-19 period we have commonly seen GDP decreases over a single quarter of around 10 to 20 per cent while a country is in lockdown, followed by a recovery of 10 to 20 per cent the following quarter when the lockdown is assumed to end. As the quarterly macroeconomic forecasts and associated model estimates have become less volatile in 2021, PMAs relating to volatil/i.rightty have not been required.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, PMAs have been applied for 11 models out of the total of 172 models. In aggregate, the PMAs increase the Group's impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons by $17 mill/i.righton (1 per cent of modelled provis/i.rightons) compared with a $133 mill/i.righton decrease at 31 December 2020, and primar/i.rightly relate to a non-linear/i.rightty PMA (see page 239 for the impact of multiple economic scenarios) and unsecured Consumer lending models. The PMAs range between a $51 mill/i.righton increase (the non-linear/i.rightty PMA) to a $16 mill/i.righton decrease in ECL (for Malaysia Business Clients). Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking PMAs reduced sign/i.rightficantly compared to 31 December 2020 as new models were implemented during the period.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, judgemental model adjustments have been applied to certain Consumer, Private and Business Banking models to hold back releases of ECL ident/i.rightfied from model monitor/i.rightng breaches because moratoria and other support schemes have suppressed observed defaults. These will be released when the observed defaults normalise.\n\nAs set out on page 239, a separate management overlay that covers risk not captured by the models has been applied after taking into account these PMAs.\n\n|                                                      | 31.12.21  $ mill/i.righton   | 31.12.20  $ mill/i.righton   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Volatil/i.rightty-related PMAs                       |                              |                              |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking | -                            | 17                           |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking                 | -                            | (12)                         |\n| Central & other items                                | -                            | (66)                         |\n|                                                      | -                            | (61)                         |\n| Model performance PMAs                               |                              |                              |\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking | 24                           | (73)                         |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking                 | (15)                         | 1                            |\n| Central & other items                                | 8                            | -                            |\n|                                                      | 17                           | (72)                         |\n| Total PMAs                                           | 17                           | (133)                        |\n| Judgemental model adjustments                        |                              |                              |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking                 | 7                            | (25)                         |\n| Total model adjustments                              | 24                           | (158)                        |\n\n## Key assumptions and judgements in determin/i.rightng expected credit loss\n\n## Incorporation of forward-looking informat/i.righton\n\nThe evolving economic environment is a key determinant of the abil/i.rightty of a bank's clients to meet their obligat/i.rightons as they fall due. It is a fundamental princ/i.rightple of IFRS 9 that the provis/i.rightons banks hold against potential future credit risk losses should depend not just on the health of the economy today but should also take into account potential changes to the economic environment. For example, if a bank were to antic/i.rightpate a sharp slowdown in the world economy over the coming year, it should hold more provis/i.rightons today to absorb the credit losses likely to occur in the near future.\n\nTo capture the effect of changes to the economic environment, the PDs and LGDs used to calculate ECL incorporate forward-looking informat/i.righton in the form of forecasts of the values of economic variables and asset prices that are likely to have an effect on the repayment abil/i.rightty of the Group's clients.\n\nThe 'Base Forecast' of the economic variables and asset prices is based on management's view of the five-year outlook, supported by project/i.rightons from the Group's in-house research team and outputs from a third-party model that project specif/i.rightc economic variables and asset prices. The research team takes consensus views into considerat/i.righton, and senior management reviews project/i.rightons for some core country variables against consensus when forming their view of the outlook. For the period beyond five years, management util/i.rightses the in-house research view and third-party model outputs, which allow for a reversion to long-term growth rates or norms. All project/i.rightons are updated on a quarterly basis.",

        "page_content": "## Forecast of key macroeconomic variables underlying the expected credit loss calculation and the impact on nonlinear/i.rightty\n\nIn the Base Forecast - management's view of the most likely outcome - the world economy is expected to grow by just over 4 per cent in 2022, easing from an almost 6 per cent expansion in 2021. The strong growth last year was driven by vaccine rollouts and government stimulus and follows a contraction of more than 3 per cent in 2020, the worst performance since the Great Depression of 1929-31. Currently, the near-term recovery momentum is being curtailed by supply-side disrupt/i.rightons and elevated inflat/i.righton. Despite this, world GDP growth in 2022 is still expected to be above the average of 3.7 per cent for the 10 years between 2010 and 2019.\n\nVaccines against COVID-19 have allowed economies to reopen, but constantly evolving virus strains have resulted in interm/i.rightttent recoveries, and sectors like hospital/i.rightty and tourism remain under pressure. In general, developed markets have been much better than emerging markets in rolling out vaccines; it is therefore not surpris/i.rightng that developed markets have led the recovery so far. The improvement in vaccine access in emerging markets in recent months should help to narrow the growth gap in 2022.\n\nThe balance of risks to the 2022 growth forecast is to the downside. The emergence of the new Omicron variant across many markets is likely to be felt in slowing the pace of reopening of economies or the re-introduct/i.righton of restrict/i.rightons lim/i.rightting public contact and movement. This will pose downside risks to economic activ/i.rightty and employment. A delayed employment recovery would likely extend supply chain disrupt/i.rightons, weakening growth and keeping inflat/i.righton elevated for longer. This combinat/i.righton will create challenges for policy-makers globally as they attempt to strike a delicate balance between responding to upward inflat/i.rightonary pressures and managing downside risks to the economic outlook.\n\nWhile the quarterly Base Forecasts inform the Group's strategic plan, one key requirement of IFRS 9 is that the assessment of provis/i.rightons should consider multiple future economic environments. For example, the global economy may grow more quickly or more slowly than the Base Forecast, and these variat/i.rightons would have different impl/i.rightcations for the provis/i.rightons that the Group should hold today. As the negative impact of an economic downturn on credit losses tends to be greater than the posit/i.rightve impact of an economic upturn, if the Group sets provis/i.rightons only on the ECL under the Base Forecast it might mainta/i.rightn a level of provis/i.rightons that does not appropriately capture the range of potential outcomes. To address this property of skewness (or non-linear/i.rightty), IFRS 9 requires reported ECL to be a probabil/i.rightty-weighted ECL, calculated over a range of possible outcomes.\n\nTo assess the range of possible outcomes the Group simulates a set of 50 scenarios around the Base Forecast, calculates the ECL under each of them and assigns an equal weight of 2 per cent to each scenario outcome. These scenarios are generated by a Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton, which addresses the challenges of crafting many realist/i.rightc alternative scenarios in\n\nthe many countries in which the Group operates by means of a model, which produces these alternative scenarios while consider/i.rightng the degree of histor/i.rightcal uncertainty (or volatil/i.rightty) observed from Q1 1990 to Q3 2020 around economic outcomes and how these outcomes have tended to move in relation to one another (or correlation). This naturally means that each of the 50 scenarios do not have a specif/i.rightc narrative, although collectively they explore a range of hypothetical alternative outcomes for the global economy, includ/i.rightng scenarios that turn out better than expected and scenarios that amplify antic/i.rightpated stresses.\n\nThe table on page 237 to 238 provides a summary of the Group's Base Forecast for key footprint markets, alongside the corresponding range seen across the multiple scenarios. The peak/trough amounts in the table show the highest and lowest points with/i.rightn the Base Forecast, and the GDP graphs illustrate the shape of the Base Forecast in relation to prior periods' actuals and the long-term growth rates.\n\nChina's growth is expected to ease from over 8 per cent in 2021 to 5.6 per cent in 2022. After excluding the COVID-19 related weakness of 2020 when the economy grew by 2.3 per cent this will be the slowest pace of expansion since 1990 when GDP grew by 3.9 per cent. Headwinds to China's outlook include the spread of the new variant of COVID-19 and concerns over the real estate sector. Hong Kong is also expected to show a sharp slowdown in 2022 from a growth of almost 7 per cent in 2021. While hopes are ris/i.rightng that quarantine-free travel between Hong Kong and the mainland may resume, full reopening of the border is unlikely until H2 2022 at the earliest as the authorit/i.rightes are expected to take a cautious approach. The resumption of internat/i.rightonal travel to other destinat/i.rightons could take even longer. In Singapore, growth is expected to hold up better in 2022 compared with Hong Kong. Earlier progress with border reopening and a high domestic vaccinat/i.righton rate should support economic activ/i.rightty. Korea and India's growth are also expected to be relatively more robust compared with 2021. Easing COVID-19 restrict/i.rightons and a recovery in employment will provide support to Korea. In India, a rapid pick-up in vaccine distr/i.rightbution and expansionary polic/i.rightes are supporting the recovery.\n\nMomentum from the strong rebound in 2021 is also expected to ease in western economies. The United States is facing increas/i.rightng headwinds in 2022. This follows robust growth last year as the rapid pace of vaccinat/i.rightons in the first half of 2021 allowed activ/i.rightty to normalise. US GDP growth is expected to moderate to 3.7 per cent in 2022 from 5.7 per cent in 2021 as supply-side constraints start to bite and high inflat/i.righton squeezes real incomes. Europe also faces sim/i.rightlar challenges with the growth in the eurozone expected to ease to around 4 per cent from 4.9 per cent in 2021.\n\nThe slowdown in world GDP growth will translate to a softening in the growth of demand for commodit/i.rightes in 2022. Supply disrupt/i.rightons from COVID-19 are also expected to dim/i.rightnish this year. The tightness in the supply-demand balance in the oil market is therefore likely to ease and the price of Brent Crude oil is expected to average $66.6 in 2022 compared with $70.0 in 2021.",

The Monte Carlo approach has the advantage that it generates many plausible alternative scenarios that cover our global footprint; however, a recognised challenge with the Monte Carlo approach is that the range of scenarios it forecasts can be narrow.\n\nThe Monte Carlo model is being redeveloped to widen the range of the scenarios; however, prior to this new model being implemented a $51 mill/i.righton non-linear/i.rightty PMA has been applied. The total amount of non-linear/i.rightty has been\n\nestimated by assign/i.rightng probabil/i.rightty weights of 70 per cent, 25 per cent and 5 per cent respectively to the ECL from the Base Forecast, Supply Chain Disrupt/i.righton and New COVID-19 Variant scenarios which are presented on pages 240 to 241 and comparing this to the unweighted base forecast ECL. The non-linear/i.rightty PMA represents the difference between the probabil/i.rightty weighted ECL calculated using the three scenarios and the probabil/i.rightty weighted ECL calculated by the Monte Carlo model.\n\nThe impact of multiple economic scenarios (which includes the non-linear/i.rightty PMA) on stage 1, stage 2 and stage 3 modelled ECL is set out in the table below together with the management overlay.\n\n|                                                  | Base   forecast   $mill/i.righton   | Multiple  economic  scenarios   $mill/i.righton   |   Management  overlay   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Total expected credit loss at 31 December 2021 1 | 1,007                               | 55                                                |                                     344 | 1,406                     |\n| Total expected credit loss at 31 December 2020 1 | 1,380                               | (8)                                               |                                     359 | 1,731                     |\n\nThe average expected credit loss under multiple scenarios is 5 per cent higher than the expected credit loss calculated using only the most likely scenario (the Base Forecast).

Other portfolios display min/i.rightmal non-linear/i.rightty owing to lim/i.rightted responsiveness to macroeconomic impacts for structural reasons such as sign/i.rightficant collateralisat/i.righton as with the Consumer, Private and Business Banking mortgage portfolios.\n\n## Management overlay\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group held:\n\n- \u00b7 A $249 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $359 mill/i.righton) management overlay relating to uncertaint/i.rightes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, $102 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $197 mill/i.righton) of which relates to Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking and $147 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $162 mill/i.righton) to Consumer, Private and Business Banking. $84 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $78 mill/i.righton) of the overlay is held in stage 1, $144 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $275 mill/i.righton) in stage 2 and $21 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $6 mill/i.righton) in stage 3.\n- \u00b7 A $95 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $nil) management overlay relating to uncertaint/i.rightes around exposures to China Commercial Real Estate, all of which relates to Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking. $31 mill/i.righton is held in stage 1 and $64 mill/i.righton in stage 2.\n\nThe overlays have been determined after taking account of the PMAs reported on page 235 and they are re-assessed quarterly. They are reviewed and approved by the IFRS 9 Impairment Committee.\n\n## COVID-19 overlay\n\n## Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking\n\nAlthough the amount of loans placed on non-purely precautionary early alert has decreased compared with 31 December 2020, balances remain higher than before the pandemic. The impact of the rapid deteriorat/i.righton in the economic environment in 2020 has not yet been fully observed in customers' financ/i.rightal performance, in part due to ongoing government support measures across the Group's\n\nmarkets. Accordingly, we have not yet seen a sign/i.rightficant increase in the level of stage 3 loans relating to COVID-19 up to 31 December 2021. To take account of the heightened Credit Risk and the continu/i.rightng uncertaint/i.rightes in the pace and tim/i.rightng of economic recovery, a judgemental overlay has been taken by estimat/i.rightng the impact of further deteriorat/i.righton to the non-purely precautionary early alert portfolio. The overlay is held in stage 2. The basis of determin/i.rightng the overlay remained unchanged during 2020 and 2021, although the assumed level of further deteriorat/i.righton was reduced in 2021 in line with our experience. The overlay has steadily reduced from $197 mill/i.righton at 31 December 2020 to $102 mill/i.righton at 31 December 2021 as the level of non-purely precautionary early alerts has reduced.\n\n## Consumer, Private and Business Banking\n\nA number of components contribute to the judgemental overlay for Consumer, Private and Business Banking. With/i.rightn Business Banking, the Group has evaluated those sectors that have been adversely impacted by COVID-19, both through internal credit processes as well as through a 'Voice of Customer' survey to understand how customers have been affected. The Group has also considered the extent to which lockdowns have impacted collections and recoveries, and the extent to which payment reliefs may mask underlying credit risks, particularly in those markets where compulsory extended moratoria schemes were in place. For those markets, the Group has estimated the impact of increased delinquenc/i.rightes and flows to defaults when the moratoria are lifted as well as the extent to which customers in stage 1 may have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk if not for the moratoria. The Group assessment also considered employee banking relationsh/i.rightps with high-impact sectors and the impact on Mortgages in Africa and the Middle East which generally have high LTVs. $84 mill/i.righton of the overlay is held in stage 1, $42 mill/i.righton in stage 2 and $21 mill/i.righton in stage 3. The basis of determin/i.rightng the overlay remained unchanged during 2020 and 2021. The overlay has reduced from $162 mill/i.righton at 31 December 2020 to $147 mill/i.righton at 31 December 2021. While general moratoria schemes have ended in a number of markets and increased delinquency flows were captured by the ECL models, moratoria schemes were further extended in certain Asian and Africa and Middle East markets.",

        "page_content": "## China Commercial Real Estate overlay\n\nChinese property developers are experienc/i.rightng liqu/i.rightdity issues, triggered by government policy changes aimed at deleveraging the property sector and ensuring property developers have the financ/i.rightal abil/i.rightty to complete resident/i.rightal properties under construction. The government's 'three red lines' matrix was introduced in August 2020 to tighten the funding condit/i.rightons for property developers by lim/i.rightting the growth rate in external debt. With addit/i.rightonal controls on sales of properties to end buyers (e.g. mortgage lending control, pric/i.rightng control, elig/i.rightbil/i.rightty control) and on restrict/i.rightng developers' abil/i.rightty to access cash from 'escrow accounts' with cash paid by retail resident/i.rightal buyers, the cashflow of developers has been sign/i.rightficantly squeezed. Also, with capital markets reacting negatively to the tighten/i.rightng polic/i.rightes, we have seen greater volatil/i.rightty in bond pric/i.rightng and reduced access to capital markets liqu/i.rightdity for developers. As such, some developers have faced/are facing diff/i.rightculties in servic/i.rightng and repaying financ/i.rightng obligat/i.rightons.\n\nThe Group's banking book net exposure to China Commercial Real Estate was $4.0 bill/i.righton at 31 December 2021 (31 December 2020: $3.5 bill/i.righton). Client level analysis continues to be done, with the high-risk clients being placed on purely precautionary or non-purely precautionary early alert. Given the evolving nature of the risks in the China Commercial Real Estate sector, a management overlay of $95 mill/i.righton has been taken by estimat/i.rightng the impact of further deteriorat/i.righton to those clients placed on early alert.\n\n## Stage 3 assets\n\nCredit-impa/i.rightred assets managed by Group Special Assets Management incorporate forward-looking economic assumptions in respect of the recovery outcomes ident/i.rightfied, and are assigned ind/i.rightvidual probabil/i.rightty weight/i.rightngs using management judgment. These assumptions are not based on a Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton but are informed by the Base Forecast.\n\n## Sensit/i.rightvity of expected credit loss calculation to macroeconomic variables\n\nThe ECL calculation relies on multiple variables and is inherently non-linear and portfolio-dependent, which impl/i.rightes that no single analysis can fully demonstrate the sensit/i.rightvity of the ECL to changes in the macroeconomic variables. The Group has conducted a series of analyses with the aim of ident/i.rightfying the macroeconomic variables which might have the greatest impact on the overall ECL. These encompassed single variable and multi-variable exercises, using simple up/ down variat/i.righton and extracts from actual calculation data, as well as bespoke scenario design assessments.\n\nThe primary conclusion of these exercises is that no ind/i.rightvidual macroeconomic variable is materially influent/i.rightal. The Group believes this is plausible as the number of variables used in the ECL calculation is large. This does not mean that macroeconomic variables are uninfluent/i.rightal; rather, that the Group believes that considerat/i.righton of macroeconomics should involve whole scenarios, as this aligns with the multi-variable nature of the calculation.\n\nThe Group faces downside risks in the operating environment related to the uncertaint/i.rightes surrounding the macroeconomic outlook. To explore this, a sensit/i.rightvity analysis of ECL was undertaken to explore the effect of slower economic recoveries across the Group's footprint markets. Two downside scenarios were considered. In the first scenario the current supply chain disrupt/i.rightons prove more persistent than expected. Labour and material shortages persist throughout 2022 and higher commodity and other input prices add to inflat/i.rightonary pressure. The global recovery in investment and consumption disappo/i.rightnts and financ/i.rightal markets weaken. The impact on the global economy is temporary, however. Supply chain disrupt/i.rightons ease sign/i.rightficantly from 2023. In the second scenario, new COVID-19 virus variants are assumed to lead to a new infect/i.righton wave in emerging markets and developing economies, resulting in the re-introduct/i.righton of severe lockdown measures. Travel restrict/i.rightons sign/i.rightficantly impact the Aviat/i.righton and Hotels and tourism sectors.\n\n|                           | Baseline          | Baseline    | Supply chain disrupt/i.righton   | Supply chain disrupt/i.righton   | New COVID-19 variant   | New COVID-19 variant   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                           | Five year average | Peak/Trough | Five year average                | Peak/Trough                      | Five year average      | Peak/Trough            |\n| China GDP                 | 5.4               | 6.1/4.7     | 5.0                              | 5.5/3.6                          | 5.2                    | 13.4/(5.2)             |\n| China unemployment        | 3.4               | 3.4/3.4     | 3.5                              | 4.0/3.4                          | 4.1                    | 5.9/3.4                |\n| China property prices     | 4.0               | 4.5/1.8     | 3.4                              | 4.5/(1.5)                        | 3.8                    | 6.6/(1.6)              |\n| Hong Kong GDP             | 2.6               | 3.5/1.8     | 2.0                              | 2.5/0.1                          | 2.3                    | 11.6/(9.1)             |\n| Hong Kong unemployment    | 3.8               | 4.4/3.7     | 4.0                              | 4.6/3.7                          | 4.7                    | 6.8/3.8                |\n| Hong Kong property prices | 3.1               | 5.3/2.7     | 1.9                              | 3.8/(2.0)                        | 3.5                    | 25.2/(21.3)            |\n| US GDP                    | 2.3               | 4.7/1.7     | 1.6                              | 4.0/(0.4)                        | 2.0                    | 13.1/(11.6)            |\n| Singapore GDP             | 2.5               | 4.8/1.8     | 1.9                              | 3.3/(0.2)                        | 2.2                    | 11.1/(8.9)             |\n| India GDP                 | 6.4               | 16.6/4.2    | 5.4                              | 15.0/1.4                         | 6.0                    | 19. 3/(12.4)           |\n| Crude oil                 | 63.7              | 73.5/60.0   | 66.3                             | 76.2/62.0                        | 49.4                   | 57.0/32.7              |",

and 2 ECL provis/i.rightons (includ/i.rightng both on and off-balance sheet instruments) would be approximately $110 mill/i.righton higher under the supply chain disrupt/i.righton scenario and $545 mill/i.righton higher under the new Covid-19 variant scenario than the baseline ECL provis/i.rightons (which excluded the impact of multiple economic scenarios and management overlays which may already capture some of the risks in these scenarios). The proportion of stage 2 assets would increase from 4.2 per cent to 4.6 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively under the supply chain disrupt/i.righton and New Covid-19 Variant scenarios. This includes the impact of exposures transferring to stage 2 from stage 1 but does not consider an increase in stage 3 defaults.\n\nUnder both scenarios the major/i.rightty of the increase was in Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking with the main corporate portfolios in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and the United States being impacted. Under both scenarios around 26 per cent of the increase was in Consumer, Private\n\nand Business Banking portfolios with most of the increases coming from the big unsecured retail portfolios (the Korea and Hong Kong Personal Loan portfolios were impacted under the supply chain disrupt/i.righton scenario, whereas the Malaysia and Singapore Credit Cards portfolios were impacted under the new Covid-19 variant scenario).\n\nThere was no material change in modelled stage 3 provis/i.rightons as these primar/i.rightly relate to unsecured Consumer, Private and Business Banking exposures for which the LGD is not sensit/i.rightve to changes in the macroeconomic forecasts. There is also no material change for non-modelled stage 3 exposures as these are more sensit/i.rightve to client specif/i.rightc factors than to alternative macroeconomic scenarios.\n\nThe actual outcome of any scenario may be materially different due to, among other factors, the effect of management actions to mit/i.rightgate potential increases in risk and changes in the underlying portfolio.\n\n## Modelled provis/i.rightons\n\n|                                                            | Base   forecast   ECL   $m   | Supply chain  disrupt/i.righton   ECL   $m   | New COVID-19   variant ECL   $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking       | 359                          | 437                                          | 749                               |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking                       | 425                          | 455                                          | 570                               |\n| Central & other items                                      | 103                          | 105                                          | 112                               |\n| Total stage 1 and 2 before overlays and multiple scenarios | 887                          | 997                                          | 1,432                             |\n| Stage 1 and 2 management overlay                           | 323                          |                                              |                                   |\n| Impact of multiple economic scenarios                      | 55                           |                                              |                                   |\n| Total reported stage 1 and 2 ECL                           | 1,265                        |                                              |                                   |\n| Stage 3 ECL 1                                              | 4,944                        |                                              |                                   |\n| Total ECL                                                  | 6,209                        |                                              |                                   |\n\n## Proportion of assets in stage 2 1\n\n|                                                    |   Base   forecast   scenario   % |   Supply chain  disrupt/i.righton  scenario   % | New COVID-19   variant   scenario   %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Corporate, Consumer & Institut/i.rightonal Banking |                              6.9 |                                             7.9 | 14.2                                    |\n| Consumer, Private & Business Banking               |                              1.5 |                                             1.6 | 2.3                                     |\n| Central & other items                              |                              2.2 |                                             2.2 | 2.3                                     |\n| Total                                              |                              4.2 |                                             4.6 | 7. 7                                    |",

        "page_content": "## Sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n\n## Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nSICR is assessed by comparing the risk of default at the reporting date to the risk of default at orig/i.rightnation. Whether a change in the risk of default is sign/i.rightficant or not is assessed using quantitat/i.rightve and qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta. These quantitat/i.rightve sign/i.rightficant deteriorat/i.righton thresholds have been separately defined for each business and where meaningful are consistently applied across business lines.\n\nAssets are considered to have experienced SICR if they have breached both relative and absolute thresholds for the change in the average annualised lifet/i.rightme probabil/i.rightty of default over the residual term of the exposure.\n\nThe absolute measure of increase in credit risk is used to capture instances where the PDs on exposures are relatively low at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton as these may increase by several multiples without representing a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk. Where PDs are relatively high at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, a relative measure is more appropriate in assessing whether there is a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk, as the PDs increase more quickly.\n\nThe SICR thresholds have been calibrated based on the following princ/i.rightples:\n\n- \u00b7 Stabil/i.rightty - The thresholds are set to achieve a stable stage 2 population at a portfolio level, trying to min/i.rightmise the number of accounts moving back and forth between stage 1 and stage 2 in a short period of time\n- \u00b7 Accuracy - The thresholds are set such that there is a materially higher propensity for stage 2 exposures to eventually default than is the case for stage 1 exposures\n- \u00b7 Dependency from backstops - The thresholds are stringent enough such that a high proportion of accounts transfer to stage 2 due to movements in forward-looking PDs rather than relying on backward-looking backstops such as arrears\n- \u00b7 Relationsh/i.rightp with business and product risk profiles The thresholds reflect the relative risk differences between different products, and are aligned to business processes\n\nFor Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking clients, the relative threshold is a 100 per cent increase in PD and the absolute change in PD is between 50 and 100 bps.\n\nFor Consumer and Business Banking clients, the relative threshold is a 100 per cent increase in PD and the absolute change in PD is between 100 and 350 bps depending on the product. Certain countries have a higher absolute threshold reflecting the lower default rate with/i.rightn their personal loan portfolios compared with the Group's other personal loan portfolios.\n\nPrivate Banking clients are assessed qualitat/i.rightvely, based on a delinquency measure relating to collateral top-ups or sell-downs.\n\nDebt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated before 1 January 2018 with an internal credit rating mapped to an investment grade equivalent are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt securit/i.rightes to stage 2. Debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated after 1 January 2018 apply the same approach and thresholds as for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking clients.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nQualitat/i.rightve factors that ind/i.rightcate that there has been a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk include processes linked to current risk management, such as placing loans on non-purely precautionary early alert.\n\n## Backstop\n\nAcross all portfolios, accounts that are 30 or more days past due (DPD) on contractual payments of princ/i.rightpal and/or interest that have not been captured by the criter/i.righta above are considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk.\n\nExpert credit judgement may be applied in assessing sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk to the extent that certain risks may not have been captured by the models or through the above criter/i.righta. Such instances are expected to be rare, for example due to events and material uncertaint/i.rightes aris/i.rightng close to the reporting date.\n\n## Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking clients Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nExposures are assessed based on both the absolute and the relative movement in the PD from orig/i.rightnation to the reporting date as described above.\n\nTo account for the fact that the mapping between internal credit grades (used in the orig/i.rightnation process) and PDs is non-linear (e.g. a one-notch downgrade in the investment grade universe results in a much smaller PD increase than in the sub-investment grade universe), the absolute thresholds have been different/i.rightated by credit quality at orig/i.rightnation, as measured by internal credit grades being investment grade or sub-investment grade.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nAll assets of clients that have been placed on early alert (for non-purely precautionary reasons) are deemed to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk.\n\nAn account is placed on non-purely precautionary early alert if it exhib/i.rightts risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requir/i.rightng closer monitor/i.rightng, supervis/i.righton or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deteriorat/i.righton of repayment prospects and the likel/i.righthood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of posit/i.righton with/i.rightn the industry, concerns over management's abil/i.rightty to manage operations, weak/deteriorat/i.rightng operating results, liqu/i.rightdity strain and overdue balances, among other factors.\n\nAll client assets that have been assigned a CG12 rating, equivalent to 'Higher risk', are deemed to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk. Accounts rated CG12 are managed by the GSAM unit. All Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking clients are placed in CG12 when they are 30 DPD unless they are granted a waiver through a strict governance process.\n\n## Consumer and Business Banking clients\n\n## Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nMaterial portfolios (defined as a combinat/i.righton of country and product, for example Hong Kong mortgages, Taiwan credit cards) for which a statist/i.rightcal model has been built, are assessed based on both the absolute and relative movement in the PD from orig/i.rightnation to the reporting date as described previously in page 233. For these portfolios, the orig/i.rightnal lifet/i.rightme PD term structure is determined based on the orig/i.rightnal Applicat/i.righton Score or Risk Segment of the client.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nAccounts that are 30 DPD that have not been captured by the quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta are considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk. For less material portfolios, which are modelled based on a roll-rate or loss-rate approach, SICR is primar/i.rightly assessed through the 30 DPD trigger.",

Sign/i.rightficant credit deteriorat/i.righton of these assets is deemed to have occurred when any early alert trigger has been breached.\n\n## Debt securit/i.rightes\n\n## Quantitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nFor debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated before 1 January 2018, the bank is util/i.rightsing the low Credit Risk simpl/i.rightfied approach, where debt securit/i.rightes with an internal credit rating mapped to an investment grade equivalent are allocated to stage 1 and all other debt securit/i.rightes are allocated to stage 2. Debt securit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated after 1 January 2018 are assessed based on the absolute and relative movements in PD from orig/i.rightnation to the reporting date.\n\n## Qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta\n\nDebt securit/i.rightes util/i.rightse the same qualitat/i.rightve criter/i.righta as the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking client segments, includ/i.rightng being placed on early alert or being classif/i.righted as CG12.\n\n## Assessment of credit-impa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal assets\n\n## Consumer and Business Banking clients\n\nThe core components in determin/i.rightng credit-impa/i.rightred expected credit loss provis/i.rightons are the value of gross chargeoff and recoveries. Gross charge-off and/or loss provis/i.rightons are recognised when it is established that the account is unlikely to pay through the normal process. Recovery of unsecured debt post credit impa/i.rightrment is recognised based on actual cash collected, either directly from clients or through the sale of defaulted loans to third-party inst/i.righttutions. Release of credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons for secured loans is recognised if the loan outstanding is paid in full (release of full provis/i.righton), or the provis/i.righton is higher than the loan outstanding (release of the excess provis/i.righton).\n\n## Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, and Private Banking clients\n\nCredit-impa/i.rightred accounts are managed by the Group's special/i.rightst recovery unit, Group Special Assets Management (GSAM), which is independent from its main businesses. Where any amount is considered irrecoverable, a stage 3 credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.righton is raised. This stage 3 provis/i.righton is the difference between the loan-carrying amount and the probabil/i.rightty-weighted present value of estimated future cash flows, reflecting a range of scenarios (typically the best, worst\n\nand most likely recovery outcomes). Where the cashflows include realisable collateral, the values used will incorporate the impact of forward-looking economic informat/i.righton.\n\nThe ind/i.rightvidual circumstances of each client are considered when GSAM estimates future cashflows and the tim/i.rightng of future recoveries which involves sign/i.rightficant judgement. All available sources, such as cashflow aris/i.rightng from operations, selling assets or subsid/i.rightaries, realis/i.rightng collateral or payments under guarantees are considered. In any decis/i.righton relating to the rais/i.rightng of provis/i.rightons, the Group attempts to balance economic condit/i.rightons, local knowledge and experience, and the results of independent asset reviews.\n\n## Write-offs\n\nWhere it is considered that there is no realist/i.rightc prospect of recovering a portion of an exposure against which an impa/i.rightrment provis/i.righton has been raised, that amount will be written off.\n\n## Governance and applicat/i.righton of expert credit judgement in respect of expected credit losses\n\nThe Group's Credit Policy and Standards framework details the requirements for continuous monitor/i.rightng to ident/i.rightfy any changes in credit quality and resultant ratings, as well as ensuring a consistent approach to monitor/i.rightng, managing and mit/i.rightgating Credit Risks. The framework aligns with the governance of ECL estimat/i.righton through the early recognit/i.righton of sign/i.rightficant deteriorat/i.rightons in ratings which drive stage 2 and 3 ECL.\n\nThe models used in determin/i.rightng expected credit losses are reviewed and approved by the Group Credit Model Assessment Committee (CMAC) which is appointed by the Model Risk Committee. CMAC has the responsib/i.rightlity to assess and approve the use of models and to review all IFRS 9 interpretat/i.rightons related to models. CMAC also provides oversight on operational matters related to model development, performance monitor/i.rightng and model validat/i.righton activ/i.rightties includ/i.rightng standards, regulatory and Group Internal Audit matters.\n\nPrior to submiss/i.righton to CMAC for approval, the models are validated by Group Model Validat/i.righton (GMV), a function which is independent of the business and the model developers. GMV's analysis comprises review of model documentation, model design and methodology, data validat/i.righton, review of the model development and calibrat/i.righton process, out-ofsample performance testing, and assessment of compliance review against IFRS 9 rules and internal standards.\n\nA quarterly model monitor/i.rightng process is in place that uses recent data to compare the differences between model predict/i.rightons and actual outcomes against approved thresholds. Where a model's performance breaches the monitor/i.rightng thresholds, an assessment of whether a PMA is required to correct for the ident/i.rightfied model issue is completed.\n\nKey inputs into the calculation and resulting expected credit loss provis/i.rightons are subject to review and approval by the IFRS 9 Impairment Committee (IIC) which is appointed by the Group Risk Committee. The IIC consists of senior representatives from Risk, Finance, and Group Economic Research. It meets at least twice every quarter, once before the models are run to approve key inputs into the calculation, and once after the models are run to approve the expected credit loss provis/i.rightons and any judgemental overrides that may be necessary.",

        "page_content": "## Traded Risk\n\nTraded Risk is the potential for loss resulting from activ/i.rightties undertaken by the Group in financ/i.rightal markets. Under the Enterprise Risk Management Framework, the Traded Risk Framework brings together Market Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk and Algorithm/i.rightc Trading. Traded Risk Management is the core risk management function supporting marketfacing businesses, predominantly Financ/i.rightal Markets and Treasury Markets.\n\n## Market Risk (audited)\n\nMarket Risk is the potential for loss of economic value due to adverse changes in financ/i.rightal market rates or prices. The Group's exposure to Market Risk arises predominantly from the following sources:\n\n- \u00b7 Trading book:\n- -  The Group provides clients access to financ/i.rightal markets, facil/i.righttation of which entails the Group taking moderate Market Risk posit/i.rightons. All trading teams support client activ/i.rightty. There are no proprietary trading teams. Hence, income earned from Market Risk-related activ/i.rightties is primar/i.rightly driven by the volume of client activ/i.rightty rather than risk-taking\n- \u00b7 Non-trading book:\n- -  The Treasury Markets desk is required to hold a liqu/i.rightd assets buffer, much of which is held in high-quality marketable debt securit/i.rightes\n- -  The Group has capital invested and related income streams denominated in currencies other than US dollars. To the extent that these are not hedged, the Group is subject to Structural Foreign Exchange Risk which is reflected in reserves\n\nA summary of our current polic/i.rightes and practices regarding Market Risk management is provided in the Princ/i.rightpal Risks section (page 267).\n\nThe primary categories of Market Risk for the Group are:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Rate Risk: aris/i.rightng from changes in yield curves and impl/i.righted volatil/i.rightties on interest rate options\n- \u00b7 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk: aris/i.rightng from changes in currency exchange rates and impl/i.righted volatil/i.rightties on foreign exchange options\n- \u00b7 Commodity Risk: aris/i.rightng from changes in commodity prices and impl/i.righted volatil/i.rightties on commodity options; covering energy, precious metals, base metals and agriculture as well as commodity baskets\n- \u00b7 Credit Spread Risk: aris/i.rightng from changes in the price of debt instruments and credit-linked derivat/i.rightves, driven by factors other than the level of risk-free interest rates\n- \u00b7 Equity Risk: aris/i.rightng from changes in the prices of equit/i.rightes, equity ind/i.rightces, equity baskets and impl/i.righted volatil/i.rightties on related options\n\n## Market risk changes (audited)\n\nValue-at Risk (VaR) allows the Group to manage market risk across the trading book and most of the fair valued nontrading books 1 . The scope of instruments included in the VaR was changed in 2021 to exclude instruments held at amortised cost. The 2020 VaR numbers presented reflect the revised scope.\n\nThe average level of total trading and non-trading VaR in 2021 was $54.8 mill/i.righton, 43.9 per cent lower than in 2020 ($97.6 mill/i.righton). The actual level of total trading and non-trading VaR as at the year end of 2021 was $43.4 mill/i.righton, 65.3 per cent lower than in 2020 ($125.2 mill/i.righton). The decrease in total average VaR was driven by the extreme market movements from 2020 dropping out of the one-year VaR timeser/i.rightes. However, during second half of 2021 volatil/i.rightty started to increase driven by the impact of new COVID variants.\n\nFor the trading book, the average level of VaR in 2021 was $17.2 mill/i.righton, 1.2 per cent higher than in 2020 ($17.0 mill/i.righton). Trading activ/i.rightties have remained relatively unchanged and client-driven.\n\n## Daily value at risk (VaR at 97.5%, one day) (audited)\n\n|                           | 2021                     | 2021                   | 2021                  | 2021                      | 2020                     | 2020                   | 2020                  | 2020                      |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Trading and non-trading 1 | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 2 $mill/i.righton | Low 2 $mill/i.righton | Year End  $mill/i.righton | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 2 $mill/i.righton | Low 2 $mill/i.righton | Year End  $mill/i.righton |\n| Interest Rate Risk 6      | 31.3                     | 68.3                   | 16.4                  | 26.0                      | 38.0                     | 46.9                   | 25.1                  | 41.1                      |\n| Credit Spread Risk 6      | 34.0                     | 97.6                   | 14.8                  | 21.5                      | 69.2                     | 103.1                  | 20.2                  | 81.0                      |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk     | 7. 3                     | 19.0                   | 4.2                   | 7.0                       | 6.3                      | 15.1                   | 3.0                   | 15.1                      |\n| Commodity Risk            | 4.5                      | 10.4                   | 2.3                   | 3.6                       | 2.5                      | 5.5                    | 0.7                   | 4.9                       |\n| Equity Risk               | 1.3                      | 1.7                    | 1.0                   | 1.4                       | 2.6                      | 5.4                    | 1.5                   | 1.5                       |\n| Total 3                   | 54.8                     | 140.7                  | 30.7                  | 43.4                      | 97. 6                    | 135.0                  | 28.9                  | 125.2                     |\n\n|                       | 2021                     | 2021                   | 2021                  | 2021                      | 2020                     | 2020                   | 2020                  | 2020                      |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|\n| Trading 4             | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 2 $mill/i.righton | Low 2 $mill/i.righton | Year End  $mill/i.righton | Average  $mill/i.righton | High 2 $mill/i.righton | Low 2 $mill/i.righton | Year End  $mill/i.righton |\n| Interest Rate Risk 6  | 7. 6                     | 10.2                   | 5.2                   | 7. 2                      | 8.4                      | 12.5                   | 5.0                   | 9.1                       |\n| Credit Spread Risk 6  | 8.6                      | 19.2                   | 4.2                   | 6.2                       | 13.0                     | 19. 3                  | 4.8                   | 16.3                      |\n| Foreign Exchange Risk | 7. 3                     | 19.0                   | 4.2                   | 7.0                       | 6.3                      | 15.1                   | 3.0                   | 15.1                      |\n| Commodity Risk        | 4.5                      | 10.4                   | 2.3                   | 3.6                       | 2.5                      | 5.5                    | 0.7                   | 4.9                       |\n| Equity Risk           | -                        | -                      | -                     | -                         | -                        | -                      | -                     | -                         |\n| Total 3               | 1 7. 2                   | 28.4                   | 12.3                  | 15.3                      | 1 7. 0                   | 26.9                   | 8.3                   | 24.7                      |",

An analysis has been performed on these exposures to assess the impact of a 1 per cent fall in the US dollar exchange rates, adjusted to incorporate the impacts of correlations of these currencies to the US dollar. The impact on the posit/i.rightons above would be an increase of $399 mill/i.righton (2020: $381 mill/i.righton). Changes in the valuation of these posit/i.rightons are taken to reserves. For analysis of the Group's capital posit/i.righton and requirements, refer to the Capital Review (page 288).\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nCounterparty Credit Risk is the potential for loss in the event of the default of a derivat/i.rightve counterparty, after taking into account the value of elig/i.rightble collaterals and risk mit/i.rightgation techniques. The Group's counterparty credit exposures are included in the Credit Risk section.\n\n## Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe Group enters into master netting agreements, which in the event of default result in a single amount owed by or to the counterparty through netting the sum of the posit/i.rightve and negative mark-to-market values of applicable derivat/i.rightve transactions. The value of exposure under master netting agreements is $39,502 mill/i.righton (2020: $47,097 mill/i.righton).\n\nIn addit/i.righton, the Group enters into credit support annexes (CSAs) with counterparties where collateral is deemed a necessary or desirable mit/i.rightgant to the exposure. Cash collateral includes collateral called under a variat/i.righton margin process from counterparties if total uncollateralised mark-tomarket exposure exceeds the threshold and min/i.rightmum transfer amount specif/i.righted in the CSA. With certain counterparties, the CSA is reciprocal and requires us to post collateral if the overall mark-to-market values of posit/i.rightons are in the counterparty's favour and exceed an agreed threshold.\n\n## Liqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk\n\nLiqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk is the risk that we may not have suffic/i.rightent stable or diverse sources of funding to meet our obligat/i.rightons as they fall due.\n\nThe Group's Liqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk framework requires each country to ensure that it operates with/i.rightn predefined liqu/i.rightdity lim/i.rightts and remains in compliance with Group liqu/i.rightdity polic/i.rightes and practices, as well as local regulatory requirements.\n\nThe Group achieves this through a combinat/i.righton of setting Risk Appetite and associated lim/i.rightts, policy formation, risk measurement and monitor/i.rightng, prudential and internal stress testing, governance and review.\n\nDespite the challenges brought by COVID-19, the Group has been resil/i.rightent throughout and kept a strong liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton. The Group continues to focus on improv/i.rightng the quality of its funding mix and remains committed to supporting its clients during these uncertain times.\n\n## Primary sources of funding (audited)\n\nThe Group's funding strategy is largely driven by its policy to mainta/i.rightn adequate liqu/i.rightdity at all times, in all geographic locations and for all currencies, and hence to be in a posit/i.righton to meet all obligat/i.rightons as they fall due. The Group's funding profile is therefore well divers/i.rightfied across different sources, maturit/i.rightes and currencies.\n\nOur assets are funded predominantly by customer deposits, supplemented with wholesale funding (which is divers/i.rightfied by type and maturity).\n\nWe mainta/i.rightn access to wholesale funding markets in all major financ/i.rightal centres in which we operate. This seeks to ensure that we have market intell/i.rightgence, mainta/i.rightn stable funding lines and can obtain optimal pric/i.rightng when performing our Interest Rate Risk management activ/i.rightties.\n\nIn 2021, the Group issued approximately $6.8 bill/i.righton of senior debt securit/i.rightes, $1.2 bill/i.righton of subordinated debt securit/i.rightes and $2.75 bill/i.righton of Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 securit/i.rightes from its holding company (HoldCo) Standard Chartered PLC. (2020: $6.8 bill/i.righton of term senior debt, $2.4 bill/i.righton of subordinated securit/i.rightes and $1 bill/i.righton of Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1). In the next 12 months approximately $7.5 bill/i.righton of the Group's senior debt, subordinated debt and Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 securit/i.rightes in total are either falling due for repayment contractually or callable by the Group.",

As of January 2022, the Net Stable Funding Ratio will also be included with/i.rightn Board Risk Appetite.\n\n## Liqu/i.rightdity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nThe LCR is a regulatory requirement set to ensure that the Group has suffic/i.rightent unencumbered high-quality liqu/i.rightd assets to meet its liqu/i.rightdity needs in a 30-calendar-day liqu/i.rightdity stress scenario.\n\nThe Group monitors and reports its liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.rightons under UK onshored Commiss/i.righton Delegated Regulation 2015/61 and has mainta/i.rightned its LCR above the prudential requirement. The Group mainta/i.rightned strong liqu/i.rightdity ratios despite the continued impacts of the COVID-19 stress. For further detail see the Liqu/i.rightdity section in the Standard Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures for FY 2021.\n\nThe LCR has remained unchanged at 143 per cent (2020: 143 per cent), despite revis/i.rightng our approach to calculating the LCR. We have re-assessed the methodology to more prudently reflect the portabil/i.rightty of liqu/i.rightdity across the Group, whilst still consider/i.rightng currency convertib/i.rightlity and regulatory intra group lim/i.rightts. Portable liqu/i.rightdity is defined as unsecured liqu/i.rightdity, usually in the form of cash, that is freely transferable across Group entit/i.rightes during a period of stress, thereby enabling the Group to meet its financ/i.rightal obligat/i.rightons as they fall due.\n\nWe also held adequate liqu/i.rightdity across our footprint to meet all local prudential LCR requirements where applicable.\n\n|                                 | 2021   $mill/i.righton   | 2020   $mill/i.righton   |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Liqu/i.rightdity buffer         | 172,178                  | 175,948                  |\n| Total net cash outflows         | 120,788                  | 122,664                  |\n| Liqu/i.rightdity coverage ratio | 143%                     | 143%                     |\n\n## Stressed coverage\n\nThe Group intends to mainta/i.rightn a prudent and sustainable funding and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton, in all countries and currencies, such that it can withstand a severe but plausible liqu/i.rightdity stress.\n\nOur approach to managing liqu/i.rightdity and funding is reflected in the following Board-level Risk Appetite Statement:\n\n'The Group should hold an adequate buffer of high-quality liqu/i.rightd assets to survive extreme but plausible liqu/i.rightdity stress scenarios for at least 60 days without recourse to extraordinary central bank support.'\n\nThe Group's internal liqu/i.rightdity stress testing framework covers the following stress scenarios:\n\nStandard Chartered-specif/i.rightc - Captures the liqu/i.rightdity impact from an id/i.rightosyncratic event affecting Standard Chartered only i.e. the rest of the market is assumed to operate normally.\n\nMarket wide - Captures the liqu/i.rightdity impact from a marketwide cris/i.rights affecting all partic/i.rightpants in a country, region or globally.\n\nCombined - Assumes both Standard Chartered-specif/i.rightc and Market-wide events affecting the Group simultaneously and hence is the most severe scenario.\n\nAll scenarios include, but are not lim/i.rightted to, modelled outflows for retail and wholesale funding, Off-Balance Sheet Funding Risk, Cross-currency Funding Risk, Intraday Risk, Franchise Risk and risks associated with a deteriorat/i.righton of a firm's credit rating.\n\nStress testing results show that a posit/i.rightve surplus was mainta/i.rightned under all scenarios at 31 December 2021, i.e. respective countries are able to survive for a period of time as defined under each scenario. The results take into account currency convertib/i.rightlity and portabil/i.rightty constraints while calculating the liqu/i.rightdity surplus at Group level.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank's credit ratings as at 31 December 2021 were A+ with negative outlook (Fitch), A+ with stable outlook (S&P) and A1 with stable outlook (Moody's). At 31 December 2021, the estimated contractual outflow of a three-notch long-term ratings downgrade is $1.7 bill/i.righton.\n\nR\n\ni\n\nn\n\ns\n\na",

        "page_content": "## External wholesale borrowing\n\nThe Board sets a risk lim/i.rightt to prevent excessive reliance on wholesale borrowing. With/i.rightn the defin/i.righttion of Wholesale Borrowing, lim/i.rightts are applied to all branches and operating subsid/i.rightaries in the Group and as at the reporting date, the Group remained with/i.rightn Board Risk Appetite.\n\n## Advances-to-deposits ratio\n\nThis is defined as the ratio of total loans and advances to customers relative to total customer accounts. An advancesto-deposits ratio of below 100 per cent demonstrates that customer deposits exceed customer loans as a result of the emphasis placed on generating a high level of funding from customers.\n\nThe Group's advances-to-deposits ratio has decreased by 2.0 per cent to 59.1 per cent, driven by an 8 per cent growth in customer deposits, most of which came from corporate customers.\n\n|                                           | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Total loans and advances to customers 1,2 | 285,922                 | 273,861                 |\n| Total customer accounts 3                 | 483,861                 | 448,236                 |\n| Advances-to-deposits ratio                | 59.1%                   | 61.1%                   |\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nThe NSFR is a balance sheet metric which requires inst/i.righttutions to mainta/i.rightn a stable funding profile in relation to an assumed duration of their assets and off-balance sheet activ/i.rightties over a one-year horizon. It is the ratio between the amount of available stable funding (ASF) and the amount of required stable funding (RSF). ASF factors are applied to balance sheet liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and capital, based on their perceived stabil/i.rightty and the amount of stable funding they provide. Likew/i.rightse, RSF factors are applied to assets and off-balance sheet exposures according to the amount of stable funding they require. The NSFR became a regulatory requirement in January 2022 with a min/i.rightmum of 100 per cent. At the last reporting date, the Group NSFR remained above 100 per cent.\n\n## Liqu/i.rightdity pool\n\nThe liqu/i.rightdity value of the Group's LCR elig/i.rightble liqu/i.rightdity pool at the reporting date was $ 172 bill/i.righton. The figures in the table below account for haircuts, currency convertib/i.rightlity and portabil/i.rightty constraints, and therefore are not directly comparable with the consolidated balance sheet. Liqu/i.rightdity pool is held to offset stress outflows as defined in UK onshored Commiss/i.righton Delegated Regulation 2015/61.

Cash collateral pledged against derivat/i.rightves and Hong Kong Government certif/i.rightcates of indebtedness, which secure the equivalent amount of Hong Kong currency notes in circulat/i.righton, are included with/i.rightn Other assets.\n\n## Unencumbered - readily available for encumbrance\n\nUnencumbered assets that are considered by the Group to be readily available in the normal course of business to secure funding, meet collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements and are not subject to any restrict/i.rightons on their use for these purposes.\n\n## Unencumbered - other assets capable of being encumbered\n\nUnencumbered assets that, in their current form, are not considered by the Group to be readily realisable in the normal course of business to secure funding, meet collateral needs,\n\nor be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements and are not subject to any restrict/i.rightons on their use for these purposes. Included with/i.rightn this category are loans and advances which would be suitable for use in secured funding structures such as securit/i.rightsations.\n\n## Unencumbered - cannot be encumbered\n\nUnencumbered assets that have not been pledged and cannot be used to secure funding, meet collateral needs, or be sold to reduce potential future funding requirements, as assessed by the Group.\n\n## Derivat/i.rightves, reverse repurchase assets and stock lending\n\nThese assets are shown separately as these on-balance sheet amounts cannot be pledged. However, these assets can give rise to off-balance sheet collateral which can be used to raise secured funding or meet addit/i.rightonal funding requirements.\n\nThe following table provides a

Contractual maturit/i.rightes do not necessarily reflect actual repayments or cashflows.\n\nWith/i.rightn the tables below, cash and balances with central banks, interbank placements and investment securit/i.rightes that are fair value through other comprehensive income are used by the Group princ/i.rightpally for liqu/i.rightdity management purposes.\n\nAs at the reporting date, assets remain predominantly short-dated, with 59 per cent maturing in under one year. Our less than three-month cumulative net funding posit/i.righton remained in surplus and the scale of the surplus increased from the previous year, largely due to an increase in customer accounts as the Group focused on improv/i.rightng the quality of its deposit base. In practice, these deposits are recognised as stable and have behavioural profiles that extend beyond their contractual maturit/i.rightes\n\n|

financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nThe cashflows presented in the previous section reflect the cashflows that will be contractually payable over the residual maturity of the instruments. However, contractual maturit/i.rightes do not necessarily reflect the tim/i.rightng of actual repayments or cashflow. In practice, certain assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes behave differently from their contractual terms, especially for shortterm customer accounts, credit card balances and overdrafts, which extend to a longer period than their contractual maturity. On the other hand, mortgage balances tend to have a shorter repayment period than their contractual maturity date. Expected customer behaviour is assessed and managed on a country basis using qualitat/i.rightve and quantitat/i.rightve techniques, includ/i.rightng analysis of observed customer behaviour over time.",

The sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes shown represent the estimated change to a hypothetical base case projected net interest income (NII), plus the change in interest rate impl/i.righted income and expense from FX swaps used to manage banking book currency posit/i.rightons, under the different interest rate shock scenarios.\n\nThe interest rate sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes are ind/i.rightcative and based on simpl/i.rightfied scenarios, estimat/i.rightng the aggregate impact of an instantaneous parallel shock across all yield curves over\n\none-year horizon, includ/i.rightng the time taken to implement changes to pric/i.rightng before becoming effective. The assessment assumes that the size and mix of the balance sheet remain constant and that there are no specif/i.rightc management actions in response to the change in rates. No assumptions are made in relation to the impact on credit spreads in a changing rate environment.\n\nSign/i.rightficant modelling and behavioural assumptions are made regarding scenario simpl/i.rightficat/i.righton, market competit/i.righton, pass-through rates, asset and liab/i.rightlity re-pric/i.rightng tenors, and price flooring. In particular, the assumption that interest rates of all currencies and maturit/i.rightes shift by the same amount concurrently, and that no actions are taken to mit/i.rightgate the impacts aris/i.rightng from this are considered unlikely. Reported sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes will vary over time due to a number of factors includ/i.rightng changes in balance sheet composit/i.righton, market condit/i.rightons, customer behaviour and risk management strategy and should therefore not be considered an income or profit forecast.\n\n|                                                                                                                           | 2021                       | 2021                       | 2021                      | 2021                      | 2021                      | 2021                                   | 2021                    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Estimated one-year impact to earnings from   a parallel shift in yield curves at the beginn/i.rightng   of the period of: | USD bloc  $mill/i.righton  | HKD bloc  $mill/i.righton  | SGD bloc  $mill/i.righton | KRW bloc  $mill/i.righton | CNY bloc  $mill/i.righton | Other  currency  bloc  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton  |\n| + 50 basis points                                                                                                         | 200                        | 150                        | 70                        | 50                        | 50                        | 140                                    | 660                     |\n| - 50 basis points                                                                                                         | (210)                      | (170)                      | (70)                      | (40)                      | (50)                      | (130)                                  | (670)                   |\n| + 100 basis points                                                                                                        | 380                        | 280                        | 130                       | 80                        | 90                        | 300                                    | 1,260                   |\n|                                                                                                                           | 2020                       | 2020                       | 2020                      | 2020                      | 2020                      | 2020                                   | 2020                    |\n| Estimated one-year impact to earnings from   a parallel shift in yield curves at the beginn/i.rightng   of the period of: | USD bloc 1 $mill/i.righton | HKD bloc 1 $mill/i.righton | SGD bloc  $mill/i.righton | KRW bloc  $mill/i.righton | CNY bloc  $mill/i.righton | Other  currency  bloc  $mill/i.righton | Total 1 $mill/i.righton |\n| + 50 basis points                                                                                                         | 100                        | 100                        | 50                        | 50                        | 10                        | 60                                     | 370                     |\n| - 50 basis points                                                                                                         | (180)                      | (70)                       | (50)                      | (60)                      | (20)                      | (70)                                   | (450)                   |\n| + 100 basis points                                                                                                        | 200                        | 90                         | 90                        | 100                       | 30                        | 110                                    | 620                     |\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Group estimates the one-year impact of an instantaneous, parallel increase across all yield curves of 50 basis points to increase projected NII by $660 mill/i.righton. The equivalent impact from a parallel decrease of 50 basis points would result in a reduction in projected NII of $670 mill/i.righton. The Group estimates the one-year impact of an instantaneous, parallel increase across all yield curves of 100 basis points to increase projected NII by $1,260 mill/i.righton.\n\nThe benefit from ris/i.rightng interest rates is primar/i.rightly from reinvest/i.rightng at higher yields and from assets re-pric/i.rightng faster and to a greater extent than deposits. NII sensit/i.rightvity in all scenarios has increased versus 31 December 2020 due to changes in modelling assumptions to reflect expected re-pric/i.rightng activ/i.rightty on Retail and Transaction Banking current accounts and savings accounts in the current interest rate environment, and to recognise the interest rate sensit/i.rightvity of banking book income when provid/i.rightng funding to the trading book. The inclus/i.righton of this item now aligns the measurement scope to that used for the calculation of the Group's net interest margin, and has increased the reported sensit/i.rightvity to the 50 basis point parallel shocks by $170 mill/i.righton, and to a 100 basis point parallel up shock by $340 mill/i.righton, primar/i.rightly in US dollars.\n\nThe asymmetry between the up and down 50 basis point shock is primar/i.rightly due to the low level of interest rates, which may constrain the Group's abil/i.rightty to reprice assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes should rates fall by a further 50 basis points, as well as differ/i.rightng behavioural assumptions, which are scenario specif/i.rightc. The level of asymmetry has changed since 31 December 2020 due to an increase in the proportion of the Group's assets whose pric/i.rightng is assumed to be floored under the 50 basis point parallel down shock, and which now largely offsets the assumed impact of flooring liab/i.rightlity pric/i.rightng under the same scenario, primar/i.rightly in Greater China and North Asia. The decis/i.righton to pass on changes in interest rates is highly subject/i.rightve and depends on a range of factors includ/i.rightng market environment and competitor behaviour.",

It is inherent in the Group carrying out business and can be impacted from a range of operational risks.\n\n## Operational Risk profile\n\nIn 2021, the Group has taken steps for further embedding of the enhanced framework to augment the management of operational risk with the aim of ensuring that risk is managed with/i.rightn Risk Appetite and we continue to deliver services to our clients.\n\nThe Group has continued to provide a stable level of service to clients during the period of COVID-19 and adapted swiftly to changes in operations brought by the pandemic.

The Group adds value to clients and the communit/i.rightes in which they operate by taking and managing appropriate levels of risk, which in turn generates returns for shareholders.\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF) enables the Group to manage enterprise-wide risks, with the object/i.rightve of maxim/i.rightsing risk-adjusted returns while remain/i.rightng with/i.rightn our Risk Appetite. The ERMF has been designed with the explic/i.rightt goal of improv/i.rightng the Group's risk management, and since its launch in January 2018, it has been embedded across the Group and rolled out to its branches and subsid/i.rightaries 1 .\n\nIn 2021, we completed a comprehensive review of the ERMF, and the following changes were approved by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7 Cross-cutting risks have been reposit/i.rightoned as Integrated Risk Types (IRT) and are defined as 'risks that are sign/i.rightficant in nature and material/i.rightse primar/i.rightly through the relevant Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types'. The ERMF sets out the roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes and min/i.rightmum governance requirements for management of IRTs.\n- \u00b7 Given their integrated nature, Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk and Third-Party Risk, in addit/i.righton to Climate Risk, have been categorised as Integrated Risk Types in the ERMF.\n- \u00b7 The Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Princ/i.rightpal Risk Type has been renamed to Treasury Risk and the scope of the risk type has been expanded to cover Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB).\n\nThe revised ERMF was approved in February 2022 and will become effective in March 2022.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nThe Group's risk culture provides guid/i.rightng princ/i.rightples for the behaviours expected from our people when managing risk. The Board has approved a risk culture statement that encourages the following behaviours and outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 An enterprise-level abil/i.rightty to ident/i.rightfy and assess current and future risks, openly discuss these and take prompt actions.\n- \u00b7 The highest level of integr/i.rightty by being transparent and proactive in disclos/i.rightng and managing all types of risks.\n- \u00b7 A constructive and collaborative approach in provid/i.rightng oversight and challenge, and taking decis/i.rightons in a timely manner.\n- \u00b7 Everyone to be accountable for their decis/i.rightons and feel safe in using their judgement to make these considered decis/i.rightons.\n\nWe acknowledge that banking inherently involves risk-taking and undesired outcomes will occur from time to time; however, we shall take the opportunity to learn from our experience and formalise what we can do to improve. We expect managers to demonstrate a high awareness of risk and control by self-ident/i.rightfying issues and managing them in a manner that will deliver lasting change.\n\n## Strategic risk management\n\nThe Group approaches strategic risk management as follows:\n\n\u00b7\n\nBy conducting an impact analysis on the risk profile from\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- growth plans, strategic in/i.righttiat/i.rightves and business model vulnerabil/i.rightties, with the aim of proactively ident/i.rightfying and managing new risks or exist/i.rightng risks that need to be reprior/i.righttised as part of the strategy review process.\n- \u00b7 By confirm/i.rightng that growth plans and strategic in/i.righttiat/i.rightves can be delivered with/i.rightn the approved Risk Appetite and/or proposing addit/i.rightonal Risk Appetite for Board considerat/i.righton as part of the strategy review process. Stress testing\n- \u00b7 By validat/i.rightng the Corporate Plan against the approved or proposed Risk Appetite Statement to the Board. The Board approves the strategy review and the five-year Corporate Plan with a confirmat/i.righton from the Group Chief Risk Officer that it is aligned with the ERMF and the Group Risk Appetite Statement where project/i.rightons allow.\n- \u00b7 Country Risk management approach and Country Risk reviews are used to ensure the country lim/i.rightts and exposures are reasonable and in line with Group strategy, country strategy, and the operating environment, consider/i.rightng the ident/i.rightfied risks.\n\n## Roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\n## Senior Managers Regime 2\n\nRoles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes under the ERMF are aligned to the object/i.rightves of the Senior Managers Regime. The Group Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall development and maintenance of the Group's ERMF and for ident/i.rightfying material risk types to which the Group may be potentially exposed. The Group Chief Risk Officer delegates effective implementat/i.righton of the Risk Type Frameworks (RTFs) to Risk Framework Owners who provide second line of defence oversight for the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types (PRTs). In addit/i.righton, the Group Chief Risk Officer has been formally ident/i.rightfied as the relevant senior manager responsible for the development of the Group's Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk Assessment Approach, as well as the senior manager responsible for Climate Risk management as it relates to financ/i.rightal and non-financ/i.rightal risks to the Group aris/i.rightng from climate change. This does not include elements of corporate social responsib/i.rightlity, the Group's contribut/i.righton to climate change and the Sustainable Finance strategy supporting a low-carbon transit/i.righton, which are the responsib/i.rightlity of other relevant senior managers.\n\n- 1 The Group's Risk Management Framework and System of Internal Control applies only to wholly controlled subsid/i.rightaries of the Group, and not to Associates, Joint Ventures or Structured Entit/i.rightes of the Group.\n- 2 Senior managers refer to ind/i.rightviduals designated as senior management functions under the FCA and PRA Senior Managers Regime (SMR).",

        "page_content": "## Risk Appetite and profile\n\nWe recognise the following constraints which determine the risks that we are will/i.rightng to take in pursuit of our strategy and the development of a sustainable business:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk the Group can assume, given its current capabil/i.rightties and resources, before breaching constraints determined by capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements and internal operational capabil/i.rightty (includ/i.rightng but not lim/i.rightted to technical infrastructure, risk management capabil/i.rightties, expertise), or otherwise fail/i.rightng to meet the expectations of regulators and law enforcement agencies.\n- \u00b7 Risk Appetite is defined by the Group and approved by the Board. It is the maximum amount and type of risk the Group is will/i.rightng to assume in pursuit of its strategy. Risk Appetite cannot exceed risk capacity.\n\nThe Board has approved a Risk Appetite Statement, which is underpinned by a set of financ/i.rightal and operational control parameters known as Risk Appetite metrics and their associated thresholds. These directly constrain the aggregate risk exposures that can be taken across the Group.\n\nThe Group Risk Appetite is reviewed at least on an annual basis to ensure that it is fit for purpose and aligned with strategy, and focus is given to emerging or new risks. The Risk Appetite Statement is supplemented by an overarching statement outlin/i.rightng the Group's Risk Appetite princ/i.rightples.\n\n## Risk Appetite princ/i.rightples\n\nThe Group Risk Appetite is defined in accordance with risk management princ/i.rightples that inform our overall approach to risk management and our risk culture. We follow the highest ethical standards and ensure a fair outcome for our clients, as well as facil/i.righttating the effective operation of financ/i.rightal markets, while at the same time meeting expectations of regulators and law enforcement agencies. We set our Risk Appetite to enable us to grow sustainably and to avoid shocks to earnings or our general financ/i.rightal health, as well as manage our Reputational Risk in a way that does not materially undermine the confidence of our investors and all internal and external stakeholders.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group will not compromise adherence to its Risk Appetite in order to pursue revenue growth or higher returns. The Group Risk Appetite is supplemented by risk control tools such as granular level lim/i.rightts, polic/i.rightes, standards and other operational control parameters that are used to keep the Group's risk profile with/i.rightn Risk Appetite. The Group's risk profile is its overall exposure to risk at a given point in time, covering all applicable risk types. Status against Risk Appetite is reported to the Board, Board Risk Committee and the Group Risk Committee, includ/i.rightng the status of breaches and remediat/i.righton plans where applicable. To keep the Group's risk profile with/i.rightn Risk Appetite (and therefore also risk capacity), we have cascaded crit/i.rightcal Group Risk Appetite metrics across our Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types to our footprint markets with sign/i.rightficant business operations.\n\nCountry Risk Appetite is managed at a country or local level with Group and regional oversight. In addit/i.righton to Risk Appetite Statements for the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types, the Group also has a Risk Appetite Statement for Climate Risk which is an Integrated Risk Type that can manifest through other risk types. Considerat/i.righton for standalone Risk Appetite Statements will be given in 2022 for addit/i.rightonal integrated risks such as Third-Party Risk and Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk. These risk types are currently supported by Risk Appetite metrics embedded with/i.rightn the respective PRTs. The Group Risk Committee, the Group Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, the Group NonFinanc/i.rightal Risk Committee and the Group Asset and Liab/i.rightlity\n\nCommittee are responsible for ensuring that our risk profile is managed in compliance with the Risk Appetite set by the Board. The Board Risk Committee and the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee (for Financ/i.rightal Crime Compliance) advise the Board on and monitor the Group's compliance with the Risk Appetite Statement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe ind/i.rightvidual Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types' Risk Appetite Statements approved by the Board are set out in the Princ/i.rightpal Risks section ( pages 264 to 279 ).\n\n## Risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and assessment\n\nIdentif/i.rightcation and assessment of potentially adverse risk events is an essential first step in managing the risks of any business or activ/i.rightty. To ensure consistency in communicat/i.righton we use Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types to classify our risk exposures.\n\nNevertheless, we also recognise the need to mainta/i.rightn a holist/i.rightc perspective since a single transaction or activ/i.rightty may give rise to multiple types of risk exposure; risk concentrations may arise from multiple exposures that are closely correlated; and a given risk exposure may change its form from one risk type to another. There are also sources of risk that arise beyond our own operations such as the Group's dependency on suppliers for the provis/i.righton of services and technology.\n\nAs the Group remains accountable for risks aris/i.rightng from the actions of such third-parties, failure to adequately monitor and manage these relationsh/i.rightps could materially impact the Group's abil/i.rightty to operate and could have an impact on our abil/i.rightty to continue to provide services that are material to the Group.\n\nTo facil/i.righttate risk ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and assessment, the Group mainta/i.rightns a dynamic risk-scanning process with inputs from the internal and external risk environment, as well as potential threats and opportunit/i.rightes from the business and client perspectives. The Group mainta/i.rightns a taxonomy of the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types, Integrated Risk Types and risk sub-types that are inherent to the strategy and business model; as well as an emerging risks inventory that includes near-term as well as longer-term uncertaint/i.rightes. Near-term risks are those that are on the horizon and can be measured and mit/i.rightgated to some extent, while uncertaint/i.rightes are longer-term matters that should be on the radar but are not yet fully measurable.\n\nThe Group Chief Risk Officer and the Group Risk Committee review regular reports on the risk profile for the Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types, adherence to the approved Risk Appetite and the Group risk inventory includ/i.rightng emerging risks. They use this informat/i.righton to escalate material developments in each risk event and make recommendations to the Board annually on any potential changes to our Corporate Plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther informat/i.righton on the Group's emerging risks can be found on pages 280 to 287 .\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe object/i.rightve of stress testing is to support the Group in assessing that it:\n\n- \u00b7 does not have a portfolio with excessive risk concentration that could produce unacceptably high losses under severe but plausible scenarios\n- \u00b7 has suffic/i.rightent financ/i.rightal resources to withstand severe but plausible scenarios\n- \u00b7 has the financ/i.rightal flexib/i.rightlity to respond to extreme but plausible scenarios\n- \u00b7 understands the key business model risks and considers what kind of event might crystallise those risks - even if extreme with a low likel/i.righthood of occurring - and ident/i.rightfies as required, actions to mit/i.rightgate the likel/i.righthood or impact as required.",

Unless set by the Bank of England, scenario design is a bespoke process that aims to explore risks that can adversely impact the Group.\n\nThe Board delegates approval of stress test submiss/i.rightons to the Bank of England to the Board Risk Committee, which reviews the recommendations from the Group Risk Committee.\n\nBased on the stress test results, the Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer and Group Chief Risk Officer can recommend strategic actions to the Board to ensure that the Group strategy remains with/i.rightn the Board-approved Risk Appetite.\n\n## Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types\n\nPrinc/i.rightpal Risk Types are risks that are inherent in our strategy and business model and have been formally defined in the Group's ERMF. These risks are managed through dist/i.rightnct RTFs which are approved by the Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types and associated Risk Appetite Statements are approved by the Board.\n\nThe Group currently recognises Climate Risk, Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk and Third-Party Risk as Integrated Risk Types. Climate Risk is defined as 'the potential for financ/i.rightal loss and non-financ/i.rightal detriments aris/i.rightng from climate change and society's\n\nresponse to it'; Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk is defined as 'the potential for regulatory penalties, financ/i.rightal loss and or reputational damage to the Group resulting from dig/i.righttal asset exposure or dig/i.righttal asset related activ/i.rightties aris/i.rightng from the Group's Clients, Products and Projects' and Third-Party risk is defined as 'the potential for loss or adverse impact from failure to manage multiple risks aris/i.rightng from the use of third parties, and is the aggregate of these risks.'\n\nIn line with the Group's strategy to explore dig/i.righttal-asset related opportunit/i.rightes, the Group continued to develop and enhance its Dig/i.righttal Asset Risk Management approach during 2021 in order to further embed risk management practices and ensure that dig/i.righttal asset activ/i.rightties across the Group are appropriately risk managed, and with/i.rightn the Group's Risk Appetite. The approach requires comprehensive assessments of risks aris/i.rightng from such in/i.righttiat/i.rightves and seeks to integrate the approach with/i.rightn exist/i.rightng risk management practices. The approach recognises the need for dig/i.righttal asset subject matter experts to assess and advise on the specif/i.rightc risks presented by dig/i.righttal assets. A Dig/i.righttal Assets Risk Management policy, outlin/i.rightng requirements for dig/i.righttal asset in/i.righttiat/i.rightves, has been implemented and is supported by defined processes, templates and guidance relating to the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton of higher-risk dig/i.righttal asset activ/i.rightties, coin admiss/i.righton requirements, and enhanced due dil/i.rightgence practices for products, projects and clients. The Group has formalised a stand-alone committee to oversee dig/i.righttal asset related risks.\n\nIn future reviews, we will continue to consider if exist/i.rightng Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types or incremental risks should be treated as Integrated Risk Types. The table below shows the Group's current Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types.\n\n| Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types                 | Defin/i.righttion   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit Risk                                 | \u00b7                   | Potential for loss due to the failure of a counterparty to meet its agreed obligat/i.rightons to pay  the Group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Traded Risk                                 | \u00b7                   | Potential for loss resulting from activ/i.rightties undertaken by the Group in financ/i.rightal markets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Treasury Risk                               | \u00b7                   | Treasury Risk is formed of Capital and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk, and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking  Book.

To facil/i.righttate this, an ERMF effectiveness review was established in 2018, which follows the princ/i.rightple of evidence-based self-assessments for all the Risk Type Frameworks and relevant polic/i.rightes. A top-down review and challenge of the results is conducted by the Group Chief Risk Officer with all Risk Framework Owners, and an opin/i.righton on the internal control environment is provided by Group Internal Audit.\n\nThe ERMF effectiveness review is conducted annually and enables measurement of progress against the 2018 baseline. The key outcomes of the 2021 effectiveness review are:\n\n- \u00b7 While the ERMF has evolved over the past four years to reflect changes in the risk profile, the focus in 2021 continued on the effective embedding of the framework across the organisat/i.righton.\n- \u00b7 The more mature financ/i.rightal risks continued to be more effectively managed on a relative basis compared to non-financ/i.rightal risks, and other aspects of the ERMF are established and operating to a more consistent standard, includ/i.rightng the key risk committees and key supporting standards.\n- \u00b7 Self-assessments performed in our footprint markets reflect the maturing ERMF adoption with emphasis on first-line ownership of risks. Country and regional risk committees continue to play an active and vital role in managing and overseeing material issues aris/i.rightng in countries.\n\nOver the course of 2022, the Group aims to further strengthen its risk management practices through further improv/i.rightng on the management of non-financ/i.rightal risks with/i.rightn its businesses, functions and across the footprint, as well as management of risks which are integrated in nature.\n\n## Executive and Board risk oversight\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Board has ultimate responsib/i.rightlity for risk management and is supported by six Board-level committees. The Board approves the ERMF based on the recommendation from the Board Risk Committee, which also recommends the Group Risk Appetite Statement for all Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types other than Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk. Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Appetite is reviewed and recommended to the Board by the Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee. In addit/i.righton, the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee (CSC) oversees the Group's culture and key sustainab/i.rightlity prior/i.rightties.\n\n## Board and Executive level risk committee governance structure\n\nThe Committee governance structure below presents the view as of 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAsia Risk Committee derives authority from both the Group Risk Committee (for oversight of the Asia region) and the Executive Committee of Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Lim/i.rightted ('SCBHK') for oversight of SCBHK Group.",

The Credit Risk function is the second-line control function responsible for independent challenge, monitor/i.rightng and oversight of the Credit Risk management practices of the business and functions engaged in or supporting revenuegenerating activ/i.rightties which constitute the first line of defence. In addit/i.righton, they ensure that credit risks are properly assessed and transparent; and that credit decis/i.rightons are controlled in accordance with the Group's Risk Appetite, credit polic/i.rightes and standards.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nSegment-specif/i.rightc polic/i.rightes are in place for the management of Credit Risk. The Credit Policy for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage sets the princ/i.rightples that must be followed for the end-to-end credit process includ/i.rightng credit in/i.righttiat/i.righton, credit grading, credit assessment, product structuring, Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation, monitor/i.rightng and control, and documentation.\n\nThe Consumer, Private and Business Banking Credit Risk Management Policy sets the princ/i.rightples for the management of Consumer, Private and Business Banking segments, that must be followed for end-to-end credit process includ/i.rightng credit in/i.righttiat/i.righton, credit assessment and monitor/i.rightng for lending to these segments.\n\nThe Group also sets out standards for the elig/i.rightbil/i.rightty, enforceabil/i.rightty and effectiveness of Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation arrangements. Potential credit losses from a given account, client or portfolio are mit/i.rightgated using a range of tools such as collateral, netting agreements, credit insurance, credit derivat/i.rightves and guarantees.\n\nRisk mit/i.rightgants are also carefully assessed for their market value, legal enforceabil/i.rightty, correlation and counterparty risk of the protection provider.\n\nCollateral must be valued prior to drawdown and regularly thereafter as required, to reflect current market condit/i.rightons, the probabil/i.rightty of recovery and the period of time to realise the collateral in the event of liqu/i.rightdation. The Group also seeks to divers/i.rightfy its collateral holdings across asset classes and markets.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group manages its credit exposures following the princ/i.rightple of divers/i.rightficat/i.righton across products, geographies, client segments and industry sectors.\n\nWhere guarantees, credit insurance, standby letters of credit or credit derivat/i.rightves are used as Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation, the creditworth/i.rightness of the protection provider is assessed and monitored using the same credit approval process applied to the obligor.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Credit Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee (GRC) oversees and appoints sub-committees for the management of Credit Risk - in particular the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Risk Committee (CCIBRC), Consumer, Private and Business Banking Risk Committee (CPBBRC), and the regional risk committees for Asia, and Africa & Middle East. The GRC also receives reports from other key Group Committees such as the Standard Chartered Bank Executive Risk Committee.\n\nThese committees are responsible for overseeing the Credit Risk profile of the Group with/i.rightn the respective business areas and regions. Meetings are held regularly, and the committees monitor all material Credit Risk exposures, as well as key internal developments and external trends, and ensure that appropriate action is taken.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Credit Risk Type Frameworks are the formal mechanism which delegate Credit Risk authorit/i.rightes cascading from the Group Chief Risk Officer, as the Senior Manager of the Credit Risk Type, to ind/i.rightviduals such as the business segments' Chief Risk Officers. Named ind/i.rightviduals further delegate credit authorit/i.rightes to ind/i.rightvidual credit officers based on risk-adjusted scales by customer type or portfolio.\n\nCredit Risk authorit/i.rightes are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate. In Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage, the ind/i.rightviduals delegating the Credit Risk authorit/i.rightes perform oversight by review/i.rightng a sample of the lim/i.rightt applicat/i.rightons approved by the delegated credit officers on a monthly basis. In Consumer, Private and Business Banking, in most cases credit decis/i.righton systems and tools (e.g. applicat/i.righton scorecards) are used for credit decis/i.rightoning. Where manual or discret/i.rightonary credit decis/i.rightons are applied, these are subject to period/i.rightc quality control assessment and assurance checks.",

        "page_content": "## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nWe regularly monitor credit exposures, portfolio performance, and external trends that may impact risk management outcomes. Internal risk management reports that are presented to risk committees contain informat/i.righton on key polit/i.rightcal and economic trends across major portfolios and countries, portfolio delinquency and loan impa/i.rightrment performance.\n\nThe Industry Portfolio Mandate, developed jo/i.rightntly by the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage business and the Risk function, provides a forwardlooking assessment of risk using a platform from which business strategy, risk considerat/i.rightons and client planning are performed with one consensus view of the external industry outlook, portfolio overviews, Risk Appetite, underwrit/i.rightng princ/i.rightples and stress test ins/i.rightghts.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage, clients and portfolios are subjected to addit/i.rightonal review when they display signs of actual or potential weakness; for example, where there is a decline in the client's posit/i.righton with/i.rightn the industry, financ/i.rightal deteriorat/i.righton, a breach of covenants, or non-performance of an obligat/i.righton with/i.rightn the stipulated period. Such accounts are subjected to a dedicated process overseen by the Credit Issues Committees in the relevant countries where client account strategies and credit grades are re-evaluated. In addit/i.righton, remedial actions, includ/i.rightng exposure reduction, security enhancement or exit/i.rightng the account, could be undertaken, and certain accounts could also be transferred into the control of Group Special Assets Management (GSAM), which is our special/i.rightst recovery unit for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage that operates independently from our main business.\n\nFor Consumer, Private and Business Banking, exposures and collateral monitor/i.rightng are performed at the counterparty and/or portfolio level across different client segments to ensure transactions and portfolio exposures remain with/i.rightn Risk Appetite. Portfolio delinquency trends are monitored on an ongoing basis. Accounts that are past due (or perceived as high risk but not yet past due) are subject to a collections or recovery process managed by a special/i.rightst function independent from the orig/i.rightnation function. In some countries, aspects of collections and recovery activ/i.rightties are outsourced. For discret/i.rightonary lending portfolios, sim/i.rightlar processes as of Commercial client coverage are followed.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, an independent Credit Risk Review team (part of Enterprise Risk Management), performs judgement-based assessments of the Credit Risk profiles at various portfolio levels, with focus on selected countries and segments through deep dives, comparative analysis, and review and challenge of the basis of credit approvals. The review ensures that the evolving Credit Risk profiles of Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Consumer, Private and Business Banking are well managed with/i.rightn our Risk Appetite and polic/i.rightes through prompt and forward-looking mit/i.rightgating actions.\n\n## Credit rating and measurement\n\nAll credit proposals are subject to a robust Credit Risk assessment. It includes a comprehensive evaluation of the client's credit quality, includ/i.rightng will/i.rightngness, abil/i.rightty and capacity to repay. The primary lending considerat/i.righton is based on the client's credit quality and the repayment capacity from operating cashflows for counterparties, and personal income or wealth for ind/i.rightvidual borrowers. The risk assessment gives due considerat/i.righton to the client's liqu/i.rightdity and leverage posit/i.righton. Where applicable, the assessment includes a detailed analysis of the Credit Risk mit/i.rightgation arrangements to determine the level of reliance on such arrangements as the secondary source of repayment in the event of a sign/i.rightficant deteriorat/i.righton in a client's credit quality leading to default.\n\nRisk measurement plays a central role, along with judgement and experience, in inform/i.rightng risk-taking and portfolio management decis/i.rightons. Since 1 January 2008, we have used the advanced internal ratings-based approach under the Basel regulatory framework to calculate Credit Risk capital requirements. The Group has also established a global programme to undertake a comprehensive assessment of capital requirements necessary to be implemented to meet the latest revised Basel III final/i.rightsation (Basel IV) regulations.\n\nA standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade system is used for Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage. The numeric grades run from 1 to 14 and some of the grades are further sub-classif/i.righted. Lower numeric credit grades are ind/i.rightcative of a lower likel/i.righthood of default. Credit grades 1 to 12 are assigned to performing customers, while credit grades 13 and 14 are assigned to non-performing or defaulted customers.\n\nConsumer, Private and Business Banking internal ratingsbased portfolios use applicat/i.righton and behavioural credit scores that are calibrated to generate a probabil/i.rightty of default and then mapped to the standard alphanumeric Credit Risk grade system. We refer to external ratings from credit bureaus (where these are available); however, we do not rely solely on these to determine CPBB credit grades. Risk Decis/i.righton Framework (RDF) as a credit rating system supports the delivery of optimum risk-adjusted-returns with controlled volatil/i.rightty and is used to define the portfolio/new booking segmentation, shape and decis/i.righton criter/i.righta for the unsecured consumer business segment.\n\nAdvanced internal ratings-based models cover a substantial major/i.rightty of our exposures and are used in assessing risks at a customer and portfolio level, setting strategy and optim/i.rightsing our risk-return decis/i.rightons. Material internal ratings-based risk measurement models are approved by the Model Risk Committee. Prior to review and approval, all internal ratingsbased models are validated in detail by a model validat/i.righton team, which is separate from the teams that develop and mainta/i.rightn the models. Models undergo annual validat/i.righton by an independent model validat/i.righton team. Reviews are also triggered if the performance of a model deteriorates materially against predetermined thresholds during the ongoing model performance monitor/i.rightng process which takes place between the annual validat/i.rightons.",

        "page_content": "## Credit Concentration Risk\n\nCredit Concentration Risk may arise from a single large exposure to a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties, or from multiple exposures across the portfolio that are closely correlated. Large exposure Concentration Risk is managed through concentration lim/i.rightts set for a counterparty or a group of connected counterparties based on control and economic dependence criter/i.righta. Risk Appetite metrics are set at portfolio level and monitored to control concentrations, where appropriate, by industry, specif/i.rightc products, tenor, collateralisat/i.righton level, top clients and exposure to holding companies. Single name credit concentration thresholds are set by client group depending on credit grade, and by customer segment. For concentrations that are material at a Group level, breaches and potential breaches are monitored by the respective governance committees and reported to the Group Risk Committee and Board Risk Committees.\n\n## Credit impa/i.rightrment\n\nExpected credit losses (ECL) are determined for all financ/i.rightal assets that are classif/i.righted as amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. ECL is computed as an unbiased, probabil/i.rightty-weighted provis/i.righton determined by evaluating a range of plausible outcomes, the time value of money, and forward-looking informat/i.righton such as crit/i.rightcal global or country-specif/i.rightc macroeconomic variables. For more detailed informat/i.righton on macroeconomic data feeding into IFRS 9 ECL calculations, please refer to the Risk profile section (pages 233 to 244).\n\nAt the time of orig/i.rightnation or purchase of a non-creditimpa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal asset (stage 1), ECL represent cash shortfalls aris/i.rightng from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. ECL continue to be determined on this basis until there is a sign/i.rightficant increase in the Credit Risk of the asset (stage 2), in which case an ECL is recognised for default events that may occur over the lifet/i.rightme of the asset. If there is observed object/i.rightve evidence of credit impa/i.rightrment or default (stage 3), ECL continue to be measured on a lifet/i.rightme basis. To provide the Board with oversight and assurance that the quality of assets orig/i.rightnated are aligned to the Group's strategy, there is a Risk Appetite metric to monitor the stage 1 and stage 2 expected credit losses from assets orig/i.rightnated in the past 12 months.\n\nIn Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Client Coverage, a loan is considered credit-impa/i.rightred where analysis and review ind/i.rightcate that full payment of either interest or princ/i.rightpal, includ/i.rightng the timel/i.rightness of such payment, is questionable, or as soon as payment of interest or princ/i.rightpal is 90 days overdue. These credit-impa/i.rightred accounts are managed by our special/i.rightst recovery unit (GSAM). Where appropriate, non-material credit-impa/i.rightred accounts are co-managed with the business under the supervis/i.righton of GSAM.\n\nIn Consumer, Private and Business Banking, a loan is considered credit-impa/i.rightred as soon as payment of interest or princ/i.rightpal is 90 days overdue or meets other object/i.rightve evidence of impa/i.rightrment such as bankruptcy, debt restructuring, fraud or death. Financ/i.rightal assets are written-off when it meets certain threshold condit/i.rightons which are set at the point where empir/i.rightcal evidence suggests that the client is unlikely to meet their contractual obligat/i.rightons, or a loss of princ/i.rightpal is expected.\n\nEstimat/i.rightng the amount and tim/i.rightng of future recoveries involves sign/i.rightficant judgement and considers the assessment of matters such as future economic condit/i.rightons and the value of collateral, for which there may not be a readily accessible market. The total amount of the Group's impa/i.rightrment provis/i.righton is inherently uncertain, being sensit/i.rightve to changes in economic and credit condit/i.rightons across the regions in which the Group operates. For further details on sensit/i.rightvity analysis of expected credit losses under IFRS 9, please refer to the Risk profile section (pages 233 to 244).\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing is a forward-looking risk management tool that constitutes a key input into the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, monitor/i.rightng and mit/i.rightgation of Credit Risk, as well as contribut/i.rightng to Risk Appetite calibrat/i.righton. Period/i.rightc stress tests are performed on credit portfolios/segments to antic/i.rightpate vulnerabil/i.rightties from stressed condit/i.rightons and in/i.righttiate timely right-siz/i.rightng and mit/i.rightgation plans. Addit/i.rightonally, multiple enterprise-wide and country-level stress tests are mandated by regulators to assess the abil/i.rightty of the Group and its subsid/i.rightaries to continue to meet their capital requirements during a plausible, adverse shock to the business. These regulatory stress tests are conducted in line with the princ/i.rightples stated in the Enterprise Stress Testing Policy. Stress tests for key portfolios are reviewed by the Credit Risk Type Framework Owners (or delegates) as part of portfolio oversight; and matters considered material to the Group are escalated to the Group Chief Risk Officer and respective regional risk committee.",

These risk sub-types include Market Risk, Counterparty Credit Risk and Algorithm/i.rightc Trading. Traded Risk Management (TRM) is the core risk management function supporting market-facing businesses, specif/i.rightcally Financ/i.rightal Markets and Treasury.\n\n## Roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nThe TRTF, which sets the roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes in respect of Traded Risk for the Group, is owned by the Global Head, Traded Risk Management. The business, acting as first line of defence, is responsible for the effective management of risks with/i.rightn the scope of its direct organisat/i.rightonal responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes set by the Board. The TRM function is the second-line control function that performs independent challenge, monitor/i.rightng and oversight of the Traded Risk management practices of the first line of defence. The first and second lines of defence are supported by the organisat/i.righton structure, job descript/i.rightons and authorit/i.rightes delegated by Traded Risk control owners.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe Group controls its trading portfolio and activ/i.rightties with/i.rightn Risk Appetite by assessing the various Traded Risk factors. These are captured and analysed using proprietary analytical tools, in addit/i.righton to risk managers' special/i.rightst market and product knowledge.\n\nThe Group's Traded Risk exposure is aligned with its Risk Appetite for Traded Risk, and assessment of potential losses that might be incurred by the Group as a consequence of extreme but plausible events.\n\nAll businesses incurr/i.rightng Traded Risk must be in compliance with the TRTF. The TRTF requires that Traded Risk lim/i.rightts are defined at a level appropriate to ensure that the Group remains with/i.rightn Traded Risk Appetite.\n\nThe TRTF, and underlying polic/i.rightes and standards ensure that these Traded Risk lim/i.rightts are implemented. All Traded Risk exposures throughout the Group aggregate up to TRM's Group-level reporting. This aggregation approach ensures that the lim/i.rightts structure across the Group is consistent with the Group's Risk Appetite.\n\nThe TRTF and Enterprise Stress Testing Policy ensure that adherence to stress-related Risk Appetite metrics is achieved. Stress testing aims at supplementing other risk metrics used with/i.rightn the Group by provid/i.rightng a forward-looking view of posit/i.rightons and an assessment of their resil/i.rightence to stressed market condit/i.rightons. Stress testing is performed on all Group businesses with Traded Risk exposures, either where the risk is actively traded or where material risk remains. This addit/i.rightonal informat/i.righton is used to inform the management of the Traded Risk taken with/i.rightn the Group. The outcome of stress tests is discussed across the various business lines and management levels so that exist/i.rightng and potential risks can be reviewed, and related management actions can be decided upon where appropriate.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should control its trading portfolio and activ/i.rightties to ensure that Traded Risk losses (financ/i.rightal or reputational) do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise.\n\nPolic/i.rightes are reviewed and approved by the Global Head, TRM annually to ensure their ongoing effectiveness.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Traded Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee delegates responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to the CCIBRC to act as the primary risk governance for Traded Risk. Where Traded Risk lim/i.rightts are set at a country level, committee governance is:\n\n- \u00b7 Subsid/i.rightary authority for setting Traded Risk lim/i.rightts, where applicable, is delegated from the local board to the local risk committee, Country Chief Risk Officer and Traded Risk managers.\n- \u00b7 Branch authority for setting Traded Risk lim/i.rightts remains with TRM which retains responsib/i.rightlity for monitor/i.rightng and reporting excesses.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Group's Risk Appetite Statement, along with the key associated Risk Appetite metrics, is approved by the Board with responsib/i.rightlity for Traded Risk lim/i.rightts, then tiered accordingly.\n\nSubject to the Group's Risk Appetite for Traded Risk, the Group Risk Committee sets Group-level Traded Risk lim/i.rightts, via delegation to the Group Chief Risk Officer. The Group Chief Risk Officer delegates authority for all Traded Risk lim/i.rightts to the TRTF Owner (Global Head, TRM) who in turn delegates approval authorit/i.rightes to ind/i.rightvidual Traded Risk managers.\n\nAddit/i.rightonal lim/i.rightts are placed on specif/i.rightc instruments, posit/i.rightons, and portfolio concentrations where appropriate. Authorit/i.rightes are reviewed at least annually to ensure that they remain appropriate and to assess the quality of decis/i.rightons taken by the authorised person. Key risk-taking decis/i.rightons are made only by certain ind/i.rightviduals with the skills, judgement and perspective to ensure that the Group's control standards and risk-return object/i.rightves are met. Authority delegators are responsible for monitor/i.rightng the quality of the risk decis/i.rightons taken by their delegates and the ongoing suitab/i.rightlity of their authorit/i.rightes.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nThe Group uses a Value at Risk (VaR) model to measure the risk of losses aris/i.rightng from future potential adverse movements in market rates, prices and volatil/i.rightties. VaR is a quantitat/i.rightve measure of Market Risk that applies recent histor/i.rightcal market condit/i.rightons to estimate the potential future loss in market value that will not be exceeded in a set time period at a set statist/i.rightcal confidence level. VaR provides a consistent measure that can be applied across trading businesses and products over time and can be set against actual daily trading profit and loss outcomes.",

        "page_content": "For day-to-day risk management, VaR is calculated as at the close of business, generally at UK time for expected market movements over one business day and to a confidence level of 97.5 per cent. Intra-day risk levels may vary from those reported at the end of the day.\n\nThe Group applies two VaR methodologies:\n\n- \u00b7 Histor/i.rightcal simulat/i.righton: this involves the revaluation of all exist/i.rightng posit/i.rightons to reflect the effect of histor/i.rightcally observed changes in Market Risk factors on the valuation of the current portfolio. This approach is applied for general Market Risk factors and the major/i.rightty of specif/i.rightc (credit spread) risk VaRs.\n- \u00b7 Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton: this methodology is sim/i.rightlar to histor/i.rightcal simulat/i.righton but with considerably more input risk factor observations. These are generated by random sampling techniques, but the results retain the essential variab/i.rightlity and correlations of histor/i.rightcally observed risk factor changes. This approach is applied for some of the specif/i.rightc (credit spread) risk VaRs in relation to id/i.rightosyncratic exposures in credit markets.\n\nA one-year histor/i.rightcal observation period is applied in both methods.\n\nAs an input to regulatory capital, trading book VaR is calculated for expected movements over 10 business days and to a confidence level of 99 per cent. Some types of Market Risk are not captured in the regulatory VaR measure, and these Risks not in VaR (RNIVs) are subject to capital add-ons.\n\nAn analysis of VaR and backtesting results in 2021 is available in the Risk profile section (pages 245 to 248).\n\n## Counterparty Credit Risk\n\nThe Counterparty Credit Risk aris/i.rightng from activ/i.rightties in financ/i.rightal markets is in scope of the Risk Appetite set by the Group for Traded Risk.\n\nThe Group uses a Potential Future Exposure (PFE) model to measure the credit exposure aris/i.rightng from the posit/i.rightve mark-to-market of traded products and future potential movements in market rates, prices and volatil/i.rightties. PFE is a quantitat/i.rightve measure of Counterparty Credit Risk that applies recent histor/i.rightcal market condit/i.rightons to estimate the potential future credit exposure that will not be exceeded in a set time period at a confidence level of 97.5 per cent.\n\nPFE is calculated for expected market movements over different time horizons based on the tenor of the transactions.\n\nThe Group applies two PFE methodologies: simulat/i.righton based, which is predominantly used, and an add-on based PFE methodology.\n\n## Underwrit/i.rightng\n\nThe underwrit/i.rightng of securit/i.rightes and loans is in scope of the Risk Appetite set by the Group for Traded Risk. Addit/i.rightonal lim/i.rightts approved by the Group Chief Risk Officer are set on the underwrit/i.rightng portfolio stress loss, and the maximum holding period. The Underwrit/i.rightng Committee, under the authority of the Group Chief Risk Officer, approves ind/i.rightvidual proposals to underwrite new security issues and loans for our clients.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nTRM monitors the overall portfolio risk and ensures that it is with/i.rightn specif/i.righted lim/i.rightts and therefore Risk Appetite. Lim/i.rightts are typically reviewed twice a year.\n\nMost of the Traded Risk exposures are monitored daily against approved lim/i.rightts. Traded Risk lim/i.rightts apply at all times unless separate intra-day lim/i.rightts have been set. Lim/i.rightt excess approval decis/i.rightons are based on an assessment of the circumstances driv/i.rightng the excess and of the proposed remediat/i.righton plan.\n\nLim/i.rightts and excesses can only be approved by a Traded Risk manager with the appropriate delegated authority.\n\nTRM reports and monitors lim/i.rightts applied to stressed exposures. Stress scenario analysis is performed on all Traded Risk exposures in financ/i.rightal markets and in portfolios outside financ/i.rightal markets such as syndicated loans and princ/i.rightpal finance. Stress loss excesses are discussed with the business and approved where appropriate, based on delegated authority levels.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe VaR and PFE measurements are complemented by weekly stress testing of Market Risk and Counterparty Credit Risk to highl/i.rightght the potential risk that may arise from severe but plausible market events.\n\nStress testing is an integral part of the Traded Risk management framework and considers both histor/i.rightcal market events and forward-looking scenarios. A consistent stress testing methodology is applied to trading and nontrading books. The stress testing methodology assumes that scope for management action would be lim/i.rightted during a stress event, reflecting the decrease in market liqu/i.rightdity that often occurs.\n\nRegular stress test scenarios are applied to interest rates, credit spreads, exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. This covers all asset classes in the Financ/i.rightal Markets and Treasury books. Ad hoc scenarios are also prepared, reflecting specif/i.rightc market condit/i.rightons and for particular concentrations of risk that arise with/i.rightn the business.\n\nStress scenarios are regularly updated to reflect changes in risk profile and economic events. The TRM function reviews stress testing results and, where necessary, enforces reductions in overall Traded Risk exposures. The Group Risk Committee considers the results of stress tests as part of its supervis/i.righton of Risk Appetite.\n\nWhere required, Group and business-wide stress testing will be supplemented by entity stress testing at a country level. This stress testing is coordinated at the country level and subject to the relevant local governance.",

Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book is the potential for a reduction in earnings or economic value due to movements in interest rates on banking book assets, liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and off-balance sheet items.\n\n## Roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management is responsible for the Risk Type Framework for Treasury Risk.\n\nThe Group Treasurer is supported by teams in Treasury and Finance to implement the Treasury Risk Type Framework as the first line of defence, and is responsible for managing Treasury Risk.\n\nFrom 2022, the second line of defence responsib/i.rightlity for Pension risk sub-type will move from Traded Risk to Treasury Risk, and the risk will be governed under the Treasury Risk Type Framework.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe Group develops polic/i.rightes to address material Treasury Risks and aims to mainta/i.rightn its risk profile with/i.rightn Risk Appetite. In order to do this, metrics are set against Capital Risk, Liqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk and Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB). Where appropriate, Risk Appetite metrics are cascaded down to regions and countries in the form of lim/i.rightts and management action triggers.\n\n## Capital Risk\n\nIn order to manage Capital Risk, strategic business and capital plans are drawn up covering a five-year horizon and are approved by the Board annually. The capital plan ensures that adequate levels of capital, includ/i.rightng loss-absorbing capacity, and an effic/i.rightent mix of the different components of capital are mainta/i.rightned to support our strategy and business plans.\n\nTreasury is responsible for the ongoing assessment of the demand for capital and the updating of the Group's capital plan.\n\nRisk Appetite metrics includ/i.rightng capital, leverage, min/i.rightmum requirement for own funds and elig/i.rightble liab/i.rightlity (MREL) and double leverage are assessed with/i.rightn the Corporate Plan to ensure that our business plan can be achieved with/i.rightn risk tolerances.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group should mainta/i.rightn a strong capital posit/i.righton includ/i.rightng the maintenance of management buffers suffic/i.rightent to support its strategic aims and hold an adequate buffer of high quality liqu/i.rightd assets to survive extreme but plausible liqu/i.rightdity stress scenarios for at least 60 days without recourse to extraordinary central bank support.\n\n## Structural FX Risk\n\nThe Group's structural posit/i.righton results from the Group's non-US dollar investment in the share capital and reserves of subsid/i.rightaries and branches. The FX translation gains, or losses are recorded in the Group's translation reserves with a direct impact on the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio.\n\nThe Group contracts hedges to manage its structural FX posit/i.righton in accordance with the Board-approved Risk Appetite, and as a result the Group has taken net investment hedges to partially cover its exposure to certain non-US dollar currencies to mit/i.rightgate the FX impact of such posit/i.rightons on its capital ratios.\n\n## Liqu/i.rightdity and Funding Risk\n\nAt Group, region and country level we implement various business-as-usual and stress risk metrics and monitor these against lim/i.rightts and management action triggers. This ensures that the Group mainta/i.rightns an adequate and well-divers/i.rightfied liqu/i.rightdity buffer, as well as a stable funding base, and that it meets its liqu/i.rightdity and funding regulatory requirements. The approach to managing risks and the Board Risk Appetite are assessed annually through the Internal Liqu/i.rightdity Adequacy Assessment Process. A funding plan is also developed for effic/i.rightent liqu/i.rightdity project/i.rightons to ensure that the Group is adequately funded in the required currencies, to meet its obligat/i.rightons and client funding needs.\n\n## Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book\n\nThis risk arises from differences in the repric/i.rightng profile, interest rate basis, and optional/i.rightty of banking book assets, liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and off-balance sheet items. IRRBB represents an economic and commercial risk to the Group and its capital adequacy. The Group monitors IRRBB against the Board Risk Appetite.",

The Recovery Plan includes a set of recovery ind/i.rightcators, an escalation framework and a set of management actions capable of being implemented in a stress. A Recovery Plan is also mainta/i.rightned with/i.rightn each major entity, and all recovery plans are subject to period/i.rightc firedrill testing.\n\nAs the UK resolution authority, the Bank of England (BoE) is required to set a preferred resolution strategy for the Group. The BoE's preferred resolution strategy is whole Group single point of entry bail-in at the ultimate holding company level (Standard Chartered PLC) and would be led by the BoE as the Group's home resolution authority. In support of this strategy, the Group has been developing a set of capabil/i.rightties, arrangements and resources to achieve the required outcomes. The Group expects to disclose a summary of its preparations in 2022, alongside a public statement from the BoE on the resolvabil/i.rightty of each in-scope firm.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt the Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Treasury Risk. At the executive level, the Group Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committee ensures the effective management of risk throughout the Group in support of the Group's strategy, guides the Group's strategy on balance sheet optim/i.rightsation and ensures that the Group operates with/i.rightn the internally approved Risk Appetite and other internal and external treasury requirements.\n\nRegional and country oversight resides with regional and country Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committees. Regions and countries must ensure that they remain in compliance with Group Treasury polic/i.rightes and practices, as well as local regulatory requirements.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Group Chief Financ/i.rightal Officer has responsib/i.rightlity for capital, funding and liqu/i.rightdity under the Senior Managers Regime. The Group Chief Risk Officer has delegated the Risk Framework Owner responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes associated with Treasury Risk to the Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management. The Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management delegates second-line oversight and challenge responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to relevant and suitably qualif/i.righted Treasury Chief Risk Officer and Country Chief Risk Officers.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nOn a day-to-day basis, the management of Treasury Risk is performed by the Group Treasurer, Country Chief Executive Officer and Treasury Markets. The Group regularly reports and monitors Treasury Risk inherent in its business activ/i.rightties and those that arise from internal and external events.\n\nInternal risk management reports covering the balance sheet and the capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton are presented to the relevant Asset and Liab/i.rightlity Committee. The reports contain key informat/i.righton on balance sheet trends, exposures against Risk Appetite and supporting risk measures which enable members to make informed decis/i.rightons around the overall management of the balance sheet.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, an independent Treasury Chief Risk Officer as part of Enterprise Risk Management reviews the prudency and effectiveness of Treasury Risk management.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are an integral part of the Treasury Risk Framework and are used to ensure that the Group's internal assessment of capital and liqu/i.rightdity considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on its risk profile. A number of stress scenarios, some designed internally, some required by regulators, are run period/i.rightcally.\n\nThey provide an ins/i.rightght into the potential impact of sign/i.rightficant adverse events on the Group's capital and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton and how this could be mit/i.rightgated through appropriate management actions to ensure that the Group remains with/i.rightn the approved Risk Appetite and regulatory lim/i.rightts.\n\nDaily liqu/i.rightdity stress scenarios are also run to ensure that the Group holds suffic/i.rightent high-quality liqu/i.rightd assets to withstand extreme liqu/i.rightdity events. The Group relies on these stress tests to understand the Group level vulnerabil/i.rightties given the sign/i.rightficant overlap between the Group and PLC Group's Treasury Risk.",

This framework collectively defines the Group's Operational Risk sub-types which have not been classif/i.righted as Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types (PRTs) and sets standards for the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, control, monitor/i.rightng and treatment of risks. These standards are applicable across all PRTs and risk sub-types in the O&T RTF. These risk sub-types relate to execution capabil/i.rightty, governance, reporting and obligat/i.rightons, legal enforceabil/i.rightty, and operational resil/i.rightence (includ/i.rightng client service, change management, people management, safety and security, and technology risk).\n\nThe O&T RTF reinforces clear accountabil/i.rightty for managing risk throughout the Group and delegates second line of defence responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to ident/i.rightfied subject matter experts. For each risk sub-type, the expert sets polic/i.rightes and standards for the organisat/i.righton to comply with, and provides guidance, oversight and challenge over the activ/i.rightties of the Group. They ensure that key risk decis/i.rightons are only taken by ind/i.rightviduals with the requis/i.rightte skills, judgement, and perspective to ensure that the Group's risk-return object/i.rightves are met.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe O&T RTF sets out the Group's overall approach to the management of Operational Risk in line with the Group's Operational and Technology Risk Appetite. This is supported by Risk and Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) which defines roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton, control and monitor/i.rightng of risks (applicable to all PRTs and risk sub-types).\n\nThe RCSA is used to determine the design strength and reliab/i.rightlity of each process, and requires:\n\n- \u00b7 the recording of processes run by client segments, products and functions into a process universe\n- \u00b7 the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton of potential breakdowns to these processes and the related risks of such breakdowns\n- \u00b7 an assessment of the impact of the ident/i.rightfied risks based on a consistent scale\n- \u00b7 the design and monitor/i.rightng of controls to mit/i.rightgate prior/i.righttised risks\n- \u00b7 assessments of residual risk and timely actions for elevated risks.\n\nRisks that exceed the Group's Operational and Technology Risk Appetite require treatment plans to address underlying causes.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee oversees the effective management of Operational Risk. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee is responsible for the\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to control operational and technology risks to ensure that operational losses (financ/i.rightal or reputational), includ/i.rightng any related to conduct of business matters, do not cause material damage to the Group's franchise.\n\ngovernance and oversight of Operational Risk for the Group, monitors the Group's Operational and Technology Risk Appetite and relies on other key Group committees for the management of Operational Risk, in particular the Group Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committee (GNFRC).\n\nRegional business segments and functional committees also provide enterprise oversight of their respective processes and related operational risks. In addit/i.righton, Country Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committees (CNFRCs) oversee the management of Operational Risk at the country (or entity) level. In smaller countries, the responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the CNFRC may be exercised directly by the Country Risk Committee (for branches) or Executive Risk Committee (for subsid/i.rightaries).\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe O&T RTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Operational Risk authorit/i.rightes is made. The GHRFOR places reliance on the respective Senior Managers who are outside the Risk function for second-line oversight of the risk sub-types through this framework. The Senior Managers may further delegate their second-line responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes to designated ind/i.rightviduals at a global business, product and function level, as well as regional or country level.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nTo deliver services to clients and to partic/i.rightpate in the financ/i.rightal services sector, the Group runs processes which are exposed to operational risks. The Group prior/i.righttises and manages risks which are sign/i.rightficant to clients and to the financ/i.rightal services sectors. Control ind/i.rightcators are regularly monitored to determine the residual risk the Group is exposed to.\n\nThe residual risk assessments and reporting of events form the Group's Operational Risk profile. The completeness of the Operational Risk profile ensures appropriate prior/i.righttisat/i.righton and timel/i.rightness of risk decis/i.rightons, includ/i.rightng risk acceptances with treatment plans for risks that exceed acceptable thresholds.\n\nThe Board is informed on adherence to Operational and Technology Risk Appetite through metrics reported for selected risks. These metrics are monitored, and escalation thresholds are devised based on the material/i.rightty and sign/i.rightficance of the risk. These Operational and Technology Risk Appetite metrics are consolidated on a regular basis and reported at relevant Group committees. This provides senior management with the relevant informat/i.righton to inform their risk decis/i.rightons.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are used to assess capital requirements for operational risks. This approach considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on the Group's Operational Risk profile. A number of scenarios have been ident/i.rightfied to test the robustness of the Group's processes and assess the potential impact on the Group. These scenarios include anti-money laundering and sanctions, as well as informat/i.righton and cyber security.",

Certain aspects of Financ/i.rightal Crime Compliance, second-line oversight and challenge, are delegated with/i.rightn the CFCC function. Approval frameworks are in place to allow for risk-based decis/i.rightons on client onboarding, potential breaches of sanctions regulation or policy, situat/i.rightons of potential money laundering (and terrorist financ/i.rightng), bribery and corruption or internal and external fraud.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nThe Group monitors Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk compliance against a set of Risk Appetite metrics that are approved by the Board. These metrics are reviewed period/i.rightcally and reported regularly to the Group Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee, Group Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and Board Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk Committee.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nThe assessment of Financ/i.rightal Crime vulnerabil/i.rightties under stressed condit/i.rightons or extreme events with a low likel/i.righthood of occurring is carried out through enterprise stress testing where scenario analysis is used to assess capital requirements for Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk as part of the overall scenario analysis portfolio managed under the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework. Specif/i.rightc scenarios are developed annually with collaboration between the business, which owns and manages the risk, and the CFCC function, which is second line to incorporate sign/i.rightficant Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk events. This approach considers the impact of extreme but plausible scenarios on the Group's Financ/i.rightal Crime Risk profile.",

Responsib/i.rightlity for the oversight and implementat/i.righton of the Model Risk Type Framework is delegated to the Global Head, Model Risk Management.\n\nThe Model Risk Type Framework sets out clear accountabil/i.rightty and roles for Model Risk management through a three lines of defence model. First-line ownership of Model Risk resides with Model Sponsors, who are the business or function heads and assign a Model Owner for each model. Model Owners mainly represent model developers and users, and are responsible for end-to-end model development, ensuring model performance through regular model monitor/i.rightng, and communicat/i.rightng model lim/i.righttations, model assumptions and risks. Model Owners also coordinate the submiss/i.righton of models for validat/i.righton and approval and ensure appropriate model implementat/i.righton and use. Second-line oversight is provided by Model Risk Management, which comprises Group Model Validat/i.righton and Model Risk Policy and Governance.\n\nGroup Model Validat/i.righton independently reviews and grades models, in line with design object/i.rightves, business uses and compliance requirements, and highl/i.rightghts ident/i.rightfied model risks by rais/i.rightng model related issues. The Model Risk Policy and Governance team provides oversight of Model Risk activ/i.rightties, performing regular Model Risk Assessment and risk profile reporting to senior management.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nThe Model Risk policy and standards define requirements for model development and validat/i.righton activ/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng regular model performance monitor/i.rightng. Any model issues or defic/i.rightencies ident/i.rightfied through the validat/i.righton process are mit/i.rightgated through the applicat/i.righton of model monitor/i.rightng, model overlays and/or a model redevelopment plan, which undergo robust review, challenge and approval. Operational controls govern all Model Risk-related processes, with regular risk assessments performed to assess appropriateness and effectiveness of those controls, in line with the Operational and Technology Risk Type Framework, with remediat/i.righton plans implemented where necessary.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Board Risk Committee exercises oversight of Model Risk with/i.rightn the Group. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee has appointed the Model Risk Committee to ensure effective measurement and management of Model Risk. Sub-committees such as the Credit Model Assessment Committee and Traded Risk Model Assessment Committee oversee their respective in-scope models and escalate material Model Risks to the Model Risk Committee. In parallel, business and function-level risk committees provide governance oversight of the models used in their respective processes.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group has no appetite for material adverse impl/i.rightcations aris/i.rightng from misuse of models or errors in the development or implementat/i.righton of models; whilst accepting model uncertainty.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Model Risk Type Framework is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Model Risk authorit/i.rightes is made.\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management delegates authorit/i.rightes to designated ind/i.rightviduals or Policy Owners through the RTF. The second-line ownership for Model Risk at country level is delegated to Country Chief Risk Officers at the applicable branches and subsid/i.rightaries.\n\nThe Model Risk Committee is responsible for approving models for use. Model approval authority is also delegated to the Credit Model Assessment Committee, Traded Risk Model Assessment Committee and ind/i.rightvidual designated model approvers for less material models.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nThe Group monitors Model Risk via a set of Risk Appetite metrics that are approved by the Board. Adherence to Model Risk Appetite and any threshold breaches are reported regularly to the Board Risk Committee, Group Risk Committee and Model Risk Committee. These metrics and thresholds are reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that threshold calibrat/i.righton remains appropriate and the themes are adequately covering the current risks.\n\nModels undergo regular monitor/i.rightng based on their level of perceived Model Risk, with monitor/i.rightng results and breaches presented to Model Risk Management and delegated model approvers.\n\nModel Risk Management produces Model Risk reports covering the model landscape, which include performance metrics, ident/i.rightfied model issues and remediat/i.righton plans. These are presented for discuss/i.righton at the Model Risk governance committees on a regular basis.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nModels play an integral role in the Group's stress testing and are rigorously user-tested to ensure that they are fit-for-use under stressed market condit/i.rightons. Compliance with Model Risk management requirements and regulatory guidel/i.rightnes are also assessed as part of each stress test, with any ident/i.rightfied gaps mit/i.rightgated through model overlays and defined remediat/i.righton plans.",

Throughout 2021, we have laid the foundation to integrate Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk management for clients, third parties and our operations and continued to invest in infrastructure and technology to keep pace with emerging environmental, social and governance (ESG) regulatory obligat/i.rightons and accelerating commitments across our markets.\n\n## Roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management is the Risk Framework Owner for Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk under the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework.\n\nThe responsib/i.rightlity for Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk management is delegated to Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk Leads in ERM as well as Chief Risk Officers at region, country and client-business levels. They constitute the second line of defence, overseeing and challenging the first line of defence, which resides with the Chief Executive Officers, Business Heads, Product Heads and Function Heads in respect of risk management activ/i.rightties of reputational and sustainab/i.rightlity-related risks respectively. The Environmental and Social Risk Management team (ESRM), which is in the first line of defence, also provides dedicated support on the management of environmental and social risks and impacts aris/i.rightng from the Group's client relationsh/i.rightps and transactions.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nIn line with the princ/i.rightples of Responsible Business Conduct and Do No Sign/i.rightficant Harm, the Group deems Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk to be driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions due to decis/i.rightons related to clients, products, transactions, third parties and strategic coverage\n- \u00b7 potential material harm or degradation to the natural environment (environmental) through actions/inact/i.rightons of the Group\n- \u00b7 potential material harm to ind/i.rightviduals or communit/i.rightes (social) risks through actions/inact/i.rightons of the Group.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to protect the franchise from material damage to its reputation by ensuring that any business activ/i.rightty is satisfactor/i.rightly assessed and managed by the appropriate level of management and governance oversight. This includes a potential failure to uphold responsible business conduct or lapses in our commitment to do no sign/i.rightficant environmental and social harm.\n\nThe Group's Reputational Risk policy sets out the princ/i.rightpal sources of Reputational Risk driven by negative shifts in stakeholder perceptions as well as responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes, control and oversight standards for ident/i.rightfying, assessing, escalating and effectively managing Reputational Risk. The Group takes a structured approach to the assessment of risks associated with how ind/i.rightvidual client, transaction, product and strategic coverage decis/i.rightons may affect perceptions of the organisat/i.righton and its activ/i.rightties, based on explic/i.rightt princ/i.rightples includ/i.rightng, but not lim/i.rightted to gambling, defence and dual use goods. Whenever potential for stakeholder concerns is ident/i.rightfied, issues are subject to prior approval by a management authority commensurate with the material/i.rightty of matters being considered. Such authorit/i.rightes may accept or decline the risk or impose condit/i.rightons upon proposals, to protect the Group's reputation.\n\nThe Group's Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk policy sets out the requirements and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for managing environmental and social risks for the Group's operations, clients and third parties, as guided by various industry standards such as the OECD's Due Dil/i.rightgence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, Equator Princ/i.rightples, UN Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement.\n\nThrough our operations, the Group seeks to min/i.rightmise its impact on the environment and have targets to reduce energy, water and waste. Clients are expected to adhere to min/i.rightmum regulatory and compliance requirements, includ/i.rightng criter/i.righta from the Group's Posit/i.righton Statements. Suppliers must comply with the Group's Supplier Charter which sets out the Group's expectations on ethics, anti-bribery and corruption, human rights, environmental, health and safety standards, labour and protection of the environment.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nAt Board level, the Culture and Sustainab/i.rightlity Committee provides oversight for our Sustainab/i.rightlity strategy while the Board Risk Committee oversees Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk as part of the ERMF. The Group Risk Committee (GRC) provides executive-level committee oversight and delegates the authority to ensure effective management of Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk to the Group Responsib/i.rightlity and Reputational Risk Committee (GRRRC).",

The regional and client-business risk committees provide oversight on the Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk profile with/i.rightn their remit. The Country Non-Financ/i.rightal Risk Committee (CNFRC) provides oversight of the Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk profile at a country level.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity RTF is the formal mechanism through which the delegation of Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk authorit/i.rightes is made. The Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management delegates risk acceptance authorit/i.rightes for stakeholder perception risks to designated ind/i.rightviduals in the first line and second line or to committees such as the GRRRC via risk authority matrices.\n\nThese risk authority matrices are tiered at country, regional, business segment or Group levels and are established for risks incurred in strategic coverage, clients, products or transactions. For environmental and social risks, the ESRM must review and support the risk assessments for clients and transactions and escalate to the Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk leads as required.\n\n## Monitor/i.rightng\n\nReputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk polic/i.rightes and standards are applicable to all Group entit/i.rightes. However, local regulators in some markets may impose addit/i.rightonal requirements on how banks manage and track Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk. In such cases, these are complied with in addit/i.righton to Group polic/i.rightes and standards.\n\nExposure to stakeholder perception risks aris/i.rightng from transactions, clients, products and strategic coverage are monitored through established triggers outlined in risk material/i.rightty matrices to prompt the right levels of risk-based considerat/i.righton by the first line and escalations to the second line where necessary. Risk acceptance decis/i.rightons and thematic trends are also being reviewed on a period/i.rightc basis.\n\nExposure to Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk is monitored through triggers embedded with/i.rightn the first-line processes where environmental and social risks are considered for clients and transactions via the Environmental and Social Risk Assessments, and considered for vendors in our supply chain through the Modern Slavery questionna/i.rightres.\n\nIn 2021, we have approved new Risk Appetite metrics for Environmental and Social risks as well as managing modern slavery risks in our supply chain.\n\n## Stress testing\n\nReputational Risk outcomes are taken into account in enterprise stress tests and incorporated into the Group's stress testing scenarios. For example, the Group might consider what impact a hypothetical event leading to loss of confidence among liqu/i.rightdity providers in a particular market might have, or what the impl/i.rightcations might be for supporting part of the organisat/i.righton in order to protect the brand. As Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk continues to evolve as an area of emerging regulatory focus with various markets developing ESG regulatory guidance, we are keeping pace with external developments to enable us to explore meaningful scenario analysis with the aim of advancing Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity Risk management.",

Climate Risk is defined as the potential for financ/i.rightal loss and non-financ/i.rightal detriments aris/i.rightng from climate change and society's response to it.\n\nClimate Risk has been recognised as an emerging risk since 2017 and was elevated to an Integrated Risk Type (previously known as material cross-cutting risk) with/i.rightn the ERMF, our central risk framework in 2019. We have introduced Climate Risk into mainstream risk management in alignment with the Bank of England's Supervisory Statement 3/19 requirements and in 2021 greatly improved our scenario analysis and stress testing abil/i.rightties to deliver the 2021 Climate Bienn/i.rightal Exploratory Scenario (CBES). However, it is still a relatively nascent risk area which will mature and stabil/i.rightse over the years to come.\n\n## Roles and responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nThe three lines of defence model as per the Enterprise Risk Management Framework applies to Climate Risk. The Group Chief Risk Officer (GCRO) has the ultimate second-line and senior management responsib/i.rightlity for Climate Risk. The GCRO is supported by the Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management who has day-to-day oversight and central responsib/i.rightlity for second-line Climate Risk activ/i.rightties. As Climate Risk is integrated into the relevant Princ/i.rightpal Risk Types (PRTs), second-line responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes lie with the Risk Framework Owner (at Group, regional and country level), with subject matter expertise support from the central Climate Risk team.\n\n## Mit/i.rightgation\n\nAs an Integrated Risk Type manifests through other PRTs, risk mit/i.rightgation activ/i.rightties are specif/i.rightc to ind/i.rightvidual PRTs. The Group has undertaken in/i.righttial development and integrat/i.righton of Climate Risk into PRT processes. Climate Risk assessments are considered as part of Reputational and Sustainab/i.rightlity transaction reviews for clients and transactions in high carbon sectors. We have directly engaged with clients on their adaptation and mit/i.rightgation plans using client level Climate Risk questionna/i.rightres and a first phase of integrat/i.righton into the credit decis/i.rightoning process is under way for CCIB Credit Risk. As part of quarterly credit portfolio reviews in CPBB, physical risk assessments for the resident/i.rightal mortgage portfolios are also being monitored for concentration levels. With/i.rightn Traded Risk, a physical risk scenario is now part of their stress testing framework while the focus for Operational and Technology Risk has been on Resil/i.rightence and Third-Party Risk management. Relevant polic/i.rightes and standards across PRTs have been updated to factor in Climate Risk considerat/i.rightons and a focus area in 2022 will be to deliver the implementat/i.righton of these requirements.\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nThe Group aims to measure and manage financ/i.rightal and non-financ/i.rightal risks from climate change, and reduce emiss/i.rightons related to our own activ/i.rightties and those related to the financ/i.rightng of clients in alignment with the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Governance committee oversight\n\nBoard-level oversight is exercised through the Board Risk Committee (BRC), and regular Climate Risk updates are provided to the Board and BRC. At the executive level, the Group Risk Committee oversees implementat/i.righton of the Climate Risk workplan. The GCRO has also appointed a Climate Risk Management Forum consist/i.rightng of senior representatives from the business, risk, strategy and other functions such as sustainab/i.rightlity and legal. The Climate Risk Management Forum meets quarterly to discuss development and implementat/i.righton of the Climate Risk workplan, and to provide structured governance around engagement with the relevant PRTs impacted by Climate Risk. Through 2022, we will strengthen country and regional governance oversight for the Climate Risk profile across our key markets.\n\n## Tools and methodologies\n\nApplying exist/i.rightng risk management tools to quantify Climate Risk is challenging given inherent data and methodology challenges, includ/i.rightng the need to be forward-looking over long time horizons. To quantify climate physical and transit/i.righton risk we leverage and have invested in a number of areas, includ/i.rightng tools and partnerships:\n\n- \u00b7 Munich Re - we are using Munich Re's physical risk assessment tool, which is built on extensive re-insurance experience.\n- \u00b7 Baringa Partners - we are using Baringa's flagship climate models to understand climate scenarios, and compute transit/i.righton risk and temperature alignment.\n- \u00b7 Standard & Poor - we are leveraging S&P and Trucost's wealth of climate data covering asset locations, energy mixes and emiss/i.rightons.\n- \u00b7 Imperial College - we are leveraging Imperial's academic expertise to advance our understanding of climate science, upskill our staff and senior management, and progress the state of independent research on climate risks with an acute focus on emerging markets.\n\n## Decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegation\n\nThe Global Head, Enterprise Risk Management is supported by a centralised Climate Risk team with/i.rightn the ERM function. The Global Head, Climate Risk and Net Zero Oversight is responsible for ensuring and executing the delivery of the Climate Risk workplan which will define decis/i.righton-making authorit/i.rightes and delegations across the Group.",

Emerging risks refer to unpredictable and uncontrollable events with the potential to materially impact our business. These include near-term risks that are on the horizon and can be measured or mit/i.rightgated to some extent, as well as longer-term uncertaint/i.rightes that are on the radar but not yet fully measurable.\n\nIn 2021, we undertook a thorough review of our Emerging Risks, using the approach described in the Enterprise Risk Management Framework 1 section (page 258 to 263). The key results of the review are detailed below.\n\n## Key changes to our emerging risks:\n\nThe following items have been removed as emerging risks:\n\n- \u00b7 'Middle East geopolit/i.rightcal tensions' - The risk has been removed as the immed/i.rightate impact to the Group's credit portfolio is manageable\n- \u00b7 'Interbank Offered Rate discont/i.rightnuation and transit/i.righton' This risk has been removed given the Group has a wellestablished global IBOR Transit/i.righton Programme to consider all aspects of the transit/i.righton and how risks from the transit/i.righton can be mit/i.rightgated\n\nThe following items have been amended or added as new emerging risks:\n\n- \u00b7 'Crystallisat/i.righton of inflat/i.righton fears' - Interest rates have already increased or are likely to rise in several countries as central banks respond to inflat/i.rightonary pressure. Drivers of price increases include shortages of materials and labour, increased demand as economic recoveries take hold and long-term monetary stimulus, with growing acceptance that the inflat/i.rightonary shock will last longer than in/i.righttially expected\n- \u00b7 'Energy security' - Increased industr/i.rightal demand and accelerated transit/i.rightons to cleaner energy sources have put a strain on supply lines. This has increased tensions between nations as power shifts towards energy exporters, and energy security becomes questionable across developed markets and emerging markets alike. A lack of investment by oil producers as we transit/i.righton could also lead to an increase in oil prices in the short term\n- \u00b7 'Supply chain dislocat/i.rightons' - Global supply chains have been disrupted both by COVID-19 lockdowns and deglobalisat/i.righton. As economies recover there are shortages in some key source materials and delivery delays which are affecting many industr/i.rightes' abil/i.rightty to meet the rapid increase in demand\n- \u00b7 'Expanding stakeholder expectations for environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG)' - Added as an emerging risk to reflect the broader sustainab/i.rightlity agenda of the Group and capture ESG concerns beyond Climate Risk such as biod/i.rightversity loss and depletion of natural resources, which are increas/i.rightng areas of focus for regulators, investors and non-governmental organisat/i.rightons. The speed of transit/i.righton to meet the requirements could be faster in developed markets\n- \u00b7 'Expanding array of global tensions' - Expanded to cover a proliferat/i.righton of global polit/i.rightcal and economic agenda items that create disrupt/i.righton and potential flashpoints between countries. These are reshaping global polit/i.rightcal alliances and disrupt/i.rightng tradit/i.rightonal economic corridors\n- \u00b7 'Adapting to endemic COVID-19 and a K-shaped recovery' - Encapsulates the shift towards liv/i.rightng with COVID-19 and what the new post-COVID normal will look like. Varying vaccinat/i.righton rates and levels of economic stimulus have widened the recovery gap and threaten a K-shaped global recovery, where countries or sectors recover at different rates depending on their abil/i.rightty to adapt to a postCOVID world\n- \u00b7 'New business structures, channels and competit/i.righton' Reflects the linkage between the Group's increas/i.rightng reliance on partnerships and alliances in exploring new technologies and dig/i.righttal enhancement, and the heightened risks that are intr/i.rightnsically linked to such activ/i.rightties. Dig/i.righttal assets are also covered with/i.rightn this emerging risk\n- \u00b7 'Talent pools of the future' - Expanded to consider the risks of widen/i.rightng skills gaps and shift/i.rightng expectations of the future workforce, beyond just the practical challenges of increased remote working\n\nOur list of emerging risks, based on our current knowledge and assumptions, is set out below, with our subject/i.rightve assessment of their impact, likel/i.righthood and velocity of change. This reflects the latest internal assessment of material risks that the Group faces as ident/i.rightfied by senior management. This list is not designed to be exhaustive and there may be addit/i.rightonal risks which could material/i.rightse or have an adverse effect on the Group.\n\nOur mit/i.rightgation approach for these risks may not elim/i.rightnate them but shows the Group's attempt to reduce or manage the risk. As certain risks develop and material/i.rightse over time, management will take appropriate steps to mit/i.rightgate the risk based on its impact on the Group.",

The Group is well capital/i.rightsed with low leverage and high levels of loss-absorbing capacity.\n\n|                                            | 2021    | 2020    |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| CET1 capital                               | 14.1%   | 14.4%   |\n| Tier 1 capital                             | 16.6%   | 16.5%   |\n| Total capital                              | 21.3%   | 21.2%   |\n| UK leverage                                | 4.9%    | 5.2%    |\n| MREL ratio                                 | 31.7%   | 30.9%   |\n| Risk-weighted assets (RWA) $mill/i.righton | 271,233 | 268,834 |\n\nThe Group's capital, leverage and MREL posit/i.rightons were all above current requirements and Board-approved Risk Appetite. For further detail see the Capital section in the Standard Chartered PLC Pillar 3 Disclosures for FY 2021.\n\nThe Group's CET1 capital decreased 28 basis points to 14.1 per cent of RWA since FY2020. Profits were more than offset by distr/i.rightbutions (includ/i.rightng ordinary share buy-backs of $0.5 bill/i.righton during the year), RWA growth, movements in reserves and an increase in regulatory deductions.\n\nThe PRA updated the Group's Pillar 2A requirement during H2 2021. As at 31 December 2021 the Group's Pillar 2A was 3.4 per cent of RWA, of which at least 1.9 per cent must be held in CET1 capital. The Group's min/i.rightmum CET1 capital requirement was 10.1 per cent at 31 December 2021. The UK counter cyclical buffer will increase to 1.0 per cent from December 2022; however, the impact on the Group's min/i.rightmum CET1 capital requirement is expected to be immater/i.rightal.\n\nFollowing updated guidance from the PRA, Structural Foreign Exchange risk will be capital/i.rightsed under the Pillar 1 approach for Market Risk from 31 December 2021. This change in regulatory treatment contributed $3.7 bill/i.righton to the reported Market Risk RWA at year-end. To avoid any possible double count of capital requirements for Structural Foreign Exchange risk across Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, the PRA has agreed to reset the Group's Pillar 2A requirement for this specif/i.rightc risk.\n\nThere are three policy changes expected to impact the calculation of CET1 and or RWAs in 2022. Firstly, the PRA has confirmed that software relief will be excluded from CET1 from 1 January 2022 which will reduce CET1 by approximately 32 basis points. Secondly, recent industry wide regulatory changes to align IRB model performance (the IRB model repair program) will add approximately $4.7 bill/i.righton of addit/i.rightonal RWA from 1 January 2022. Finally, the introduct/i.righton of standardised rules for counterparty credit risk on derivat/i.rightves and other instruments (SA-CCR) will add approximately $1.6 bill/i.righton of addit/i.rightonal RWA. The combinat/i.righton of the IRB model repair program and SA-CCR are expected to reduce the CET1 ratio by approximately 31 basis points from 1 January 2022. On a pro forma basis, after the deduction of software relief and other regulatory changes and adjustments, the CET1 ratio as at 1 January 2022 is 13.5 per cent.\n\nThe Group CET1 capital ratio at 31 December 2021 reflects the share buy-backs of $254 mill/i.righton completed in the first quarter of 2021 and $250 mill/i.righton completed in the third quarter of 2021. The CET1 capital ratio also includes an accrual for the FY 2021 div/i.rightdend. The Board has recommended a final div/i.rightdend for FY 2021 of $277 mill/i.righton or 9 cents per share resulting in a total 2021 div/i.rightdend of 12 cents per share, a one-third increase on the 2020 div/i.rightdend. In addit/i.righton, the Board has announced a share buy-back of $750 mill/i.righton, the impact of this will reduce the Group's CET1 capital by around 28 basis points in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nThe Group expects to manage CET1 capital dynamically with/i.rightn our 13-14 per cent target range in support of our aim of deliver/i.rightng future sustainable shareholder distr/i.rightbutions.\n\nThe Group's fully phased MREL will be 26.4 per cent of RWA from 1 January 2022. This is composed of a min/i.rightmum requirement of 22.7 per cent of RWA and the Group's combined buffer (compris/i.rightng the capital conservation buffer, the G-SII buffer and the countercyclical buffer). The Group's MREL ratio was 31.7 per cent of RWA and 9.4 per cent of UK leverage exposure at 31 December 2021.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group successfully raised around $10.8 bill/i.righton of MREL elig/i.rightble securit/i.rightes from its holding company, Standard Chartered PLC. Issuance was across the capital structure includ/i.rightng $2.8 bill/i.righton of Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 (AT1), $1.2 bill/i.righton of Tier 2 and around $6.8 bill/i.righton of callable senior debt.\n\nDuring 2021 the Group repurchased $1 bill/i.righton 7.5 per cent AT1 securit/i.rightes via a tender offer alongside a new 4.3 per cent AT1 issue of $1.5 bill/i.righton. This transaction was part of the Group's proactive approach to capital management and reduced the weighted average cost of the Group's AT1 capital base.\n\nThe Group successfully completed the formation of an ASEAN hub during 2021 in which our exist/i.rightng businesses in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were moved under our exist/i.rightng Singapore subsid/i.rightary entity, which itself remains under Standard Chartered Bank.\n\nThe Group is a G-SII, with a 1.0 per cent G-SII CET1 capital buffer.

This was mainly due to increases in Market Risk RWA of $2.9 bill/i.righton and Operational Risk RWA of $0.3 bill/i.righton, partly offset by a decrease in Credit Risk RWA of $0.9 bill/i.righton.\n\n## Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking\n\nCredit Risk RWA decreased by $1.8 bill/i.righton to $125.9 bill/i.righton mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 $2.1 bill/i.righton decrease from foreign currency translation\n- \u00b7 $1.5 bill/i.righton decrease due to improvement in asset quality reflecting client upgrades and actions concerning specif/i.rightc stage 3 exposures\n- \u00b7 $0.4 bill/i.righton decrease from RWA effic/i.rightencies relating to unsecured recoveries\n- \u00b7 $2.2 bill/i.righton increase due to asset balance growth mainly from Lending in Asia.\n\n## Consumer, Private & Business Banking\n\nCredit Risk RWA decreased by $2.0 bill/i.righton to $42.7 bill/i.righton mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 $3.7 bill/i.righton decrease from a model change benefit in Korea\n- \u00b7 $1.2 bill/i.righton decrease from foreign currency translation\n- \u00b7 $0.7 bill/i.righton decrease due to improvement in asset quality across retail portfolios in Asia\n- \u00b7 $3.6 bill/i.righton increase in asset balance growth in Asia.\n\n## Central & other items\n\nCentral & other items RWA mainly relate to the Treasury Markets liqu/i.rightdity portfolio, equity investments and current & deferred tax assets.\n\nCredit Risk RWA increased by $2.9 bill/i.righton to $51.0 bill/i.righton mainly due to:\n\n- \u00b7 $4.4 bill/i.righton increase from asset balance growth primar/i.rightly in Europe and the Americas and Africa and the Middle East, partially offset by asset balance decline in Asia\n- \u00b7 $0.3 bill/i.righton increase relating to software intang/i.rightble assets with a corresponding deduction to CET1\n- \u00b7 $1.1 bill/i.righton decrease from foreign currency translation\n- \u00b7 $0.7 bill/i.righton decrease due to effic/i.rightencies relating to covered bonds.\n\n## Market Risk\n\nTotal Market Risk RWA increased by $2.9 bill/i.righton, or 14 per cent from 31 December 2020 to $24.5 bill/i.righton.\n\nThe increase was mainly due to the impact of updated PRA guidance ($2 bill/i.righton). Structural Foreign Exchange risk of $3.7 bill/i.righton is now treated as Pillar 1 market risk RWA. Previously this was recognised entirely as Pillar 2A risk. This increase was offset in part by the $1.6 bill/i.righton benefit of PRA permiss/i.righton to consolidate market risk RWA for SCB Malaysia Berhad, SCB Thai PCL and SCB (Vietnam) Ltd. Consolidat/i.righton reflects divers/i.rightficat/i.righton and thus gives lower RWA.\n\nOther movements contributed a $0.9 bill/i.righton increase due to:\n\n- \u00b7 $1.1 bill/i.righton increase in Standardised Approach Specif/i.rightc Interest Rate Risk RWA due to increased credit spread posit/i.rightons\n- \u00b7 $1.0 bill/i.righton increase in Internal Models Approach (IMA) stressed VaR RWA due to increased IMA posit/i.rightons\n- \u00b7 $1.0 bill/i.righton decrease in IMA VaR RWA with reduced market volatil/i.rightty in the one-year histor/i.rightcal rates applied for daily VaR\n- \u00b7 $0.5 bill/i.righton decrease in IMA Risks not in VaR\n- \u00b7 $0.3 bill/i.righton of other small increases.\n\n## Operational Risk\n\nOperational Risk RWA increased by $0.3 bill/i.righton, or 1 per cent from 31 December 2020 to $27.1 bill/i.righton. This was mainly due to an increase in average income as measured over a rolling three-year time horizon, with higher 2020 income replacing lower 2017 income.",

The leverage ratio was 29 basis points lower than FY20. Leverage exposure increased by $76 bill/i.righton from an increase in onbalance sheet items (excluding derivat/i.rightves) of $58 bill/i.righton, off-balance sheet items of $11 bill/i.righton and a securit/i.rightes financ/i.rightng transactions add-on of $9 bill/i.righton. End point Tier 1 increased by $1.3 bill/i.righton as CET1 capital reduced by $0.4 bill/i.righton and the issuance of $1.25 bill/i.righton 4.75 per cent and $1.5 bill/i.righton 4.3 per cent AT1 securit/i.rightes completed during the year was partly offset by the repurchase of $1 bill/i.righton 7.5 per cent AT1 securit/i.rightes via a tender offer.\n\nIn October 2021, the PRA published a policy statement outlin/i.rightng changes to the UK leverage ratio framework. The min/i.rightmum leverage ratio requirement applicable to the Group was mainta/i.rightned at 3.25 per cent. Addit/i.rightonal buffers based on the countercyclical and G-SII buffers are set at 35 per cent of their risk-weighted equivalent and must be met with 100 per cent of CET1 capital. Firms that breach their leverage ratio buffers will not face any capital distr/i.rightbution restrict/i.rightons. The exposure value of derivat/i.rightve contracts will be based on the standardised approach to Counterparty Credit Risk, while central bank reserves continue to be excluded from the UK leverage ratio exposure measure. The rules came into force on 1 January 2022. The impact from implementat/i.righton of the new leverage rules is estimated to be immater/i.rightal.\n\n## UK leverage ratio\n\n|                                                        | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Tier 1 capital (transit/i.rightonal)                   | 45,153                  | 44,391                  |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 capital subject to phase out  | (557)                   | (1,114)                 |\n| Tier 1 capital (end point) 1                           | 44,596                  | 43,277                  |\n| Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments         | 52,445                  | 69,467                  |\n| Derivat/i.rightve cash collateral                      | 9,217                   | 11,759                  |\n| Securit/i.rightes financ/i.rightng transactions (SFTs) | 88,418                  | 67, 5 70                |\n| Loans and advances and other assets                    | 677,738                 | 640,254                 |\n| Total on-balance sheet assets                          | 827,818                 | 789,050                 |\n| Regulatory consolidat/i.righton adjustments 2          | (63,704)                | (60,059)                |\n| Derivat/i.rightves adjustments                         |                         |                         |\n| Derivat/i.rightves netting                             | (34,819)                | (44,257)                |\n| Adjustments to cash collateral                         | (17,867)                | (21,278)                |\n| Net written credit protection                          | 1,534                   | 1,284                   |\n| Potential future exposure on derivat/i.rightves        | 50,857                  | 42,410                  |\n| Total derivat/i.rightves adjustments                   | (295)                   | (21,841)                |\n| Counterparty Risk leverage exposure measure for SFTs   | 13,724                  | 4,969                   |\n| Off-balance sheet items                                | 139,505                 | 128,167                 |\n| Regulatory deductions from Tier 1 capital              | (5,908)                 | (5,521)                 |\n| UK leverage exposure (end point)                       | 911,140                 | 834,765                 |\n| UK leverage ratio (end point)                          | 4.9%                    | 5.2%                    |\n| UK leverage exposure quarterly average                 | 897,992                 | 837,147                 |\n| UK leverage ratio quarterly average                    | 5.0%                    | 5.2%                    |\n| Countercyclical leverage ratio buffer                  | 0.1%                    | 0.0%                    |\n| G-SII addit/i.rightonal leverage ratio buffer          | 0.4%                    | 0.4%                    |\n\n- 1 Tier 1 capital (end point) is adjusted only for grandfathered Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 instruments\n- 2   Includes adjustment for qualify/i.rightng central bank claims",

Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and Company's abil/i.rightty to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Understanding management's going concern assessment process, includ/i.rightng the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19);\n- \u00b7 Review of the Corporate Plan, includ/i.rightng assessing the reasonableness of assumptions and histor/i.rightcal forecasting accuracy;\n- \u00b7 Assessing the results of management's stress testing, includ/i.rightng considerat/i.righton of princ/i.rightpal and emerging risks, on funding, liqu/i.rightdity and regulatory capital;\n- \u00b7 Review/i.rightng correspondence with prudential regulators and authorit/i.rightes for matters that may impact the going concern assessment; and\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the appropriateness of the going concern disclosure included in note 1 to the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not ident/i.rightfied any material uncertaint/i.rightes relating to events or condit/i.rightons that, ind/i.rightvidually or collectively, may cast sign/i.rightficant doubt on the Group and Company's abil/i.rightty to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from 17 February 2022.\n\nIn relation to the Group and Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financ/i.rightal statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.",

Taken together, this enables us to form an opin/i.righton on the consolidated financ/i.rightal statements. We took into account the size, risk profile, the organisat/i.righton of the group and effectiveness of Group control environment, changes in the business environment and other factors such as material issues or misstatements noted in prior period when assessing the level of work to be performed at each component.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the consolidated financ/i.rightal statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitat/i.rightve coverage of sign/i.rightficant accounts in the financ/i.rightal statements, of the 352 reporting components of the Group, we selected 28 components in 18 countries covering entit/i.rightes with/i.rightn Bangladesh, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Kenya, Mainland China, Malaysia, Niger/i.righta, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, and the United States of America, which represent the princ/i.rightpal business units with/i.rightn the Group. The defin/i.righttion of a component is aligned with the structure of the Group's consolidat/i.righton system, typically these are either a branch, group of branches, group of subsid/i.rightaries, a subsid/i.rightary or an associate.\n\nWe took a centralised approach to audit/i.rightng certain processes and controls, as well as the substantive testing of specif/i.rightc balances. This included audit work over Global Business Services, Commercial, Corporate and Institut/i.rightonal Banking, Credit Impairment and Technology.\n\nOf the 28 components selected in 18 countries, we performed an audit of the complete financ/i.rightal informat/i.righton of 21 components in 14 countries ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characterist/i.rightcs. For the remain/i.rightng 7 components in 4 countries ('specif/i.rightc scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specif/i.rightc accounts with/i.rightn that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the sign/i.rightficant accounts in the financ/i.rightal statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 81% (2020: 86%) of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, 89% (2020: 89%) of the Group's absolute operating income and 96% (2020: 97%) of the Group's total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 74% (2020: 82%) of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, 81% (2020: 82%) of the Group's absolute operating income and 88% (2020: 90%) of the Group's total assets. The specif/i.rightc scope component contributed 7% (2020: 4%) of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, 8% (2020: 7%) of the Group's absolute operating income and 8% (2020: 7%) of the Group's total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all sign/i.rightficant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of sign/i.rightficant accounts tested for the Group.\n\nOf the remain/i.rightng 324 components that together represent 19% of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT, none are ind/i.rightvidually greater than 1.7% of the Group's absolute adjusted PBT. For these components, we performed other procedures at a Group level which included, performing analytical reviews at a Group financ/i.rightal statement line item level, testing entity level controls, performing audit procedures on the centralised shared service centres, testing of consolidat/i.righton journals and intercompany elim/i.rightnations, inqu/i.rightring with local component teams and assessing the outcome of prior year local statutory audits to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financ/i.rightal statements.

        "page_content": "## Changes from the prior year\n\nWe assessed our 2021 audit scope with considerat/i.righton of history or expectation of unusual or complex transactions and potential for or history of material misstatements. We also kept our audit scope under review throughout the year.\n\nA total of 5 components in 4 countries which were previously included in our prior year audit scope, that together represent 1.3% of the prior year absolute adjusted PBT have now been excluded from the Group audit scope in the current year based on our updated risk assessment.\n\nBangladesh which was a full scope component in the prior year is designated as a specif/i.rightc scope component in the current year based on our updated risk assessment.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establish/i.rightng our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the Group audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms and another firm operating under our instruct/i.righton.\n\nOf the 21 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these (includ/i.rightng the audit of the Company) directly by the Group audit engagement team (EY London) in the United Kingdom. For the 7 specif/i.rightc scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that suffic/i.rightent audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opin/i.righton on the Group as a whole. In addit/i.righton, the Group has centralised processes and controls over key areas in its shared service centres. Members of the Group audit engagement team provide direct oversight, review and coordinat/i.righton of our shared service centre audits.\n\nOur programme of planned vis/i.rightts to components and shared service centres in several locations was impacted by the travel restrict/i.rightons and other imposed government measures which are still in place from the prior year as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The audit was performed remotely at both Group audit engagement team and component locations supported through the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and timely delivery of requested audit evidence. We also undertook virtual engagement with local audit teams and management. These virtual meetings involved discuss/i.rightng the audit approach with the component and shared service centres team and any issues aris/i.rightng from their work, meeting with local management, attending meetings with the key audit partners of material components, attending inter/i.rightm and closing meetings and performing remote reviews of key audit workpapers. Furthermore, the Senior Statutory Auditor vis/i.rightted Singapore as it is the location where sign/i.rightficant element of the work on sign/i.rightficant risk areas such as credit and financ/i.rightal instrument valuation is performed. He attended meetings with management and held discuss/i.rightons on the audit approach and any issues aris/i.rightng from the work of the Singapore component and Shared Service Centre teams.\n\nAs a result of COVID-19, we mainta/i.rightned continuous involvement and oversight of the component teams. This includes the Group audit engagement partners and senior members of the primary audit team increas/i.rightng regular\n\ninteract/i.rightons through calls and video conferences during various stages of the audit process, increas/i.rightng our written communicat/i.rightons to and reporting from the component teams and inv/i.rightting component teams to our virtual planning event and subsequent virtual events dedicated to specif/i.rightc areas of the audit.\n\nFor major/i.rightty of the sign/i.rightficant and fraud risk areas, substantial elements of the audit work were led centrally, either with/i.rightn the Group audit engagement team, or with/i.rightn other teams performing centralised procedures.\n\nThis, together with the addit/i.rightonal procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opin/i.righton on the Group and Company financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere has been increas/i.rightng interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact the banking industry. The Group has determined climate risk to be a Primary Integrated Risk Type and the assessment of this risk is explained in the Task Force for Climate related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures and in the Princ/i.rightpal Risks and Uncertaint/i.rightes section of the Annual Report (collectively the 'Climate Disclosures').\n\nThe Climate Disclosures form part of the 'Other informat/i.righton,' rather than the audited financ/i.rightal statements. Our procedures on the Climate Disclosures therefore consisted solely of consider/i.rightng whether they are materially incons/i.rightstent with the financ/i.rightal statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nGovernmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing and are interdependent upon each other; accordingly, financ/i.rightal statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of uncertainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determin/i.rightng asset and liab/i.rightlity valuations and the tim/i.rightng of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted IAS and EU IFRS.\n\nOur audit effort in consider/i.rightng climate change risks was focused on evaluating whether the Group's assessment of the effects of material climate change risks disclosed with/i.rightn Basis of Preparation on page 316 have been appropriately reflected in the valuation of assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, where these can be reliably measured. This was in the context of the Group's process over this emerging area being lim/i.rightted, as a result of lim/i.righttations in the availab/i.rightlity of data and sophist/i.rightcated models, and as the Group considers how it further embeds its climate ambit/i.rightons into the planning process.\n\nWe also understood the Directors' considerat/i.rightons of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viab/i.rightlity and the associated disclosures.\n\nWhilst the Group has stated its commitment to the aspirat/i.rightons of the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emiss/i.rightons by 2050, the Group considers Climate Risk as a longer-term risk and will address the risk through its business strategy and financ/i.rightal planning as the Group implements its net zero journey. As set out above and on page 316 with/i.rightn Basis of Preparation, the Group's process is currently lim/i.rightted, and accordingly, the potential impacts of Climate Risk may not be fully incorporated in these financ/i.rightal statements.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most sign/i.rightficance in our audit of the financ/i.rightal statements of the current period and include the most sign/i.rightficant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we ident/i.rightfied. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and direct/i.rightng the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financ/i.rightal statements as a whole, and in our opin/i.righton thereon, and we do not provide a separate opin/i.righton on these matters.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\n## Credit Impairment\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (page 117); Accounting polic/i.rightes (page 328); Note 8 of the financ/i.rightal statements; and relevant credit risk disclosures (includ/i.rightng pages 203 and 234) At 31 December 2021, the Group reported total credit impa/i.rightrment balance sheet provis/i.righton of $6,209 mill/i.righton (2020: $7,145 mill/i.righton).\n\nManagement's judgements and estimates are especially subject/i.rightve due to sign/i.rightficant uncertainty associated with the assumptions used. Assumptions with increased complexity in respect of the tim/i.rightng and measurement of expected credit losses (ECL) include:\n\n- \u00b7 Staging - Allocation of assets to stage 1, 2, or 3 on a timely basis using criter/i.righta in accordance with IFRS 9;\n- \u00b7 Model output and adjustments - Accounting interpretat/i.rightons, modelling assumptions and data used to build and run the models that calculate the ECL, includ/i.rightng the appropriateness, completeness and valuation of post-model adjustments applied to model output to address risks not fully captured by the models;\n- \u00b7 Economic scenarios - Sign/i.rightficant judgements involved with the determinat/i.righton of parameters used in Monte Carlo Simulat/i.righton and the evaluation of the appropriateness of using Monte Carlo Simulat/i.righton with regards to whether the simulat/i.righton can suffic/i.rightently capture the non-linear/i.rightty of ECL and appropriately generate a wide enough range of possible outcomes;\n- \u00b7 Management overlays - Appropriateness, completeness and valuation of risk event overlays to capture risks not ident/i.rightfied by the credit impa/i.rightrment models, includ/i.rightng the considerat/i.righton of the risk of management override; and\n- \u00b7 Indiv/i.rightdually assessed ECL allowances - Measurement of ind/i.rightvidual provis/i.rightons includ/i.rightng the assessment of probabil/i.rightty weighted recovery scenarios, exit strategies, collateral valuations and time to collect.\n\nThe above complexit/i.rightes are further exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly due to its dynamic nature and the divers/i.rightty of its impact across geographies and time. The most notable risk in this respect remains the appropriateness of the management COVID-19 overlay recognised with/i.rightn the ECL. The level of risk remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls relevant to the Group's processes over material ECL balances, includ/i.rightng the judgements and estimates noted, involv/i.rightng EY special/i.rightsts to assist us in performing our procedures to the extent it was appropriate. These included:\n\n- \u00b7 credit monitor/i.rightng;\n- \u00b7 controls over the allocation of assets into stages such as management's monitor/i.rightng of stage effectiveness;\n- \u00b7 completeness and accuracy of data;\n- \u00b7 review and approval of multiple economic scenarios;\n- \u00b7 model governance, includ/i.rightng model monitor/i.rightng, model validat/i.righton and review and approval of post model adjustments;\n- \u00b7 review and approval of management overlays; and\n- \u00b7 review and approval of the ind/i.rightvidually assessed ECL.\n\nIn evaluating the controls, we obtained the relevant papers and minutes of the executive forums that discuss and approve the credit models and ECL allowances for evidence of executive review and challenge.\n\nWe performed an overall stand-back assessment of the ECL\n\nallowance levels by stage to determine if they were reasonable by consider/i.rightng the overall credit quality of the Group's portfolios, risk profile, impact of COVID-19 includ/i.rightng geographic considerat/i.rightons and vulnerable sectors. We also assessed the effect of government support measures in key locations (e.g., payment deferrals), which may delay or mask stage migrat/i.rightons. Our assessment also included the evaluation of the macroeconomic environment by consider/i.rightng trends in the economies and industr/i.rightes to which the Group is exposed. We performed peer benchmarking where available to assess overall staging and provis/i.righton coverage levels.\n\nStaging - We evaluated the criter/i.righta used to allocate financ/i.rightal assets to stage 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 9. We reperformed the staging distr/i.rightbution for a sample of financ/i.rightal assets and assessed the reasonableness of staging downgrades applied by management.\n\nTo test credit monitor/i.rightng which largely drives the probabil/i.rightty of default estimates used in the staging calculation, we challenged the risk ratings for a sample of performing accounts and other accounts exhib/i.rightting risk characterist/i.rightcs such as financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculties, deferment of payment, late payment and watchlist. We also considered the vulnerable sectors (as defined on page 229 in the annual report) impacted by COVID-19.",

We focused on judgements and estimates, includ/i.rightng the appropriateness of the equity accounting treatment under IAS 28 and the assessment of impa/i.rightrment.\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nThe Group holds a 16.26% stake in China Bohai Bank and equity accounts for the investment as an associate, on the grounds that the Group has assessed that it exercises sign/i.rightficant influence over China Bohai Bank.\n\nIAS 28 states that if the entity holds, directly or ind/i.rightrectly, less than 20% of the voting power of the investee, it is presumed that the entity does not have sign/i.rightficant influence, unless such influence can be clearly demonstrated.\n\nThere is a risk that the equity accounting treatment may not be appropriate, if the Group cannot demonstrate that it exerts sign/i.rightficant influence over China Bohai Bank.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the China Bohai Bank's market capital/i.rightsation was at a sign/i.rightficant discount compared to the carrying value of the investment, which represents an ind/i.rightcator of impa/i.rightrment.\n\nImpairment of the investment in China Bohai Bank is determined by comparing the carrying value to the VIU. Where the recoverable amount is based on VIU, this is modelled by reference to future cashflow forecasts (profit includ/i.rightng a regulatory capital haircut adjustment), discount rates and macroeconomic assumptions such as long-term growth rates.\n\nConsequently, there is a risk that if the judgements and assumptions underpinn/i.rightng the impa/i.rightrment assessments are inappropr/i.rightate, then the investment in China Bohai Bank may be misstated.\n\nThe risk has increased in current year in the context of economic developments in China as well as Bohai's financ/i.rightal performance in 2021.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\nWe concluded that the Group continues to mainta/i.rightn sign/i.rightficant influence over China Bohai Bank as at 31 December 2021. We concluded that the Interest in Associate - China Bohai Bank balance as at 31 December 2021 was not materially misstated. We concluded that the disclosures in the annual report appropriately reflect the sensit/i.rightvity of the carrying value to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions.\n\n## Basis of accounting\n\nWe evaluated the facts and circumstances that the Group presented to demonstrate its abil/i.rightty to exert sign/i.rightficant influence over the management, and financ/i.rightal and operating polic/i.rightes of China Bohai Bank, through Board representation, membership of Board Committees and the sharing of industry and technical advice.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the Group's VIU methodology for testing the impa/i.rightrment of the investment in China Bohai Bank for compliance with the accounting standards. We tested the mathematical accuracy of the VIU model and engaged our valuation special/i.rightsts to support the audit team in calculating an independent range for the assumptions underlying the VIU calculations, such as the discount rate and long-term growth rate.\n\nWe performed audit procedures to assess the reasonableness of the Group's forecast of the future cashflows relating to Bohai, by review/i.rightng management's assessment, benchmarking the forecasts to broker reports published for comparable companies and challenging management with regard to the relevance and reliab/i.rightlity of histor/i.rightcal data when preparing their assessment. We assessed the appropriateness of disclosures in the annual report in relation to the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions on the carrying values of the investment in Bohai.",

At 31 December 2021, the Group reported financ/i.rightal assets measured at fair value of $303,678 mill/i.righton, and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at fair value of $138,596 mill/i.righton, of which financ/i.rightal assets of $4,116 mill/i.righton and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes of $1,653 mill/i.righton are classif/i.righted as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair value of financ/i.rightal instruments with higher risk characterist/i.rightcs involves the use of management judgement in the selection of valuation models and techniques, pric/i.rightng inputs and assumptions and fair value adjustments.\n\nA higher level of estimat/i.righton uncertainty is involved for financ/i.rightal instruments valued using complex models, pric/i.rightng inputs that have lim/i.rightted observabil/i.rightty, and fair value adjustments, includ/i.rightng the Credit Valuation Adjustment and Debit Valuation Adjustment, in relation to derivat/i.rightve transactions with counterparties where credit spreads are less readily able to be determined.\n\nWe considered the following portfolios presented a higher level of estimat/i.righton uncertainty:\n\n- \u00b7 Level 3 derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments and a portfolio of Level 2 derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments due to the use of complex models or ill/i.rightquid pric/i.rightng inputs, and\n- \u00b7 Unlisted equity investments, loans at fair value, debt and other financ/i.rightal instruments classif/i.righted in Level 3 with unobservable pric/i.rightng inputs.\n\nThe level of risk remains consistent with the prior year.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\nWe concluded that assumptions used by management to estimate the fair value of financ/i.rightal instruments with higher risk characterist/i.rightcs and the recognit/i.righton of related income were reasonable. We highl/i.rightghted the following matters to the Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 Complex model-dependent valuations were appropriate based on the output of our independent revaluations;\n- \u00b7 Fair values of derivat/i.rightve transactions, unlisted equity investments, loans, debt and other financ/i.rightal instruments valued using pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton with lim/i.rightted observabil/i.rightty were not materially misstated as at 31 December 2021, based on the output of our independent calculations; and\n- \u00b7 Valuation adjustments in respect of credit, funding and other risks applied to derivat/i.rightve portfolios and debt securit/i.rightes issued were appropriate, based on our analysis of market data and benchmarking of pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton.\n\nThe KAMs remain consistent from prior year.\n\n## Our applicat/i.righton of material/i.rightty\n\nWe apply the concept of material/i.rightty in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of ident/i.rightfied misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opin/i.righton.\n\n## Material/i.rightty\n\nThe magnitude of an omiss/i.righton or misstatement that, ind/i.rightvidually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decis/i.rightons of the users of the financ/i.rightal statements. Material/i.rightty provides a basis for determin/i.rightng the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined material/i.rightty for the Group to be $195 mill/i.righton (2020: $144 mill/i.righton), which is 5% (2020: 5%) of adjusted PBT. This reflects actual PBT adjusted for non-recurring item relating to restructuring, regulatory fine and net gain on businesses disposed/held for sale. We believe that adjusted PBT provides us with the most appropriate measure for the users of the financ/i.rightal statements, given the Group is profit making; it is consistent with the wider industry and is the standard for listed and regulated entit/i.rightes and we believe it reflects the most useful measure for users of the financ/i.rightal statements. We also believe that the adjustments are appropriate as they relate to material non-recurring items.\n\n## Starting basis\n\n- \u00b7  Statutory profit before tax - $3,347m\n\n## Adjustments\n\n- \u00b7  Restructuring - $507m\n- \u00b7  Regulatory fine - $62m\n- \u00b7  Net gain on businesses disposed/held for sale - ($20m)\n\n## Material/i.rightty\n\n- \u00b7  Totals $3,896m Adjusted PBT\n- \u00b7  Material/i.rightty of $195m (5% of Adjusted PBT)\n\nWe evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of financ/i.rightal instruments, includ/i.rightng independent price verif/i.rightcation, model review and approval, fair value adjustments, income statement analysis and reporting.\n\nAmong other procedures, we engaged our valuation special/i.rightsts to assist the audit team in performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Test complex model-dependent valuations by independently revaluing a sample of Level 3 and complex Level 2 derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments, in order to assess the appropriateness of models and the adequacy of assumptions and inputs used by the Group;\n- \u00b7 Test valuations of other financ/i.rightal instruments with higher estimat/i.righton uncertainty, such as unlisted equity investments, loans at fair value, debt and other financ/i.rightal instruments. We compared management's valuation to our own independently developed range, where appropriate;\n- \u00b7 Assessed the appropriateness of pric/i.rightng inputs as part of the Independent Price Verif/i.rightcation process; and\n- \u00b7 Compared the methodology used for fair value adjustments to current market practice. We revalued a sample of valuation adjustments, compared funding and credit spreads to third party data and challenged the basis for determin/i.rightng ill/i.rightquid credit spreads.\n\nWhere material differences between our independent valuation and management's valuation were outside our thresholds, we performed addit/i.rightonal testing to assess the impact on the valuation of financ/i.rightal instruments.",

        "page_content": "We determined material/i.rightty for the Company to be $176 mill/i.righton (2020: $130 mill/i.righton) which is 0.33% (2020: 0.25%) of the equity of the Company. We believe that equity provides us with the most appropriate measure for the users of the Company's financ/i.rightal statements, given that the Company is primar/i.rightly a holding company.\n\n## Performance material/i.rightty\n\nThe applicat/i.righton of material/i.rightty at the ind/i.rightvidual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probabil/i.rightty that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds material/i.rightty.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance material/i.rightty was 50% (2020: 50%) of our planning material/i.rightty, namely $98 mill/i.righton (2020: $72 mill/i.righton). We have set performance material/i.rightty at this percentage based on a variety of risk assessment factors such as the expectation of misstatements, internal control environment considerat/i.rightons and other factors such as the global complexity of the Group.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtain/i.rightng audit coverage over sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightal statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance material/i.rightty. The performance material/i.rightty set for each component is based on the relative size and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance material/i.rightty allocated to components was $8m to $29m (2020: $7m to $22m).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which ident/i.rightfied misstatements are considered as being clearly triv/i.rightal.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of $10 mill/i.righton (2020: $7 mill/i.righton), which is set at 5% of planning material/i.rightty, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitat/i.rightve grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitat/i.rightve measures of material/i.rightty discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitat/i.rightve considerat/i.rightons in forming our opin/i.righton.\n\n## Other informat/i.righton\n\nThe other informat/i.righton comprises the informat/i.righton included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 293, includ/i.rightng the Strategic report (page 2 to 87), the Directors' report (page 88 to 140) and the informat/i.righton not marked as 'audited' in the Directors' remuneration report (page 141 to 190) and the Risk and capital review section (page 194 to 293), and the Supplementary informat/i.righton (page 440 to 468), other than the financ/i.rightal statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other informat/i.righton contained with/i.rightn the annual report.\n\nOur opin/i.righton on the financ/i.rightal statements does not cover the other informat/i.righton and, except to the extent otherwise explic/i.righttly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsib/i.rightlity is to read the other informat/i.righton and, in doing so, consider whether the other informat/i.righton is materially incons/i.rightstent with the financ/i.rightal statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we ident/i.rightfy such material\n\nincons/i.rightstencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financ/i.rightal statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other informat/i.righton, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opin/i.rightons on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opin/i.righton, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opin/i.righton, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the informat/i.righton given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financ/i.rightal year for which the financ/i.rightal statements are prepared is consistent with the financ/i.rightal statements; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by/uni00A0exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the Company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not ident/i.rightfied material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opin/i.righton:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not vis/i.rightted by us; or\n- \u00b7 the Company financ/i.rightal statements and the part of the Directors' remuneration report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specif/i.righted by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the informat/i.righton and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nWe have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viab/i.rightlity and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and Company's compliance with the provis/i.rightons of the UK Corporate Governance Code specif/i.righted for our review by the List/i.rightng Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financ/i.rightal statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertaint/i.rightes ident/i.rightfied;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the Company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate;\n\nF",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, ind/i.rightvidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decis/i.rightons of users taken on the basis of these financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregular/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng fraud\n\nIrregularit/i.rightes, includ/i.rightng fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes, outlined above, to detect irregular/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intent/i.rightonal misrepresentat/i.rightons, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregular/i.rightties, includ/i.rightng fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsib/i.rightlity for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the Company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most sign/i.rightficant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK-adopted IAS and EU IFRS, the Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Financ/i.rightal Conduct Authority (FCA) List/i.rightng Rules, the Main Board List/i.rightng Rules of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange), regulations and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), FRC, FCA and other overseas regulatory requirements, includ/i.rightng but not lim/i.rightted to regulations in its major markets such as Hong Kong, India, Singapore, the United States of America, and the relevant tax compliance regulations in the jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons in which the Group operates. In addit/i.righton, we concluded that there are certain sign/i.rightficant laws and regulations that may have an effect on the determinat/i.righton of the amounts and disclosures in the financ/i.rightal statements and those laws and regulations relating to regulatory capital and liqu/i.rightdity, conduct, financ/i.rightal crime includ/i.rightng anti-money laundering, sanctions and market abuse recognis/i.rightng the financ/i.rightal and regulated nature of the Group's activ/i.rightties.\n- \u00b7 We understood how the Group is complying with those frameworks by performing a combinat/i.righton of inqu/i.rightries of senior management and those charged with governance as required by audit/i.rightng standards, review of board and committee meeting minutes, gain/i.rightng an understanding of the Group's approach to governance, inspect/i.righton of regulatory correspondences in the year and engaging with internal and external legal counsels. We also engaged EY financ/i.rightal crime and forensics special/i.rightsts to perform procedures on areas relating to anti-money laundering, whistleblow/i.rightng, and sanctions. Through these procedures, we became aware of actual or suspected non-compliance. The ident/i.rightfied actual or suspected non-compliance was not suffic/i.rightently sign/i.rightficant to our audit that would have resulted in being ident/i.rightfied as a key audit matter.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptib/i.rightlity of the Group's financ/i.rightal statements to material misstatement, includ/i.rightng how fraud might occur by consider/i.rightng the controls that the Group has established to address risks ident/i.rightfied by the entity, or that otherwise seek to prevent, deter or detect fraud. Our procedures to address the risks ident/i.rightfied also included incorporation of unpredictab/i.rightlity into the nature, tim/i.rightng and/or extent of our testing, challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and journal entry testing.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding, we designed our audit procedures to ident/i.rightfy non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved inqu/i.rightries of the Group's internal and external legal counsel, money laundering reporting officer, internal audit, certain senior management executives and focused testing on a sample basis, includ/i.rightng journal entry testing. We also performed inspect/i.righton of key regulatory correspondence from the relevant regulatory authorit/i.rightes as well as review of board and committee minutes.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 For instances of actual or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations, which have a material impact on the financ/i.rightal statements, these were communicated by management to the Group audit engagement team and component teams (where applicable) who performed audit procedures such as inqu/i.rightries with management and external legal counsel, sending confirmat/i.rightons to external lawyers, substantive testing and meeting with regulators. Where appropriate, we involved special/i.rightsts from our firm to support the audit team.\n- \u00b7 The Group is authorised to provide banking, insurance, mortgages and home finance, consumer credit, pensions, investments and other activ/i.rightties. The Group operates in the banking industry which is a highly regulated environment. As such, the Senior Statutory Auditor considered the experience and expertise of the Group audit engagement team, the component teams and the shared service centre teams to ensure that the team had the appropriate competence and capabil/i.rightties, which included the use of special/i.rightsts where appropriate.\n\nA further descript/i.righton of our responsib/i.rightlit/i.rightes for the audit of the financ/i.rightal statements is located on the FRC's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsrespons/i.rightbil/i.rightties. This descript/i.righton forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 Following the recommendation from the Audit Committee, we were re-appointed by the Company at the Annual General Meeting on 12 May 2021 to audit the financ/i.rightal statements for the year ending 31 December 2021 and subsequent financ/i.rightal periods.\n- \u00b7 The period of total uninterrupted engagement is two years, covering the years ended 31 December 2020 to 31 December 2021.\n- \u00b7 The audit opin/i.righton is consistent with the addit/i.rightonal report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.

Accounting polic/i.rightes\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe Group financ/i.rightal statements consolidate Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) and its subsid/i.rightaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity account the Group's interests in associates and jo/i.rightntly controlled entit/i.rightes. The Company financ/i.rightal statements present informat/i.righton about the Company as a separate entity.\n\nThe Group financ/i.rightal statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted internat/i.rightonal accounting standards and International Financ/i.rightal Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS). The Company financ/i.rightal statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted internat/i.rightonal accounting standards as applied in conformity with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006. The financ/i.rightal statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThere are no sign/i.rightficant differences between UK-adopted internat/i.rightonal accounting standards and EU IFRS.\n\nThe following parts of the Risk review and Capital review form part of these financ/i.rightal statements:\n\na) Risk review: Disclosures marked as 'audited' from the start of the Credit Risk section (page 200) to the end of Other princ/i.rightpal risks in the same section (page 257).\n\nb) Capital review: Tables marked as 'audited' from the start of 'CRD Capital base' to the end of 'Movement in total capital', excluding 'Total risk-weighted assets' (pages 289 to 290).\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Group and Company financ/i.rightal statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the histor/i.rightcal cost convention, as modif/i.righted by the revaluation of cashsettled share-based payments, fair value through other comprehensive income, and financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes (includ/i.rightng derivat/i.rightves) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe consolidated financ/i.rightal statements are presented in United States dollars ($), being the presentation currency of the Group and functional currency of the Company, and all values are rounded to the nearest mill/i.righton dollars, except when otherwise ind/i.rightcated.\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of climate risk on the Group's financ/i.rightal report. As set out on page 67 of the Task Force for Climate related Financ/i.rightal Disclosures and pages 278 and 279 of the Princ/i.rightpal Risks and Uncertaint/i.rightes section of the Annual Report, the Group has determined climate risk to be a Primary Integrated Risk Type. The areas of\n\nimpact were credit risk and the impact on lending portfolios; ESG features with/i.rightn issued loans and bonds; physical risk on our mortgage lending portfolio; and, the corporate plan, in respect of which forward looking cash flows impact the recoverabil/i.rightty of certain assets, includ/i.rightng of goodwill, deferred tax assets and investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings.\n\nThis assessment was undertaken by consider/i.rightng the maturity profile of the loan portfolio which is major/i.rightty shorter term. Transit/i.righton risk, as our clients move to lower carbon emitt/i.rightng revenues is considered with reference to client transit/i.righton pathways and manifests over a longer term than the maturity of the loan book (up to 2050). Physical risk is already included with/i.rightn the major/i.rightty of our mortgage lending and we have applied scenario analysis against the pathways of different temperature addit/i.rightons and country policy scenarios. We also assess the impact of climate risk on the classif/i.rightcation of financ/i.rightal instruments under IFRS 9, when Environmental, Sustainab/i.rightlity or Governance (ESG) triggers may affect the cash flows received by the Group under the contractual terms of the instrument.\n\nOur corporate plan has a 5 year outlook and already includes where we have committed to transit/i.rightoning away from certain high carbon sectors (i.e. coal), offset by transit/i.righton finance opportunit/i.rightes. This is shorter term than many of the climate scenario outlooks but seeks to capture the nearer term performance as required by recoverabil/i.rightty models.\n\nWe have further partic/i.rightpated in the first Climate Bienn/i.rightal Exploratory Scenario (CBES) to explore key risks from climate change, being transit/i.righton risk of the economy as it moves away from carbon and the physical risks associated with higher global temperatures. Focussed on credit risk in the loans and advances portfolio to corporate and inst/i.righttutional clients as well as personal customers over a thirty year time horizon. Estimates included the impact of transit/i.righton risk on the Group's lending portfolios with impacts moving from temporarily lower growth up to recession and permanently lower growth.\n\nOur process was lim/i.rightted in the context of this being an emerging area, particularly given of the availab/i.rightlity of data and the sophist/i.rightcation of models, and so the potential impact of Climate Risk may not be fully reflected in these financ/i.rightal statements.  The Group considers Climate Risk to have lim/i.rightted impact in the immed/i.rightate term and as a longer term risk will be addressed through its business strategy and financ/i.rightal planning as the Group implements its net zero journey.",

Accounting polic/i.rightes continued\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn determin/i.rightng the carrying amounts of certain assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, the Group makes assumptions of the effects of uncertain future events on those assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at the balance sheet date. The Group's estimates and assumptions are based on histor/i.rightcal experience and expectation of future events and are reviewed period/i.rightcally. Further informat/i.righton about key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimat/i.righton uncertainty and judgement, are set out in the relevant disclosure notes for the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit impa/i.rightrment, includ/i.rightng evaluation of management overlays and post-model adjustments, and determinat/i.righton of probabil/i.rightty weight/i.rightngs for Stage 3 ind/i.rightvidually assessed provis/i.rightons (Note 8)\n- \u00b7 Taxation (Note 10)\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal instruments measured at fair value (Note 13)\n- \u00b7 Goodwill impa/i.rightrment (Note 17)\n- \u00b7 Recoverable amounts for aircraft operating lease assets (Note 18)\n- \u00b7 Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges (Note 24)\n- \u00b7 Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates - China Bohai associate accounting and impa/i.rightrment analysis (Note 32)\n\n## IFRS and Hong Kong accounting requirements\n\nAs required by the Hong Kong List/i.rightng Rules, an explanation of the differences in accounting practices between UKadopted IFRS and Hong Kong Financ/i.rightal Reporting Standards is required to be disclosed. There would be no sign/i.rightficant differences had these accounts been prepared in accordance with Hong Kong Financ/i.rightal Reporting Standards.\n\n## Comparatives\n\nCertain comparatives have been restated in line with current year disclosures. Details of these changes are set out in the relevant sections and notes below:\n\n- \u00b7 Note 2 Segmental informat/i.righton\n- \u00b7 Note 4 Net fees and commiss/i.righton\n- \u00b7 Note 13 Financ/i.rightal instruments\n- \u00b7 Note 17 Goodwill and intang/i.rightble assets\n- \u00b7 Risk review: various credit risk tables for change in segment policy\n- \u00b7 Risk review: interest rate risk in the banking book\n- \u00b7 Risk review: tables marked as 'audited' disaggregating Credit Risk informat/i.righton by client segment have been restated following the Group's change in organisat/i.rightonal structure that came into effect on 1 January 2021\n- \u00b7 Risk review: market risk changes\n\n## New accounting standards adopted by the Group Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021\n\nThe Group has adopted amendments to IFRS 16 that permit the Group not to assess whether a rent concession granted as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic is accounted for as a lease modif/i.rightcation. In March 2021 the IASB extended the availab/i.rightlity of the practical expedient by one year and this was endorsed by the UK Endorsement Board on 12 May 2021, therefore a rent concession is deemed to be a direct consequence of COVID-19 if and only if all the following criter/i.righta are met:\n\n- \u00b7 A change in lease payments results in revised considerat/i.righton for the lease that is substantially the same as, or less than, the considerat/i.righton for the lease immed/i.rightately preceding the change;\n- \u00b7 Any reduction in lease payments affects only payments orig/i.rightnally due up to and includ/i.rightng 30 June 2022 (this includes the case where the change results in reduced lease payments before this date and increased lease payments after this date); and\n- \u00b7 There is no substantive change to other terms and condit/i.rightons of the lease\n\nThe amendments have not had a material effect on the Group's financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## New accounting standards in issue but not yet effective IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts was issued in May 2017 to replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts and to establish a comprehensive standard for inceptors of insurance polic/i.rightes. The effective date is 1 January 2023. The Group is assessing the likely implementat/i.righton impact of adopting the standards on its financ/i.rightal statements.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9 Financ/i.rightal Instruments: Fees in the\n\n'10 per cent' test for derecognit/i.righton of financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes In May 2020 the IASB published its 2018-2020 annual improvements process which provides non-urgent but necessary amendments to IFRS. This publicat/i.righton included changes to IFRS 9 that will be effective prospectively from 1 January 2022, with early adoption permitted. Under these amendments, when assessing changes in terms of a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity, the only fees considered in the assessment of whether the terms of a new or modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity are substantially different (i.e. a change in present value of more than 10 per cent) from the terms of the orig/i.rightnal financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity are fees paid or received between the borrower or lender. This includes fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other's behalf. The effect of these amendments is not expected to be material to the Group's financ/i.rightal statements.",

The directors have made an assessment of the Group's abil/i.rightty to continue as a going concern. This assessment has been made having considered the impact of COVID-19, macroeconomic and geopolit/i.rightcal headwinds, includ/i.rightng:\n\n- \u00b7 A review of the Group Strategy and Corporate Plan, both of which cover a year from the date of sign/i.rightng the annual report\n- \u00b7 An assessment of the actual performance to date, loan book quality, credit impa/i.rightrment, legal, regulatory and compliance matters, and the updated annual budget\n- \u00b7 Considerat/i.righton of stress testing performed, includ/i.rightng both the Bank of England annual stress test and a Group Recovery and Resolution Plan (RRP) as submitted to the PRA. Both these submiss/i.rightons include the applicat/i.righton of stressed scenarios includ/i.rightng; COVID-19 addit/i.rightonal waves with the accompanying economic shocks, credit impact and short term liqu/i.rightdity shocks. Under the tests and through the range of scenarios, the results of these exercises and the RRP demonstrate that the Group has suffic/i.rightent capital and liqu/i.rightdity to continue as a going concern and meet min/i.rightmum regulatory capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements\n\n## 2. Segmental informat/i.righton\n\n## Segments and regions\n\nThe Group's segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments and is reported consistently with the internal performance framework and as presented to the Group's Management Team.\n\nFollowing the Group's change in organisat/i.rightonal structure, effective 1 January 2021, the composit/i.righton of the reportable segments has been amended to reflect this new structure.\n\nAs such, there are two new reportable business segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal Banking and Commercial Banking have been combined to form Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking, serving larger companies and inst/i.righttutions.\n- \u00b7 Retail and Private banking have been combined to form Consumer, Private & Business Banking serving ind/i.rightvidual and business banking clients.\n\nFrom a regional perspective, Greater China & North Asia and ASEAN & South Asia have been combined to form a single Asia region.\n\n- \u00b7 Analysis of the capital, funding and liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton of the Group, includ/i.rightng the capital and leverage ratios, and ICAAP which summarises the Group's capital and risk assessment processes, assesses its capital requirements and the adequacy of resources to meet them. Further, funding and liqu/i.rightdity was considered in the context of the risk appetite metrics, includ/i.rightng the ADR and LCR ratios\n- \u00b7 The Group's Internal Liqu/i.rightdity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP), which considers the Group's liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton, its framework and whether suffic/i.rightent liqu/i.rightdity resources are being mainta/i.rightned to meet liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes as they fall due, was also reviewed\n- \u00b7 The level of debt in issue, includ/i.rightng redemptions and issuances during the year, debt falling due for repayment in the next 12 months and further planned debt issuances, includ/i.rightng the appetite in the market for the Group's debt\n- \u00b7 A detailed review of all princ/i.rightpal and emerging risks\n\nBased on the analysis performed, the directors confirm they are satisf/i.righted that the Group has adequate resources to continue in business for a period of 12 months from 17 February 2022. For this reason, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for preparing the financ/i.rightal statements.\n\nThe three geographic regions are now: Asia, Africa & Middle East, and Europe & Americas. Activ/i.rightties not directly related to a client segment and/or geographic region are included in Central & other items. These mainly include Corporate Centre costs, Treasury activ/i.rightties, certain strategic investments and the UK bank levy.\n\nThe changes above require comparative periods to be restated.\n\nThe following should also be noted:\n\n- \u00b7 Transactions and funding between the segments are carried out on an arm's-length basis\n- \u00b7 Corporate Centre costs represent stewardship and central management services roles and activ/i.rightties that are not directly attributable to business or country operations\n- \u00b7 Treasury markets, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associate investments are managed in the regions and are included with/i.rightn the applicable region. However, they are not managed directly by a client segment and are therefore included in the Central & other items segment",

        "page_content": "## 2. Segmental informat/i.righton continued\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe analysis reflects how the client segments and geographic regions are managed internally. This is described as the Management View (on an underlying basis) and is princ/i.rightpally the location from which a client relationsh/i.rightp is managed, which may differ from where it is financ/i.rightally booked and may be shared between businesses and/or regions. In certain instances this approach is not appropriate and a Financ/i.rightal View is disclosed, that is, the location in which the transaction or balance was booked. Typically, the Financ/i.rightal View is used in areas such as the Market and Liqu/i.rightdity Risk reviews where actual booking location is more important for an assessment. Segmental informat/i.righton is therefore on a Management View unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Restructuring items excluded from underlying results\n\nThe Group's statutory performance is adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature, amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent, other infrequent and/ or exceptional transactions that are sign/i.rightficant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the period and items which management and investors would ordinar/i.rightly ident/i.rightfy separately when assessing underlying performance period-by period.\n\nRestructuring charges of $507 mill/i.righton for 2021 reflects, the impact of actions to transform the organisat/i.righton to improve productiv/i.rightty, primar/i.rightly redundancy related charges, the major/i.rightty of which, includ/i.rightng an early retirement programme in Korea, were booked in 2021.\n\nOther restructuring items include a $62 mill/i.righton regulatory financ/i.rightal penalty and a $20 mill/i.righton fair-value gain relating to a SC Ventures investment.\n\nReconcil/i.rightations between underlying and statutory results are set out in the tables below:\n\n## Profit before taxation (PBT)\n\n|                                                                       | 2021                        | 2021                             | 2021                           | 2021                                                                | 2021                                         | 2021                        |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                       | Underlying  $mill/i.righton | Regulatory Fine  $mill/i.righton | Restructuring  $mill/i.righton | Net gain on  businesses  disposed/   held for sale  $mill/i.righton | Goodwill  impa/i.rightrment  $mill/i.righton | Statutory   $mill/i.righton |\n| Operating income                                                      | 14,713                      | -

Net interest income\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nInterest income for financ/i.rightal assets held at either fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost, and interest expense on all financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost is recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financ/i.rightal asset or a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financ/i.rightal instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal asset or financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates cash flows consider/i.rightng all contractual terms of the financ/i.rightal instrument (for example, prepayment options) but does not consider future credit losses. The calculation includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and all other premiums or discounts. Where the estimates of cash flows have been revised, the carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal asset or liab/i.rightlity is adjusted to reflect the actual and revised cash flows, discounted at the instruments orig/i.rightnal effective interest rate. The adjustment is recognised as interest income or expense in the period in which the revis/i.righton is made.\n\nInterest income for financ/i.rightal assets that are either held at fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost that have become credit-impa/i.rightred subsequent to in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton (stage 3), is recognised using the orig/i.rightnal effective interest rate applied to the net carrying value. Interest income is therefore recognised on the amortised cost of the financ/i.rightal asset includ/i.rightng expected credit losses. Should the credit risk on a stage 3 financ/i.rightal asset improve such that the financ/i.rightal asset is no longer considered credit-impa/i.rightred, interest income recognit/i.righton reverts to a computation based on the gross carrying value of the financ/i.rightal asset.\n\n|                                                                                              | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Balances at central banks                                                                    | 92                      | 113                     |\n| Loans and advances to banks                                                                  | 490                     | 801                     |\n| Loans and advances to customers                                                              | 7, 3 47                 | 8,473                   |\n| Debt securit/i.rightes                                                                       | 1,787                   | 2,325                   |\n| Other elig/i.rightble bills                                                                  | 303                     | 495                     |\n| Accrued on impa/i.rightred assets (discount unwind)                                          | 227 1                   | 85                      |\n| Interest income                                                                              | 10,246                  | 12,292                  |\n| Of which: financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 1,541                   | 2,134                   |\n| Deposits by banks                                                                            | 136                     | 237                     |\n| Customer accounts                                                                            | 2,196                   | 3,671                   |\n| Debt securit/i.rightes in issue                                                              | 566                     | 836                     |\n| Subordinated liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and other borrowed funds                              | 497                     | 637                     |\n| Interest expense on IFRS 16 lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes                                  | 53                      | 59                      |\n| Interest expense                                                                             | 3,448                   | 5,440                   |\n| Net interest income                                                                          | 6,798                   | 6,852                   |\n\n## 4.

        "page_content": "## 4. Net fees and commiss/i.righton continued\n\nThe Group applies the following practical expedients:\n\n- \u00b7 informat/i.righton on amounts of transaction price allocated to unsatisf/i.righted (or partially unsatisf/i.righted) performance obligat/i.rightons at the end of the reporting period is not disclosed as almost all fee-earning contracts have an expected duration of less than one year\n- \u00b7 promised considerat/i.righton is not adjusted for the effects of a sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightng component as the period between the Group provid/i.rightng a service and the customer paying for it is expected to be less than one year\n- \u00b7 incremental costs of obtain/i.rightng a fee-earning contract are recognised upfront in 'Fees and commiss/i.righton expense' rather than amortised, if the expected term of the contract is less than one year\n\nThe determinat/i.righton of the services performed for the customer, the transaction price, and when the services are completed depends on the nature of the product with the customer. The main considerat/i.rightons on income recognit/i.righton by product are as follows:\n\n## Transaction Banking\n\nThe Group recognises fee income associated with transactional trade and cash management at the point in time the service is provided. The Group recognises income associated with trade contingent risk exposures (such as letters of credit and guarantees) over the period in which the service is provided.\n\nPayment of fees is usually received at the same time the service is provided. In some cases, letters of credit and guarantees issued by the Group have annual upfront premiums, which are amortised on a straight-line basis to fee income over the year.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal Markets\n\nThe Group recognises fee income at the point in time the service is provided. Fee income is recognised for a sign/i.rightficant nonlending service when the transaction has been completed and the terms of the contract with the customer entitle the Group to the fee. Fees are usually received shortly after the service is provided.\n\nSyndicat/i.righton fees are recognised when the syndicat/i.righton is complete. Fees are generally received before completion of the syndicat/i.righton, or with/i.rightn 12 months of the transaction date.\n\nSecurit/i.rightes services include custody services, fund accounting and admin/i.rightstration, and broker clearing. Fees are recognised over the period the custody or fund management services are provided, or as and when broker services are requested.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nUpfront considerat/i.righton on bancassurance agreements is amortised straight-line over the contractual term. Commiss/i.rightons for bancassurance activ/i.rightties are recorded as they are earned through sales of third-party insurance products to customers. These commiss/i.rightons are received with/i.rightn a short time frame of the commiss/i.righton being earned. Target-linked fees are accrued based on percentage of the target achieved, provided it is assessed as highly probable that the target will be met. Cash payment is received at a contractually specif/i.righted date after achievement of a target has been confirmed.\n\nUpfront and trail/i.rightng commiss/i.rightons for managed investment placements are recorded as they are confirmed. Income from these activ/i.rightties is relatively even throughout the period, and cash is usually received with/i.rightn a short time frame after the commiss/i.righton is earned.\n\n## Retail Products\n\nThe Group recognises most income at the point in time the Group is entitled to the fee, since most services are provided at the time of the customer's request.\n\nCredit card annual fees are recognised at the time the fee is received since in most of our retail markets there are contractual circumstances under which fees are waived, so income recognit/i.righton is constrained until the uncertaint/i.rightes associated with the annual fee are resolved. The Group defers the fair value of reward points on its credit card reward programmes, and recognises income and costs associated with fulfill/i.rightng the reward at the time of redemption.\n\n|                                                                              | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Fees and commiss/i.rightons income                                           | 4,458                   | 3,865                   |\n| Of which:                                                                    |                         |                         |\n| Financ/i.rightal instruments that are not fair valued through profit or loss | 1,282                   | 1,122                   |\n| Trust and other fiduc/i.rightary activ/i.rightties                           | 703                     | 254                     |\n| Fees and commiss/i.rightons expense                                          | (736)                   | (705)                   |\n| Of which:                                                                    |                         |                         |\n| Financ/i.rightal instruments that are not fair valued through profit or loss | (234)                   | (219)                   |\n| Trust and other fiduc/i.rightary activ/i.rightties                           | (49)                    | (11)                    |\n| Net fees and commiss/i.righton                                               | 3,722                   | 3,160                   |",

Any unamortised 'day one' gain is released to net trading income if the transaction is terminated.\n\n|                                                                                                      | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Net trading income                                                                                   | 3,431                   | 3,672                   |\n| Sign/i.rightficant items with/i.rightn net trading income include:                                   |                         |                         |\n| Gains on instruments held for trading\u00b9                                                               | 3,381                   | 3,254                   |\n| Gains on financ/i.rightal assets mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss                    | 181                     | 607                     |\n| Losses on financ/i.rightal assets designated at fair value through profit or loss                    | (8)                     | (4)                     |\n| Losses on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss | (133)                   | (247)                   |",

Credit impa/i.rightrment\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group's expected credit loss (ECL) calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying assumptions. The sign/i.rightficant judgements in determin/i.rightng expected credit loss include:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group's criter/i.righta for assessing if there has been a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk;\n- \u00b7 Development of expected credit loss models, includ/i.rightng the choice of inputs relating to macroeconomic variables;\n- \u00b7 Evaluation of management overlays and post-model adjustments;\n- \u00b7 Determinat/i.righton of probabil/i.rightty weight/i.rightngs for Stage 3 ind/i.rightvidually assessed provis/i.rightons\n\nThe calculation of credit impa/i.rightrment provis/i.rightons also involves expert credit judgement to be applied by the credit risk management team based upon counterparty informat/i.righton they receive from various sources includ/i.rightng relationsh/i.rightp managers and on external market informat/i.righton. Details on the approach for determin/i.rightng expected credit loss can be found in the credit risk section, under IFRS 9 Methodology (page 233).\n\nEstimates of forecasts of key macroeconomic variables underlying the expected credit loss calculation can be found with/i.rightn the Risk review, Key assumptions and judgements in determin/i.rightng expected credit loss (page 235).\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nExpected credit losses are determined for all financ/i.rightal debt instruments that are classif/i.righted at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income, undrawn commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees.\n\nAn expected credit loss represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a financ/i.rightal asset, undrawn commitment or financ/i.rightal guarantee.\n\nA cash shortfall is the difference between the cash flows that are due in accordance with the contractual terms of the instrument and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive over the contractual life of the instrument.",

Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\n## Measurement\n\nExpected credit losses are computed as unbiased, probabil/i.rightty-weighted amounts which are determined by evaluating a range of reasonably possible outcomes, the time value of money, and consider/i.rightng all reasonable and supportable informat/i.righton includ/i.rightng that which is forward-looking.\n\nFor material portfolios, the estimate of expected cash shortfalls is determined by multiply/i.rightng the probabil/i.rightty of default (PD) with the loss given default (LGD) with the expected exposure at the time of default (EAD). There may be multiple default events over the lifet/i.rightme of an instrument. Further details on the components of PD, LGD and EAD are disclosed in the Credit risk section. For less material Retail Banking loan portfolios, the Group has adopted less sophist/i.rightcated approaches based on histor/i.rightcal roll rates or loss rates.\n\nForward-looking economic assumptions are incorporated into the PD, LGD and EAD where relevant and where they\n\ninfluence credit risk, such as GDP growth rates, interest rates, house price ind/i.rightces and commodity prices among others. These assumptions are incorporated using the Group's most likely forecast for a range of macroeconomic assumptions. These forecasts are determined using all reasonable and supportable informat/i.righton, which includes both internally developed forecasts and those available externally, and are consistent with those used for budgeting, forecasting and capital planning.\n\nTo account for the potential non-linear/i.rightty in credit losses, multiple forward-looking scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes for all material portfolios. For example, where there is a greater risk of downside credit losses than upside gains, multiple forward-looking economic scenarios are incorporated into the range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in respect of determin/i.rightng the PD (and where relevant, the LGD and EAD) and in determin/i.rightng the overall expected credit loss amounts. These scenarios are determined using a Monte Carlo approach centred around the Group's most likely forecast of macroeconomic assumptions.\n\nThe period over which cash shortfalls are determined is generally lim/i.rightted to the maximum contractual period for which the Group is exposed to credit risk. However, for certain revolving credit facil/i.rightties, which include credit cards or overdrafts, the Group's exposure to credit risk is not lim/i.rightted to the contractual period. For these instruments, the Group estimates an appropriate life based on the period that the Group is exposed to credit risk, which includes the effect of credit risk management actions such as the withdrawal of undrawn facil/i.rightties.\n\nFor credit-impa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal instruments, the estimate of cash shortfalls may require the use of expert credit judgement.\n\nThe estimate of expected cash shortfalls on a collateralised financ/i.rightal instrument reflects the amount and tim/i.rightng of cash flows that are expected from foreclosure on the collateral less the costs of obtain/i.rightng and selling the collateral, regardless of whether foreclosure is deemed probable.\n\nCash flows from unfunded credit enhancements held are included with/i.rightn the measurement of expected credit losses if they are part of, or integral to, the contractual terms of the instrument (this includes financ/i.rightal guarantees, unfunded risk partic/i.rightpations and other non-derivat/i.rightve credit insurance). Although non-integral credit enhancements do not impact the measurement of expected credit losses, a reimbursement asset is recognised to the extent of the expected credit losses recorded.\n\nCash shortfalls are discounted using the effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for purchased or orig/i.rightnated credit-impa/i.rightred instruments (POCI)) on the financ/i.rightal instrument as calculated at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton or if the instrument has a variable interest rate, the current effective interest rate determined under the contract.\n\n## Instruments\n\n## Location of expected credit loss provis/i.rightons\n\n| Financ/i.rightal assets held at amortised cost        | Loss provis/i.rightons: netted against gross carrying value 1     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financ/i.rightal assets held FVOCI - Debt instruments | Other comprehensive income (FVOCI expected credit loss reserve) 2 |\n| Loan commitments                                      | Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges 3     |\n| Financ/i.rightal guarantees                           | Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges 3     |\n\n- 3 Expected credit loss on loan commitments and financ/i.rightal guarantees is recognised as a liab/i.rightlity provis/i.righton. Where a financ/i.rightal instrument includes both a loan (i.e. financ/i.rightal asset component) and an undrawn commitment (i.e. loan commitment component), and it is not possible to separately ident/i.rightfy the expected credit loss on these components, expected credit loss amounts on the loan commitment are recognised together with expected credit loss amounts on the financ/i.rightal asset. To the extent the combined expected credit loss exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal asset, the expected credit loss is recognised as a liab/i.rightlity provis/i.righton\n\n## Recognit/i.righton\n\n12 months expected credit losses (Stage 1) Expected credit losses are recognised at the time of in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton of a financ/i.rightal instrument and represent the lifet/i.rightme cash shortfalls aris/i.rightng from possible default events up to 12 months into the future from the balance sheet date. Expected credit losses continue to be determined on this basis until there is either a sign/i.rightficant increase in the credit risk of an instrument or the instrument becomes credit-impa/i.rightred. If an instrument is no longer considered to exhib/i.rightt a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk, expected credit losses will revert to being determined on a 12-month basis.",

Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\nSign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk (Stage 2) If a financ/i.rightal asset experiences a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk (SICR) since in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, an expected credit loss provis/i.righton is recognised for default events that may occur over the lifet/i.rightme of the asset.\n\nSign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk is assessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at orig/i.rightnation (after taking into account the passage of time). Sign/i.rightficant does not mean statist/i.rightcally sign/i.rightficant nor is it assessed in the context of changes in expected credit loss. Whether a change in the risk of default is sign/i.rightficant or not is assessed using a number of quantitat/i.rightve and qualitat/i.rightve factors, the weight of which depends on the type of product and counterparty. Financ/i.rightal assets that are 30 or more days past due and not credit-impa/i.rightred will always be considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk. For less material portfolios where a loss rate or roll rate approach is applied to compute expected credit loss, sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk is primar/i.rightly based on 30 days past due.\n\nQuantitat/i.rightve factors include an assessment of whether there has been sign/i.rightficant increase in the forward-looking probabil/i.rightty of default (PD) since orig/i.rightnation. A forward-looking PD is one that is adjusted for future economic condit/i.rightons to the extent these are correlated to changes in credit risk. We compare the residual lifet/i.rightme PD at the balance sheet date to the residual lifet/i.rightme PD that was expected at the time of orig/i.rightnation for the same point in the term structure and determine whether both the absolute and relative change between the two exceeds predetermined thresholds. To the extent that the differences between the measures of default outlined exceed the defined thresholds, the instrument is considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk.\n\nQualitat/i.rightve factors assessed include those linked to current credit risk management processes, such as lending placed on non-purely precautionary early alert (and subject to closer monitor/i.rightng).\n\nA non-purely precautionary early alert account is one which exhib/i.rightts risk or potential weaknesses of a material nature requir/i.rightng closer monitor/i.rightng, supervis/i.righton, or attention by management. Weaknesses in such a borrower's account, if left uncorrected, could result in deteriorat/i.righton of repayment prospects and the likel/i.righthood of being downgraded. Indicators could include a rapid erosion of posit/i.righton with/i.rightn the industry, concerns over management's abil/i.rightty to manage operations, weak/ deteriorat/i.rightng operating results, liqu/i.rightdity strain and overdue balances among other factors.\n\nCredit-impa/i.rightred (or defaulted) exposures (Stage 3) Financ/i.rightal assets that are credit-impa/i.rightred (or in default) represent those that are at least 90 days past due in respect of princ/i.rightpal and/or interest. Financ/i.rightal assets are also considered to be credit-impa/i.rightred where the obligors are unlikely to pay on the occurrence of one or more observable events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financ/i.rightal asset. It may not be possible to ident/i.rightfy a single discrete event but instead the combined effect of several events may cause financ/i.rightal assets to become credit-impa/i.rightred.\n\n- \u00b7 Evidence that a financ/i.rightal asset is credit-impa/i.rightred includes observable data about the following events:\n- \u00b7 Sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculty of the issuer or borrower;\n- \u00b7 Breach of contract such as default or a past due event;\n- \u00b7 For economic or contractual reasons relating to the borrower's financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculty, the lenders of the borrower have granted the borrower concession/s that lenders would not otherwise consider. This would include forbearance actions (page 331);\n- \u00b7 Pending or actual bankruptcy or other financ/i.rightal reorganisat/i.righton to avoid or delay discharge of the borrower's obligat/i.righton/s;\n- \u00b7 The disappearance of an active market for the applicable financ/i.rightal asset due to financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculties of the borrower;\n- \u00b7 Purchase or orig/i.rightnation of a financ/i.rightal asset at a deep discount that reflects incurred credit losses\n\nLending commitments to a credit-impa/i.rightred obligor that have not yet been drawn down are included to the extent that the commitment cannot be withdrawn. Loss provis/i.rightons against credit-impa/i.rightred financ/i.rightal assets are determined based on an assessment of the recoverable cash flows under a range of scenarios, includ/i.rightng the realisat/i.righton of any collateral held where appropriate. The loss provis/i.rightons held represent the difference between the present value of the expected cash shortfalls, discounted at the instrument's orig/i.rightnal effective interest rate, and the gross carrying value (includ/i.rightng contractual interest due but not paid) of the instrument prior to any credit impa/i.rightrment. The Group's defin/i.righttion of default is aligned with the regulatory defin/i.righttion of default as set out in the UK's onshored capital requirements regulations (Art 178).",

        "page_content": "## 8. Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\n## Expert credit judgement\n\nFor Corporate & Institut/i.rightonal, Commercial and Private Banking, borrowers are graded by credit risk management on a credit grading (CG) scale from CG1 to CG14. Once a borrower starts to exhib/i.rightt credit deteriorat/i.righton, it will move along the credit grading scale in the performing book and when it is classif/i.righted as CG12 the credit assessment and oversight of the loan will normally be performed by Group Special Assets Management (GSAM).\n\nBorrowers graded CG12 exhib/i.rightt well-defined weaknesses in areas such as management and/or performance but there is no current expectation of a loss of princ/i.rightpal or interest. Where the impa/i.rightrment assessment ind/i.rightcates that there will be a loss of princ/i.rightpal on a loan, the borrower is graded a CG14 while borrowers of other credit-impa/i.rightred loans are graded CG13. Instruments graded CG13 or CG14 are regarded as stage 3.\n\nFor ind/i.rightvidually sign/i.rightficant financ/i.rightal assets with/i.rightn stage 3, GSAM will consider all judgements that have an impact on the expected future cash flows of the asset. These include: the business prospects, industry and geo polit/i.rightcal climate of the customer, quality of realisable value of collateral, the Group's legal posit/i.righton relative to other claimants and any renegotiat/i.righton/ forbearance/ modif/i.rightcation options. The future cash flow calculation involves sign/i.rightficant judgements and estimates. As new informat/i.righton becomes available and further negotiat/i.rightons/ forbearance measures are taken the estimates of the future cash flows will be revised, and will have an impact on the future cash flow analysis.\n\nFor financ/i.rightal assets which are not ind/i.rightvidually sign/i.rightficant, such as the Retail Banking portfolio or small business loans, which comprise a large number of homogenous loans that share sim/i.rightlar characterist/i.rightcs, statist/i.rightcal estimates and techniques are used, as well as credit scoring analysis.\n\nRetail Banking clients are considered credit-impa/i.rightred where they are more 90 days past due. Retail Banking products are also considered credit-impa/i.rightred if the borrower files for bankruptcy or other forbearance programme, the borrower is deceased or the business is closed in the case of a small business, or if the borrower surrenders the collateral, or there is an ident/i.rightfied fraud on the account. Addit/i.rightonally, if the account is unsecured and the borrower has other credit accounts with the Group that are considered credit-impa/i.rightred, the account may be also be credit-impa/i.rightred.\n\nTechniques used to compute impa/i.rightrment amounts use models which analyse histor/i.rightcal repayment and default rates over a time horizon. Where various models are used, judgement is required to analyse the available informat/i.righton provided and select the appropriate model or combinat/i.righton of models to use.\n\nExpert credit judgement is also applied to determine whether any post-model adjustments are required for credit risk elements which are not captured by the models.\n\n## Modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nWhere the orig/i.rightnal contractual terms of a financ/i.rightal asset have been modif/i.righted for credit reasons and the instrument has not been derecognised (an instrument is derecognised when a modif/i.rightcation results in a change in cash flows that the Group would consider substantial), the resulting modif/i.rightcation loss is recognised with/i.rightn credit impa/i.rightrment in the income statement with a corresponding decrease in the gross carrying value of the asset. If the modif/i.rightcation involved a concession that the bank would not otherwise consider, the instrument is considered to be credit-impa/i.rightred and is considered forborne.\n\nExpected credit loss for modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal assets that have not been derecognised and are not considered to be creditimpa/i.rightred will be recognised on a 12-month basis, or a lifet/i.rightme basis, if there is a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk. These assets are assessed (by comparison to the orig/i.rightnation date) to determine whether there has been a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk subsequent to the modif/i.rightcation. Although loans may be modif/i.righted for non-credit reasons, a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk may occur. In addit/i.righton to the recognit/i.righton of modif/i.rightcation gains and losses, the revised carrying value of modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal assets will impact the calculation of expected credit losses, with any increase or decrease in expected credit loss recognised with/i.rightn impa/i.rightrment.\n\n## Forborne loans\n\nForborne loans are those loans that have been modif/i.righted in response to a customer's financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculties. Forbearance strategies assist clients who are temporarily in financ/i.rightal distress and are unable to meet their orig/i.rightnal contractual repayment terms. Forbearance can be in/i.righttiated by the client, the Group or a third-party includ/i.rightng government sponsored programmes or a conglomerate of credit inst/i.righttutions. Forbearance may include debt restructuring such as new repayment schedules, payment deferrals, tenor extensions, interest only payments, lower interest rates, forgiveness of princ/i.rightpal, interest or fees, or relaxation of loan covenants.\n\nForborne loans that have been modif/i.righted (and not derecognised) on terms that are not consistent with those readily available in the market and/or where we have granted a concession compared to the orig/i.rightnal terms of the loans are considered credit-impa/i.rightred if there is a detrimental impact on cash flows. The modif/i.rightcation loss (see Classif/i.rightcation and measurement - Modif/i.rightcations) is recognised in the profit or loss with/i.rightn credit impa/i.rightrment and the gross carrying value of the loan reduced by the same amount. The modif/i.righted loan is disclosed as 'Loans subject to forbearance - credit-impa/i.rightred'.\n\nLoans that have been subject to a forbearance modif/i.rightcation, but which are not considered credit-impa/i.rightred (not classif/i.righted as CG13 or CG14), are disclosed as 'Forborne - not credit-impa/i.rightred'. This may include amendments to covenants with/i.rightn the contractual terms.",

Credit impa/i.rightrment continued\n\n## Write-offs of credit-impa/i.rightred instruments and reversal of impa/i.rightrment\n\nTo the extent a financ/i.rightal debt instrument is considered irrecoverable, the applicable portion of the gross carrying value is written off against the related loan provis/i.righton. Such loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed, it is decided that there is no realist/i.rightc probabil/i.rightty of recovery and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off decrease the amount of the provis/i.righton for credit impa/i.rightrment in the income statement.\n\n## Loss provis/i.rightons on purchased or orig/i.rightnated credit-impa/i.rightred instruments (POCI)\n\nThe Group measures expected credit loss on a lifet/i.rightme basis for POCI instruments throughout the life of the instrument. However, expected credit loss is not recognised in a separate loss provis/i.righton on in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton for POCI instruments as the lifet/i.rightme expected credit loss is inherent with/i.rightn the gross carrying amount of the instruments. The Group recognises the change in lifet/i.rightme expected credit losses aris/i.rightng subsequent to in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton in the income statement and the cumulative change as a loss provis/i.righton. Where lifet/i.rightme expected credit losses on POCI instruments are less than those at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, then the favourable differences are recognised as impa/i.rightrment gains in the income statement (and as impa/i.rightrment loss where the expected credit losses are greater).\n\n## Improvement in credit risk/curing\n\nA period may elapse from the point at which instruments enter lifet/i.rightme expected credit losses (stage 2 or stage 3) and are reclassif/i.righted back to 12-month expected credit losses (stage 1). For financ/i.rightal assets that are credit-impa/i.rightred (stage 3), a transfer to stage 2 or stage 1 is only permitted where the instrument is no longer considered to be credit-impa/i.rightred. An instrument will no longer be considered credit-impa/i.rightred when there is no shortfall of cash flows compared to the orig/i.rightnal contractual terms.\n\nFor financ/i.rightal assets with/i.rightn stage 2, these can only be transferred to stage 1 when they are no longer considered to have experienced a sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk.\n\nWhere sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk was determined using quantitat/i.rightve measures, the instruments will automatically transfer back to stage 1 when the orig/i.rightnal PD based transfer criter/i.righta are no longer met. Where instruments were transferred to stage 2 due to an assessment of qualitat/i.rightve factors, the issues that led to the reclassif/i.rightcation must be cured before the instruments can be reclassif/i.righted to stage 1. This includes instances where management actions led to instruments being classif/i.righted as stage 2, requir/i.rightng that action to be resolved before loans are reclassif/i.righted to stage 1.\n\nA forborne loan can only be removed from being disclosed as forborne if the loan is performing (stage 1 or 2) and a further two-year probation period is met.\n\nIn order for a forborne loan to become performing, the following criter/i.righta have to be satisf/i.righted:\n\n- \u00b7 At least a year has passed with no default based upon the forborne contract terms\n- \u00b7 The customer is likely to repay its obligat/i.rightons in full without realis/i.rightng security\n- \u00b7 The customer has no accumulated impa/i.rightrment against amount outstanding (except for ECL)\n\nSubsequent to the criter/i.righta above, a further two-year probation period has to be fulfilled, whereby regular payments are made by the customer and none of the exposures to the customer are more than 30 days past due.\n\n|                                                                                           | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment on loans and advances to banks and customers                 | 258                     | 2,191                   |\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment on debt securit/i.rightes                                    | 26                      | 33                      |\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment relating to financ/i.rightal guarantees and loan commitments | (30)                    | 103                     |\n| Net credit impa/i.rightrment relating to other financ/i.rightal assets                    | -                       | (2)                     |\n| Credit impa/i.rightrment 1                                                                | 254                     | 2,325                   |\n\n## 9.

Taxation\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nIncome tax payable on profits is based on the applicable tax law in each jur/i.rightsdict/i.righton and is recognised as an expense in the period in which profits arise.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences aris/i.rightng between the tax bases of assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financ/i.rightal statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted as at the balance sheet date, and that are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liab/i.rightlity is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be util/i.rightsed. Where permitted, deferred tax assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are offset on an entity basis and not by component of deferred taxation.\n\nCurrent and deferred tax relating to items which are charged or credited directly to equity, is credited or charged directly to equity and is subsequently recognised in the income statement together with the current or deferred gain or loss.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\n- \u00b7 Determin/i.rightng the Group's tax charge for the year involves estimat/i.righton and judgement, which includes an interpretat/i.righton of local tax laws and an assessment of whether the tax authorit/i.rightes will accept the posit/i.righton taken. These judgements take account of external advice where appropriate, and the Group's view on settling with the relevant tax authorit/i.rightes\n- \u00b7 The Group provides for current tax liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at the best estimate of the amount that is expected to be paid to the tax authorit/i.rightes where an outflow is probable. In making its estimates the Group assumes that the tax authorit/i.rightes will examine all the amounts reported to them and have full knowledge of all relevant informat/i.righton\n- \u00b7 The recoverabil/i.rightty of the Group's deferred tax assets is based on management's judgement of the availab/i.rightlity of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets will be util/i.rightsed. In preparing management forecasts the effect of applicable laws and regulations relevant to the util/i.rightsation of future taxable profits have been considered.\n\nThe following table provides analysis of taxation charge in the year:\n\n|                                                                            | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| The charge for taxation based upon the profit for the year comprises:      |                         |                         |\n| Current tax:                                                               |                         |                         |\n| United Kingdom corporation tax at 19 per cent (2020: 19 per cent):         |                         |                         |\n| Current tax charge on income for the year                                  | -                       | -                       |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years (includ/i.rightng double tax relief) | 9                       | (41)                    |\n| Foreign tax:                                                               |                         |                         |\n| Current tax charge on income for the year                                  | 896                     | 1,061                   |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                                      | (26)                    | (352)                   |\n|                                                                            | 879                     | 668                     |\n| Deferred tax:                                                              |                         |                         |\n| Orig/i.rightnation/reversal of temporary differences                       | 218                     | (193)                   |\n| Adjustments in respect of prior years                                      | (63)                    | 387                     |\n|                                                                            | 155                     | 194                     |\n| Tax on profits on ordinary activ/i.rightties                               | 1,034                   | 862                     |\n| Effective tax rate                                                         | 30.9%                   | 53.4%                   |\n\nThe tax charge for the year of $1,034 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $862 mill/i.righton) on a profit before tax of $3,347 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $1,613 mill/i.righton) reflects the impact of countries with tax rates higher or lower than the UK, the most sign/i.rightficant of which is India, non-deductible expenses and non-creditable withhold/i.rightng taxes.

The Group does not currently consider that assumptions or judgements made in assessing tax liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes have a sign/i.rightficant risk of resulting in a material adjustment with/i.rightn the next financ/i.rightal year.\n\n|                                                                      | 2021                         | 2021                          | 2021                   | 2020                         | 2020                          | 2020                   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Tax recognised in other   comprehensive income                       | Current tax  $mill/i.righton | Deferred tax  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Current tax  $mill/i.righton | Deferred tax  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Items that will not be reclassif/i.righted to  income statement      | -                            | (82)                          | (82)                   | -                            | (17)                          | (17)                   |\n| Own credit adjustment                                                | -                            | (6)                           | (6)                    | -                            | 1                             | 1                      |\n| Equity instruments at fair value through  other comprehensive income | -                            | (59)                          | (59)                   | -                            | (27)                          | (27)                   |\n| Retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons                                | -                            | (17)                          | (17)                   | -                            | 9                             | 9                      |\n| Items that may be reclassed  subsequently to income statement        | -                            | 74                            | 74                     | (1)                          | (53)                          | (54)                   |\n| Debt instruments at fair value through  other comprehensive income   | -                            | 76                            | 76                     | (1)                          | (68)                          | (69)                   |\n| Cash flow hedges                                                     | -                            | (2)                           | (2)                    | -                            | 15                            | 15                     |\n| Total tax credit/(charge) recognised   in equity                     | -                            | (8)                           | (8)                    | (1)                          | (70)                          | (71)                   |",

The recoverabil/i.rightty of the Group's deferred tax assets is based on management's judgement of the availab/i.rightlity of future taxable profits against which the deferred tax assets will be util/i.rightsed.\n\nOf the Group's total deferred tax assets, $263 mill/i.righton relates to tax losses carried forward. These tax losses have arisen in ind/i.rightvidual legal entit/i.rightes and will be offset as future taxable profits arise in those entit/i.rightes.\n\n- \u00b7 $104 mill/i.righton of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in Ireland, where there is no expiry date for unused tax losses. These losses relate to aircraft leasing and are expected to be fully util/i.rightsed over the useful economical life of the assets being up to 18 years.\n- \u00b7 $112 mill/i.righton of the deferred tax assets relating to losses has arisen in the US. Management forecasts show that the losses are expected to be fully util/i.rightsed over a period of three years.\n\nThe remain/i.rightng deferred tax assets of $47 mill/i.righton relating to losses have arisen in other jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons and are expected to be recovered in less than 10 years.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax\n\n|                                                                                                       | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| No account has been taken of the following potential deferred tax assets/(liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes): |                         |                         |\n| Withhold/i.rightng tax on unremitted earnings from overseas subsid/i.rightaries and associates        | (426)                   | (397)                   |\n| Tax losses                                                                                            | 2,104                   | 1,612                   |\n| Held over gains on incorporation of overseas branches                                                 | (422)                   | (336)                   |\n| Other temporary differences                                                                           | 208                     | 221                     |\n\nThe aggregate temporary differences relating to unrecognised deferred tax aris/i.rightng on unremitted earnings from overseas subsid/i.rightaries and associates at the balance sheet date was $(5,544) mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $(5,183) mill/i.righton), the gross value of the unrecognised tax losses (includ/i.rightng capital losses) was $8,292 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $7,213 mill/i.righton), gross value of held over gains on incorporation of overseas branches $(1,476) mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $(1,489) mill/i.righton), and other temporary differences $790 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $946 mill/i.righton).",

Earnings per ordinary share\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nBasic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by div/i.rightding the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, excluding own shares held. Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by div/i.rightding the basic earnings, which require no adjustment for the effects of dilut/i.rightve potential ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming the conversion of all dilut/i.rightve potential ordinary shares, excluding own shares held.\n\nThe Group also measures earnings per share on an underlying basis. This differs from earnings defined in IAS 33 Earnings per share. Underlying earnings is profit/(loss) attributable to ordinary shareholders adjusted for profits or losses of a capital nature; amounts consequent to investment transactions driven by strategic intent; and other infrequent and/or exceptional transactions that are sign/i.rightficant or material in the context of the Group's normal business earnings for the year.\n\nThe table below provides the basis of underlying earnings.\n\n|                                                                                  | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Profit for the period attributable to equity holders                             | 2,313                   | 751                     |\n| Non-controlling interest                                                         | 2                       | (27)                    |\n| Div/i.rightdend payable on preference shares and AT1 classif/i.righted as equity | (410)                   | (395)                   |\n| Profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders                      | 1,905                   | 329                     |\n| Items normalised:                                                                |                         |                         |\n| Regulatory fine                                                                  | 62                      | (14)                    |\n| Restructuring                                                                    | 507                     | 382                     |\n| Goodwill impa/i.rightrment (Note 9)                                              | -                       | 489                     |\n| Net (gain)/loss on sale of Businesses (Note 6)                                   | (20)                    | 38                      |\n| Tax on normalised items 1                                                        | (87)                    | (83)                    |\n| Underlying profit attributable to equity holders                                 | 2,367                   | 1,141                   |\n| Basic - Weighted average number of shares (mill/i.rightons)                      | 3,108                   | 3,160                   |\n| Diluted - Weighted average number of shares (mill/i.rightons)                    | 3,154                   | 3,199                   |\n| Basic earnings per ordinary share (cents)                                        | 61.3                    | 10.4                    |\n| Diluted earnings per ordinary share (cents)                                      | 60.4                    | 10.3                    |\n| Underlying basic earnings per ordinary share (cents)                             | 76.2                    | 36.1                    |\n| Underlying diluted earnings per ordinary share (cents)                           | 75.0                    | 35.7                    |\n\n- 1 No tax is included in respect of the impa/i.rightrment of goodwill as no tax relief is available",

Financ/i.rightal instruments\n\n## Classif/i.rightcation and measurement\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group classif/i.rightes its financ/i.rightal assets into the following measurement categories: amortised cost; fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI); and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are classif/i.righted as either amortised cost, or held at fair value through profit or loss. Management determines the classif/i.rightcation of its financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton of the instrument or, where applicable, at the time of reclassif/i.rightcation.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets held at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nDebt instruments held at amortised cost or held at FVOCI have contractual terms that give rise to cashflows that are solely payments of princ/i.rightpal and interest (SPPI) characterist/i.rightcs. Princ/i.rightpal is the fair value of the financ/i.rightal asset at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton but this may change over the life of the instrument as amounts are repaid. Interest consists of considerat/i.righton for the time value of money, for the Credit Risk associated with the princ/i.rightpal amount outstanding during a particular period and for other basic lending risks and costs, as well as a profit margin.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cashflows have SPPI characterist/i.rightcs, the Group considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financ/i.rightal asset contains a contractual term that could change the tim/i.rightng or amount of contractual cashflows such that it would not meet this condit/i.righton. In making the assessment, the Group considers:\n\n- \u00b7 Contingent events that would change the amount and tim/i.rightng of cashflows\n- \u00b7 Leverage characterist/i.rightcs which increase the variab/i.rightlity of contractual cashflows\n- \u00b7 Prepayment and extension terms\n- \u00b7 Terms that lim/i.rightt the Group's claim to cashflows from specif/i.righted assets (e.g. non-recourse asset arrangements)\n- \u00b7 Features that modify considerat/i.righton of the time value of money - for example, period/i.rightcal reset of interest rates\n\nWhether financ/i.rightal assets are held at amortised cost or at FVOCI depends on the object/i.rightves of the business models under which the assets are held. A business model refers to how the Group manages financ/i.rightal assets to generate cashflows.\n\nThe Group makes an assessment of the object/i.rightve of a business model in which an asset is held at the ind/i.rightvidual product business line, and, where applicable, with/i.rightn business lines depending on the way the business is managed and informat/i.righton is provided to management. Factors considered include:\n\n- \u00b7 How the performance of the product business line is evaluated and reported to the Group's management\n- \u00b7 How managers of the business model are compensated, includ/i.rightng whether management is compensated based on the fair value of assets or the contractual cashflows collected\n- \u00b7 The risks that affect the performance of the business model and how those risks are managed\n- \u00b7 The frequency, volume and tim/i.rightng of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and expectations about future sales activ/i.rightty\n\nThe Group's business model assessment is as follows:\n\n| Business model                      | Business object/i.rightve                                                                                                                                   | Characterist/i.rightcs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Businesses                                                                                                                             | Products                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Hold to  collect                    | Intent is to orig/i.rightnate  financ/i.rightal assets and  hold them to maturity,  collecting the  contractual cashflows  over the term of the  instrument | \u00b7  Provid/i.rightng financ/i.rightng and  orig/i.rightnating assets to earn interest  income as primary income stream \u00b7  Performing Credit Risk  management activ/i.rightties \u00b7  Costs include funding costs,  transaction costs and impa/i.rightrment  losses                      | \u00b7  Corporate Lending \u00b7  Financ/i.rightal Markets \u00b7  Transaction Banking \u00b7  Retail Lending \u00b7  Treasury Markets  (Loans and  Borrowings) | \u00b7  Loans and advances \u00b7  Debt securit/i.rightes                                                                                                             |\n| Hold to  collect   and sell         | Business object/i.rightve met  through both hold to  collect and by selling  financ/i.rightal assets                                                        | \u00b7  Portfolios held for liqu/i.rightdity needs;  or where a certain interest yield  profile is mainta/i.rightned; or that are  normally rebalanced to achieve  matching of duration of assets                                                                                        | \u00b7  Treasury Markets                                                                                                                    | \u00b7  Derivat/i.rightves \u00b7  Debt securit/i.rightes                                                                                                             |\n| Fair value  through  profit or loss | All other business  object/i.rightves, includ/i.rightng  trading and managing  financ/i.rightal assets on a   fair value basis                              | \u00b7  Assets held for trading \u00b7  Assets that are orig/i.rightnated,  purchased, and sold for profit- taking or underwrit/i.rightng activ/i.rightty \u00b7  Performance of the portfolio is  evaluated on a fair value basis \u00b7  Income streams are from fair  value changes or trading gains | \u00b7  Financ/i.rightal Markets \u00b7  All other business lines                                                                                | \u00b7  Derivat/i.rightves \u00b7  Trading portfolios \u00b7  Financ/i.rightal Markets  reverse repos \u00b7  Financ/i.rightal Markets   (FM Bond and Loan  Syndicat/i.righton) |",

Sales of assets under a hold to collect business model can be made to manage increases in the credit risk of financ/i.rightal assets but sales for other reasons should be infrequent or ins/i.rightgnif/i.rightcant.\n\nCashflows from the sale of financ/i.rightal assets under a hold to collect and sell business model by contrast are integral to achiev/i.rightng the object/i.rightves under which a particular group of financ/i.rightal assets are managed. This may be the case where frequent sales of financ/i.rightal assets are required to manage the Group's daily liqu/i.rightdity requirements or to meet regulatory requirements to demonstrate liqu/i.rightdity of financ/i.rightal instruments. Sales of assets under hold to collect and sell business models are therefore both more frequent and more sign/i.rightficant in value than those under the hold to collect model.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as held at FVOCI\n\nNon-trading equity instruments acquired for strategic purposes rather than capital gain may be irrevocably designated at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton as held at FVOCI on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Div/i.rightdends received are recognised in profit or loss. Gains and losses aris/i.rightng from changes in the fair value of these instruments, includ/i.rightng foreign exchange gains and losses, are recognised directly in equity and are never reclassif/i.righted to profit or loss, even on derecognit/i.righton.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at  fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets which are not held at amortised cost or that are not held FVOCI are held at fair value through profit or loss. Financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at fair value through profit or loss are either mandatorily classif/i.righted fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton.\n\n## Mandatorily classif/i.righted at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes which are mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss are split between two subcategories as follows:\n\n## Trading, includ/i.rightng:\n\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held for trading, which are those acquired princ/i.rightpally for the purpose of selling in the short-term\n- \u00b7 Derivat/i.rightves\n\nNon-trading mandatorily at fair value through profit or loss, includ/i.rightng:\n\n- \u00b7 Instruments in a business which has a fair value business model (see the Group's business model assessment) which are not trading or derivat/i.rightves\n- \u00b7 Hybrid financ/i.rightal assets that contain one or more embedded derivat/i.rightves\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal assets that would otherwise be measured at amortised cost or FVOCI but which do not have SPPI characterist/i.rightcs\n- \u00b7 Equity instruments that have not been designated as held at FVOCI\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes that constitute contingent considerat/i.righton in a business combinat/i.righton.\n\n## Designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes may be designated at fair value through profit or loss  when the designat/i.righton elim/i.rightnates or sign/i.rightficantly reduces a measurement or recognit/i.righton incons/i.rightstency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes on a different basis ('accounting mismatch').\n\nFinanc/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes may also be designated at fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis or have a embedded derivat/i.rightve where the Group is not able to bifurcate and separately value the embedded derivat/i.rightve component.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost\n\nFinanc/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes that are not financ/i.rightal guarantees or loan commitments and that are not classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at fair value through profit or loss are classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost.\n\nPreference shares which carry a mandatory coupon that represents a market rate of interest at the issue date, or which are redeemable on a specif/i.rightc date or at the option of the shareholder are classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and are presented in other borrowed funds. The div/i.rightdends on these preference shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense on an amortised cost basis using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## 13. Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Group issues financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are in/i.righttially recognised at their fair value as a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity, and subsequently measured at the higher of the in/i.righttial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the princ/i.rightples of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and their expected credit loss provis/i.righton. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held.\n\n## Fair value of financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liab/i.rightlity in an orderly transaction between market partic/i.rightpants at the measurement date in the princ/i.rightpal market for the asset or liab/i.rightlity, or in the absence of a princ/i.rightpal market, the most advantageous market to which the Group has access at the date. The fair value of a liab/i.rightlity includes the risk that the bank will not be able to honour its obligat/i.rightons.\n\nThe fair value of financ/i.rightal instruments is generally measured on the basis of the ind/i.rightvidual financ/i.rightal instrument. However, when a group of financ/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes is managed on the basis of its net exposure to either Market Risk or Credit Risk, the fair value of the group of financ/i.rightal instruments is measured on a net basis.\n\nThe fair values of quoted financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liab/i.rightlity take place with suffic/i.rightent frequency and volume to provide pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton on an ongoing basis. If the market for a financ/i.rightal instrument, and for unlisted securit/i.rightes, is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.\n\n## Init/i.rightal recognit/i.righton\n\nPurchases and sales of financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at fair value through profit or loss, and debt securit/i.rightes classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal assets held at fair value through other comprehensive income are in/i.righttially recognised on the trade date (the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset). Loans and advances and other financ/i.rightal assets held at amortised cost are recognised on the settlement date (the date on which cash is advanced to the borrowers).\n\nAll financ/i.rightal instruments are in/i.righttially recognised at fair value, which is normally the transaction price, plus directly attributable transaction costs for financ/i.rightal assets which are not subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the in/i.righttial fair value may be based on a valuation technique which may lead to the recognit/i.righton of profits or losses at the time of in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton. However, these profits or losses can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based solely on observable market data. In those cases where the in/i.righttially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses unobservable inputs, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immed/i.rightately in the income statement but is amortised or released to the income statement as the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated.\n\n## Subsequent measurement\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at amortised cost are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method (see Interest income and expense). Foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\nWhere a financ/i.rightal instrument carried at amortised cost is the hedged item in a qualify/i.rightng fair value hedge relationsh/i.rightp, its carrying value is adjusted by the fair value gain or loss attributable to the hedged risk.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets held at FVOCI\n\nDebt instruments held at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value, with all unrealised gains and losses aris/i.rightng from changes in fair value (includ/i.rightng any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. Foreign exchange gains and losses on the amortised cost are recognised in income. Changes in expected credit losses are recognised in the profit or loss and are accumulated in equity. On derecognit/i.righton, the cumulative fair value gains or losses, net of the cumulative expected credit loss reserve, are transferred to the profit or loss.\n\nEquity investments designated at FVOCI are subsequently carried at fair value with all unrealised gains and losses aris/i.rightng from changes in fair value (includ/i.rightng any related foreign exchange gains or losses) recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in a separate component of equity. On derecognit/i.righton, the cumulative reserve is transferred to retained earnings and is not recycled to profit or loss.\n\n## Financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss and financ/i.rightal assets designated at fair value through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fair value, with gains and losses aris/i.rightng from changes in fair value, includ/i.rightng contractual interest income or expense, recorded in the net trading income line in the profit or loss unless the instrument is part of a cashflow hedging relationsh/i.rightp.",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinanc/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss are held at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the net trading income line in the profit or loss, other than that attributable to changes in Credit Risk. Fair value changes attributable to Credit Risk are recognised in other comprehensive income and recorded in a separate category of reserves, unless this is expected to create or enlarge an accounting mismatch, in which case the entire change in fair value of the financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity designated at fair value through profit or loss is recognised in profit or loss.\n\n## Derecognit/i.righton of financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cashflows from the financ/i.rightal assets have expired, or where the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership. If substantially all the risks and rewards have been neither retained nor transferred and the Group has retained control, the assets continue to be recognised to the extent of the Group's continu/i.rightng involvement.\n\nWhere financ/i.rightal assets have been modif/i.righted, the modif/i.righted terms are assessed on a qualitat/i.rightve and quantitat/i.rightve basis to determine whether a fundamental change in the nature of the instrument has occurred, such as whether the derecognit/i.righton of the pre-exist/i.rightng instrument and the recognit/i.righton of a new instrument is appropriate.\n\nOn derecognit/i.righton of a financ/i.rightal asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of the considerat/i.righton received (includ/i.rightng any new asset obtained less any new liab/i.rightlity assumed) and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in profit or loss, except for equity instruments elected FVOCI (see above) and cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the Credit Risk of a liab/i.rightlity that are held in other comprehensive income.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are derecognised when they are extingu/i.rightshed. A financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity is extingu/i.rightshed when the obligat/i.righton is discharged, cancelled or expires and this is evaluated both qualitat/i.rightvely and quantitat/i.rightvely. However, where a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity has been modif/i.righted, it is derecognised if the difference between the modif/i.righted cashflows and the orig/i.rightnal cashflows is more than 10 per cent; or if less than 10 per cent, the Group will perform a qualitat/i.rightve assessment to determine whether the terms of the two instruments are substantially different.\n\nIf the Group purchases its own debt, it is derecognised and the difference between the carrying amount of the liab/i.rightlity and the considerat/i.righton paid is included in Other income except for the cumulative fair value adjustments attributable to the Credit Risk of a liab/i.rightlity that are held in other comprehensive income which are never recycled to the profit or loss.\n\n## Modif/i.righted financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes whose orig/i.rightnal contractual terms have been modif/i.righted, includ/i.rightng those loans subject to forbearance strategies, are considered to be modif/i.righted instruments. Modif/i.rightcations may include changes to the tenor, cashflows and or interest rates, among other factors.\n\nWhere derecognit/i.righton of financ/i.rightal assets is appropriate (see Derecognit/i.righton), the newly recognised residual loans are assessed to determine whether the assets should be classif/i.righted as purchased or orig/i.rightnated Credit-Impaired assets (POCI).\n\nWhere derecognit/i.righton is not appropriate, the gross carrying amount of the applicable instruments is recalculated as the present value of the renegotiated or modif/i.righted contractual cashflows discounted at the orig/i.rightnal effective interest rate (or credit-adjusted effective interest rate for POCI financ/i.rightal assets). The difference between the recalculated values and the pre-modif/i.righted gross carrying values of the instruments are recorded as a modif/i.rightcation gain or loss in the profit or loss.\n\nGains and losses aris/i.rightng from modif/i.rightcations for credit reasons are recorded as part of 'Credit impa/i.rightrment' (see Credit Impairment policy). Modif/i.rightcation gains and losses aris/i.rightng for non-credit reasons are recognised either as part of Credit impa/i.rightrment or with/i.rightn income, depending on whether there has been a change in the Credit Risk on the financ/i.rightal asset subsequent to the modif/i.rightcation. Modif/i.rightcation gains and losses aris/i.rightng on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are recognised with/i.rightn income. The movements in the applicable expected credit loss loan posit/i.rightons are disclosed in further detail in Risk review.\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9, changes to the basis for determin/i.rightng contractual cashflows as a direct result of interest rate benchmark reform are treated as changes to a floating interest rate to that instrument, provided that the transit/i.righton from the Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) benchmark rate to the alternative riskfree rate (RFR) takes place on an economically equivalent basis. Where the instrument is measured at amortised cost or FVOCI, this results in a change in the instrument's effective interest rate, with no change in the amortised cost value of the instrument. If the change to the instrument does not meet these criter/i.righta, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the changes are substantial and, if they are, the financ/i.rightal instrument is derecognised and a new financ/i.rightal instrument is recognised. If the changes are not substantial, the Group adjusts the gross carrying amount of the financ/i.rightal instrument by the present value of the changes not covered by the practical expedient, discounted using the revised effective interest rate.",

Reclassif/i.rightcations of financ/i.rightal assets are made when, and only when, the business model for those assets changes. Such changes are expected to be infrequent and arise as a result of sign/i.rightficant external or internal changes, such as the terminat/i.righton of a line of business or the purchase of a subsid/i.rightary whose business model is to realise the value of pre-exist/i.rightng held for trading financ/i.rightal assets through a hold to collect model.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets are reclassif/i.righted at their fair value on the date of reclassif/i.rightcation and previously recognised gains and losses are not restated.

In addit/i.righton, the related cumulative expected credit losses held with/i.rightn other comprehensive income are reversed against the gross carrying value of the reclassif/i.righted assets at the date of reclassif/i.rightcation.\n\n## Reclassif/i.righted from fair value through profit or loss\n\nWhere financ/i.rightal assets held at fair value through profit or loss are reclassif/i.righted to financ/i.rightal assets held at air value through other comprehensive income or financ/i.rightal assets held at amortised cost, the fair value at the date of reclassif/i.rightcation is used to determine the effective interest rate on the financ/i.rightal asset going forward.

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn 2017, the Financ/i.rightal Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it had reached an agreement with LIBOR panel banks to contribute to LIBOR until the end of 2021, after which there would be a transit/i.righton from LIBORs to risk-free rates (RFRs). Since then, there have been further updates, particularly with respect to the cessation date for certain USD LIBOR tenors being deferred from 31 December 2021 to 30 June 2023.\n\n## How the Group is managing the transit/i.righton to alternative benchmark rates\n\nIn 2018, the Group established its IBOR Transit/i.righton Programme, with Senior Manager oversight from the Group Chief Operating Officer, to manage the transit/i.righton away from LIBOR. The Programme's strategic bank-wide approach aims to support clients throughout the transit/i.righton, while ensuring key risks and issues are ident/i.rightfied and effectively managed. The Programme is governed by a princ/i.rightpal Programme Steering Committee that oversees 16 workstreams aligned to the Group's businesses and functions. With/i.rightn the Programme, separate committee meetings are held for each workstream, with all workstreams having dedicated accountable executives.\n\nAddit/i.rightonal governance is supported by regular updates provided to senior risk committees, includ/i.rightng the Group Risk Committee, Board Risk Committee and the Corporate, Commercial and Institut/i.rightonal Banking Risk Committee.\n\nFrom an industry and regulatory perspective, the Group actively partic/i.rightpates in and contributes to RFR working groups, industry associat/i.rightons and business forums that focus on different aspects of the transit/i.righton. The Group monitors the developments at these forums and reflects, then aligns sign/i.rightficant decis/i.rightons into its broader transit/i.righton plans.\n\n## Progress during 2021\n\nSupported by a number of system enhancements, the Group has successfully enabled the transit/i.righton to RFR products, with end-to-end capabil/i.rightties developed across a full suite of derivat/i.rightve and cash products. The Group mainta/i.rightned full adherence to all the inter/i.rightm GBP LIBOR cessation milestones set by the Bank of England's Working Group on Sterling Risk-Free Reference Rates. Activ/i.rightty in products referencing RFRs continued to grow throughout the year.\n\nThe Group has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivat/i.rightves Associat/i.righton (ISDA) 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol for all its trading entit/i.rightes and engaged clients that had not adhered to negotiate remediat/i.righton of non-USD LIBOR contracts by 31 December 2021. The conversion events at the London Clearing House were successfully completed for cleared derivat/i.rightves. At the end of 2021, remediat/i.righton of all cleared and uncleared derivat/i.rightve contracts referencing ceasing LIBORs was complete.\n\nClients with legacy non-USD LIBOR loans were engaged to remediate their contracts via active conversions to alternative rates, fallbacks, or other suitable transit/i.righton mechanisms. At end of 2021, all negotiat/i.rightons for drawn non-USD LIBOR exposures were concluded, and all but four loans had their documentation completed (it is expected the documentation will be fin/i.rightshed prior to the respective next fix/i.rightng dates).\n\nThe Group is well-posit/i.rightoned to support the transit/i.righton to Secured Overnight Financ/i.rightng Rate (SOFR) for the USD LIBOR transit/i.righton. The Group is operationally ready and is actively offering SOFR products, in line with the regulatory prohib/i.righttions on new USD LIBOR financ/i.rightal instruments. Preparations are also underway to ensure that the Group is ready to remediate legacy USD LIBOR transactions. Over the course of 2021, the Group made considerable progress in automating IBOR-related data, and increas/i.rightng process automation remains a prior/i.rightty for 2022.\n\nFrontline and client engagement, includ/i.rightng internal and client communicat/i.rightons, frontline train/i.rightng, and client webinars, were a key feature of the Programme throughout 2021. This allowed for a smooth client experience during the transit/i.righton of non-USD LIBOR to RFRs, and this approach will continue in 2022 for USD LIBOR. Following an in/i.righttial USD LIBOR-focused client outreach and internal communicat/i.rightons in early December 2021, the Group has already started engaging clients to ascertain their level of readiness, and to secure an ind/i.rightcative timel/i.rightne for remediat/i.righton activ/i.rightties.\n\n## Risks which the Group is exposed to due to IBOR transit/i.righton\n\nThe Group has largely mit/i.rightgated all material adverse outcomes associated with the cessation of LIBOR benchmarks, and these have not required a change to the Group's risk management strategy. However, the Group will continue to focus on the remediat/i.righton required for other benchmarks, and will continue to monitor and manage the inherent risks of the transit/i.righton, with particular attention being paid to the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal Risk: LIBOR transit/i.righton introduces sign/i.rightficant legal risks and the Group has taken action to mit/i.rightgate them where possible. These include risks around contracts that reference USD LIBOR and other LIBORs such as GBP and JPY. Steps have been taken to either insert robust fallbacks or actively convert transactions from the relevant LIBOR to the new RFR-based options\n- \u00b7 Conduct Risk: The Group considers Conduct Risk to be a sign/i.rightficant area of non-financ/i.rightal risk management throughout the transit/i.righton. Our risk appetite statement on Conduct Risk strives to mainta/i.rightn appropriate outcomes by continuously demonstrating that we are 'Doing the Right Thing' in the way we do business. Accordingly, we recognise that the ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and mit/i.rightgation of conduct risks aris/i.rightng in respect of the transit/i.righton are fundamental to the successful transit/i.righton to new RFR-based rates by 30 June 2023. The Group has therefore taken actions in this regard as an integral part of its IBOR Transit/i.righton Programme, includ/i.rightng an extensive outreach programme",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n- \u00b7 Operational Risk: The Group has recognised the importance of the ongoing ident/i.rightficat/i.righton and management of Operational Risk as a result of LIBOR transit/i.righton. The Programme has adopted the Group's exist/i.rightng Operational Risk Framework in its approach to ident/i.rightfying, quantify/i.rightng, and mit/i.rightgating the impact of operational risks resulting from the transit/i.righton\n- \u00b7 Market Risk: As trades are transit/i.rightoned from IBOR to RFR, the business-as-usual metrics, lim/i.rightt structure and controls will continue to apply. Lim/i.rightts for value at risk and Market Risk sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes are in accordance with the Group Risk Appetite Statement. New lim/i.rightts will be set following engagement with the business, to consider client demand and market liqu/i.rightdity in RFR-linked products, as well as the regulatory expectations and inter/i.rightm milestones agreed by the industry\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal and Credit Risk: As part of the 'Data collection on exposures' exercise undertaken for the Prudential Regulation Authority and FCA, the Group set out its view of the impact of LIBOR transit/i.righton on its Financ/i.rightal Risk profile, includ/i.rightng its Credit Risk and funding profile. At present, the Group has yet to see any material change to any of these categories. However, all of these risks will continue to be monitored as part of the Programme across business and functional workstreams\n- \u00b7 Accounting Risk: The Group has ident/i.rightfied the financ/i.rightal instruments that may be affected by accounting issues such as accounting for contractual changes due to IBOR reform, fair value measurement and hedge accounting. We continue to monitor and contribute to industry developments on tax and accounting changes\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the Group had the following notional princ/i.rightpal exposures to interest rate benchmarks that are expected to be subject to interest rate benchmark reform. The Group has excluded financ/i.rightal instruments linked to USD LIBOR maturing before 30 June 2023 as it is assumed these will not require reform due to USD LIBOR no longer being published beyond this date. The Group has also excluded $2.7 bill/i.righton of exposures that transit/i.rightoned under fallback clauses immed/i.rightately after 31 December 2021.\n\n| IBOR exposures by benchmark   as of 31 December 2021                              | USD LIBOR  $mill/i.righton   | GBP LIBOR  $mill/i.righton   | SGD SOR  $mill/i.righton   | THB FIX  $mill/i.righton   | Other IBOR  $mill/i.righton   | Total IBOR  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Assets                                                                            |                              |                              |                            |                            |                               |                               |\n| Loans and advances to banks                                                       | 552                          | -

Such arrangements include master netting arrangements for derivat/i.rightves and global master repurchase agreements for repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. These agreements generally allow that all outstanding transactions with a particular counterparty can be offset, but only in the event of default or other predetermined events.\n\nIn addit/i.righton, the Group also receives and pledges readily realisable collateral for derivat/i.rightve transactions to cover net exposure in the event of a default. Under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, the Group pledges (legally sells) and obtains (legally purchases) respectively, highly liqu/i.rightd assets which can be sold in the event of a default.\n\nThe following tables set out the impact of netting on the balance sheet. This comprises derivat/i.rightve transactions settled through an enforceable netting agreement where we have the intent and abil/i.rightty to settle net and which are offset on the balance sheet.\n\n|                                                                         | 2021                                                          | 2021                                          | 2021                                             | 2021                                             | 2021                                             | 2021                        |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                                                                         | Gross amounts                                                 | Impact of                                     | Net amounts   of financ/i.rightal  instruments   | Related amount not offset   in the balance sheet | Related amount not offset   in the balance sheet |                             |\n|                                                                         | of recognised  financ/i.rightal  instruments  $mill/i.righton | offset in the  balance sheet  $mill/i.righton | presented in the  balance sheet  $mill/i.righton | Financ/i.rightal  instruments  $mill/i.righton   | Financ/i.rightal  collateral  $mill/i.righton    | Net amount  $mill/i.righton |\n| Assets                                                                  |                                                               |                                               |                                                  |                                                  |                                                  |                             |\n| Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments                          | 79,043                                                        | (26,598)                                      | 52,445                                           | (39,502)                                         | (8,092)                                          | 4,851                       |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements and  other sim/i.rightlar secured lending | 95,845                                                        | ( 7, 42 6)                                    | 88,419                                           | -                                                | (88,419)                                         | -                           |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                     | 174,888                                                       | (34,024)                                      | 140,864                                          | (39,502)                                         | (96,511)                                         | 4,851                       |\n| Liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes                                               |                                                               |                                               |                                                  |                                                  |                                                  |                             |\n| Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments                          | 79,997                                                        | (26,598)                                      | 53,399                                           | (39,502)                                         | (9,217)                                          | 4,680                       |\n| Repurchase agreements and other   sim/i.rightlar secured borrowing      | 73,074                                                        | ( 7, 42 6)                                    | 65,648                                           | -                                                | (65,648)                                         | -                           |\n| At 31 December 2021                                                     | 153,071                                                       | (34,024)                                      | 119,047                                          | (39,502)                                         | (74,865)                                         | 4,680                       |",

Further details of the Group's own credit adjustment (OCA) valuation technique is described later in this Note.\n\n## Valuation of financ/i.rightal instruments\n\nThe fair values of quoted financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes in active markets are based on current prices. A market is regarded as active if transactions for the asset or liab/i.rightlity take place with suffic/i.rightent frequency and volume to provide pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton on an ongoing basis. Wherever possible, fair values have been calculated using unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for ident/i.rightcal instruments held by the Group. Where quoted market prices are not available, or are unreliable because of poor liqu/i.rightdity, fair values have been determined using valuation techniques which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non market observable inputs. Valuation techniques used include discounted cashflow analysis and pric/i.rightng models and, where appropriate, comparison with instruments that have characterist/i.rightcs sim/i.rightlar to those of the instruments held by the Group.\n\nThe Valuation Methodology function is responsible for independent price verif/i.rightcation, oversight of fair value and appropriate value adjustments and escalation of valuation issues. Independent price verif/i.rightcation is the process of determin/i.rightng that the valuations incorporated into the financ/i.rightal statements are validated independent of the business area responsible for the product. The Valuation Methodology function has oversight of the fair value adjustments to ensure that the financ/i.rightal instruments are priced to exit. These are key controls in ensuring the material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financ/i.rightal statements. The market data used for price verif/i.rightcation (PV) may include data sourced from recent trade data involv/i.rightng external counterparties or third parties such as Bloomberg, Reuters, brokers and consensus pric/i.rightng providers. Valuation Methodology perform an ongoing review of the market data sources that are used as part of the PV and fair value processes which are formally documented on a semi-annual basis, detail/i.rightng the suitab/i.rightlity of the market data used for price testing. PV uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market the instruments trade in. To determine the quality of the market data inputs, factors such as independence, relevance, reliab/i.rightlity, availab/i.rightlity of multiple data sources and methodology employed by the pric/i.rightng provider are taken into considerat/i.righton.\n\nThe Valuation and Benchmarks Committee (VBC) is the valuation governance forum consist/i.rightng of representatives from Group Market Risk, Product Control, Valuation Methodology and the business, which meets monthly to discuss and approve the independent valuations of the inventory. For Princ/i.rightpal Finance, the Investment Committee meeting is held on a quarterly basis to review investments and valuations.",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group evaluates the sign/i.rightficance of financ/i.rightal instruments and material accuracy of the valuations incorporated in the financ/i.rightal statements as they involve a high degree of judgement and estimat/i.righton uncertainty in determin/i.rightng the carrying values of financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes at the balance sheet date.\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value of financ/i.rightal instruments is determined using valuation techniques and estimates (see below) which, to the extent possible, use market observable inputs, but in some cases use non-market observable inputs. Changes in the observabil/i.rightty of sign/i.rightficant valuation inputs can materially affect the fair values of financ/i.rightal instruments\n- \u00b7 When establish/i.rightng the exit price of a financ/i.rightal instrument using a valuation technique, the Group estimates valuation adjustments in determin/i.rightng the fair value (page 351)\n- \u00b7 In determin/i.rightng the valuation of financ/i.rightal instruments, the Group makes judgements on the amounts reserved to cater for model and valuation risks, which cover both Level 2 and Level 3 assets, and the sign/i.rightficant valuation judgements in respect of Level 3 instruments (page 353)\n- \u00b7 Where the estimated measurement of fair value is more judgemental in respect of Level 3 assets, these are valued based on models that use a sign/i.rightficant degree of non-market-based unobservable inputs\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nRefer to the fair value hierarchy explanation - Level 1, 2 and 3 (page 353)\n\n- \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value\n- -Debt securit/i.rightes - asset-backed securit/i.rightes: Asset-backed securit/i.rightes are valued based on external prices obtained from consensus pric/i.rightng providers, broker quotes, recent trades, arrangers' quotes, etc. Where an observable price is available for a given security, it is classif/i.righted as Level 2. In instances where third-party prices are not available or reliable, the security is classif/i.righted as Level 3. The fair value of Level 3 securit/i.rightes is estimated using market standard cashflow models with input parameter assumptions, which include prepayment speeds, default rates, discount margins derived from comparable securit/i.rightes with sim/i.rightlar vintage, collateral type, and credit ratings\n- -Debt securit/i.rightes in issue: These debt securit/i.rightes relate to structured notes issued by the Group. Where independent market data is available through pric/i.rightng vendors and broker sources, these posit/i.rightons are classif/i.righted as Level 2. Where such liqu/i.rightd external prices are not available, valuations of these debt securit/i.rightes are impl/i.righted using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads, and are classif/i.righted as Level 3. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxies from comparable issuers or assets\n- -Derivat/i.rightves: Derivat/i.rightve products are classif/i.righted as Level 2 if the valuation of the product is based upon input parameters which are observable from independent and reliable market data sources. Derivat/i.rightve products are classif/i.righted as Level 3 if there are sign/i.rightficant valuation input parameters which are unobservable in the market, such as products where the performance is linked to more than one underlying variable. Examples are foreign exchange basket options, equity options based on the performance of two or more underlying ind/i.rightces and interest rate products with quanto payouts. In most cases these unobservable correlation parameters cannot be impl/i.righted from the market, and methods such as histor/i.rightcal analysis and comparison with histor/i.rightcal levels or other benchmark data must be employed\n- -Equity shares - private equity: The major/i.rightty of private equity unlisted investments are valued based on earning multiples Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or enterprise value to earnings before income tax, depreciat/i.righton and amortisat/i.righton (EV/EBITDA) ratios - of comparable listed companies. The two primary inputs for the valuation of these investments are the actual or forecast earnings of the investee companies and earning multiples for the comparable listed companies. To ensure comparabil/i.rightty between these unquoted investments and the comparable listed companies, appropriate adjustments are also applied (for example, liqu/i.rightdity and size) in the valuation. In circumstances where an investment does not have direct comparables, or where the multiples for the comparable companies cannot be sourced from reliable external sources, alternative valuation techniques (for example, discounted cashflow models), which use predominantly unobservable inputs or Level 3 inputs, may be applied. Even though earning multiples for the comparable listed companies can be sourced from third-party sources (for example, Bloomberg), and those inputs can be deemed Level 2 inputs, all unlisted investments (excluding those where observable inputs are available, for example, over-the-counter (OTC) prices) are classif/i.righted as Level 3 on the basis that the valuation methods involve judgements ranging from determin/i.rightng comparable companies to discount rates where the discounted cashflow method is applied\n- -Loans and advances: These primar/i.rightly include loans in the FM Bond and Loan Syndicat/i.righton business which were not syndicated as of the balance sheet date and other financ/i.rightng transactions with/i.rightn Financ/i.rightal Markets, and loans and advances includ/i.rightng reverse repurchase agreements that do not have SPPI cashflows or are managed on a fair value basis. These loans are generally bilateral in nature and, where available, their valuation is based on observable clean sales transactions prices or market observable spreads. If observable credit spreads are not available, proxy spreads based on comparable loans with sim/i.rightlar credit grade, sector and region, are used. Where observable credit spreads and market standard proxy methods are available, these loans are classif/i.righted as Level 2. Where there are no recent transactions or comparable loans, these loans are classif/i.righted as Level 3",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n- -Other debt securit/i.rightes: These debt securit/i.rightes include convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit and structured notes. Where quoted prices are available through pric/i.rightng vendors, brokers or observable trading activ/i.rightties from liqu/i.rightd markets, these are classif/i.righted as Level 2 and valued using such quotes. Where there are sign/i.rightficant valuation inputs which are unobservable in the market, due to ill/i.rightquid trading or the complexity of the product, these are classif/i.righted as Level 3. The valuations of these debt securit/i.rightes are impl/i.righted using input parameters such as bond spreads and credit spreads. These input parameters are determined with reference to the same issuer (if available) or proxied from comparable issuers or assets.\n\n## \u00b7 Financ/i.rightal instruments held at amortised cost\n\nThe following sets out the Group's basis for establish/i.rightng fair values of amortised cost financ/i.rightal instruments and their classif/i.rightcation between Levels 1, 2 and 3. As certain categories of financ/i.rightal instruments are not actively traded, there is a sign/i.rightficant level of management judgement involved in calculating the fair values:\n\n- -Cash and balances at central banks: The fair value of cash and balances at central banks is their carrying amounts\n- -Debt securit/i.rightes in issue, subordinated liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and other borrowed funds: The aggregate fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices. For those notes where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cashflow model is used based on a current market related yield curve appropriate for the remain/i.rightng term to maturity\n- -Deposits and borrowings: The estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is the amount repayable on demand. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings without quoted market prices is based on discounted cashflows using the prevail/i.rightng market rates for debts with a sim/i.rightlar Credit Risk and remain/i.rightng maturity\n- -Investment securit/i.rightes: For investment securit/i.rightes that do not have directly observable market values, the Group util/i.rightses a number of valuation techniques to determine fair value. Where available, securit/i.rightes are valued using input proxies from the same or closely related underlying (for example, bond spreads from the same or closely related issuer) or input proxies from a different underlying (for example, a sim/i.rightlar bond but using spreads for a particular sector and rating). Certain instruments cannot be proxies as set out above, and in such cases the posit/i.rightons are valued using non-market observable inputs. This includes those instruments held at amortised cost and predominantly relates to asset-backed securit/i.rightes. The fair value for such instruments is usually proxies from internal assessments of the underlying cashflows\n- -Loans and advances to banks and customers: For loans and advances to banks, the fair value of floating rate placements and overnight deposits is their carrying amounts. The estimated fair value of fixed interest-bearing deposits is based on discounted cashflows using the prevail/i.rightng money market rates for debts with a sim/i.rightlar Credit Risk and remain/i.rightng maturity. The Group's loans and advances to customers' portfolio is well divers/i.rightfied by geography and industry. Approximately a quarter of the portfolio re-prices with/i.rightn one month, and approximately half re-prices with/i.rightn 12 months. Loans and advances are presented net of provis/i.rightons for impa/i.rightrment. The fair value of loans and advances to customers with a residual maturity of less than one year generally approximates the carrying value. The estimated fair value of loans and advances with a residual maturity of more than one year represents the discounted amount of future cashflows expected to be received, includ/i.rightng assumptions relating to prepayment rates and Credit Risk. Expected cash flows are discounted at current market rates to determine fair value. The Group has a wide range of ind/i.rightvidual instruments with/i.rightn its loans and advances portfolio and as a result provid/i.rightng quantif/i.rightcation of the key assumptions used to value such instruments is impract/i.rightcal\n- -Other assets: Other assets comprise primar/i.rightly of cash collateral and trades pending settlement. The carrying amount of these financ/i.rightal instruments is considered to be a reasonable approximat/i.righton of fair value as they are either short-term in nature or re-price to current market rates frequently\n\n## Fair value adjustments\n\nWhen establish/i.rightng the exit price of a financ/i.rightal instrument using a valuation technique, the Group considers adjustments to the modelled price which market partic/i.rightpants would make when pric/i.rightng that instrument. The main valuation adjustments (described further below) in determin/i.rightng fair value for financ/i.rightal assets and financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are as follows:\n\n|                                | 01.01.21  $mill/i.righton   | Movement  during the year  $mill/i.righton   | 31.12.21  $mill/i.righton   | 01.01.20  $mill/i.righton   | Movement  during the year  $mill/i.righton   | 31.12.20  $mill/i.righton   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Bid-offer valuation adjustment | 103                         | (2)                                          | 101                         | 79                          | 24                                           | 103                         |\n| Credit valuation adjustment    | 189                         | (24)                                         | 165                         | 136                         | 53                                           | 189                         |\n| Debit valuation adjustment     | (55)                        | (15)                                         | (70)                        | (43)                        | (12)                                         | (55)                        |\n| Model valuation adjustment     | 5                           | -                                            | 5                           | 7                           | (2)                                          | 5                           |\n| Funding valuation adjustment   | 5                           | (5)                                          | -                           | 26                          | (21)                                         | 5                           |\n| Other fair value adjustments   | 32                          | (12)                                         | 20                          | 45                          | (13)                                         | 32                          |\n| Total                          | 279                         | (58)                                         | 221                         | 250                         | 29                                           | 279                         |\n| Income deferrals               |                             |                                              |                             |                             |                                              |                             |\n| Day 1 and other deferrals      | 138                         | 9                                            | 147                         | 103                         | 35                                           | 138                         |\n| Total                          | 138                         | 9                                            | 147                         | 103                         | 35                                           | 138                         |\n\nNote: Bracket represents an asset and credit to the income statement",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n- \u00b7 Bid-offer valuation adjustment: Generally, market parameters are marked on a mid-market basis in the revaluation systems, and a bid-offer valuation adjustment is required to quantify the expected cost of neutralis/i.rightng the business' posit/i.rightons through dealing away in the market, thereby bring/i.rightng long posit/i.rightons to bid and short posit/i.rightons to offer. The methodology to calculate the bid-offer adjustment for a derivat/i.rightve portfolio involves netting between long and short posit/i.rightons and the grouping of risk by strike and tenor based on the hedging strategy where long posit/i.rightons are marked to bid and short posit/i.rightons marked to offer in the systems\n- \u00b7 Credit valuation adjustment (CVA): The Group accounts for CVA against the fair value of derivat/i.rightve products. CVA is an adjustment to the fair value of the transactions to reflect the possib/i.rightlity that our counterparties may default and we may not receive the full market value of the outstanding transactions. It represents an estimate of the adjustment a market partic/i.rightpant would include when deriv/i.rightng a purchase price to acquire our exposures. CVA is calculated for each subsid/i.rightary, and with/i.rightn each entity for each counterparty to which the entity has exposure and takes account of any collateral we may hold. The Group calculates the CVA by using estimates of future posit/i.rightve exposure, market-impl/i.righted probabil/i.rightty of default (PD) and recovery rates. Where market-impl/i.righted data is not readily available, we use market-based proxies to estimate the PD. Wrongway risk occurs when the exposure to a counterparty is adversely correlated with the credit quality of that counterparty, and the Group has implemented a model to capture this impact for key wrong-way exposures. The Group also captures the uncertaint/i.rightes associated with wrong-way risk in the Group's Prudential Valuation Adjustments framework\n- \u00b7 Debit valuation adjustment (DVA): The Group calculates DVA adjustments on its derivat/i.rightve liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes to reflect changes in its own credit standing. The Group's DVA adjustments will increase if its credit standing worsens and conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. For derivat/i.rightve liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, a DVA adjustment is determined by applying the Group's probabil/i.rightty of default to the Group's negative expected exposure against the counterparty. The Group's probabil/i.rightty of default and loss expected in the event of default is derived based on bond and credit default swap (CDS) spreads associated with the Group's issuances and market standard recovery levels. The expected exposure is modelled based on the simulat/i.righton of the underlying risk factors over the expected life of the deal. This simulat/i.righton methodology incorporates the collateral posted by the Group and the effects of master netting agreements\n- \u00b7 Model valuation adjustment: Valuation models may have pric/i.rightng defic/i.rightencies or lim/i.righttations that require a valuation adjustment. These pric/i.rightng defic/i.rightencies or lim/i.righttations arise due to the choice, implementat/i.righton and calibrat/i.righton of the pric/i.rightng model\n- \u00b7 Funding valuation adjustment (FVA): The Group makes FVA adjustment against derivat/i.rightve products. FVA reflects an estimate of the adjustment to its fair value that a market partic/i.rightpant would make to incorporate funding costs or benefits that could arise in relation to the exposure. FVA is calculated by determin/i.rightng the net expected exposure at a counterparty level and then applying a funding rate to those exposures that reflect the market cost of funding. The FVA for uncollateralised (includ/i.rightng partially collateralised) derivat/i.rightves incorporates the estimated present value of the market funding cost or benefit associated with funding these transactions\n- \u00b7 Other fair value adjustments: The Group calculates the fair value on the interest rate callable products by calibrat/i.rightng to a set of market prices with differ/i.rightng maturity, expiry and strike of the trades\n- \u00b7 Day one and other deferrals: In certain circumstances the in/i.righttial fair value is based on a valuation technique which differs to the transaction price at the time of in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton. However, these gains can only be recognised when the valuation technique used is based primar/i.rightly on observable market data. In those cases where the in/i.righttially recognised fair value is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, the difference between the transaction price and the valuation model is not recognised immed/i.rightately in the income statement. The difference is amortised to the income statement until the inputs become observable, or the transaction matures or is terminated. Other deferrals primar/i.rightly represent adjustments taken to reflect the specif/i.rightc terms and condit/i.rightons of certain derivat/i.rightve contracts which affect the terminat/i.righton value at the measurement date\n\nIn addit/i.righton, the Group calculates own credit adjustment (OCA) on its issued debt designated at fair value, includ/i.rightng structured notes, in order to reflect changes in its own credit standing. Own issued note liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are discounted util/i.rightsing spreads as at the measurement date. These spreads consist of a market level of funding component and an id/i.rightosyncratic own credit component. Under IFRS 9 the change in the OCA component is reported under other comprehensive income. The Group's OCA reserve will increase if its credit standing worsens and, conversely, decrease if its credit standing improves. The Group's OCA reserve will reverse over time as its liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes mature. The OCA at 31 December 2021 is a gain of $3 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $43 mill/i.righton loss).\n\n## Fair value hierarchy - financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value\n\nAssets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes carried at fair value, or for which fair values are disclosed, have been classif/i.righted into three levels according to the observabil/i.rightty of the sign/i.rightficant inputs used to determine the fair values. Changes in the observabil/i.rightty of sign/i.rightficant valuation inputs during the reporting period may result in a transfer of assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes with/i.rightn the fair value hierarchy. The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy when there is a sign/i.rightficant change in either its princ/i.rightpal market or the level of observabil/i.rightty of the inputs to the valuation techniques at the end of the reporting period.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1: Fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for ident/i.rightcal assets or liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n- \u00b7 Level 2: Fair value measurements are those with quoted prices for sim/i.rightlar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for ident/i.rightcal or sim/i.rightlar instruments in inact/i.rightve markets and financ/i.rightal instruments valued using models where all sign/i.rightficant inputs are observable\n- \u00b7 Level 3: Fair value measurements are those where inputs which could have a sign/i.rightficant effect on the instrument's valuation are not based on observable market data",

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Level 3 Summary and sign/i.rightficant unobservable inputs continued\n\nThe following section describes the sign/i.rightficant unobservable inputs ident/i.rightfied in the valuation technique table:\n\n- \u00b7 Comparable price/yield is a valuation methodology in which the price of a comparable instrument is used to estimate the fair value where there are no direct observable prices. Yield is the interest rate that is used to discount the future cashflows in a discounted cashflow model. Valuation using comparable instruments can be done by calculating an impl/i.righted yield (or spread over a liqu/i.rightd benchmark) from the price of a comparable instrument, then adjust/i.rightng that yield (or spread) to derive a value for the instrument. The adjustment should account for relevant differences in the financ/i.rightal instruments such as maturity and/or credit quality. Alternatively, a price-to-price basis can be assumed between the comparable instrument and the instrument being valued in order to establish the value of the instrument (for example, deriv/i.rightng a fair value for a jun/i.rightor unsecured bond from the price of a senior secured bond). An increase in price, in isolat/i.righton, would result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the asset. An increase in yield, in isolat/i.righton, would result in an unfavourable movement in the fair value of the asset\n- \u00b7 Correlation is the measure of how movement in one variable influences the movement in another variable. An equity correlation is the correlation between two equity instruments, while an interest rate correlation refers to the correlation between two swap rates\n- \u00b7 Credit spread represents the addit/i.rightonal yield that a market partic/i.rightpant would demand for taking exposure to the Credit Risk of an instrument\n- \u00b7 Discount rate refers to the rate of return used to convert expected cash flows into present value\n- \u00b7 Equity-FX correlation is the correlation between equity instrument and foreign exchange instrument\n- \u00b7 EV/EBITDA multiple is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciat/i.righton and Amortisat/i.righton (EBITDA). EV is the aggregate market capital/i.rightsation and debt minus the cash and cash equivalents. An increase in EV/EBITDA multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 EV/Revenue multiple is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Revenue. An increase in EV/Revenue multiple will result in a favourable movement in the fair value of the unlisted firm\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange curves is the term structure for forward rates and swap rates between currency pairs over a specif/i.righted period\n- \u00b7 Net asset value (NAV) is the value of an entity's assets after deducting any liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n- \u00b7 Interest rate curves is the term structure of interest rates and measure of future interest rates at a particular point in time\n- \u00b7 Liqu/i.rightdity discounts in the valuation of unlisted investments primar/i.rightly applied to the valuation of unlisted firms' investments to reflect the fact that these stocks are not actively traded.

Financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes in respect of the fair values of Level 3 assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes\n\nSensit/i.rightvity analysis is performed on products with sign/i.rightficant unobservable inputs. The Group applies a 10 per cent increase or decrease on the values of these unobservable inputs, to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations. The percentage shift is determined by statist/i.rightcal analysis performed on a set of reference prices based on the composit/i.righton of the Group's Level 3 inventory as the measurement date. Favourable and unfavourable changes (which show the balance adjusted for input change) are determined on the basis of changes in the value of the instrument as a result of varying the levels of the unobservable parameters. The Level 3 sensit/i.rightvity analysis assumes a one-way market move and does not consider offsets for hedges.\n\n|                                                                               | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Held at fair value through profit or loss   | Fair value through other comprehensive income   | Fair value through other comprehensive income   | Fair value through other comprehensive income   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                               | Net exposure  $mill/i.righton               | Favourable  changes  $mill/i.righton        | Unfavourable  changes  $mill/i.righton      | Net exposure  $mill/i.righton                   | Favourable  changes  $mill/i.righton            | Unfavourable  changes  $mill/i.righton          |\n| Financ/i.rightal instruments held at fair value                               |                                             |                                             |                                             |                                                 |                                                 |                                                 |\n| Loans and advances                                                            | 1,366                                       | 1,398                                       | 1,328                                       | -

Derivat/i.rightves are categorised as trading unless they are designated as hedging instruments.\n\nDerivat/i.rightves are in/i.righttially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value, with revaluation gains recognised in profit or loss (except where cashflow or net investment hedging has been achieved, in which case the effective portion of changes in fair value is recognised with/i.rightn other comprehensive income).\n\nFair values may be obtained from quoted market prices in active markets, recent market transactions, and valuation techniques, includ/i.rightng discounted cashflow models and option pric/i.rightng models, as appropriate. Where the in/i.righttially recognised fair value of a derivat/i.rightve contract is based on a valuation model that uses inputs which are not observable in the market, it follows the same in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton accounting policy as for other financ/i.rightal assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. All derivat/i.rightves are carried as assets when fair value is posit/i.rightve and as liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes when fair value is negative.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nUnder certain condit/i.rightons, the Group may designate a recognised asset or liab/i.rightlity, a firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment of a foreign operation into a formal hedge accounting relationsh/i.rightp with a derivat/i.rightve that has been entered to manage interest rate and/or foreign exchange risks present in the hedged item. The Group applies the 'Phase 1' hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39 Financ/i.rightal Instruments: Recognit/i.righton and Measurement and the 'Phase 2' amendments to IFRS in respect of interest rate benchmark reform. There are three categories of hedge relationsh/i.rightps:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedge: to manage the fair value of interest rate and/or foreign currency risks of recognised assets or liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes or firm commitments\n- \u00b7 Cashflow hedge: to manage interest rate or foreign exchange risk of highly probable future cashflows attributable to a recognised asset or liab/i.rightlity, or a forecasted transaction\n- \u00b7 Net investment hedge: to manage the structural foreign exchange risk of an investment in a foreign operation.\n\nThe Group formally documents at the incept/i.righton of the transaction the relationsh/i.rightp between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management object/i.rightve and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This is described in more detail in the categories of hedges below.\n\nThe Group assesses, both at hedge incept/i.righton and on a quarterly basis, whether the derivat/i.rightves designated in hedge relationsh/i.rightps are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cashflows of hedged items. Hedges are considered to be highly effective if all the following criter/i.righta are met:\n\n- \u00b7 At incept/i.righton of the hedge and throughout its life, the hedge is prospectively expected to be highly effective in achiev/i.rightng offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk\n- \u00b7 Actual results of the hedge are with/i.rightn a range of 80-125%. This is tested using regression analysis\n- \u00b7 The regression co-effic/i.rightent (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression, is at least 80%\n- \u00b7 In the case of the hedge of a forecast transaction, the transaction must have a high probabil/i.rightty of occurring and must present an exposure to variat/i.rightons in cashflows that are expected to affect reported profit or loss. The Group assumes that any interest rate benchmarks on which hedged item cashflows are based are not altered by IBOR reform.\n\nThe Group discont/i.rightnues hedge accounting in any of the following circumstances:\n\n- \u00b7 The hedging instrument is not, or has ceased to be, highly effective as a hedge\n- \u00b7 The hedging instrument has expired, is sold, terminated, or exercised\n- \u00b7 The hedged item matures, is sold, or repaid\n- \u00b7 The forecast transaction is no longer deemed highly probable\n- \u00b7 The Group elects to discont/i.rightnue hedge accounting voluntarily\n\nFor interest rate benchmarks deemed in scope of IBOR reform, if the actual result of a hedge is outside the 80-125% range, but the hedge passes the prospective assessment, then the Group will not de-designate the hedge relationsh/i.rightp.\n\nUnder the Phase 2 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform amendments to IFRS 9 and IAS 39, the Group may change hedge designat/i.rightons and corresponding documentation without the hedge being discont/i.rightnued where there is a change in interest rate benchmark of the hedged item, hedging instrument or designated hedged risk. Permitted changes include the right to:\n\n- \u00b7 Redefine the descript/i.righton of the hedged item and/or hedging instrument\n- \u00b7 Redefine the hedged risk to reference an alternative risk-free rate\n- \u00b7 Change the method for assessing hedge effectiveness due to modif/i.rightcations required by IBOR reform\n- \u00b7 Elect, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to reset the cumulative fair value changes in the assessment of retrospective hedge effectiveness to zero\n\nA hedge designat/i.righton may be modif/i.righted more than once, each time a relationsh/i.rightp is affected as a direct result of IBOR reform.",

Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivat/i.rightves that are designated and qualify as fair value hedging instruments are recorded in net trading income, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liab/i.rightlity that are attributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criter/i.righta for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the remain/i.rightng term to maturity of the hedged item. If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immed/i.rightately in the income statement. For financ/i.rightal assets classif/i.righted as fair value through other comprehensive income, the hedge accounting adjustment attributable to the hedged risk is included in net trading income to match the hedging derivat/i.rightve.\n\n## Cashflow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivat/i.rightves that are designated and qualify as cashflow hedging instruments are in/i.righttially recognised in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the cashflow hedge reserve with/i.rightn equity. These amounts are subsequently recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. Both the derivat/i.rightve fair value movement and any recycled amount are recorded in the 'Cashflow hedges' line item in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group assesses hedge effectiveness using the hypothetical derivat/i.rightve method, which creates a derivat/i.rightve instrument to serve as a proxy for the hedged transaction. The terms of the hypothetical derivat/i.rightve match the crit/i.rightcal terms of the hedged item and it has a fair value of zero at incept/i.righton. The hypothetical derivat/i.rightve and the actual derivat/i.rightve are regressed to establish the statist/i.rightcal sign/i.rightficance of the hedge relationsh/i.rightp. Any ineffect/i.rightve portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the net trading income immed/i.rightately.\n\nIf a cash flow hedge is discont/i.rightnued, the amount accumulated in the cashflow hedge reserve is released to the income statement as and when the hedged item affects the income statement.\n\nFor interest rate benchmarks deemed in scope of IBOR reform, the Group will retain the cumulative gain or loss in the cashflow hedge reserve for designated cashflow hedges even though there is uncertainty aris/i.rightng from these reforms with respect to the tim/i.rightng and amount of the cashflows of the hedged items. Should the Group consider the hedged future cashflows are no longer expected to occur due to reasons other than IBOR reform, the cumulative gain or loss will be immed/i.rightately reclassif/i.righted to profit or loss.\n\n## Net investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments are accounted for in a sim/i.rightlar manner to cashflow hedges, with gains and losses aris/i.rightng on the effective portion of the hedges recorded in the line 'Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations' in other comprehensive income, accumulating in the translation reserve with/i.rightn equity. These amounts remain in equity until the net investment is disposed of. The ineffect/i.rightve portion of the hedges is recognised in the net trading income immed/i.rightately.\n\nThe tables below analyse the notional princ/i.rightpal amounts and the posit/i.rightve and negative fair values of derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments. Notional princ/i.rightpal amounts are the amounts of princ/i.rightpal underlying the contract at the reporting date.\n\n|                                               | 2021

The Group also holds various fixed-rate debt securit/i.rightes such as government and corporate bonds, includ/i.rightng some denominated in foreign currency (see Note 13). These assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes held are exposed to changes in fair value due to movements in market interest and foreign currency rates.\n\nThe Group uses interest rate swaps to exchange fixed rates for floating rates on funding to match floating rates received on assets, or exchange fixed rates on assets to match floating rates paid on funding. The Group further uses cross-currency swaps to match the currency of the issued debt or held asset with that of the entity's functional currency.\n\nHedge ineffect/i.rightveness from fair value hedges is driven by cross currency basis risk. The amortisat/i.righton of fair value hedge adjustments for hedged items no longer designated is recognised in net trading income. In future periods, hedge relationsh/i.rightps linked to an interest rate benchmark deemed in scope of benchmark reform may experience ineffect/i.rightveness due to market partic/i.rightpants' expectations for when the change from the exist/i.rightng IBOR benchmark to an alternative risk-free rate will occur, since the transit/i.righton may occur at different times for the hedged item and hedging instrument.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the Group held the following interest rate and cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments in fair value hedges of interest and currency risk.",

The amounts and tim/i.rightng of future cashflows, representing both princ/i.rightpal and interest flows, are projected on the basis of contractual terms and other relevant factors, includ/i.rightng estimates of prepayments and defaults.\n\nThe hedging strategy of the Group involves using interest rate swaps to manage the variab/i.rightlity in future cashflows on assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes that have floating rates of interest by exchanging the floating rates for fixed rates. It also uses foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps to manage the variab/i.rightlity in future exchange rates on its assets and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and costs in foreign currencies. This is done on both a micro basis, whereby a single interest rate or cross-currency swap is designated in a separate relationsh/i.rightp with a single hedged item (such as a floating rate loan to a customer), and on a portfolio basis, whereby each hedging instrument is designated against a group of hedged items that share the same risk (such as a group of customer accounts).\n\nThe hedged risk is determined as the variab/i.rightlity of future cashflows aris/i.rightng from changes in the designated benchmark interest rate.\n\n## Hedging instruments and ineffect/i.rightveness\n\n|                                   | 2021                      | 2021                   | 2021                              | 2021                                            | 2021                                | 2021                                                     | 2021                                           |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                                   |                           | Carrying amount        | Carrying amount                   | Change in fair  value used to  calculate  hedge | Gain                                | Ineffectiveness  gain/(loss)  recognised in  net trading | Amount  reclassif/i.righted  from  reserves to |\n|                                   | Notional  $mill/i.righton | Asset  $mill/i.righton | Liab/i.rightlity  $mill/i.righton | ineffect/i.rightveness  $mill/i.righton         | recognised  in OCI  $mill/i.righton | income  $mill/i.righton                                  | income  $mill/i.righton                        |\n| Interest rate risk                |                           |                        |                                   |                                                 |                                     |                                                          |                                                |\n| Interest rate swaps               | 10,381                    | 60                     | 74                                | 77                                              | 77                                  | -

This risk arises from the fluctuation in spot exchange rates between the functional currency of the subsid/i.rightaries and the Group's presentation currency, which causes the value of the investment to vary.\n\nThe Group's policy is to hedge these exposures only when not doing so would be expected to have a sign/i.rightficant impact on the regulatory ratios of the Group and its banking subsid/i.rightaries. The Group uses foreign exchange forwards to manage the effect of exchange rates on its net investments in foreign subsid/i.rightaries.",

Derivat/i.rightve financ/i.rightal instruments continued\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform\n\nThe Group applies the Phase 1 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7 which allow the Group to assume that the interest rate benchmark on which cashflows for the hedged item and/or hedging instrument are based is are altered as a result of IBOR reform for the following activ/i.rightties:\n\n- \u00b7 Prospective hedge assessment\n- \u00b7 Determin/i.rightng whether a cash flow or forecast transaction for a cashflow hedge is highly probable. However, the Group otherwise assesses whether the cashflows are considered highly probable\n- \u00b7 Determin/i.rightng when cumulative balances in the cashflow hedge reserve from de-designated hedges should be recycled to the income statement\n\nThe Group will not de-designate a hedge relationsh/i.rightp of a benchmark in scope of IBOR reform if the retrospective hedge result is outside the required 80-125% range but, the hedge passes the prospective assessment. Any hedge ineffect/i.rightveness continues to be recorded in net trading income.\n\nFor hedges of non-contractually specif/i.righted benchmark portions of an interest rate (such as fair value hedges of interest rate risk on fixed rate debt instruments) the Group only assesses whether the designated benchmark is separately ident/i.rightfiable at hedge incept/i.righton. The choice of designated benchmark is not revis/i.rightted for exist/i.rightng hedge relationsh/i.rightps.\n\nIn applying these amendments, the Group has made the following key assumptions for the period end, to be reviewed on an ongoing basis:\n\n- \u00b7 the interest rate benchmarks applicable to the Group that are in scope of the IFRS amendments are all LIBORs, EONIA, Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SGD SOR) and Thai Baht Interest Rate Fix/i.rightng (THB FIX)\n- \u00b7 EURIBOR is not in scope of the IFRS amendments because its revised methodology incorporates market transaction data, hence the benchmark is expected to continue to exist in future reporting periods\n\nThe Group assumes that the uncertainty aris/i.rightng from USD LIBOR will be present until 30 June 2023, at which time the amendments to IFRS no longer apply.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the following notional princ/i.rightpal amounts of derivat/i.rightve instruments designated in fair value or cash flow hedge accounting relationsh/i.rightps were linked to IBOR reference rates:\n\n|                                                                                            | Fair value   hedges  $mill/i.righton   | Cashflow   hedges  $mill/i.righton   | Total  $mill/i.righton   | Weighted  average  exposure  Years   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps                                                                        |                                        |                                      |                          |                                      |\n| USD LIBOR                                                                                  | 46,615                                 | 2,636                                | 49,251                   | 3.6                                  |\n| GBP LIBOR                                                                                  | 1,444                                  | -                                    | 1,444                    | 0.1                                  |\n| JPY LIBOR                                                                                  | 637                                    | -                                    | 637                      | 0.2                                  |\n| SGD SOR                                                                                    | -                                      | -                                    | -                        | -                                    |\n|                                                                                            | 48,696                                 | 2,636                                | 51,332                   | 3.5                                  |\n| Cross-currency swaps                                                                       |                                        |                                      |                          |                                      |\n| USD LIBOR vs fixed rate foreign currency                                                   | 2,262                                  | 3,681                                | 5,943                    | 0.9                                  |\n| Total notional of hedging instruments in scope of IFRS amendments   as at 31 December 2021 | 50,958                                 | 6,317                                | 57, 275                  | 3.2                                  |",

Where fixed rate instruments are in other currencies, cross-currency swaps are used to achieve an equivalent floating USD exposure.\n\nExposures in GBP LIBOR and JPY LIBOR are short-dated basis swaps created per the LCH's methodology for converting derivat/i.rightves to alternative benchmark rates. Under this methodology, if an interest rate swap referencing either of these benchmarks would have had a fix/i.rightng between its conversion date and 31 December 2021, the orig/i.rightnal swap is replaced with a RFR swap of the same maturity and a LIBOR versus RFR basis swap that matures at the end of the last LIBOR fix/i.rightng period set before 31 December 2021. This replacement is treated as continuat/i.righton of the orig/i.rightnal LIBOR swap as the new bookings do not alter or amend the legal rights and obligat/i.rightons under the orig/i.rightnal derivat/i.rightve. The Group has applied the Phase 2 amendments to IAS 39 to redefine the descript/i.righton of the hedging instrument and hedged risk to reference the alternative benchmark rate in order to continue these hedge relationsh/i.rightps.\n\n## 15.

The securit/i.rightes are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and these securit/i.rightes are disclosed as pledged collateral. Considerat/i.righton received (or cash collateral received) is accounted for as a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity at amortised cost unless it is either mandatorily classif/i.righted as fair value through profit or loss or irrevocably designated at fair value through profit or loss at in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal assets are pledged as collateral as part of sales and repurchases, securit/i.rightes borrowing and securit/i.rightsation transactions under terms that are usual and customary for such activ/i.rightties.

Securit/i.rightes sold subject to repos, either by way of a Global Master Repurchase Agreement (GMRA), or through a securit/i.rightes sale and Total Return Swap (TRS) continue to be recognised on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially the associated risks and rewards of the securit/i.rightes (the TRS is not recognised). The counterparty liab/i.rightlity is included in deposits by banks or customer accounts, as appropriate. Assets sold under repurchase agreements are considered encumbered as the Group cannot pledge these to obtain funding.\n\n## Reverse repurchase agreements and other sim/i.rightlar secured lending\n\n|                                   | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Banks                             | 19,806                  | 19,452                  |\n| Customers                         | 68,613                  | 48,119                  |\n|                                   | 88,419                  | 67, 5 7 1               |\n| Of which:                         |                         |                         |\n| Fair value through profit or loss | 80,009                  | 63,405                  |\n| Banks                             | 18,727                  | 18,205                  |\n| Customers                         | 61,282                  | 45,200                  |\n| Held at amortised cost            | 8,410                   | 4,166                   |\n| Banks                             | 1,079                   | 1,247                   |\n| Customers                         | 7, 3 3 1                | 2,919                   |\n\nUnder reverse repurchase and securit/i.rightes borrowing arrangements, the Group obtains securit/i.rightes on terms which permit it to repledge or resell the securit/i.rightes to others.

        "page_content": "## 17. Goodwill and intang/i.rightble assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquis/i.righttion over the fair value of the Group's share of the ident/i.rightfiable net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the acquired subsid/i.rightary, associate or jo/i.rightnt venture at the date of acquis/i.righttion. Goodwill on acquis/i.righttions of subsid/i.rightaries is included in intang/i.rightble assets. Goodwill on acquis/i.righttions of associates is included in Investments in associates. Goodwill included in intang/i.rightble assets is assessed at each balance sheet date for impa/i.rightrment and carried at cost less any accumulated impa/i.rightrment losses. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Detailed calculations are performed based on discount/i.rightng expected cash flows of the relevant cash-generating units (CGUs) and discount/i.rightng these at an appropriate discount rate, the determinat/i.righton of which requires the exercise of judgement. Goodwill is allocated to CGUs for the purpose of impa/i.rightrment testing. CGUs represent the lowest level with/i.rightn the Group which generate separate cash inflows and at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes. These are equal to or smaller than the Group's reportable segments (as set out in Note 2) as the Group views its reportable segments on a global basis. The major CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are set out in the CGU table (page 380).\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe carrying amount of goodwill is based on the applicat/i.righton of judgements includ/i.rightng the basis of goodwill impa/i.rightrment calculation assumptions. Judgement is also applied in determinat/i.righton of cash-generating units.\n\nEstimates include forecasts used for determin/i.rightng cash flows for CGUs, the appropriate long-term growth rates to use and discount rates which factor in country risk-free rates and applicable risk premiums. The Group undertakes an annual assessment to evaluate whether the carrying value of goodwill is impa/i.rightred. The estimat/i.righton of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires sign/i.rightficant judgement and is subject to potential change over time.\n\n## Acquired intang/i.rightbles\n\nAt the date of acquis/i.righttion of a subsid/i.rightary or associate, intang/i.rightble assets which are deemed separable and that arise from contractual or other legal rights are capital/i.rightsed and included with/i.rightn the net ident/i.rightfiable assets acquired. These intang/i.rightble assets are in/i.righttially measured at fair value, which reflects market expectations of the probabil/i.rightty that the future economic benefits embodied in the asset will flow to the entity and are amortised on the basis of their expected useful lives (4 to 16 years). At each balance sheet date, these assets are assessed for ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down immed/i.rightately.\n\n## Computer software\n\nAcquired computer software licences are capital/i.rightsed if the princ/i.rightples of development are met on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specif/i.rightc software.\n\nInternally generated software represents substantially all of the total software capital/i.rightsed. Direct costs of the development of separately ident/i.rightfiable internally generated software are capital/i.rightsed where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow from its use (internally generated software). These costs include salaries and wages, materials, service providers and contractors, and directly attributable overheads. Costs incurred in the ongoing maintenance of software are expensed immed/i.rightately when incurred. Internally generated software is amortised over each asset's useful life to a maximum of a 10-year time period. On an annual basis software assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, includ/i.rightng assessing for ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment. Indicators of impa/i.rightrment include loss of business relevance, obsolescence of asset, exit of the business to which the software relates, technological changes, change in use of the asset, reduction in useful life, plans to reduce usage or scope.\n\nFor capital/i.rightsed software, judgement is required to determine which costs relate to research (and therefore expensed) and which costs relate to development (capital/i.rightsed). Further judgement is required to determine the technical feasib/i.rightlity of completing the software such that it will be available for use. Estimates are used to determine how the software will generate probable future economic benefits, these estimates include: cost savings, income increases, balance sheet improvements, improved functional/i.rightty or improved asset safeguarding.",

As a result of this change in estimate, the Group has recorded a decrease in software amortisat/i.righton of approximately $88 mill/i.righton for the year when compared to the previous estimate.\n\n## Goodwill\n\n## Outcome of impa/i.rightrment assessment\n\nChange in cash-generating units (CGUs) Goodwill is allocated to CGUs, which are considered the level at which goodwill is managed and which generate independent cash inflows. At year-end 2021, the Group had two global CGUs representing Corporate, Commercial & Institut/i.rightonal Banking (CCIB) and Private Banking (PB), along with six ind/i.rightvidual country CGUs representing Retail Banking (RB) for each country.\n\nFollowing the changes in the Group's organisat/i.rightonal structure as described in Note 2 - Operating Segments which has resulted in two new business segments, CCIB and CPBB, the CGUs have changed. Goodwill relating to CB ($478 mill/i.righton), which was previously allocated to country CGUs, has been reallocated to the global CCIB CGU. The CB goodwill has been allocated on a relative value basis with reference to the ratio of RB and CB risk-weighted assets in the ind/i.rightvidual country at 1 January 2021.\n\nThe changes above require comparative periods to be restated.\n\n## Testing of goodwill for impa/i.rightrment\n\nAn annual assessment is made as to whether the current carrying value of goodwill is impa/i.rightred. For the purposes of impa/i.rightrment testing, goodwill is allocated at the date of acquis/i.righttion to a CGU. Goodwill is considered to be impa/i.rightred if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. Indicators of impa/i.rightrment include changes in the economic performance and outlook of the region includ/i.rightng geopolit/i.rightcal changes, changes in market value of regional investments, large credit defaults and strategic decis/i.rightons to exit certain regions. The recoverable amounts for all the CGUs were measured based on value in use (ViU). The calculation of ViU for each CGU is calculated using five-year cashflow project/i.rightons and an estimated terminal value based on a perpetuity value after year five. The cashflow project/i.rightons are based on forecasts approved by management up to 2026. The perpetuity terminal value amount is calculated using year five cashflows using long-term GDP growth rates. All cashflows are discounted using discount rates which reflect market rates appropriate to the CGU.\n\nThe goodwill allocated to each CGU and key assumptions used in determin/i.rightng the recoverable amounts are set out below and are solely estimates for the purposes of assessing impa/i.rightrment of acquired goodwill.",

This is primar/i.rightly due to increased antic/i.rightpated cashflows as economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has abated and the change in CGUs as described above.\n\n## Acquired intang/i.rightbles\n\nThese primar/i.rightly comprise those items recognised as part of the acquis/i.righttions of Union Bank (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Lim/i.rightted), Hsinchu (now amalgamated into Standard Chartered Bank (Taiwan) Lim/i.rightted), Pembroke, American Express Bank and ABSA's custody business in Africa. Maintenance intang/i.rightble assets represent the value in the difference between the contractual right under acquired leases to receive aircraft in a specif/i.righted maintenance condit/i.righton at the end of the lease and the actual physical condit/i.righton of the aircraft at the date of acquis/i.righttion.\n\nThe acquired intang/i.rightbles are amortised over periods from four years to a maximum of 16 years. The constituents are as follows:\n\n|                                       | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Acquired intang/i.rightbles comprise: |                         |                         |\n| Aircraft maintenance                  | 5                       | 6                       |\n| Brand names                           | 1                       | -                       |\n| Customer relationsh/i.rightps         | 3                       | 7                       |\n| Licences                              | 11                      | 9                       |\n| Net book value                        | 20                      | 22                      |",

Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nAll property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciat/i.righton and impa/i.rightrment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquis/i.righttion of the assets. Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or are recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nAt each balance sheet date the asset's residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, includ/i.rightng assessing for ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the asset is written down to the recoverable amount. Gains and losses on disposals are included in the income statement.\n\nRepairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financ/i.rightal period in which they are incurred.\n\nLand and build/i.rightngs comprise mainly branches and offices. Freehold land is not depreciated, although it is subject to impa/i.rightrment testing.\n\nDepreciat/i.righton on other assets is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost to their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Build/i.rightngs\n- \u00b7 up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Leasehold improvements life of lease\n- \u00b7 up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Equipment and motor vehicles\n- \u00b7 three to 15 years\n- \u00b7 Aircraft\n- \u00b7 up to 18 years\n- \u00b7 Ships\n- \u00b7 up to 15 years\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee of a right-of-use asset, the leased assets are capital/i.rightsed and included in Property, plant and equipment with a corresponding liab/i.rightlity to the lessor recognised in Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes, in accordance with the Group's leased assets accounting policy in Note 19.\n\nAll other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income statement during the financ/i.rightal period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe carrying amount of the Group's aircraft leasing portfolio is based on the applicat/i.righton of judgement and estimates to determine the most appropriate recoverable amount for each aircraft when assessing for impa/i.rightrment. Estimates involve the appropriate cash flows, discount rates and residual values used in determin/i.rightng a value-in-use for aircraft, and judgement is required in determin/i.rightng the appropriate observable third-party valuations to use for assessing current market value.",

Property, plant and equipment continued\n\n## Operating lease assets\n\nThe operating lease assets subsection of property, plant and equipment is the Group's aircraft operating leasing business, consist/i.rightng of 97 commercial aircraft at year end, of which 94 are narrow-bodies and three are wide-bodies. The leases are classif/i.righted as operating leases as they do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards inc/i.rightdental to the ownership of the assets to the lessee, and rental income from operating lease assets is disclosed in Note 6. At 31 December 2021, these assets had a net book value of $3,092 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $3,897 mill/i.righton).\n\nUnder these leases the lessee is responsible for the maintenance and servic/i.rightng of the aircraft during the lease term while the Group receives rental income and assumes the risks of the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease. Init/i.rightal lease terms range in length up to 12 years, while the average remain/i.rightng lease term at 31 December 2021 is approximately five years. By varying the lease terms, the effects of changes in cyclical market condit/i.rightons at the time aircraft become elig/i.rightble for re-lease are mit/i.rightgated. The Group will look at entering into a lease extension with exist/i.rightng lessees well in advance of lease expiry in order to min/i.rightmise the risk of aircraft downtime and aircraft transit/i.righton costs. Aircraft may also be sold from time to time to manage the composit/i.righton and average age of the fleet.\n\nA series of stress sensit/i.rightvit/i.rightes conducted on the narrow-body portfolio highl/i.rightght the two biggest risks remain either an increase in the discount rate or a substantial number of airl/i.rightne clients defaulting. A sensit/i.rightvity test was performed on the narrow-body portfolio assuming a discount rate increase of 100 basis points, from a base range of  4.5%-5.5%, (31 December 2020: 4.5%-6%), which resulted in a possible increase in impa/i.rightrment of $26 mill/i.righton.\n\nA further sensit/i.rightvity test considered that the lessees with lower credit ratings defaulted on their current leases. This scenario would result in a possible increase in impa/i.rightrment of $75 mill/i.righton.\n\nDuring 2020 the Group offered payment concessions to customers as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing them to defer lease payments for between three and nine months. For customers who have not defaulted on their obligat/i.rightons, deferrals do not affect income recognit/i.righton provided the total lease rentals and lease expiry date are unchanged. For customers who have defaulted, any income not covered by collateral is provided against. The provis/i.righton is reversed on receipt of the deferred payment.\n\n|                        | 2021  Min/i.rightmum lease  receivables  under operating  leases falling  due:  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  Min/i.rightmum lease  receivables   under operating  leases falling   due:  $mill/i.righton   |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| With/i.rightn one year | 330                                                                                               | 478                                                                                                 |\n| One to two years       | 285                                                                                               | 436                                                                                                 |\n| Two to three years     | 251                                                                                               | 374                                                                                                 |\n| Three to four years    | 197                                                                                               | 328                                                                                                 |\n| Four to five years     | 153                                                                                               | 251                                                                                                 |\n| After five years       | 411                                                                                               | 697                                                                                                 |\n|                        | 1,627                                                                                             | 2,564                                                                                               |",

        "page_content": "## 19. Leased assets\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is a lease in scope of this policy by determin/i.rightng whether the contract gives it the right to use a specif/i.righted underlying physical asset for a lease term greater than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of low value.\n\nWhere the Group is a lessee and the lease is deemed in scope, it recognises a liab/i.rightlity equal to the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate applicable in the economic environment of the lease. The liab/i.rightlity is recognised in 'Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes'. A corresponding right-of-use asset equal to the liab/i.rightlity, adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, is recognised in 'Property, plant and equipment'. The lease term includes any extension options contained in the contract that the Group is reasonably certain it will exercise.\n\nThe Group subsequently depreciates the right-of-use asset using the straight-line method over the lease term and measures the lease liab/i.rightlity using the effective interest method. Depreciat/i.righton on the asset is recognised in 'Depreciat/i.righton and amortisat/i.righton', and interest on the lease liab/i.rightlity is recognised in 'Interest expense'.\n\nIf a leased premise, or a physically dist/i.rightnct portion of a premise such as an ind/i.rightvidual floor, is deemed by management to be surplus to the Group's needs and action has been taken to abandon the space before the lease expires, this is considered an ind/i.rightcator of impa/i.rightrment. An impa/i.rightrment loss is recognised if the right-of-use asset, or portion thereof, has a carrying value in excess of its value-in-use when taking into account factors such as the abil/i.rightty and likel/i.righthood of obtain/i.rightng a subtenant.\n\nThe judgements in determin/i.rightng lease balances are the determinat/i.righton of whether the Group is reasonably certain that it will exercise extension options present in lease contracts. On in/i.righttial recognit/i.righton, the Group considers a range of characterist/i.rightcs such as premises function, regional trends and the term remain/i.rightng on the lease to determine whether it is reasonably certain that a contractual right to extend a lease will be exercised. Where a change in assumption is confirmed by the local property management team, a remeasurement is performed in the Group-managed vendor system.\n\nThe estimates were the determinat/i.righton of incremental borrowing rates in the respective economic environments. The Group uses third-party broker quotes to estimate its USD cost of senior unsecured borrowing, then uses cross-currency swap pric/i.rightng informat/i.righton to determine the equivalent cost of borrowing in other currencies. If it is not possible to estimate an incremental borrowing rate through this process, other proxies such as local government bond yields are used.\n\nThe Group primar/i.rightly enters lease contracts that grant it the right to use premises such as office build/i.rightngs and retail branches.\n\nExist/i.rightng lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes may change in future periods due to changes in assumptions or decis/i.rightons to exercise lease renewal or terminat/i.righton options, changes in payments due to renegotiat/i.rightons of market rental rates as permitted by those contracts and changes to payments due to rent being contractually linked to an inflat/i.righton index. In general the re-measurement of a lease liab/i.rightlity under these circumstances leads to an equal change to the right-of-use asset balance, with no immed/i.rightate effect on the income statement.\n\nThe total cash outflow during the year for premises and equipment leases was $331 mill/i.righton (2020: $352 mill/i.righton).\n\nThe total expense during the year in respect of leases with a term less than or equal to 12 months was less than $1 mill/i.righton (2020: $1 mill/i.righton).\n\nThe right-of-use asset balances and depreciat/i.righton charges are disclosed in Note 18. The lease liab/i.rightlity balances are disclosed in Note 23 and the interest expense on lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes is disclosed in Note 3.\n\n## Maturity analysis\n\nThe maturity profile for lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes associated with leased premises and equipment assets is as follows:\n\n|                                                                   | 2021                                 | 2021                                                 | 2021                                                  | 2021                                     | 2021                    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                   | One year   or less   $mill/i.righton | Between   one year and   two years   $mill/i.righton | Between   two years and  five years   $mill/i.righton | More than   five years   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton |\n| Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes - lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes | 293                                  | 247                                                  | 521                                                   | 175                                      | 1,236                   |\n|                                                                   | 2020                                 | 2020                                                 | 2020                                                  | 2020                                     | 2020                    |\n|                                                                   | One year   or less   $mill/i.righton | Between   one year and   two years   $mill/i.righton | Between   two years and  five years   $mill/i.righton | More than   five years   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton |\n| Other liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes - lease liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes | 368                                  | 280                                                  | 559                                                   | 188                                      | 1,395                   |",

Provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group recognises a provis/i.righton for a present legal or constructive obligat/i.righton resulting from a past event when it is more likely than not that it will be required to transfer economic benefits to settle the obligat/i.righton and the amount of the obligat/i.righton can be estimated reliably. Where a liab/i.rightlity arises based on partic/i.rightpation in a market at a specif/i.righted date, the obligat/i.righton is recognised in the financ/i.rightal statements on that date and is not accrued over the period.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe recognit/i.righton and measurement of provis/i.rightons for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and charges requires sign/i.rightficant judgement and the use of estimates about uncertain future condit/i.rightons or events.\n\nEstimates include the best estimate of the probabil/i.rightty of outflow of economic resources, cost of settling a provis/i.righton and tim/i.rightng of settlement. Judgements are required for inherently uncertain areas such as legal decis/i.rightons (includ/i.rightng external advice obtained), and outcome of regulator reviews.\n\n|                                   | 2021                                                        | 2021                                       | 2021                   | 2020                                                        | 2020                                       | 2020                   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                   | Provis/i.righton   for credit  commitments  $mill/i.righton | Other   provis/i.rightons  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Provis/i.righton   for credit  commitments  $mill/i.righton | Other   provis/i.rightons  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| At 1 January                      | 367                                                         | 99                                         | 466                    | 317                                                         | 132                                        | 449                    |\n| Exchange translation differences  | 9                                                           | (1)                                        | 8                      | (50)                                                        | (3)                                        | (53)                   |\n| Transfer                          | -                                                           | 2                                          | 2                      | -                                                           | 9                                          | 9                      |\n| Charge against profit             | (30)                                                        | 54                                         | 24                     | 103                                                         | 22                                         | 125                    |\n| Provis/i.rightons util/i.rightsed | -                                                           | (47)                                       | (47)                   | (3)                                                         | (61)                                       | (64)                   |\n| At 31 December                    | 346                                                         | 107                                        | 453                    | 367                                                         | 99                                         | 466                    |\n\nProvis/i.righton for credit commitment comprises those undrawn contractually committed facil/i.rightties where there is doubt as to the borrower's abil/i.rightty to meet their repayment obligat/i.rightons.\n\nOther provis/i.rightons consist mainly of provis/i.rightons for regulatory settlements and legal claims, the nature of which are described in Note 26.",

Contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes and commitments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments\n\nThe Group issues financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments in return for fees. Financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and any loan commitments issued at below-market interest rates are in/i.righttially recognised at their fair value as a financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlity, and subsequently measured at the higher of the in/i.righttial value less the cumulative amount of income recognised in accordance with the princ/i.rightples of IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and their expected credit loss provis/i.righton. Loan commitments may be designated at fair value through profit or loss where that is the business model under which such contracts are held. Notional values of financ/i.rightal guarantee contracts and loan commitments are disclosed in the table below.\n\nFinanc/i.rightal guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit are the notional values of contracts issued by the Group's Transaction Banking business for which an obligat/i.righton to make a payment has not arisen at the reporting date. Transaction Banking will issue contracts to clients and counterparties of clients, whereby in the event the holder of the contract is not paid, the Group will reimburse the holder of the contract for the actual financ/i.rightal loss suffered. These contracts have various legal forms such as letters of credit, guarantee contracts and performance bonds. The contracts are issued to facil/i.righttate trade through export and import business, provide guarantees to financ/i.rightal inst/i.righttutions where the Group has a local presence, as well as guaranteeing project financ/i.rightng involv/i.rightng large construction projects undertaken by sovereigns and corporates. The contracts may contain performance clauses which require the counterparty performing services or provid/i.rightng goods to meet certain condit/i.rightons before a right to payment is achieved, however the Group does not guarantee this performance. The Group will only guarantee the credit of the counterparty paying for the services or goods.\n\nCommitments are where the Group has confirmed its intent/i.righton to provide funds to a customer or on behalf of a customer under prespecif/i.righted terms and condit/i.rightons in the form of loans, overdrafts, future guarantees, whether cancellable or not and the Group has not made payments at the balance sheet date; those instruments are included in these financ/i.rightal statements as 'commitments'. Commitments and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are generally considered on demand as the Group may have to honour them, or the client may draw down at any time.\n\n'Capital commitments' are contractual commitments the Group has entered into to purchase non-financ/i.rightal assets.\n\nThe table below shows the contract or underlying princ/i.rightpal amounts of unmatured off-balance sheet transactions at the balance sheet date. The contract or underlying princ/i.rightpal amounts ind/i.rightcate the volume of business outstanding and do not represent amounts at risk.\n\n|                                                                                                   | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Financ/i.rightal guarantees and trade credits                                                     |                         |                         |\n| Financ/i.rightal guarantees, trade credits and irrevocable letters of credit                      | 58,535                  | 53,832                  |\n|                                                                                                   | 58,535                  | 53,832                  |\n| Commitments                                                                                       |                         |                         |\n| Undrawn formal standby facil/i.rightties, credit lines and other commitments to lend              |                         |                         |\n| One year and over                                                                                 | 69,542                  | 68,848                  |\n| Less than one year                                                                                | 27,306                  | 24,500                  |\n| Uncondit/i.rightonally cancellable                                                                | 61,675                  | 60,055                  |\n|                                                                                                   | 158,523                 | 153,403                 |\n| Capital commitments                                                                               |                         |                         |\n| Contracted capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in these accounts 1 | 124                     | 135                     |\n\nAs set out in Note 26, the Group has contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes in respect of certain legal and regulatory matters for which it is not practicable to estimate the financ/i.rightal impact as there are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes.",

        "page_content": "## 26. Legal and regulatory matters\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nWhere appropriate, the Group recognises a provis/i.righton for liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes when it is probable that an outflow of economic resources embodying economic benefits will be required, and for which a reliable estimate can be made of the obligat/i.righton. The uncertaint/i.rightes inherent in legal and regulatory matters affect the amount and tim/i.rightng of any potential outflows with respect to which provis/i.rightons have been established. These uncertaint/i.rightes also mean that it is not possible to give an aggregate estimate of contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes aris/i.rightng from such legal and regulatory matters.\n\nThe Group receives legal claims against it in a number of jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons and is subject to regulatory and enforcement invest/i.rightgations and proceedings from time to time. Apart from the matters described below, the Group currently considers none of the ongoing claims, invest/i.rightgations or proceedings to be material. However, in light of the uncertaint/i.rightes involved in such matters there can be no assurance that the outcome of a particular matter or matters currently not considered to be material may not ultimately be material to the Group's results in a particular reporting period depending on, among other things, the amount of the loss resulting from the matter(s) and the results otherwise reported for such period.\n\nSince 2014, the Group has been named as a defendant in a series of lawsuits that have been filed in the United States Distr/i.rightct Courts for the Southern and Eastern Distr/i.rightcts of New York against a number of banks (includ/i.rightng Standard Chartered Bank or its affil/i.rightates) on behalf of plaint/i.rightffs who are, or are relatives of, vict/i.rightms of various terrorist attacks in Iraq and Afghanistan. The most recent lawsuit was filed in August 2021 and concerns terrorist attacks that occurred in Afghanistan between 2011 and 2016. The plaint/i.rightffs in each of these lawsuits have alleged that the defendant banks aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of U.S. sanctioned parties in breach of the U.S. Anti-Terrorism Act. While the courts have ruled in favour of the banks' motions to dism/i.rightss in five of these lawsuits, plaint/i.rightffs' have appealed or are expected to appeal against certain of these judgements. The remain/i.rightng cases are at an early procedural stage and, except for the lawsuit filed in August 2021, have been stayed pending the outcomes of the appeals in the dism/i.rightssed cases. None of these lawsuits have specif/i.righted the amount of damages claimed.\n\nIn January 2020, a shareholder derivat/i.rightve complaint was filed by the City of Philadelph/i.righta in New York State Court against 45 current and former directors and senior officers of the Group. It is alleged that the ind/i.rightviduals breached their duties to the Group and caused a waste of corporate assets by permitt/i.rightng the conduct that gave rise to the costs and losses to the Group related to legacy conduct and control issues. In March 2021, an amended complaint was served in which SCB and seven ind/i.rightviduals were removed from the case. Standard Chartered PLC and Standard Chartered Holdings Lim/i.rightted remained as named 'nominal defendants' in the complaint. In May 2021, Standard Chartered PLC filed a motion to dism/i.rightss the complaint. On 2 February 2022, the New York State Court ruled in favour of Standard Chartered PLC's motion to dism/i.rightss the complaint. The plaint/i.rightffs have a right of appeal.\n\nSince October 2020, two lawsuits have been filed in the English High Court against Standard Chartered PLC on behalf of more than 300 shareholders in relation to alleged untrue and/or mislead/i.rightng statements and/or omiss/i.rightons in informat/i.righton published by Standard Chartered PLC in its rights issue prospectuses of 2008, 2010 and 2015 and/or public statements regarding the Group's histor/i.rightc sanctions, money laundering and financ/i.rightal crime compliance issues. These lawsuits have been brought under sections 90 and 90A of the Financ/i.rightal Services and Markets Act 2000. Section 90 permits shareholders to pursue a claim if they acquire shares, and suffer loss, as a result of mislead/i.rightng statements in, or omiss/i.rightons of necessary informat/i.righton from, a prospectus or list/i.rightng particulars. Section 90A permits shareholders to pursue a claim if they acquire, hold or dispose of shares in reliance upon a knowingly or recklessly made untrue or mislead/i.rightng statement in, or dishonest omiss/i.righton of required informat/i.righton from published informat/i.righton, or if there has been a dishonest delay in publish/i.rightng relevant informat/i.righton. These lawsuits are at an early procedural stage.\n\nAs the Group has previously disclosed, Bernard Madoff's 2008 confession to running a Ponzi scheme through Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securit/i.rightes LLC (BMIS) gave rise to a number of lawsuits against the Group. BMIS and the Fairf/i.righteld funds (which invested in BMIS) are in bankruptcy and liqu/i.rightdation, respectively. Between 2010 and 2012, five lawsuits were brought against the Group by the BMIS bankruptcy trustee and the Fairf/i.righteld funds' liqu/i.rightdators, in each case seeking to recover funds paid to the Group's clients pursuant to redemption requests made prior to BMIS' bankruptcy fil/i.rightng. The total amount sought in these cases exceeds USD 300 mill/i.righton, excluding any pre-judgment interest that may be awarded. The four lawsuits commenced by the Fairf/i.righteld funds' liqu/i.rightdators have been dism/i.rightssed and the appeals of those dism/i.rightssals by the funds' liqu/i.rightdators are ongoing. The lawsuit brought against the Group by the BMIS bankruptcy trustee had been stayed pending a ruling by the US Second Circu/i.rightt Court of Appeals in related cases brought by the BMIS bankruptcy trustee against other defendants that had been dism/i.rightssed. In August 2021, the US Court of Appeals issued its ruling in the related cases with the result that the BMIS bankruptcy trustee's lawsuit against the Group is no longer stayed and is now ongoing. While the Group continues to vigorously defend these lawsuits, there is a range of possible outcomes in this lit/i.rightgation.\n\nBased on the facts currently known, it is not possible for the Group to predict the outcome of these lawsuits.",

Where such shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any considerat/i.righton received is included in shareholders' equity of the Group and/or the Company.\n\n|                                                         | Number of  ordinary   shares  mill/i.rightons   | Ordinary   share   capital 1 mill/i.rightons   | Ordinary   share   premium  mill/i.rightons   | Preference   share   premium 2 mill/i.rightons   | Total share  capital and   share premium  mill/i.rightons   | Other   equity  instruments  mill/i.rightons   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| At 1 January 2020                                       | 3,196                                           | 1,598                                          | 3,986                                         | 1,494                                            | 7, 078                                                      | 5,513                                          |\n| Cancellation of shares includ/i.rightng share  buy-back | (40)                                            | (20)                                           | -                                             | -                                                | (20)                                                        | -                                              |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 equity issuance                | -                                               | -                                              | -                                             | -                                                | -                                                           | 992                                            |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 equity redemption              | -                                               | -                                              | -                                             | -                                                | -                                                           | (1,987)                                        |\n| At 31 December 2020                                     | 3,156                                           | 1,578                                          | 3,986                                         | 1,494                                            | 7,058                                                       | 4,518                                          |\n| Cancellation of shares includ/i.rightng share  buy-back | (77)                                            | (39)                                           | -                                             | -                                                | (39)                                                        | -                                              |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 equity issuance                | -                                               | -                                              | -                                             | -                                                | -                                                           | 2,728                                          |\n| Addit/i.rightonal Tier 1 redemption                     | -                                               | -                                              | -                                             | -                                                | -                                                           | (992)                                          |\n| Other movements                                         | -                                               | -                                              | 3                                             | -                                                | 3                                                           | -                                              |\n| At 31 December 2021                                     | 3,079                                           | 1,539                                          | 3,989                                         | 1,494                                            | 7,022                                                       | 6,254                                          |\n\n- 1 Issued and fully paid ordinary shares of 50 cents each\n- 2   Includes preference share capital of $75,000",

Share capital, other equity instruments and reserves continued\n\nThe princ/i.rightpal terms of the AT1 securit/i.rightes are described below:\n\n- \u00b7 The securit/i.rightes are perpetual and redeemable, at the option of Standard Chartered PLC in whole but not in part, on the first interest reset date and each date falling five years after the first reset date\n- \u00b7 The securit/i.rightes are also redeemable for certain regulatory or tax reasons on any date at 100 per cent of their princ/i.rightpal amount together with any accrued but unpaid interest up to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. Any redemption is subject to Standard Chartered PLC giv/i.rightng notice to the relevant regulator and the regulator granting permiss/i.righton to redeem\n- \u00b7 Interest payments on these securit/i.rightes will be accounted for as a div/i.rightdend.\n- \u00b7 Interest on the securit/i.rightes is due and payable only at the sole and absolute discret/i.righton of Standard Chartered PLC, subject to certain addit/i.rightonal restrict/i.rightons set out in the terms and condit/i.rightons. Accordingly, Standard Chartered PLC may at any time elect to cancel any interest payment (or part thereof) which would otherwise be payable on any interest payment date.\n- \u00b7 The securit/i.rightes convert into ordinary shares of Standard Chartered PLC, at a predetermined price detailed in the table above, should the fully loaded Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of the Group fall below 7.0 per cent. Approximately 947 mill/i.righton ordinary shares would be required to satisfy the conversion of all the securit/i.rightes mentioned above\n\nThe securit/i.rightes rank behind the claims against Standard Chartered PLC of; (a) unsubordinated creditors; (b) which are expressed to be subordinated to the claims of unsubordinated creditors of Standard Chartered PLC but not further or otherwise; or (c) which are, or are expressed to be, jun/i.rightor to the claims of other creditors of Standard Chartered PLC, whether subordinated or unsubordinated, other than claims which rank, or are expressed to rank, pari passu with, or jun/i.rightor to, the claims of holders of the AT1 securit/i.rightes in a wind/i.rightng-up occurring prior to the conversion trigger.\n\n## Reserves\n\nThe constituents of the reserves are summarised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The capital reserve represents the exchange difference on redenominat/i.righton of share capital and share premium from sterling to US dollars in 2001. The capital redemption reserve represents the nominal value of preference shares redeemed\n- \u00b7 The amounts in the 'Capital and Merger Reserve' represents, the premium aris/i.rightng on shares issued using a cash box financ/i.rightng structure, which required the Company to create a merger reserve under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006. Shares were issued using this structure in 2005 and 2006 to assist in the funding of Korea ($1.9 bill/i.righton) and Taiwan ($1.2 bill/i.righton) acquis/i.righttions, in 2008, 2010 and 2015 for the shares issued by way of a rights issue, primar/i.rightly for capital maintenance requirements, and for the shares issued in 2009 by way of an accelerated book build, the proceeds of which were used in the ordinary course of business of the Group. The funding raised by the 2008, 2010 and 2015 rights issues and 2009 share issue was fully retained with/i.rightn the Company. Of the 2015 funding, $1.5 bill/i.righton was used to subscribe to addit/i.rightonal equity in Standard Chartered Bank, a wholly owned subsid/i.rightary of the Company. Apart from the Korea, Taiwan and Standard Chartered Bank funding, the merger reserve is considered realised and distr/i.rightbutable.\n- \u00b7 Own credit adjustment (OCA) reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit. Gains and losses on financ/i.rightal liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes designated at fair value through profit or loss relating to own credit in the year have been taken through other comprehensive income into this reserve. On derecognit/i.righton of applicable instruments, the balance of any OCA will not be recycled to the income statement, but will be transferred with/i.rightn equity to retained earnings\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) debt reserve represents the unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financ/i.rightal assets classif/i.righted as FVOCI, net of expected credit losses and taxation. Gains and losses are deferred in this reserve and are reclassif/i.righted to the income statement when the underlying asset is sold, matures or becomes impa/i.rightred.\n- \u00b7 FVOCI equity reserve represents unrealised fair value gains and losses in respect of financ/i.rightal assets classif/i.righted as FVOCI, net of taxation. Gains and losses are recorded in this reserve and never recycled to the income statement\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedge reserve represents the effective portion of the gains and losses on derivat/i.rightves that meet the criter/i.righta for these types of hedges.

Since 1 January 2004, gains and losses are deferred to this reserve and are reclassif/i.righted to the income statement when the underlying foreign operation is disposed.

The maintenance of local regulatory capital ratios could potentially restrict the amount of reserves which can be remitted. In addit/i.righton, if these overseas reserves were to be remitted, further unprovided taxation liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes might arise.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the distr/i.rightbutable reserves of Standard Chartered PLC (the Company) were $15.0 bill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $14.3 bill/i.righton). These comprised retained earnings and $12.6 bill/i.righton of the merger reserve account. Distr/i.rightbution of reserves is subject to mainta/i.rightning min/i.rightmum capital requirements.",

        "page_content": "## 30. Retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group operates pension and other post-retirement benefit plans around the world, which can be categorised into defined contribut/i.righton plans and defined benefit plans. For defined contribut/i.righton plans, the Group pays contribut/i.rightons to publicly or privately admin/i.rightstered pension plans on a statutory or contractual basis, and such amounts are charged to operating expenses. The Group has no further payment obligat/i.rightons once the contribut/i.rightons have been paid.\n\nFor funded defined benefit plans, the liab/i.rightlity recognised in the balance sheet is the present value of the defined benefit obligat/i.righton at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. For unfunded defined benefit plans the liab/i.rightlity recognised at the balance sheet date is the present value of the defined benefit obligat/i.righton.\n\nThe defined benefit obligat/i.righton is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.\n\nActuarial gains and losses that arise are recognised in shareholders' equity and presented in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period they arise. The Group determines the net interest expense on the net defined benefit liab/i.rightlity for the year by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligat/i.righton at the beginn/i.rightng of the annual period to the net defined benefit liab/i.rightlity, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liab/i.rightlity during the year as a result of contribut/i.rightons and benefit payments. Net interest expense, the cost of the accrual of new benefits, benefit enhancements (or reductions) and admin/i.rightstration expenses met directly from plan assets are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they were incurred.\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThere are many factors that affect the measurement of the retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons. This measurement requires the use of estimates, such as discount rates, inflat/i.righton, pension increases, salary increases, and life expectancies which are inherently uncertain. Discount rates are determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on high-quality corporate bonds (or, in countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, government bonds) of a currency and term consistent with the currency and term of the post-employment benefit obligat/i.rightons. This is the approach adopted across our geographies. Where there are inflat/i.righton-linked bonds available (e.g. United Kingdom and the eurozone), the Group derives inflat/i.righton based on the market on those bonds, with the market yield adjusted in respect of the United Kingdom to take account of the fact that liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes are linked to Consumer Price Index inflat/i.righton, whereas the reference bonds are linked to Retail Price Index inflat/i.righton. Where no inflat/i.righton-linked bonds exist, we determine inflat/i.righton assumptions based on a combinat/i.righton of long-term forecasts and short-term inflat/i.righton data. Salary growth assumptions reflect the Group's long-term expectations, taking into account future business plans and macroeconomic data (primar/i.rightly expected future long-term inflat/i.righton). Demographic assumptions, includ/i.rightng mortality and turnover rates, are typically set based on the assumptions used in the most recent actuarial funding valuation, and will generally use industry standard tables, adjusted where appropriate to reflect recent histor/i.rightc experience and/or future expectations. The sensit/i.rightvity of the liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes to changes in these assumptions is shown in the Note below.\n\nRetirement benefit obligat/i.rightons comprise:\n\n|                                                     |   2021  $mill/i.righton |   2020  $mill/i.righton |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Defined benefit plans obligat/i.righton             |                     192 |                     434 |\n| Defined contribut/i.righton plans obligat/i.righton |                      18 |                       9 |\n| Net obligat/i.righton                               |                     210 |                     443 |\n\nRetirement benefit charge comprises:\n\n|                                     |   2021  $mill/i.righton |   2020  $mill/i.righton |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Defined benefit plans               |                      62 |                      81 |\n| Defined contribut/i.righton plans 1 |                     315 |                     277 |\n| Charge against profit (Note 7)      |                     377 |                     358 |\n\nThe Group operates over 60 defined benefit plans across its geographies, many of which are closed to new entrants who now jo/i.rightn defined contribut/i.righton arrangements. The aim of all these plans is, as part of the Group's commitment to financ/i.rightal wellbeing for employees, to give employees the opportunity to save appropriately for retirement in a way that is consistent with local regulations, taxation requirements and market condit/i.rightons. The defined benefit plans expose the Group to currency risk, interest rate risk, investment risk and actuarial risks such as longevity risk.\n\nThe material holdings of government and corporate bonds shown on page 400 partially hedge movements in the liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes resulting from interest rate and inflat/i.righton changes. Setting aside movements from other drivers such as currency fluctuation, the increases in discount rates in most geographies over 2021 have led to lower liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. These have been partly offset by decreases in the value of bonds held but good stock market performance has led to assets broadly holding level over the year resulting in a material fall in the pension defic/i.rightt reported. These movements are shown as actuarial gains in the tables below. Contribut/i.rightons into a number of plans in excess of the amounts required to fund benefits accruing have also helped to reduce the net defic/i.rightt over the year.\n\nThe disclosures required under IAS 19 have been calculated by independent qualif/i.righted actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuations updated, where necessary, to 31 December 2021.",

Retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons continued\n\n## UK Fund\n\nThe Standard Chartered Pension Fund (the 'UK Fund') is the Group's largest pension plan, representing 58 per cent (31 December 2020: 63 per cent) of total pension liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. The UK Fund is set up under a trust that is legally separate from the Bank (its formal sponsor) and, as required by UK legislat/i.righton, at least one third of the trustee directors are nominated by members; the remainder are appointed by the Bank. The trustee directors have a fiduc/i.rightary duty to members and are responsible for governing the UK Fund in accordance with its Trust Deed and Rules.\n\nThe UK Fund was closed to new entrants from 1 July 1998 and closed to the accrual of new benefits from 1 April 2018: all UK employees are now offered membership of a defined contribut/i.righton plan.\n\nThe financ/i.rightal posit/i.righton of the UK Fund is regularly assessed by an independent qualif/i.righted actuary. The funding valuation as at 31 December 2020 was completed in December 2021 by the Scheme Actuary, T Kripps of Will/i.rights Towers Watson, using assumptions different from those on page 399, and agreed with the UK Fund trustee. It showed that the UK Fund was 92% funded at that date, revealing a past service defic/i.rightt of $172 mill/i.righton (\u00a3127 mill/i.righton).\n\nTo repair the defic/i.rightt, three annual cash payments each of $45 mill/i.righton (\u00a332.9 mill/i.righton) were agreed, with the first of these paid in December 2021, and two further instalments to be paid in December 2022 and December 2023. The agreement allows that, if the funding posit/i.righton improves to being at or near a surplus in future years, the payments due in 2022 and 2023 will be reduced or elim/i.rightnated. In addit/i.righton, an addit/i.rightonal payment of $68 mill/i.righton (\u00a350 mill/i.righton) has been made to top up the exist/i.rightng escrow account of $149 mill/i.righton (\u00a3110 mill/i.righton) which exists to provide security for future contribut/i.rightons.\n\nThe Group has not recognised any addit/i.rightonal liab/i.rightlity under IFRIC 14, as the Bank has control of any pension surplus under the Trust Deed and Rules.\n\n## Overseas plans\n\nThe princ/i.rightpal overseas defined benefit arrangements operated by the Group are in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Jersey, Korea, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States of America (US). Plans in Germany, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Taiwan and UAE remain open for accrual of future benefits.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe princ/i.rightpal financ/i.rightal assumptions used at 31 December 2021 were:\n\n|                   | Funded plans   | Funded plans   | Funded plans     | Funded plans     |\n|-------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                   | UK Fund        | UK Fund        | Overseas Plans 1 | Overseas Plans 1 |\n|                   | 2021  %        | 2020  %        | 2021  %          | 2020  %          |\n| Discount rate     | 2.0            | 1.4            | 0.4 - 3.1        | 0.3 - 2.8        |\n| Price Inflation   | 2.6            | 2.2            | 1.0 - 3.1        | 1.0 - 3.0        |\n| Salary increases  | n/a            | n/a            | 3.5 - 4.5        | 2.9 - 4.0        |\n| Pension increases | 2.5            | 2.1            | 1.9 - 3.1        | 1.3 - 2.7        |\n\nUnfunded plans\n\n|                              | US post-retirement medical                               | US post-retirement medical                               | Other 1   | Other 1   |\n|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n|                              | 2021  %                                                  | 2020  %                                                  | 2021  %   | 2020  %   |\n| Discount rate                | 3.1                                                      | 2.8                                                      | 2.2 - 6.7 | 1.4 - 6.3 |\n| Price inflat/i.righton       | 2.5                                                      | 2.5                                                      | 2.0 - 4.0 | 2.0 - 4.0 |\n| Salary increases             | N/A                                                      | N/A                                                      | 3.7 - 7.0 | 3.5 - 7.0 |\n| Pension increases            | N/A                                                      | N/A                                                      | 0.0 - 2.6 | 0.0 - 2.1 |\n| Post-retirement medical rate | 7% in 2021  reducing by  0.5% per  annum to   5% in 2025 | 7% in 2020  reducing by  0.5% per  annum to   5% in 2024 | N/A       | N/A       |\n\nThe princ/i.rightpal non-financ/i.rightal assumptions are those made for UK life expectancy. The UK mortality tables are S3PMA for males and S3PFA for females, projected by year of birth with the CMI 2019 improvement model with a 1.25% annual trend and in/i.righttial addit/i.righton parameter of 0.25%. Scaling factors of 92% for male pensioners, 92% for female pensioners, 92% for male dependants and 82% for female dependants have been applied.\n\nThe resulting assumptions for life expectancy for the UK Fund are that a male member currently aged 60 will live for 27 years (31 December 2020: 27 years) and a female member for 30 years (31 December 2020: 30 years) and a male member currently aged 40 will live for 29 years (31 December 2020: 29 years) and a female member for 31 years (31 December 2020: 31 years) after their 60th birthdays.",

Retirement benefit obligat/i.rightons continued\n\nBoth financ/i.rightal and non-financ/i.rightal assumptions can be expected to change in the future, which would affect the value placed on the liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes. For example, changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligat/i.righton by the amounts shown below:\n\n- \u00b7 If the discount rate increased by 25 basis points the liab/i.rightlity would reduce by approximately $65 mill/i.righton for the UK Fund (31 December 2020: $75 mill/i.righton) and $35 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2020: $40 mill/i.righton)\n- \u00b7 If the rate of inflat/i.righton increased by 25 basis points the liab/i.rightlity, allowing for the consequent impact on pension and salary increases would increase by approximately $45 mill/i.righton for the UK Fund (31 December 2020: $50 mill/i.righton) and $20 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2020: $25 mill/i.righton)\n- \u00b7 If the rate salaries increase compared to inflat/i.righton increased by 25 basis points the liab/i.rightlity would increase by nil for the UK Fund (31 December 2020: nil) and approximately $15 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2020: $15 mill/i.righton)\n- \u00b7 If longevity expectations increased by one year the liab/i.rightlity would increase by approximately $80 mill/i.righton for the UK Fund (31 December 2020: $70 mill/i.righton) and $15 mill/i.righton for the other plans (31 December 2020: $20 mill/i.righton)\n\nAlthough this analysis does not take account of the full distr/i.rightbution of cash flows expected, it does provide an approximat/i.righton of the sensit/i.rightvity to the main assumptions.

        "page_content": "## 31. Share-based payments\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nThe Group operates equity-settled and cash-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services (measured by the fair value of the awards granted) received in exchange for the grant of the shares and awards is recognised as an expense. For deferred share awards granted as part of an annual performance award, the expense is recognised over the period from the start of the performance period to the vesting date. For example, the expense for three-year awards granted in 2022 in respect of 2021 performance, which vest in 2023-2025, is recognised as an expense over the period from 1 January 2021 to the vesting dates in 2023-2025. For all other awards, the expense is recognised over the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.\n\nFor equity-settled awards, the total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares and awards at the date of grant, which excludes the impact of any non-market vesting condit/i.rightons (for example, profitab/i.rightlity and growth targets). The fair value of equity instruments granted is based on market prices, if available, at the date of grant. In the absence of market prices, the fair value of the instruments is estimated using an appropriate valuation technique, such as a binom/i.rightal option pric/i.rightng model. Non-market vesting condit/i.rightons are included in assumptions for the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest.\n\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares and awards that are expected to vest. It recognises the impact of the revis/i.righton of orig/i.rightnal estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remain/i.rightng vesting period. Forfeitures prior to vesting attributable to factors other than the failure to satisfy service condit/i.rightons and non-market vesting condit/i.rightons are treated as a cancellation and the remain/i.rightng unamortised charge is debited to the income statement at the time of cancellation. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when awards in the form of options are exercised.\n\nCash-settled awards are revalued at each balance sheet date and a liab/i.rightlity recognised on the balance sheet for all unpaid amounts, with any changes in fair value charged or credited to staff costs in the income statement until the awards are exercised. Where forfeitures occur prior to vesting that are attributable to factors other than a failure to satisfy service condit/i.rightons or market-based performance condit/i.rightons, the cumulative charge incurred up to the date of forfeiture is credited to the income statement. Any revaluation related to cash-settled awards is recorded as an amount due from subsid/i.rightary undertakings.\n\nThe Group operates a number of share-based arrangements for its executive directors and employees. Details of the sharebased payment charge are set out below.\n\n|                            | 2021\u00b9                  | 2021\u00b9                    | 2021\u00b9                   | 2020\u00b9                  | 2020\u00b9                    | 2020\u00b9                   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                            | Cash   $mill/i.righton | Equity   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton | Cash   $mill/i.righton | Equity   $mill/i.righton | Total   $mill/i.righton |\n| Deferred share awards      | 9                      | 81                       | 90                      | (1)                    | 59                       | 58                      |\n| Other share awards         | 10                     | 67                       | 77                      | (1)                    | 75                       | 74                      |\n| Total share-based payments | 19                     | 148                      | 167                     | (2)                    | 134                      | 132                     |\n\n## 2021 Standard Chartered Share Plan (the '2021 Plan') and 2011 Standard Chartered Share Plan (the '2011 Plan')\n\nThe 2021 Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2021 and is the Group's main share plan, replacing the 2011 Plan for new awards, June 2021. It may be used to deliver various types of share awards, previously granted under the 2011 Plan:\n\n- \u00b7 Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards: granted with vesting subject to performance measures. Performance measures attached to awards granted previously include: total shareholder return (TSR); return on equity (RoE) and return on tangible equity (RoTE) (in the case of both RoE and RoTE, with a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) underpin); strategic measures; earnings per share (EPS) growth; and return on risk-weighted assets (RoRWA). Each measure is assessed independently over a three-year period. Awards granted from 2016 have an ind/i.rightvidual conduct gateway requirement that results in the award lapsing if not met\n- \u00b7 Deferred awards are used to deliver the deferred portion of variable remuneration, in line with both market practice and regulatory requirements. These awards vest in instalments on anniversar/i.rightes of the award date specif/i.righted at the time of grant. Deferred awards are not subject to any plan lim/i.rightt. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating to deferral levels, and is in line with market practice\n- \u00b7 Restricted share awards, made outside of the annual performance process as replacement buy-out awards to new jo/i.rightners who forfeit awards on leaving their previous employers, vest in instalments on the anniversar/i.rightes of the award date specif/i.righted at the time of grant. This enables the Group to meet regulatory requirements relating buy- to buy-outs, and is in line with market practice. In line with sim/i.rightlar plans operated by our competitors, restricted share awards are not subject to an annual lim/i.rightt and do not have any performance measures\n\nUnder the 2021 Plan and 2011 Plan, no grant price is payable to receive an award. The remain/i.rightng life of the 2021 Plan during which new awards can be made is ten years. The 2011 Plan has expired and no further awards will be granted under this plan.",

Share-based payments continued\n\n## Valuation - LTIP awards\n\nThe vesting of awards granted in both 2021 and 2020 is subject to relative TSR performance measures, achievement of a strategic scorecard and satisfact/i.righton of RoTE (subject to a capital CET1 underpin). The vesting of awards granted in 2021 has addit/i.rightonal condit/i.rightons under strategic measures related to targets set for sustainab/i.rightlity linked to business strategy. The fair value of the TSR component is calculated using the probabil/i.rightty of meeting the measures over a three-year performance period, using a Monte Carlo simulat/i.righton model. The number of shares expected to vest is evaluated at each reporting date, based on the expected performance against the RoTE and strategic measures in the scorecard, to determine the accounting charge.\n\nNo div/i.rightdend equivalents accrue for the LTIP awards made in 2020 or 2021 and the fair value takes this into account, calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield.\n\n|                                   | 2021       | 2020       |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Grant date                        | 15-March   | 09-March   |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3)     | 4.9        | 5.2        |\n| Vesting period (years)            | 03-Jul     | 03-Jul     |\n| Expected div/i.rightded yield (%) | 3.4        | 4.2        |\n| Fair value (RoTE) (\u00a3)             | 1.25, 1.20 | 1.40, 1.34 |\n| Fair value (TSR) (\u00a3)              | 0.72, 0.71 | 0.75, 0.72 |\n| Fair value (Strategic) (\u00a3)        | 1.66, 1.60 | 1.40, 1.34 |\n\n## Valuation - deferred shares and restricted shares\n\nThe fair value for deferred awards which are not granted to material risk takers is based on 100 per cent of the face value of the shares at the date of grant as the share price will reflect expectations of all future div/i.rightdends. For awards granted to material risk takers in 2021, the fair value of awards takes into account the lack of div/i.rightdend equivalents, calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield.\n\n## Deferred share awards\n\n|                               |                                          |                               | 2021                                     | 2021             | 2021                                     | 2021                       |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Grant date                    | Grant date                               | Grant date                    | 21-Jun                                   | 21-Jun           | 15-Mar                                   | 15-Mar                     |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | Share price at grant date (\u00a3)            | Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 4.69                                     | 4.69             | 4.9                                      | 4.9                        |\n| Vesting period (years)        |                                          |                               | Expected  div/i.rightdend   yield   (%)  | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected  div/i.rightdend   yield   (%)  | Fair value   (\u00a3)           |\n| 1-3 years                     | 1-3 years                                | 1-3 years                     | N/A,3.4                                  | 4.69,4.24        |                                          | N/A,3.4,3.4 4.90,4.58,4.43 |\n| 1-5 years                     | 1-5 years                                | 1-5 years                     | 3.4                                      | 4.17             |                                          | 3.4,3.4,3.4 4.43,4.36,4.29 |\n| 3-7 years                     |                                          |                               | -                                        | -                | 3.4,3.4                                  | 4.15,4.01                  |\n|                               | 2020                                     | 2020                          | 2020                                     | 2020             | 2020                                     | 2020                       |\n| Grant date                    | 22-Jun                                   | 22-Jun                        | 30-Mar                                   | 30-Mar           | 09-Mar                                   | 09-Mar                     |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3) | 4.27                                     | 4.27                          | 4.67                                     | 4.67             | 5.2                                      | 5.2                        |\n| Vesting period (years)        | Expected   div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3)              | Expected   div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3) | Expected   div/i.rightdend   yield   (%) | Fair value   (\u00a3)           |\n| 1-3 years                     | NA                                       | 4.27                          | NA,4.2                                   | 4.67,4.13        | NA,4.2,4.2                               | 5.20,4.79,4.59             |\n| 1-5 years                     | -                                        | -                             | 4.2                                      | 4.04             | 4.2,4.2                                  | 4.59,4.50                  |\n| 3-7 years                     | -                                        | -                             | -                                        | -                | 4.2,4.2                                  | 4.23,4.06                  |",

With/i.rightn a maturity period of six months after the third anniversary, employees may save up to \u00a3250 per month over three years to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at a discount of up to 20 per cent on the share price at the date of inv/i.righttation (this is known as the 'option exercise price'). There are no performance measures attached to options granted under the 2013 Sharesave Plan and no grant price is payable to receive an option. In some countries in which the Group operates, it is not possible to operate Sharesave plans, typically due to securit/i.rightes law and regulatory restrict/i.rightons. In these countries, where possible, the Group offers an equivalent cash-based plan to its employees.\n\nThe 2013 Sharesave Plan was approved by shareholders in May 2013 and all future Sharesave inv/i.righttations are made under this plan. The remain/i.rightng life of the 2013 Sharesave Plan is one year.\n\n## Valuation - Sharesave:\n\nOptions under the Sharesave plans are valued using a binom/i.rightal option-pric/i.rightng model. The same fair value is applied to all employees includ/i.rightng executive directors. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:\n\n## All Employee Sharesave Plan (Sharesave)\n\n|                                    | 2021         | 2020         |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Grant date                         | 30-September | 30-September |\n| Share price at grant date (\u00a3)      | 4.37         | 3.52         |\n| Exercise price (\u00a3)                 | 3.67         | 3.14         |\n| Vesting period (years)             | 3            | 3            |\n| Expected volatil/i.rightty (%)     | 35.1         | 31.8         |\n| Expected option life (years)       | 3.33         | 3.33         |\n| Risk-free rate (%)                 | 0.42         | -0.07        |\n| Expected div/i.rightdend yield (%) | 3.4          | 4.2          |\n| Fair value (\u00a3)                     | 1.11         | 0.69         |\n\nThe expected volatil/i.rightty is based on histor/i.rightcal volatil/i.rightty over the last three years, or three years prior to grant. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life. The expected div/i.rightdend yield is calculated by reference to market consensus div/i.rightdend yield.",

Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## Subsid/i.rightaries\n\nSubsid/i.rightaries are all entit/i.rightes, includ/i.rightng structured entit/i.rightes, which the Group controls. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, and has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the abil/i.rightty to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The assessment of power is based on the Group's practical abil/i.rightty to direct the relevant activ/i.rightties of the entity unilaterally for the Group's own benefit and is subject to reassessment if and when one or more of the elements of control change. Subsid/i.rightaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group effectively obtains control. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases, and where any interest in the subsid/i.rightary remains, this is remeasured to its fair value and the change in carrying amount is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Associates and jo/i.rightnt arrangements\n\nJoint arrangements are where two or more parties either have rights to the assets, and obligat/i.rightons of the jo/i.rightnt arrangement (jo/i.rightnt operations), or have rights to the net assets of the jo/i.rightnt arrangement (jo/i.rightnt venture). The Group evaluates the contractual terms of jo/i.rightnt arrangements to determine whether a jo/i.rightnt arrangement is a jo/i.rightnt operation or a jo/i.rightnt venture. The Group did not have any contractual interest in jo/i.rightnt operations.\n\n## An associate is an entity over which the Group has sign/i.rightficant influence.\n\nInvestments in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are in/i.righttially recognised at cost. The Group's investment in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures includes goodwill ident/i.rightfied on acquis/i.righttion (net of any accumulated impa/i.rightrment loss).\n\nThe Group's share of its associates' and jo/i.rightnt ventures' post-acquis/i.righttion profits or losses is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquis/i.righttion movements in other comprehensive income is recognised in reserves. The cumulative post-acquis/i.righttion movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associate or a jo/i.rightnt venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, includ/i.rightng any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligat/i.rightons or made payments on behalf of the associate or jo/i.rightnt venture.\n\nUnrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures are elim/i.rightnated to the extent of the Group's interest in the associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures. At each balance sheet date, the Group assesses whether there is any object/i.rightve evidence of impa/i.rightrment in the investment in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures. Such evidence includes a sign/i.rightficant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the Group's investment in an associate or jo/i.rightnt venture below its cost, among other factors.",

Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates continued\n\n## Sign/i.rightficant accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe Group applies judgement in determin/i.rightng if it has control, jo/i.rightnt control or sign/i.rightficant influence over subsid/i.rightaries, jo/i.rightnt ventures and associates respectively. These judgements are based upon ident/i.rightfying the relevant activ/i.rightties of counterparties, being those activ/i.rightties that sign/i.rightficantly affect the entit/i.rightes returns, and further making a decis/i.righton of if the Group has control over those entit/i.rightes, jo/i.rightnt control, or has sign/i.rightficant influence (being the power to partic/i.rightpate in the financ/i.rightal and operating policy decis/i.rightons but not control them).\n\nThese judgements are at times determined by equity holdings, and the voting rights associated with those holdings. However, further considerat/i.rightons includ/i.rightng but not lim/i.rightted to board seats, advisory committee members and special/i.rightst knowledge of some decis/i.righton-makers are also taken into account. Further judgement is required when determin/i.rightng if the Group has de-facto control over an entity even though it may hold less than 50% of the voting shares of that entity. Judgement is required to determine the relative size of the Group's shareholding when compared to the size and dispers/i.righton of other shareholders.\n\nImpairment testing of investments in associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures, and on a Company level investments in subsid/i.rightaries is performed if there is a possible ind/i.rightcator of impa/i.rightrment. Judgement is used to determine if there is object/i.rightve evidence of impa/i.rightrment. Object/i.rightve evidence may be observable data such as losses incurred on the investment when applying the equity method, the granting of concessions as a result of financ/i.rightal diff/i.rightculty, or breaches of contracts/regulatory fines of the associate or jo/i.rightnt venture. Further judgement is required when consider/i.rightng broader ind/i.rightcators of impa/i.rightrment such as losses of active markets or ratings downgrades across key markets in which the associate or jo/i.rightnt venture operate in.\n\nImpairment testing is based on estimates includ/i.rightng forecasting the expected cash flows from the investments, growth rates, terminal values and the discount rate used in calculation of the present values of those cash flows. The estimat/i.righton of future cash flows and the level to which they are discounted is inherently uncertain and requires sign/i.rightficant judgement.\n\n## Business combinat/i.rightons\n\nThe acquis/i.righttion method of accounting is used to account for the acquis/i.righttion of subsid/i.rightaries by the Group. The cost of an acquis/i.righttion is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, together with the fair value of any contingent considerat/i.righton payable. The excess of the cost of acquis/i.righttion over the fair value of the Group's share of the ident/i.rightfiable net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes acquired is recorded as goodwill (see Note 17 for details on goodwill recognised by the Group). If the cost of acquis/i.righttion is less than the fair value of the net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the subsid/i.rightary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.\n\nWhere the fair values of the ident/i.rightfiable net assets and contingent liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes acquired have been determined provis/i.rightonally, or where contingent or deferred considerat/i.righton is payable, adjustments aris/i.rightng from their subsequent final/i.rightsation are not reflected in the income statement if (i) they arise with/i.rightn 12 months of the acquis/i.righttion date (or relate to acquis/i.righttions completed before 1 January 2014) and (i/i.right) the adjustments arise from better informat/i.righton about condit/i.rightons exist/i.rightng at the acquis/i.righttion date (measurement period adjustments). Such adjustments are applied as at the date of acquis/i.righttion and, if applicable, prior year amounts are restated. All changes that are not measurement period adjustments are reported in income other than changes in contingent considerat/i.righton not classif/i.righted as financ/i.rightal instruments, which are accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting policy, and changes in contingent considerat/i.righton classif/i.righted as equity, which is not remeasured.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in a subsid/i.rightary, which do not result in a loss of control, are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity. Where a business combinat/i.righton is achieved in stages, the previously held equity interest is remeasured at the acquis/i.righttion date fair value with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the income statement.\n\nIn the Company's financ/i.rightal statements, investment in subsid/i.rightaries, associates and jo/i.rightnt ventures are held at cost less impa/i.rightrment and div/i.rightdends from pre-acquis/i.righttion profits received prior to 1 January 2009, if any. Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains and losses on transactions between Group companies are elim/i.rightnated in the Group accounts.\n\n| Investments in subsid/i.rightary undertakings   | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| As at 1 January                                 | 57,407                  | 58,037                  |\n| Addit/i.rightons 1                              | 4,023                   | 1,370                   |\n| Disposal 2                                      | (1,001)                 | (2,000)                 |\n| As at 31 December                               | 60,429                  | 57,407                  |",

interest except as listed above, which contribute $17 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $26 mill/i.righton) of the profit attributable to non-controlling interest and $298 mill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $308 mill/i.righton) of the equity attributable to non-controlling interests\n\nWhile the Group's subsid/i.rightaries are subject to local statutory capital and liqu/i.rightdity requirements in relation to foreign exchange remittance, these restrict/i.rightons arise in the normal course of business and do not sign/i.rightficantly restrict the Group's abil/i.rightty to access or use assets and settle liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes of the Group.\n\nThe Group does not have sign/i.rightficant restrict/i.rightons on its abil/i.rightty to access or use its assets and settle its liab/i.rightlit/i.rightes other than those resulting from the regulatory framework with/i.rightn which the banking subsid/i.rightaries operate. These frameworks require banking operations to keep certain levels of regulatory capital, liqu/i.rightd assets, exposure lim/i.rightts and comply with other required ratios. These restrict/i.rightons are summarised below:\n\n## Regulatory and liqu/i.rightdity requirements\n\nThe Group's subsid/i.rightaries are required to mainta/i.rightn min/i.rightmum capital, leverage ratios, liqu/i.rightdity and exposure ratios which therefore restrict the abil/i.rightty of these subsid/i.rightaries to distr/i.rightbute cash or other assets to the parent company.\n\nThe subsid/i.rightaries are also required to mainta/i.rightn balances with central banks and other regulatory authorit/i.rightes in the countries in which they operate. At 31 December 2021, the total cash and balances with central banks was $73 bill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $67 bill/i.righton) of which $8 bill/i.righton (31 December 2020: $7 bill/i.righton) is restricted.\n\n## Statutory requirements\n\nThe Group's subsid/i.rightaries are subject to statutory requirements not to make distr/i.rightbutions of capital and unrealised profits to the parent company, generally to mainta/i.rightn solvency. These requirements restrict the abil/i.rightty of subsid/i.rightaries to remit div/i.rightdends to the Group. Certain subsid/i.rightaries are also subject to local exchange control regulations which provide for restrict/i.rightons on exporting capital from the country other than through normal div/i.rightdends.",

Lim/i.rightted, and a cash in/j.rightection into CurrencyFair of $35 mill/i.righton, which provided the Group with equity of 43.42% in CurrencyFair.

As a result, the Group assessed its investment in associate for impa/i.rightrment and concluded an impa/i.rightrment loss of $300 mill/i.righton was required due to the shortfall between the value-in-use and the carrying amount. The decrease in recoverable amount of Bohai is primar/i.rightly a result of lower forecast cashflows due to the latest published results being weaker than expected.\n\n| Bohai                                  | 2021 $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n| VIU                                    | 1,917                  | 2,943                   |\n| Carrying amount pre impa/i.rightrment\u00b9 | 2,217                  | 2,025                   |\n| Fair value                             | 1,114                  | 1,888                   |\n\n## Basis of recoverable amount\n\nThe impa/i.rightrment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of Bohai, determined by a VIU calculation, with its carrying amount. The VIU calculation uses the following primary inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 short to medium term project/i.rightons based on management's best estimates of future profits available to ordinary shareholders. These project/i.rightons have been determined with reference to the latest published financ/i.rightal results and histor/i.rightcal performance\n- \u00b7 a discount rate based upon a capital asset pric/i.rightng model (CAPM) calculation for Bohai representing the risk-free rate and company risk premiums. Management compares this CAPM against external sources and the cost-of-equity used for transactions in the China market\n- \u00b7 a long term growth rate, for China, which is used to extrapolate in perpetuity those expected short to medium term earnings to derive a terminal value, and\n- \u00b7 an estimat/i.righton of RWAs and RWA growth to determine a capital maintenance haircut to forecast profits. This haircut  is taken in order for Bohai to meet its target regulatory capital requirements over the forecast period. This haircut takes into account movements in risk weighted assets and the total capital required, includ/i.rightng required retained earnings over time to meet the target capital ratios\n\nThe key assumptions used in the VIU calculation:\n\n|                                       | 2021  %   | 2020  %   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Pre tax discount rate                 | 14.83     | 12.75     |\n| Forecast profit long term growth rate | 4.75      | 5.00      |\n| Long term RWA growth rate             | 4.75      | 5.00      |\n| Capital requirement adequacy ratio    | 7. 5 0    | 7. 5 0    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo improve the headroom to zero would require, on the basis of changing ind/i.rightvidual assumptions, an increase in forecast profits by 9.71%, decrease in discount rate by 0.95%, increase in GDP growth rate by 1.16% or decrease in RWAs by 9.6%.\n\nThe movement in RWAs is correlated to forecast profit growth.

Structured entit/i.rightes\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nA structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or sim/i.rightlar rights are not the dominant factor in decid/i.rightng who controls the entity. Contractual arrangements determine the rights and therefore relevant activ/i.rightties of the structured entity. Structured entit/i.rightes are generally created to achieve a narrow and well-defined object/i.rightve with restrict/i.rightons around their activ/i.rightties. Structured entit/i.rightes are consolidated when the substance of the relationsh/i.rightp between the Group and the structured entity ind/i.rightcates the Group has power over the contractual relevant activ/i.rightties of the structured entity, is exposed to variable returns, and can use that power to affect the variable return exposure.\n\nIn determin/i.rightng whether to consolidate a structured entity to which assets have been transferred, the Group takes into account its abil/i.rightty to direct the relevant activ/i.rightties of the structured entity. These relevant activ/i.rightties are generally evidenced through a unilateral right to liqu/i.rightdate the structured entity, investment in a substantial proportion of the securit/i.rightes issued by the structured entity or where the Group holds specif/i.rightc subordinate securit/i.rightes that embody certain controlling rights. The Group may further consider relevant activ/i.rightties embedded with/i.rightn contractual arrangements such as call options which give the practical abil/i.rightty to direct the entity, special relationsh/i.rightps between the structured entity and investors, and if a single investor has a large exposure to variable returns of the structured entity.\n\nJudgement is required in determin/i.rightng control over structured entit/i.rightes. The purpose and design of the entity is considered, along with a determinat/i.righton of what the relevant activ/i.rightties are of the entity and who directs these. Further judgements are made around which investor is exposed to, and absorbs the variable returns of the structured entity. The Group will have to weigh up all of these facts to consider whether the Group, or another involved party is acting as a princ/i.rightpal in its own right or as an agent on behalf of others. Judgement is further required in the ongoing assessment of control over structured entit/i.rightes, specif/i.rightcally if market condit/i.rightons have an effect on the variable return exposure of different investors.\n\nThe Group has involvement with both consolidated and unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes, which may be established by the Group as a sponsor or by a third-party.\n\nInterests in consolidated structured entit/i.rightes: A structured entity is consolidated into the Group's financ/i.rightal statements where the Group controls the structured entity, as per the determinat/i.righton in the accounting policy above.\n\nThe following table presents the Group's interests in consolidated structured entit/i.rightes.\n\n|                                               | 2021  $mill/i.righton   | 2020  $mill/i.righton   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Aircraft and ship leasing                     | 3,450                   | 4,388                   |\n| Princ/i.rightpal and other structured finance | 229                     | 365                     |\n| Total                                         | 3,679                   | 4,753                   |\n\n## Interests in unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes:\n\nUnconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes are all structured entit/i.rightes that are not controlled by the Group. The Group enters into transactions with unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes in the normal course of business to facil/i.righttate customer transactions and for specif/i.rightc investment opportunit/i.rightes. An interest in a structured entity is contractual or non-contractual involvement which creates variab/i.rightlity of the returns of the Group aris/i.rightng from the performance of the structured entity.\n\nThe table below presents the carrying amount of the assets recognised in the financ/i.rightal statements relating to variable interests held in unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes, the maximum exposure to loss relating to those interests and the total assets of the structured entit/i.rightes. Maximum exposure to loss is primar/i.rightly lim/i.rightted to the carrying amount of the Group's on-balance sheet exposure to the structured entity. For derivat/i.rightves, the maximum exposure to loss represents the on-balance sheet valuation and not the notional amount. For commitments and guarantees, the maximum exposure to loss is the notional amount of potential future losses.\n\n|                                                                                 | 2021                                              | 2021                                 | 2021                                              | 2021                                      | 2021                   | 2020                                              | 2020                                 | 2020                                              | 2020                                      | 2020                   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Asset- backed  securit/i.rightes  $mill/i.righton | Structured  finance  $mill/i.righton | Princ/i.rightpal  Finance  funds  $mill/i.righton | Other  activ/i.rightties  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton | Asset- backed  securit/i.rightes  $mill/i.righton | Structured  finance  $mill/i.righton | Princ/i.rightpal  Finance  funds  $mill/i.righton | Other  activ/i.rightties  $mill/i.righton | Total  $mill/i.righton |\n| Group's interest -

Structured entit/i.rightes continued\n\nThe main types of activ/i.rightties for which the Group util/i.rightses unconsolidated structured entit/i.rightes cover synthetic credit default swaps for managed investment funds (includ/i.rightng special/i.rightsed Princ/i.rightpal Finance funds), portfolio management purposes, structured finance and asset-backed securit/i.rightes. These are detailed as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset-backed securit/i.rightes (ABS): The Group also has investments in asset-backed securit/i.rightes issued by third-party sponsored and managed structured entit/i.rightes. For the purpose of market making and at the discret/i.righton of ABS trading desk, the Group may hold an immater/i.rightal amount of debt securit/i.rightes from structured entit/i.rightes orig/i.rightnated by credit portfolio management. This is disclosed in the ABS column above.\n\nPortfolio management (Group sponsored entit/i.rightes): For the purposes of portfolio management, the Group purchased credit protection via synthetic credit default swaps from note-issu/i.rightng structured entit/i.rightes. This credit protection creates credit risk which the structured entity and subsequently the end investor absorbs. The referenced assets remain on the Group's balance sheet as they are not assigned to these structured entit/i.rightes. The Group continues to own or hold all of the risks and returns relating to these assets. The credit protection obtained from the regulatory-compliant securit/i.rightsation only serves to protect the Group against losses upon the occurrence of elig/i.rightble credit events and the underlying assets are not derecognised from the Group's balance sheet. The Group does not hold any equity interests in the structured entit/i.rightes, but may hold an ins/i.rightgnif/i.rightcant amount of the issued notes for market making purposes. This is disclosed in the ABS section above. The proceeds of the notes' issuance are typically held as cash collateral in the issuer's account operated by a trustee or invested in AAArated government-backed securit/i.rightes to collateralise the structured entit/i.rightes swap obligat/i.rightons to the Group, and to repay the princ/i.rightpal to investors at maturity. The structured entit/i.rightes reimburse the Group on actual losses incurred, through the use of the cash collateral or realisat/i.righton of the collateral security. Correspondingly, the structured entit/i.rightes write down the notes issued by an equal amount of the losses incurred, in reverse order of senior/i.rightty. All funding is committed for the life of these vehicles and the Group has no ind/i.rightrect exposure in respect of the vehicles' liqu/i.rightdity posit/i.righton. The Group has reputational risk in respect of certain portfolio management vehicles and investment funds either because the Group is the arranger and lead manager or because the structured entit/i.rightes have Standard Chartered branding.\n\n- \u00b7 Structured finance: Structured finance comprises interests in transactions that the Group or, more usually, a customer has structured, using one or more structured entit/i.rightes, which provide benefic/i.rightal arrangements for customers.

For the purpose of these tables, average balances have been determined on the basis of daily balances, except for certain categories, for which balances have been determined less frequently. The Group does not believe that the informat/i.righton presented in these tables would be sign/i.rightficantly different had such balances been determined on a daily basis.\n\n## Average assets\n\n|                                                                                 | 2021                                                      | 2021                                                    | 2021                               | 2021                                         | 2021                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                                                                 | Average  non-interest  earning   balance  $mill/i.righton | Average   interest   earning   balance  $mill/i.righton | Interest   income  $mill/i.righton | Gross yield  interest   earning   balance  % | Gross yield   total   balance  % |\n| Cash and balances at central banks                                              | 23,612                                                    | 55,991                                                  | 92                                 | 0.16                                         | 0.12                             |\n| Gross loans and advances to banks                                               | 22,335                                                    | 45,953                                                  | 490                                | 1.07                                         | 0.72                             |\n| Gross loans and advances to customers                                           | 56,582                                                    | 307,552                                                 | 7, 5 74                            | 2.46                                         | 2.08                             |\n| Impairment provis/i.rightons against loans and advances to  banks and customers | -

        "page_content": "- 1 Percentage of green lease clause inclus/i.righton in all new and renewed leases with/i.rightn the reporting year.\n- 2 Refers to the Group's headcount as at 31 December 2021.\n- 3 This is a new reporting addit/i.righton for 2021. Market-based data is unavailable for previous years. All aggregate and intens/i.rightty emiss/i.rightons figures use location based data as their foundation.\n- 4  This is a location based consumption value emiss/i.righton. This is zero, as all energy consumed in the UK is from verif/i.righted renewable sources.\n- 5 Measured Scope 3 flight emiss/i.rightons are drawn from reliable data collected from 35 countries, based on seating class and distance flown. This data is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from. As we operate largely outside of the UK, all flights domestic or internat/i.rightonal with flight distance of less than 785km, labelled by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (DBEIS) as domestic flights, have been classif/i.righted as short haul. All flights with distance flown ranging from 785 to 3,700km, labelled by DBEIS as short haul have been classif/i.righted as medium haul. All flights with a distance flown in excess of 3,700km are classif/i.righted as long haul. Note that 2020 scaled up flight emiss/i.rightons, along with associated totals and intens/i.rightty metrics have been restated due to an error made in previous reporting periods. This was an immater/i.rightal change of less than one per cent.\n- 6  We measured data from 98% of our properties to calculate our energy use across our properties. This is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from. Warehouses, empty land, car parks, unoccupied sites for business continu/i.rightty purposes, resident/i.rightal properties, space occupied by automated teller machines, vaults and space sub-let to tenants are excluded from this extrapolation. Figures for renewable, non-renewable and total energy in GWh are rounded to one decimal place - therefore some discrepanc/i.rightes in rounded sum totals may arise. Total consumption figures have been verif/i.righted as accurate from source data. This also applies to previous periods which are therefore restated to the same level of detail. Further detail on the types of energy included with/i.rightn these calculations can be found at sc.com/environmentcriter/i.righta.\n- 7 In 2021, reporting has changed to GWh for this metric. In previous years this was reported in MWh.\n- 8  This value represents the total energy of heating, cooling and electric/i.rightty consumption globally. Total energy use is normalised to reflect periods of vacancy in certain sites during the reporting period.\n- 9  We measured data from 67% of our properties to calculate our water use across our properties. This is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from.\n- 10 Areas of high and extremely high water stress determined according to WRI Aquaduct tool. As accessed on 10 Jan 2022, these countries are South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, UAE, Pakistan, India, Thailand and China. This is a new reporting addit/i.righton for 2021, data is unavailable for previous years.\n- 11  We measured data from 63% of our properties to calculate our waste across our properties. This is then scaled up to reflect the portion of the portfolio we do not gather measurements from.\n\n## Addit/i.rightonal notes on environment data\n\nThe emiss/i.rightons with/i.rightn our inventory correspond to a reporting period of 1 October 2020 to 30 September 2021. This is to allow suffic/i.rightent time for independent assurance to be gained prior to the publicat/i.righton of results. Accordingly, the operating income used in this inventory corresponds to the same period rather than the calendar year used in financ/i.rightal reporting. This is consistent with internat/i.rightonal carbon reporting practice.\n\nWe use an independent third-party assurance provider to verify our greenhouse gas (GHG) emiss/i.rightons. In 2021, our measured Scope 1 and Scope 2 emiss/i.rightons, as well as waste and water consumption, were assured by Global Documentation Ltd, ensuring the accuracy and credib/i.rightlity of our reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our environment reporting criter/i.righta at sc.com/environmentcriter/i.righta\n\nRead our independent assurance report at sc.com/environmentalassurance\n\n<!-- image -->",

There is no impl/i.rightcation for capital gains tax (no gain or loss) when you donate shares to charity, and UK taxpayers may be able to claim income tax relief on the value of their donation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther informat/i.righton can be obtained from the Company's registrars or from ShareGift on 020 7930 3737 or from sharegift.org\n\n## Bankers' Automated Clearing System (BACS)\n\nDiv/i.rightdends can be paid straight into your bank or build/i.rightng society account.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease register online at investorcentre.co.uk or contact our registrar for a div/i.rightdend mandate form.\n\n## Registrars and shareholder enquir/i.rightes\n\nIf you have any enquir/i.rightes relating to your shareholding and you hold your shares on the UK register, please contact our registrar Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavil/i.rightons, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZZ or call the shareholder helpline number on 0370 702 0138.\n\nIf you hold your shares on the Hong Kong branch register and you have enquir/i.rightes, please contact Computershare Hong Kong Investor Services Lim/i.rightted, 17M Floor, Hopewell Centre, 183 Queen's Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can check your shareholding at computershare.com/hk/investors",

CCyB as defined in the Basel III standard provides for an addit/i.rightonal capital requirement of up to 2.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets in a given jur/i.rightsdict/i.righton. The Bank of England's Financ/i.rightal Policy Committee has the power to set the CCyB rate for the United Kingdom. Each bank must calculate its 'inst/i.righttution-specif/i.rightc' CCyB rate, defined as the weighted average of the CCyB rates in effect across the jur/i.rightsdict/i.rightons in which it has credit exposures. The inst/i.righttution-specif/i.rightc CCyB rate is then applied to a bank's total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nThe risk that a counterparty defaults before satisfy/i.rightng its obligat/i.rightons under a derivat/i.rightve, a securit/i.rightes financ/i.rightng transaction (SFT) or a sim/i.rightlar contract.\n\n## CCF or Credit conversion factor\n\nAn estimate of the amount the Group expects a customer to have drawn further on a facil/i.rightty lim/i.rightt at the point of default.

Energy generated off-site in the form of purchased electric/i.rightty, heat, steam or cooling is collected as kilowatt hours consumed using meters or, where metering is not available, collated from vendor invo/i.rightces. For leased properties we include all ind/i.rightrect and direct sources of energy consumed by build/i.rightng services (amongst other activ/i.rightties) with/i.rightn the space occupied by the Group. This can include base build/i.rightng services under landlord control but over which we typically hold a reasonable degree of influence. All data centre facil/i.rightties with condit/i.rightoning systems and hardware remain/i.rightng under the operational control of the Group are included in the reporting. This does not include energy used at outsourced data centre facil/i.rightties which are captured under Scope 3.\n\n## Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons\n\nOccur as a consequence of the Group's activ/i.rightties but aris/i.rightng from sources not controlled by the Group. Business air travel data is collected as person kilometres travelled by seating class by employees of the Group. Data are drawn from country operations that have processes in place to gather accurate employee air travel data from travel management companies. Flights are categorised as short, medium or long haul trips. Emiss/i.rightons from other potential Scope 3 sources such as electric/i.rightty transmiss/i.righton and distr/i.rightbution line losses are not currently accounted for on the basis that they cannot be calculated with an acceptable level of reliab/i.rightlity or consistency. The Group does however capture Scope 3 emiss/i.rightons from outsourced data centres managed by third parties.\n\n## Secured (fully and partially)\n\nA secured loan is a loan in which the borrower pledges an asset as collateral for a loan which, in the event that the borrower defaults, the Group is able to take possession of. All secured loans are considered fully secured if the fair value of the collateral is equal to or greater than the loan at the time of orig/i.rightnation. All other secured loans are considered to be partly secured.\n\n## Securit/i.rightsation\n\nSecurit/i.rightsation is a process by which credit exposures are aggregated into a pool, which is used to back new securit/i.rightes. Under tradit/i.rightonal securit/i.rightsation transactions, assets are sold to a structured entity which then issues new securit/i.rightes to investors at different levels of senior/i.rightty (credit tranching). This allows the credit quality of the assets to be separated from the credit rating of the orig/i.rightnating inst/i.righttution and transfers risk to external investors in a way that meets their risk appetite. Under synthetic securit/i.rightsation transactions, the transfer of risk is achieved by the use of credit derivat/i.rightves or guarantees, and the exposures being securit/i.rightsed remain exposures of the orig/i.rightnating inst/i.righttution.\n\n## Senior debt\n\nDebt that takes prior/i.rightty over other unsecured or otherwise more 'jun/i.rightor' debt owed by the issuer. Senior debt has greater senior/i.rightty in the issuer's capital structure than subordinated debt. In the event the issuer goes bankrupt, senior debt theoretically must be repaid before other creditors receive any payment.\n\n## SICR or Sign/i.rightficant increase in credit risk\n\nAssessed by comparing the risk of default of an exposure at the reporting date to the risk of default at orig/i.rightnation (after consider/i.rightng the passage of time).\n\n## Solo\n\nThe solo regulatory group as defined in the Prudential Regulation Authority waiver letter dated 10 August 2020 differs from Standard Chartered Bank Company in that it includes the full consolidat/i.righton of nine subsid/i.rightaries, namely Standard Chartered Holdings (International) B.V., Standard Chartered MB Holdings B.V., Standard Chartered UK Holdings Lim/i.rightted, Standard Chartered Grindlays PTY Lim/i.rightted, SCMB Overseas Lim/i.rightted, Standard Chartered Capital Management (Jersey) LLC, Cerulean Investments L.P., SC Ventures Innovation Investment L.P. and SC Ventures G.P.
