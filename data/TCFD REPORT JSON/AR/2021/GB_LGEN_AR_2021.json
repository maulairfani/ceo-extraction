No one company can address these challenges on its own, but we can be proud of Legal & General's contribution to the progress made in 2021. We continue to be thankful for the service of key workers and our thoughts are with all those who have suffered during the pandemic, especially those who have lost loved ones.\n\nOur customers rely on Legal & General to pay their pensions, protect their income and manage their assets. We have worked through two years of challenging circumstances and I would like to thank everyone at Legal & General for their hard work and dedication to make sure that we maintained the quality of our service during this time.\n\nIn the complex circumstances of 2021, we have continued to focus on our long-term strategy. Our five growing businesses are building new homes, de-risking pension schemes, providing annuities, protecting customers, and creating and managing socially and environmentally useful investments. We will continue our \u00a333 billion programme of direct investments, which includes investments into key sustainability fields, such as renewables and clean energy.",

        "page_content": "## The climate decade\n\nCOP26 in Glasgow was convened to coordinate and progress the international effort to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C or less. It was more successful than some expected, but less successful than others hoped. We continue to advocate urgent action from both governments and the private sector, and we will continue to use our influence as a large investor to promote the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\nThis transition requires diligent and determined approaches to solving all the challenges of decarbonisation. We continue to regard engagement as opposed to divestment as a more effective way of managing the whole spectrum of these challenges. We will not simply leave the toughest issues to others.\n\nWe are committed to decarbonising both the assets on our balance sheet and our operations to align with the 'Paris' Agreement. We will validate our targets through setting science-based targets.\n\n## Financial resilience\n\nDuring 2021, our business achieved balanced and profitable growth, and we saw the group return to the growth trend rate achieved in the last decade, following the 'pause year' of 2020. Legal & General operated throughout 2021 without accessing any furlough scheme or other Covid-19 business support.\n\nOur adjusted operating profit was \u00a32.3 billion and profit for the year of \u00a32.0 billion was up 30% compared with 2020, reflecting a recovery from the prior year impact of Covid-19. Earnings per share was 34.19 pence compared with 27.00 pence in 2020. We achieved a return on equity of 20.5% and our Solvency II coverage ratio was 187% on a proforma basis.\n\nThe interim dividend of 5.18 pence and the recommended final dividend of 13.27 pence are consistent with our stated ambition. The Board's intention is to maintain its progressive dividend policy.\n\n## Stakeholders\n\nIn the Governance section of this report, we report on our wider engagement with stakeholders.\n\nIn October 2021, we hosted a capital markets event focused on our capital investment business (LGC), with presentations of LGC's strategy, our approach and investment capability, financial performance and ambitions.\n\nIn May 2021 our Annual General Meeting (AGM) was held in our office in London. While, due to Covid-19, shareholders were not able to attend in person, all were invited to join virtually via an online video platform. The Board was delighted to provide shareholders with the opportunity to ask questions live during the meeting.\n\nThe Board is looking forward to welcoming shareholders to our first hybrid AGM this year. Full details of the 2022 AGM and any special arrangements that may be in place in light of Covid-19 will be included in the Notice of AGM that will be sent to shareholders.\n\n## The Board\n\nI would like to congratulate Sir Nigel Wilson on his knighthood; it is a reflection of his extraordinary leadership of the company and of the wider social purpose he puts at the centre of everything we do.\n\nJulia Wilson stood down from the Board on 31 March 2021 following a nine-year tenure. Philip Broadley, Chair of the Audit Committee, has taken on the position of Senior Independent Director following Julia's departure from the Board. We have also recently announced that Toby Strauss will be standing down from the Board at the end of April 2022 following his recent appointment as the Chair of Age UK. I would like to thank Julia and Toby for their immense contributions to Legal & General during their time with us.\n\nNilufer von Bismarck OBE was appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive director in May 2021. Laura Wade-Gery was appointed to the Board in January 2022, bringing extensive knowledge of digital transformation and customer experience. We are also delighted that Tushar Morzaria will be joining the Board in May 2022.\n\nThe Board continues to focus on maintaining a well-balanced and diversified Board with the right mix of individuals who can apply their wider business knowledge and experience to the setting, and oversight of delivery, of the group's strategy.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWhilst Covid-19 remains very much with us, we nevertheless maintain a confident business outlook for 2022.\n\nThe preparations we made, both before the pandemic and those we have implemented over the last year, have ensured that we have been well placed to play an important role in an investmentled economic recovery and to contribute further to addressing critical societal challenges, especially long-term investment in the infrastructure required to reach net zero by 2050.\n\nSir John Kingman Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2022\n\nThe AGM will be held on 26 May 2022.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nWe are a long-term business and set our dividend annually, according to agreed principles. The Board's intention for the future is to maintain its progressive dividend policy, reflecting the group's expected medium-term underlying business growth, including measurement of Net release from operations and Adjusted operating profit.\n\n## Full year dividend p\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinal dividend to be paid on 1 June 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13.27 p\n\n(2020: 12.64p)",

I am proud that our team of over 10,000 people adapted well to the challenges of different working models and continued to deliver great customer service, protecting the financial security of millions of customers.\n\n## The virtuous circle of inclusive capitalism\n\nWe have been operating inclusive capitalism at scale to help re-shape the UK for a decade now. We use our own capital and pension assets from our institutional retirement business to invest back into society. In this way, the savings of older policyholders provide opportunities for younger generations; we call this the virtuous circle of inclusive capitalism. Be it renewable energy generated by Hornsea's wind turbines, urban regeneration in Manchester and Leeds or affordable homes in Bristol, we know it works.\n\n## Stepping up to levelling up\n\nFor Legal & General, 'Levelling Up', and 'Build Back Better', are more than phrases; we are leading the change. We have invested more than \u00a333 billion, targeted to deliver 'Levelling Up' to an economically more productive, net zero economy. We are creating thousands of jobs through transformative regeneration projects from Sunderland to Cardiff.\n\n## Strengthening sustainability\n\nClimate change is both the biggest challenge, and the biggest investment opportunity, of our lifetimes. Long before COP26, as an investor, an asset manager and an employer, we were pushing for climate action and a more sustainable economy.\n\nFor the past 18 months, Michelle Scrimgeour (CEO of LGIM) has co-chaired the COP26 Business Leaders Group, where we mobilised the skills and resources of our peers to target net zero by 2050. COP26 delivered on many of the issues we have campaigned for, but there remains much more to be done; words must now give way to actions delivered at speed and scale.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## How did the business perform in 2021?\n\nDespite the challenges of 2021, our long-term strategy continues to deliver five successful, growing businesses. Our global pension risk transfer business, LGRI, welcomed major new customers and wrote \u00a37.2 billion of premiums. LGRR, our retail retirement business, delivered annuity sales of \u00a3957 million.\n\nOur investment management business, LGIM, is a major global investor with total assets under management of \u00a31.4 trillion, of which \u00a3290 billion is in responsible investment strategies explicitly linked to environment, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Our capital investment business, LGC, grew its alternative asset portfolio by 10% to \u00a33.4 billion.\n\nOur insurance business, LGI, delivered adjusted operating profit of \u00a3268 million. From 1 January 2022, our retail retirement and insurance businesses have come together to form Legal & General Retail, which will focus on serving the savings, protection and retirement needs of our retail and workplace customers.\n\n## What is Legal & General's focus today? Creating a sustainable economy\n\nHistoric under-investment in the UK has to be remedied if we are to create a sustainable economy. This is where the private sector can make a difference. At COP26, we argued that the private sector can bring expertise to convert promises and pledges into real actions.\n\n## Funding innovation\n\nWe look after the workplace pensions of more than four million UK workers and the total savings of all defined contribution pensions will soon exceed \u00a31 trillion. Currently, workplace pensions do not benefit from the same level of growth offered by venture capital funds. Our capital investment business has increased its small and medium enterprises (SME) finance assets under management to \u00a3611 million, supporting over 330 start-up businesses.\n\n## Areas of focus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Addressing climate change\n\nWe are investing in low-carbon technologies, are a world-leading ESG investor and have set ourselves ambitious targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 18 to 19\n\n## Technological innovation\n\nFrom building data centres to supporting our customers, we invest in technology to build a better future for everyone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee pages 22 to 23\n\n## Disrupting markets with technology\n\nAffordable and energy-efficient housing is crucial to 'Levelling Up' throughout the UK. We have a state-of-the-art modular homes factory in Selby and we use our investments in clean technology, such as ground source and air source heat pumps and electric vehicle charging points, to build homes which are capable of operating efficiently. We will enable all homes we build from 2030 to operate at net zero carbon. In the US, our Horizon platform is automating underwriting, helping more people access the protection products they need.\n\n## Delivering on promises\n\nIn 2021, we broke ground on a number of developments that add real growth and real jobs to the economy. As part of our \u00a34 billion partnership with Oxford University, construction began on the new Life and Mind Building. Our investment in Sky Studios Elstree aims to be the most sustainable film and TV production site in the world when it opens in late 2022.\n\nOur \u00a31.5 billion partnership with the University of Manchester will add another tranche of capacity to the UK's scientific capability as we create a new science quarter called IDManchester.\n\nAs we have demonstrated over the last two years, we have adapted to change whilst growing our business. We have been operating inclusive capitalism at scale and are set to continue with this ambition in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sir Nigel Wilson\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe've created a culture where people want to deliver the right outcomes and society trusts us.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Improving wellbeing\n\nWe prioritise the welfare of our employees, who in turn support the millions of people who rely on us.\n\nSee pages 20 to 21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investing in the real economy\n\nOur direct investments range from affordable housing, to science hubs and creative industries.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As the challenges presented by Covid-19 recede, focus is moving to re-building from the economic impacts, including infrastructure development, house building and addressing the effects of ageing demographics, all of which are key parts of our strategy.\n\n## Geopolitical landscape\n\n2022 has seen a range of geopolitical risks come to the fore, with the potential for significant disruption to global economic activity. We are carefully monitoring the impacts for our businesses from a range of geopolitical scenarios and to ensure we remain financially and operationally resilient to adverse events.\n\n## Economic outlook\n\nWhilst global and UK economic activity is returning to preCovid-19 levels, the outlook of a period of sustained inflation, and higher interest rates to those seen for a number of years, will impact consumer sentiment.

Companies increasingly need to find solutions to their ongoing pension commitments. At the same time, individuals need to ensure that their retirement funds and other assets can finance longer retirements.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe aim to be global leaders in pensions de-risking and retirement income solutions, building upon success in the UK and US.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nThe world population's average life expectancy is projected to reach 77 years by 2050 whilst the working-age population declines. We participate in the global pension risk transfer (PRT) market, focusing on corporate defined benefit (DB) pension plans in the UK, the US, Canada, Ireland and the Netherlands, which together have nearly \u00a37 trillion of pension liabilities. Market commentators anticipate between \u00a3150 to \u00a3250 billion of UK PRT demand over the next five years.\n\n## Globalisation of asset markets 2\n\nAsset markets are increasingly globalised and growing. North America, Asia Pacific and Europe are all attractive markets which continue to expand. We look for selective opportunities to build and expand our successful UK business model abroad into markets where we believe we can thrive.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe aim to build a truly global asset management business, entering new markets and expanding our existing operations.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nAs global assets under management are projected to increase from $103 trillion in 2020 to $136 trillion by 2025, we will continue to innovate in the US retirement income market, expand into European wholesale asset management and increase our presence in Asia Pacific.",

We invest pension assets and our own capital into the real economy, delivering financial security for pensioners and fostering growth across towns and cities in the UK.\n\n## Welfare reforms 4\n\nThe plan for adult social care reform in England highlights the continued need to protect people from financial uncertainty. This includes helping people take personal responsibility for saving for their retirement, and safeguarding their financial wellbeing and resilience.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe help people take responsibility for their own financial security through insurance, pensions and savings.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nAs we recover from the impacts of Covid-19, the UK's social security system will be under increasing strain, thereby placing ever more onus on individuals to build and maintain their own financial wellbeing.

Technological solutions can increase security, improve the way we work and how we access information. This can mean the difference between success and failure in business.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nTechnology and innovative solutions improve customers' lives and increase efficiency. We aim to be market leaders in the digital provision of insurance, sustaining our UK leadership, growing in the US and expanding in adjacent markets.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nThe retail protection market is expected to increase to $30 billion in the US by 2025. We anticipate continued premium growth across our UK and US protection businesses as technological innovation makes our products more accessible to customers and supports further product and pricing enhancements.\n\n## Addressing climate change 6\n\nScientists, policy-makers, markets and regulators increasingly agree that we must limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C to avoid potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change. This requires a transition to a low-carbon economy, which in turn creates risk management challenges but also substantial new growth opportunities, including in innovative technologies and clean energy.\n\n## Strategic priority\n\nWe are able to support the fight against climate change through the positioning of our own investments, our influence as one of the world's largest asset managers and through management of our own operational footprint.\n\n## Market opportunity\n\nAs global finance supports the changes our planet needs to address climate change, this creates an important shift in investment allocation and the biggest investment opportunity of our lifetimes. It is estimated that $20 trillion of investment is needed by 2025 alone to put us on the path to achieving global net zero emissions by 2050.",

        "page_content": "## What is the role of capital investment?\n\nOver 2021, our capital investment division, LGC, has continued to evolve and mature. Since inception, our alternative asset portfolio net asset value (NAV) has grown to \u00a33.4 billion, with our total portfolio, including traded and treasury, at \u00a38.6 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nThe capital investment division has three objectives: 1) to deliver shareholder returns; 2) to create assets for our annuity portfolio and third parties; and 3) to secure lasting value for society.\n\nThe division aims to deliver on these objectives through four specific asset classes: 1) specialist commercial real estate (including digital infrastructure); 2) multi-tenure housing; 3) clean energy; and 4) SME finance.\n\n2021 has seen four notable proof-point transactions which demonstrate our ability to create and realise value for shareholders: the sale of MediaCity (with a continuing investment in Manchester via a \u00a31.5 billion SciTech joint venture with the university); the formation of a \u00a3500 million later living joint venture with Natwest Group Pension Scheme; the initial public offering of Pod Point; and the sale of Current Health. Together, these investments generated returns of 1.6 times the initial investment.\n\nAt our capital markets event in October 2021, we restated our ambitions for LGC. By the end of 2025, we aim to grow our alternative assets to \u00a35 billion, and to deliver a 10 - 12% return. In total, our ambition is for LGC to deliver \u00a3600 - \u00a3700 million of annual adjusted operating profit by 2025. Over the same period, we have also set an ambitious target to grow third-party capital to \u00a325 - \u00a330 billion. We see our capital investment division as a source of competitive advantage and a key driver of future growth for the group.\n\n## How are you preparing for IFRS 17?\n\nIFRS 17 is a new accounting standard which will come into effect from 1 January 2023. The standard will impact insurance contracts, which in our case represents business written through our retirement and insurance divisions. Our investment management and capital investment divisions are unaffected. It is worth highlighting that the accounting standard only impacts the timing of profit recognition over the lifetime of the contract - the cash emergence and economics of the contract remain the same.\n\nOur IFRS 17 project represents a significant investment for the business that will deliver new end-to-end finance processes, driving efficiencies as well as meeting the requirements of the new standard. We will continue to assess the quantitative impact of the regime over 2022, with the first comparative results expected in early 2023.\n\n## How does the business consider ESG investments in balancing shareholder returns and doing the right thing?\n\nWe consider ESG through three lenses: 1) how we invest our proprietary assets; 2) how we influence as one of the world's largest asset managers; and 3) how our businesses operate.\n\nWe are committed to decarbonising our balance sheet to align with the Paris Agreement's objective of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and have made steady progress by reducing the carbon intensity of the group balance sheet by 17.0% compared to 2020. We will validate our commitments through setting sciencebased targets. Our climate report, prepared in line with recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), provides more detail on our commitments.\n\nIn respect of how we invest our proprietary assets, ESG assessment forms an integral part of our investment process and, of course, has been central to our mission to deliver inclusive capitalism.\n\nIn terms of assets sourced for our \u00a389.9 billion annuity portfolio, we have seen increased competition for ESG assets in the open market, especially in the clean energy sector. Despite this, we have deployed \u00a31.4 billion in a range of clean energy investments, including solar and offshore wind, and a further \u00a38.1 billion in social infrastructure such as affordable housing, student accommodation and healthcare, whilst delivering above our investment return hurdles.\n\nWe are also able to utilise LGC's strong asset origination capabilities. LGC provides us with ample opportunities to originate ESG-friendly assets that also deliver attractive returns. For example, we have deployed growth equity into new innovative clean technology such as Pod Point and Kensa Group, enabling these businesses to scale up at pace. Our investments in urban regeneration, affordable homes and build to rent accommodation provide significant societal benefit, whilst also benefiting our retirement division and our policyholders. ESG remains a key underpin in our investment process.\n\n## Over the period 2020 - 2024, our cumulative ambition is for:\n\n- \u00b7 cash and capital generation to significantly exceed dividends\n- \u00b7 earnings per share to grow faster than dividends\n- \u00b7 net surplus generation (including new business strain) to exceed dividends.\n\n8 - \u00a39\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are making good progress against our /five year (2020 - 2024) ambitions.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate report\n\nOur 2021 climate report is available on our group website.

See: group. legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\nOur approach to tax supports our purpose of improving lives through inclusive capitalism. We aim for our tax affairs to be sustainable in the long term. This relies on an approach that is well-governed, transparent, and fair to our customers, shareholders and the public.\n\nYou can read more about our tax strategy and governance and what taxes we pay in our tax supplement, which is approved by the Board and can be found here: group. legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\n## Our 2021 tax position\n\nThe effective tax rate for the year of 17.9% is higher than in 2020 (12.1%). The increase in rate is mainly due to the increase in the UK rate to 25% from 1 April 2023, which has resulted in a revaluation of our UK deferred tax balances from 19% to 25%. Our tax rate is also influenced by the different tax rates that apply to profits earned outside of the UK.\n\n## The tax environment\n\nThe tax environment is always dynamic, more than ever in the wake of recent events. Governments around the world will be looking for ways to pay for the exceptional measures brought in because of Covid-19. The additional layers of taxes and legislation which are implemented make managing the tax affairs of large corporates ever more complex, while governments, investors and other stakeholders rightly continue to have high expectations of compliance, risk management and transparency. We will continue to engage with all our stakeholders and supplement our disclosures on tax where we believe these will add value.\n\nIn 2021, we have seen new UK tax-raising measures, such as the corporate tax rate increase to 25%, the 1.25% social care levy, and a new 4% residential property developers tax which will impact our house building businesses.\n\nLooking ahead, it seems likely that the global focus on climate change will result in changes to how businesses pay tax. While 'green' taxes make up a modest proportion of tax revenue at present, such taxes may well become evermore prevalent as the world aims to limit the extent and impact of climate change.\n\nGrace Stevens Chief Tax Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIt is vital that new tax measures are properly considered in the context of their aims, simplicity, existing tax measures and compliance burden to manage the cumulative impact effectively and efficiently for taxpayers, tax authorities and wider society.\n\nAlso in 2021, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) agreed a landmark deal to implement a global minimum tax rate, alongside a tax on digital services based on the end user location. Model rules for the global minimum tax rate were published in December 2021, with the intention that these should be effective from 2023. This is an ambitious target for introducing a new global tax regime and significant effort is required for multi-national groups to achieve compliance with the new rules.\n\nAs our businesses expand internationally, the group will continue to pay more tax overseas and our compliance obligations will increase. This creates new tax risks and complexity for each new territory we enter. We continue to manage these risks and complexities across all the territories in which we operate, to ensure we pay the right tax, at the right time, in the right place, consistent with our tax strategy. Further detail on our four main risk areas - and how we manage those risks - can be found in our tax supplement.",

Our investment management business demonstrated stable growth and our capital investment business grew at pace as the economy recovered from Covid-19, and as underlying investments matured. Our insurance business continued to apply a data-driven approach to optimise the value add of new business in the context of continued high claims experience, especially in the US.\n\nAs of 1 January 2022, our two retail businesses (retail retirement and insurance) have come together to form Legal & General Retail. Under the leadership of Bernie Hickman, this division will focus on serving the savings, protection and retirement needs of our retail and workplace customers allowing us to take a joined-up approach to our customers, data and technology.\n\n## Outlook\n\nOur institutional retirement business is the only player in the direct pension risk transfer (PRT) market writing business in the UK and US, while also innovating our product offering with Assured Payment Policies (APPs). APPs allow companies to begin their de-risking journey with a pathway to buy-in or buy-out at a future date. Our ambition is to write \u00a340 to \u00a350 billion of new UK PRT and $10 billion of international PRT between 2020 and 2025. By the end of 2021, we had already written \u00a314 billion and approaching $3 billion respectively.\n\nThe new retail division's ambition is to be the UK's leading insurance, savings and retirement brand, enabling all our customers to have a secure retirement whilst generating long duration assets and profits for the group and, over time, to expand internationally. Together, we can protect people from financial uncertainty throughout their lives and help to secure the retirement they deserve.\n\nThe three pillars of our investment management business's strategy are: modernise, diversify and internationalise. This positions us to grow our profits, expand our international presence, diversify by client, channel and geography, and to maintain a cost:income ratio in the high 50% range.\n\nThe success of our capital investment business in creating and scaling alternative asset capabilities has resulted in a number of realisations generating high returns on our initial investments. As communicated at the capital markets event in October 2021, our ambition is to build our diversified alternative assets under management to c.\u00a35 billion by 2025, with a blended portfolio return target of 10% - 12%. We plan to increase our third-party capital to \u00a325 - \u00a330 billion (2021: \u00a312.3 billion) to generate additional fees for the business.",

We are the UK's longest serving and largest pension risk transfer (PRT) provider with successful positions in the US and internationally.\n\n## Response to Covid-19\n\nCovid-19 has highlighted the need for scheme administrators to be able to react and adapt to change quickly. Our customer service is provided in-house in the UK, which means that we can make decisions and implement them rapidly. This is evidenced by the fact that we complete 97% of member enquiries within five working days.\n\nThe development of digital solutions including over the phone settlements and the option to sign documentation electronically allows us to continue to offer our services despite the challenges presented by the working from home environment.\n\n## 2021 key activities\n\nIn 2021 we have brought together our expertise in investment management, asset sourcing, mortality trends and longevity risk. We have remained disciplined in the deployment of our capital, selecting opportunities that allow us to invest in high credit quality assets, matching our long-term liabilities and meeting our target returns.\n\n## CCA Global Standard Accreditation\n\nOur retirement business provides income and security in retirement to more than half a million customers and has had a Net Promoter Score\n\n## Institutional retirement sales \u00a3bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a3\n\n7.2\n\nbn\n\nOur internal asset sourcing capabilities, as well as our relationships with our investment management and capital investment businesses, mean that we are well positioned to meet increasing levels of demand for de-risking solutions.\n\nAs of 1 January 2022, Andrew Kail has taken over from Laura Mason as CEO.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Ageing demographics.\n- \u00b7 Investing in the real economy.\n- \u00b7 Addressing climate change.\n\n(NPS) of over 70 for four years, which is widely regarded as being at a 'world class' level.\n\nOur efforts have been recognised after we successfully attained the Customer Contact Association (CCA) Global Standard Accreditation for 2022, marking the third consecutive year that we have received this accreditation.\n\n## New business\n\nIn 2021 we secured premiums of \u00a37.2 billion across the UK, US and internationally compared to \u00a38.8 billion in 2020. In a challenging economic environment we focused on commercially attractive opportunities and maintaining pricing discipline, whilst sustaining our historic market share of 20% - 25% in the UK.\n\n## Opportunities for small- and mid-sized pension schemes\n\n72% of UK pension schemes have assets of less than \u00a3100 million. Within such a vast market it is important that we provide opportunities for small- and medium-sized pension schemes. Last year we completed 31 transactions which were below \u00a3100 million each, totalling \u00a3900 million in premiums. This is a significant increase of transaction volume from 2019, when we launched our streamlined small scheme proposition.\n\n## Net promoter score\n\nInstitutional retirement achieved strong sales of \u00a37.2 billion. We transacted on 57 deals globally, achieving \u00a36.2 billion in premiums in the UK, whilst growing our presence in the US market, writing premiums of \u00a3789 million.

These transactions mark the scheme's first PRT transactions with us and cover two of the three pension sections within the scheme.\n\n## \u00a3310 million buy-in with Reuters Supplementary Pension Scheme\n\nDriving innovation, we agreed a \u00a3310 million full-scheme buy-in transaction with the Reuters Supplementary Pension Scheme. The transaction involved the assessment and insurance of a complex multi-currency benefit structure and is the scheme's first transaction with us. This demonstrates how innovation in the market can cater to each pension scheme's specific needs.\n\n## \u00a3650 million buy-in with Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan\n\nIn December 2021 we agreed a \u00a3650 million buy-in with Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan.

The deal was written on a quota share basis with a new partner, an established Canadian PRT insurer. This marks our second external PRT transaction in Canada and is a strong indication that our strategy of providing reinsurance through a competitive proposition has positioned us well for success in the Canadian PRT market.\n\nWe anticipate further global deals as international markets continue to grow.\n\n## Relationships\n\nWe want to build long-lasting and strong relationships with our clients.

The figures shown include releases associated with changes to future mortality improvements (2021 release: \u00a3nil, 2020 release: \u00a3102 million).\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nTaking on the responsibility for pension scheme liabilities and providing income in retirement exposes us to the risk that people may live longer than we have anticipated, or that we experience defaults in the investments backing our obligations. We remain vigilant in our pricing to the long-term trends in longevity and use reinsurance to manage selected risks. Working with our investment management business' credit and property experts, we seek to continuously assess default risks in our investment portfolio, managing exposures to sectors that may be at risk in the prevailing economic environment and, where appropriate, trading out positions.\n\nagreement. We then tailor each transaction to our clients' needs. This process enables smoother transactions for additional tranches with the same client.\n\nOur close relationship with our investment management business puts us in a strong position to support pension schemes at any stage of their lifecycle. We secured more than \u00a31.5 billion of retirement income through umbrella contracts in 2021, including the transactions below.\n\n## \u00a3760 million buy-in with Sanofi Pensions\n\nWe signed a \u00a3760 million buy-in with Sanofi Pension Scheme securing the benefits of c.2,900 retirees. This marked the scheme's first PRT transaction with us after being a long-term asset management client. This agreement is another great example of our ability to support schemes at all stages of their journey.\n\n## \u00a3130 million buy-in with QinetiQ Pension Scheme\n\nWe signed a \u00a3130 million buy-in with QinetiQ Pension Scheme covering the pension benefits for over 390 new retirees following a previous pensioner buy-in in April 2019. This agreement's umbrella contract will enable future transactions with us to be completed quickly and easily on the same pre-agreed terms.\n\n## The power of pensions\n\nOur retirement businesses generate stable cash flows from pensioners that we can invest to benefit wider society and younger generations. We seek out opportunities to invest capital in an environmentally friendly and socially useful way. We are passionate about the projects we undertake, believing in their transformative power to stimulate positive change in the world.\n\n## Protecting people's pensions\n\nWe announced a \u00a3150 million Pension Protection Fund (PPF) transaction with the Mowlem (1993) Pension Scheme, following the liquidation of its sponsor. This transaction will enable the Trustee to secure benefits with us that are greater than those which would have been provided by the Pension Protection Fund.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are well-positioned to meet increasing levels of demand for de-risking solutions.'\n\n## Laura Mason\n\nChief Executive Officer, Legal & General Retirement Institutional",

We used additional recoveries received through the sponsor's insolvency proceedings, along with the innovative transaction structure that we agreed as part of the original transaction, to provide additional benefits to plan members.\n\n## Contribution to society\n\nBuilding on the efforts we made in 2020, we have continued to be socially mindful. Lighthouse Connect, an education-focused fund launched by us, is on track to deliver more than 230 laptops to Bermuda's students this academic year. Lighthouse Connect addresses the increased need for digital learning tools during Covid-19, while also contributing to the long-term learning of Bermuda's students.\n\n## Build to Rent\n\nWe believe it is more important than ever that we deliver the houses that our society needs to address structural shortages across every dimension of the market.\n\nLegal & General's Build to Rent (BTR) urban platform launched in 2015 and now has 20 schemes in operation or development across the UK and has delivered 7,000 homes.\n\nWe partner with our capital investment business to invest in housing developments. Our BTR and Suburban Build to Rent (SBTR) businesses are a great example of how we invest pension scheme assets to solve our society's needs.\n\nThe SBTR business develops large-scale 'single family' rental communities in suburban locations across the UK. SBTR will partner with housebuilders to bring forward large-scale sites, as well as undertake a direct delivery programme to deliver 1,000 homes each year by 2024. The SBTR housing schemes will be community focused and service-led, offering residents choice, security of tenure and flexibility.\n\n## Our journey to net zero\n\nWe have one of the largest retirement annuity books in the UK and we recognise that our scale brings a responsibility to act decisively on matters such as climate change. We strongly support the 'Paris' Agreement's aim of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and have made the following commitments starting from a 2019 baseline:\n\n- \u00b7 by 2025, reduce portfolio greenhouse gases (GHG) emission intensity by 18.5%.\n- \u00b7 by 2030, reduce portfolio GHG emission intensity by 50%.\n- \u00b7 by 2050, we are targeting a net zero asset portfolio, in line with a 1.5\u00b0C 'Paris' objective.\n\nRefer to our climate report for full details.\n\n60% of LGRI's renewable investments, by market value, are in the UK offshore wind sector and we continue to increase our investment in renewable energy. We have invested in three offshore wind farms with the capacity to provide power for millions of homes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis includes \u00a3370 million invested in Hornsea Project One located in the North Sea. Once completed, it will be the world's largest offshore wind farm with 174 turbines. We have also invested in the Walney Extension, off the coast of Cumbria, and the Dudgeon Offshore Wind Farm off the east coast of England.\n\n## Outlook\n\nEffective from 1 January 2022, Andrew Kail has taken over from Laura Mason as CEO of our institutional retirement business. Andrew brings with him a wealth of industry knowledge and experience, having joined our retail retirement business in 2021.\n\nThe UK PRT market has experienced rapid growth over the past decade. A baseline of over \u00a325 billion per annum of PRT volume is now well established. We expect to see significant growth in both the UK and US PRT markets over the next decade and beyond as more DB pension schemes move closer to full buy-out funding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate report\n\nOur 2021 climate report is available on our group website. See: group. legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\n## Build to Rent\n\nWe have invested over \u00a3500 million in 2021 on the development of four Build to Rent (BTR) schemes in Stratford (pictured), Hove, Southampton and Lewisham, which will create over 1,300 new homes for the local communities. Our well established BTR platform works alongside third parties to develop best-in-class BTR schemes, which help to tackle the UK's housing crisis by using pension funds to deliver thousands of new homes. From 2030, all of our BTR homes built will be enabled to operate at net zero carbon. We are using pensions funds to regenerate cities around the country and supporting the UK economy.",

The business currently comprises the group's retirement savings and income, later life lending and care solutions businesses.\n\nAs of 1 January 2022, our two retail businesses (retirement and insurance) have come together to form Legal & General Retail.

Many of our colleagues have continued to work from home, but we continued to deliver excellent customer service and ensured that all our annuitants continued to be paid.\n\n## 2021 key activities\n\n## Workplace pensions\n\nOur Workplace Savings business was transferred from our investment management business to our retail retirement business at the start of 2021, and now serves 4.4 million people saving for retirement. This allows us to better serve these customers as we are able to provide savings and retirement advice and products to members before and after retirement as their needs change.\n\nAs well as being beneficial for our customers, it allows us to retain their custom for longer and bring greater value to the group.

We understand that everyone's retirement plans will be different and that we need to provide the products and guidance to support this.\n\n## Retirement lending\n\nIn July 2021 we launched our new later life mortgages portal, with greater automation and improved product functionality, to cater for adviser needs and customer choice.\n\nOur recent research shows that a third of all non-retirees (35%) have less than \u00a310,000 in their pension pot, but own a property, and that 22% of current workers plan on using the value of their home to fund their retirement, following record house price increases. We anticipate that using your home to fund your retirement will become more commonplace in the future, whether by downsizing to free up funds or releasing money tied up in your home through products such as lifetime mortgages. To help support this change in need, we continue to add new features to our products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n848\n\nLifetime and retirement interest only mortgage lending advances of \u00a3848 million were 7% higher than the prior year, whilst still maintaining pricing and underwriting discipline.",

In pricing our lifetime mortgages, we also make assumptions for the long-term outlook of the housing market. Our mortgage underwriting seeks to ensure that we are selective in the risks we take on and that our loan portfolio is resilient to a range of economic scenarios.

There are significant opportunities for Sero to work with our existing housing assets and businesses. We also own a 25% share of NTR Asset Management Europe, a Principles for Responsible Investment A+ rated sustainable infrastructure asset manager, with more than \u20ac500 million deployed across two funds.\n\n## Traded portfolio\n\nOur diversified traded portfolio has performed strongly over 2021, while continuing our strategy to shift LGC's asset mix towards alternative assets. Consistent with our publicly stated climate targets, we continue to reduce the carbon emissions intensity of the listed equity portfolio by investing into assets where carbon reduction targets are a key objective or by investing in more climate impact stocks, such as renewable infrastructure companies.\n\n## Outlook\n\nLGC's ambition is to deliver adjusted operating profit of \u00a3600 - \u00a3700 million in 2025. We plan to increase fee-generating third-party capital to \u00a325 - \u00a330 billion (2021: \u00a312.3 billion) by 2025, driven by a wide range of strategies. As part of our ambition, we also target international opportunities, primarily focusing on the US.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nOur early stage investments through Legal & General Capital are inherently exposed to the risk that they do not perform as anticipated. Where we undertake construction activity, we are also directly exposed to health and safety, and environmental risks. We seek to closely manage our real estate and housing market risk exposures, including development costs and changes in property values. Site health and safety is a core focus area across all our property development and operating activities.\n\n## Pod Point\n\nPod Point is an electric vehicle charge point provider first backed by LGC in 2019. Pod Point's partnership with Volkswagen and Tesco has powered more than 10 million miles of travel and helped to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. We expect demand to grow as sales of new petrol- and diesel-powered vehicles will be banned from 2030. Pod Point's IPO in 2021 raised c.\u00a3120m of gross proceeds. This implies a return of 3.8x on LGC's investment, demonstrating our commitment to addressing climate change and our ability to create value through realisations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy investing in and developing high-quality alternative assets, our capital investment business generates attractive risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.'\n\n## Laura Mason\n\nChief Executive Officer, Legal & General Capital\n\nLGC capital markets event\n\ngroup.legalandgeneral.com/CME",

We expanded our virtual screenings' capabilities for protection applicants by providing digital blood pressure machines to a selection of customers requiring a medical assessment, and who qualified to do it virtually. We continued to offer deferred payment holidays where vulnerable customers request help with payments and we have helped our customers to remain protected.\n\nWe paid \u00a32.1 billion of protection claims in 2021, of which \u00a3279 million related to Covid-19, helping families during this devastating time.\n\n## 2021 key activities\n\n## UK retail protection\n\nThere was an increase in demand in the UK retail protection market in 2021. As a result of strong relationships with our key distribution partners and our investment in technology, we maintained a market share of over 25%.\n\nSolvency II new business contribution \u00a3m\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n262\n\nAs of 1 January 2022, our two retail businesses (retirement and insurance) have come together to form Legal & General Retail. Under the leadership of Bernie Hickman, this division will focus on serving the savings, protection and retirement needs of our retail and workplace customers allowing us to take a joined-up approach to our customers, data, and technology.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n- \u00b7 Welfare reforms.\n- \u00b7 Technological innovation.\n\nAdvances in our digital underwriting processes allow us to offer immediate terms to over 84% of our applicants, which we believe to be market leading. We have enhanced our digital offering to align with the changes that our partners and customers require in accessing and buying their financial services.\n\nWe continue to develop our health and wellbeing assistance offering. 'Umbrella benefits' includes two new optional protection benefits - fracture cover and private diagnostics - with access to wellbeing support and rehabilitation support services also available on income protection policies to help advisers offer their clients more choice, more cover and more assistance when they need it most. We expanded our offer to the under-served rental market, with the launch of a non-advised income protection product, illness and injury insurance.\n\n## UK group protection\n\n2021 was a year of innovation, growth and a focus on customers. We launched Protect to the market: a new digital proposition that provides a way for employees to tailor their protection benefits to their own circumstances. We conducted research that showed that, whilst wellbeing is high on businesses' agendas, the\n\n## Gross written premiums \u00a3bn\n\nOur data-driven approach to optimise the value we add from writing new business has delivered a Solvency II new business contribution of \u00a3262 million, a 3% growth on last year in a challenging market. We have focused on higher margin products, enhanced pricing sophistication and continued to deliver good expense management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bernie Hickman\n\nChief Executive Officer, Legal & General Insurance\n\nway they are approaching it varies widely. Recognising this, we refreshed our wellbeing proposition: be well, get better and be supported. This is intended to be easy for our customers to understand and helps clients and their employees when they need it most.\n\n## US protection\n\nBy harnessing data and technology, we are continuing to grow in the sizeable and growing US protection market, which has over $27 billion of term life premiums each year. We seek to be the insurer of choice for families in the US who seek simple, affordable and digitally accessible life insurance.\n\nWe continue to develop our market-leading, digital new business platform, Horizon. Adoption of Horizon is now over 65% of new business and we expect this to increase next year. We have significantly reduced use of physical medical assessments, from 85% of all applications needing a physical assessment at the start of 2020 to less than 50% of applications currently. We have a range of further underwriting innovations being deployed to reduce the need for physical assessments and reduce the time taken to provide an underwriting decision.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3 2.9 bn\n\nGross written premiums grew by 2% to \u00a32.9 billion, driven by increased customer retention and renewals in our UK group protection business as well as strong new business from our distribution reach in UK and US retail protection. Our longer-term focus remains on enhancing competitive advantage through effective use of technology.",

We hold investments in businesses specialising in workplace benefits, insurtech, mortgages, health and care.\n\n## Salary Finance\n\nSalary Finance supports financial wellbeing through employers by offering products such as salary deductible loans, savings and early wage access, which over four million employees in the UK and the US have access to. The UK gross revenue has nearly doubled and the new employee loan volumes in the US have grown fivefold year-on-year. Gross revenue grew to \u00a330 million, an increase of 85% year-on-year. These trends in key metrics are expected to continue with growing employee awareness and increasing platform engagement in both the UK and US.\n\n## Asanto\n\nAsanto is a no-code cloud-based decision making platform developed by our technology business, theidol.com. Asanto allows financial services products to be configured and launched more effectively than traditional legacy platforms by removing the need for IT developers and allowing other business areas to make changes themselves. During 2022, the Asanto team will build more tools in order to provide advanced mortgage services and will partner with a US technology business to modernise the US protection market and make automated underwriting more accessible.\n\nAdjusted operating profit \u00a3m\n\n314\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n268\n\nAdjusted operating profit increased 42% to \u00a3268 million, primarily driven by increased new business contribution and assumption changes (including modelling refinements to the liability discount rate in our retail protection business). This is partially offset by high claims experience, particularly in our US protection business, driven by Covid-19.\n\n## Mortgage services\n\nWe continue to enhance our mortgage services offering to borrowers, brokers and lenders by improving the portfolio of attractive mortgage assets through innovative technology solutions.\n\n## Mortgage club\n\nOur mortgage club is the largest and longest running mortgage club in the UK, facilitating around one in five of all mortgages. We work closely with a broad range of lenders to deliver both mainstream and specific products for our advisers. We saw record lending levels through the mortgage club in 2021, with \u00a397.5 billion of lending transacted. We continue to innovate to pursue our vision of a frictionless mortgage journey for customers.\n\n## Surveying services\n\nAs one of the largest market participants, managing over 528,000 valuations in 2021, we continue to invest in new technology and in refining our digital valuation proposition. Our remote digital valuation solution processed over 49,000 digital valuations, compared with 43,000 in 2020, as lockdowns increased the value of our service to lenders.\n\n## Outlook\n\nEffective 1 January 2022, our insurance business came together with our retail retirement business to form Legal & General Retail - bringing together our people, ideas, and technology so we can be there when it matters most to our customers.\n\nWe continue to target mid-single digit growth in revenues across our UK protection businesses, and to achieve double digit growth in US new business sales.\n\n## Understanding the risks\n\nProviding protection products means that we have to make assumptions about our customers' life spans, how healthy they will be, and how long they will continue with the policy. We seek to price and underwrite our products to take account of these risks, and use reinsurance to manage significant exposures. In delivering our ambition to be a market leader in the digital provision of insurance, as we develop our digital propositions, we are also exposed to technology risks and cyber risks which if not well controlled may lead to both reputational damage and financial loss.\n\n## Automating underwriting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHorizon, our digital new business platform in the US, leverages increasingly available electronic health data, combined with disciplined underwriting and strong expertise from our UK business. Automating our underwriting process and reducing reliance on physical assessments and paper-based evidence will deliver meaningful growth, facilitate new distribution partnerships and provide cost efficiencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe will continue to invest and provide support to customers in our new retail division, incorporating our insurance division with retail retirement to create a single interface for our retail clients.'\n\n## Bernie Hickman\n\nChief Executive Officer, Legal & General Insurance",

We fund critical research into the technologies, and develop the infrastructure, which will enable the transition to a low-carbon economy. Through our relationships with policy-makers, institutional clients and other stakeholders, we influence public debate and corporate actions on a range of sustainabilityrelated issues and we demonstrate the power of capital to solve problems. At its core, our business is geared around providing access to financial services for those who need them.\n\nBeing a responsible and sustainable business remains at the heart of our agenda.\n\nDuring 2021, the market's focus on environment, social and governance (ESG) matters continued to intensify. We have long believed that these issues are critical to the ways in which we do business. Our prosperity as a company depends on a strong and resilient society and a stable economic context. It is increasingly clear that this will only be achieved for the long term if environmental, social and health concerns are addressed by companies such as Legal & General.\n\nDuring 2021 we reviewed our sustainability strategy. Our 2021 sustainability report, to be published later in 2022, will include more detail on our achievements in 2021 and our future strategy. In the meantime, we have continued to take steps on our journey to net zero, contributed to the creation of a better society and worked to ensure our company is governed in a responsible way, consistent with our goal to be a sustainable business.\n\n## Journey to net zero\n\nWe recognise that 'environment' encompasses more than just climate change and we face a broad set of specific risks and opportunities across our businesses and balance sheet.\n\nInvestment portfolio carbon footprint (Scope 3 investments)\n\n74\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScientific and policy opinion continue to emphasise the need to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C or lower in order to avoid the most catastrophic physical and economic risks associated with climate change. 2021 was the second year of the 'climate decade', and while COP26 gave grounds for cautious optimism, there remains much to be done to align across the economy on the need to act.\n\nWe have continued our journey to net zero. There are three principal ways in which we contribute to a low-carbon future:\n\n- \u00b7 investing our own assets in low-carbon technology and infrastructure. We also seek to reduce the environmental impact of our investments - such as in affordable and build to rent housing - which serve a social purpose.\n- \u00b7 influencing others, both using our position as one of the world's largest asset managers and leveraging our relationships with policymakers and in public debate.\n- \u00b7 operating our business in a way which seeks to reduce our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.\n\nKey progress in 2021 includes:\n\n- \u00b7 bringing our climate scenario modelling capabilities in-house.\n- \u00b7 constructing our first net zero carbon retirement community.\n- \u00b7 working towards setting and validating science-based targets, which will be disclosed in 2023.\n- \u00b7 appointing Simon Gadd as Group Climate Change Director and Nilufer von Bismarck as non-executive director with focus on climate.\n\n## Investing our own assets\n\nWe fund investments in technology and infrastructure which are aligned with the Paris Agreement's objective of limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C. We have invested \u00a31.4 billion in clean energy to date and we have commitments to decarbonise our balance sheet. We choose to engage with companies to support and encourage them to decarbonise before divesting. Please refer to our climate report for full details.\n\n## Purpose: Measures the greenhouse gases associated with our investment portfolio.\n\nThe carbon emission intensity of our proprietary assets was 74 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per \u00a31 million invested, down 17.0% from last year. This is due to a combination of refinements to methodology, the organic decarbonisation of our investments, which includes an impact from Covid-19, along with changes in our portfolio, such as that driven by our coal divestments as well as the impact of market movements on company valuations.\n\nOur Scope 3 non-investment emissions (business travel, working from home and serviced offices) were 5,466 tCO2e.\n\n- 1. 2020 figure rebased (previously reported as 117 tCO2e).

During 2021, we joined a number of initiatives which either demonstrate progress made, or set out our ambition for further progress:\n\n- \u00b7 the UK Government's Get Nature Positive campaign, in recognition of the role that protecting and restoring biodiversity will play in creating a more sustainable future.\n- \u00b7 as one of the 236 members of the Net Zero Asset Managers' Alliance, we were part of that body's announcement that $4.2 trillion of assets are now being managed in line with achieving net zero by 2050.\n- \u00b7 the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, contributing towards its commitment of $130 trillion in private capital to finance the economic transition to net zero.\n\n## Operational carbon footprint\n\nOur operational carbon footprint is detailed below and includes the carbon footprint from the operations we directly control, including the energy consumed:\n\n- \u00b7 in our core occupied offices.\n- \u00b7 from our landlord activities.\n- \u00b7 from the construction of new homes within our housing businesses, including joint ventures.\n\nOperational footprint (Scope 1 and 2 location)\n\n30,706\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2021 we have taken steps towards our net zero targets:\n\n- \u00b7 business travel: whilst the carbon from our 2021 business travel has remained lower (71%) than in 2019, due to Covid-19 restrictions, we have still accounted for the carbon impact of our employees' journeys associated with business travel. We relaunched our business travel policy, focusing on sustainable modes of transport and enhancing our business travel booking system to enable users to understand the carbon associated with their journey and therefore make informed and sustainable travel choices.\n- \u00b7 occupied offices: we undertook net zero carbon audits of our core occupied offices, the outputs of which will feed into our future of work strategy, with the aim of achieving net zero emissions from 2030.\n- \u00b7 renewable energy: several of our businesses were impacted by energy suppliers ceasing to trade and as a result our Scope 2 - Marketbased emissions have increased.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2023 we expect our operational footprint to increase due to the recovery from Covid-19, as working patterns change and business travel increases.\n\nHowever we will continue to manage and reduce the carbon emissions from our operational footprint through identifying efficiencies and improvements in technology, increasing the consumption of onsite and offsite renewable energy, designing and building energy-efficient homes and buildings, and seeking to better understand and manage our need to travel for business.\n\n## Purpose: Measures the greenhouse gases associated with our direct operations.\n\nDue to the impact of Covid-19 it is difficult to draw meaningful comparisons between 2021 and 2020.

As communities began to recover from Covid-19 in 2021, the importance of our efforts to build a better society became more pronounced than ever.\n\nWe are committed to making investments and managing money in ways which are socially useful. This year we shaped our response around the need to continue supporting communities affected by Covid-19, while thinking ahead to future social needs and continuing to tackle the most pressing issues facing us today.\n\nOur work to build a better society has focused on five key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 investing in solutions to the housing crisis and regenerating our towns and cities.\n- \u00b7 supporting healthcare systems and partnering on research.\n- \u00b7 helping young people in the aftermath of Covid-19.\n- \u00b7 working with social enterprises.\n- \u00b7 funding community groups and supporting our employees' activities.\n\n## Housing and city regeneration\n\nWe are tackling the housing crisis by investing in affordable housing, alongside our mainstream build to rent and build to sell businesses. By investing institutional capital at scale, we are able to provide safe, secure, affordable housing where it is most needed.\n\nwhich we gained planning permission in 2021 will be affordable. The use of air source heat pumps, photovoltaic cells and high-quality building standards will place the homes in the top 1% nationally for energy performance. Meanwhile, our 153 modular homes planned at Broadstairs, Kent will have public amenity added in the form of 8,500 new trees.\n\nOur \u00a31 billion, 2,750-home plan for North Horsham, Sussex saw us bring together our affordable, suburban build to rent and modular housing businesses for the first time in a multi-tenure site, with a school and other community amenities.\n\nThe housing crisis affects people of all age groups, and there is a shortage of age-appropriate homes for older people in the UK. Our Millfield Green retirement community in Bedfordshire will provide 200 such homes within a net zero development, using ground source heat pump technology from Kensa, an investee company, to reduce running costs and emissions and insulate residents against energy price rises.\n\nA new partnership between our real assets business and 'believe housing' will fund 1,200 new affordable homes in the next five years in the north-east of England. Meanwhile, in Leeds city centre, the new \u00a357 million Tower Works development sees us funding a development site through our build to rent fund. In Manchester, we are partnering with Bruntwood and the University of Manchester to deliver a new \u00a31.5 billion innovation district covering four million square feet in the city centre.\n\nDuring 2021, our affordable homes business announced its pipeline stood at 5,500 homes across the UK.

The Legal & General and Institute of Health Equity (IHE) Places Fund will examine how improvements to the design and construction of our towns and cities can help to address health inequalities and support 'levelling up' across the UK's regions.\n\nIn November 2021 we broke ground on the Life and Mind Building, part of our \u00a34 billion partnership with the University of Oxford. The new facility will be the university's largest teaching building and support scientists working in biology and psychology to solve some of our major global challenges.\n\nWe continue to support the University of Edinburgh's Advanced Care Research Centre (ACRC), which aims to find solutions that support the quality of life for older people.\n\n## Helping young people after Covid-19\n\nThe pandemic, with its knock-on effects on education and employment, hit young people particularly hard. We continued to support them in accessing education and in providing opportunities to develop skills to access employment.\n\nmentoring and networks in businesses including Legal & General. The programme is purposefully targeted to those sections of the community which have traditionally been less able to access such opportunities.\n\nWe supported the Duke of Edinburgh's Awards' Youth Without Limits strategy, designed to widen accessibility of the scheme to more young people. The focus of our support was in south Wales and north-eastern England.\n\n## Working with social enterprises\n\nOur support for small social enterprises this year took the form of the SE-Assist programme, run by CAF Venturesome, the Charities Aid Foundation's social enterprise arm. Supported by Legal & General, SE-Assist awarded \u00a3300,000 in blended finance to social enterprises across Wales - the fifth round of such investments.\n\n## Funding community groups and supporting our employees' activities\n\nWe have continued to support our employees' fundraising and volunteering efforts through matched funding schemes. The total donated to UK charities including through company matching during 2021 was \u00a31.3 million, including over \u00a390,000 in funding to charities with income below \u00a31.5 million in our Small Donations campaign. In the US, our charity drive raised over $800,000.\n\nIn the UK, we continued our partnership with the Samaritans, where our funding supported the expansion of the charity's training programmes. We were headline sponsors of the charity's inaugural Dawn Walk, which raised \u00a360,000.\n\nWe built on our position as founding partners in the digital and business skills programme, FastFutures, increasing our investment by \u00a3100,000 this year. We funded three additional cohorts, providing young people from underrepresented backgrounds with the opportunity to access online learning,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe believe that business can be a force for good in society if we work to identify areas where we can positively impact people's lives.

Not only is it the right thing to do, but we believe that diversity of experience brings diversity of thought and perspective, which in turn drives greater proximity to customers, better-informed decisions, and a culture which more readily embraces innovation.\n\nOur vision, our action plan and measuring our progress are the responsibility of our global Diversity and Inclusion Council, which reports to the Group Board and is chaired by Laura Mason, CEO of our capital investment business.\n\n## More diversity, greater inclusion: progress on our action plan\n\nA key focus for 2021 was continuing to build a better picture of our employee base, and to do this, we focused on increasing the quantity of characteristic data we hold on our employees. As this is shared with us on a discretionary basis, we ran a communication and engagement programme, 'Count Me In', encouraging employees to share information about their background (ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, socio-economic background and others). During 2021, the rate of disclosure for ethnicity increased from 52.6% to 67.9%. Across all other characteristics, we saw an average 79% increase (from a lower average baseline of disclosure).\n\nDuring 2021, we:\n\n## focused on recruitment and early careers:\n\n- \u00b7 conducted an audit of our recruitment practices to assess our maturity across a range of D&I characteristics (including gender, age and ethnicity) to help us understand where improvements to our talent attraction and hiring approach can be made. We introduced anonymised CVs into our recruitment processes.\n- \u00b7 continued our support for the #10000BlackInterns programme by providing internship opportunities at LGIM for 17 black students.\n- \u00b7 through our socio-economic mobility employee group, undertook a programme of engagement and outreach activities including mentoring students from under-represented backgrounds through our partnership with Kingston University's Beyond Barriers Mentoring Scheme.\n\n## continued to train line managers on D&I:\n\n- \u00b7 piloted a new inclusive line management programme with 100 managers.\n- \u00b7 introduced D&I basics learning (the 'inclusion accelerator') - a digital learning programme for line managers based on short learning sprints, covering key D&I themes. Among the 100 leaders who have been through this pilot, understanding of core D&I concepts (bias, micro-messages and working inclusively) increased by 95%.\n\n## widened opportunities for employees:\n\n- \u00b7 launched a global mentoring platform, which saw over 370 people register in the first three months; developed reverse mentoring for our senior leadership teams, giving them an opportunity to learn from more junior employees.\n- \u00b7 continued to support our employee representative groups. Three new groups were launched: Women and Tech; the Ability Working Group; and an inclusion network for those in our insurance business.\n\nWe also issued internal communications celebrating Inclusion Week, Black History Month, Pride Month and International Women's Day; continued to tell diverse employee stories through the 'Our Story' campaign; and had the Chairman of our Board participate in a Listening Project focus group, where he heard from employees about their lived experience of diversity and inclusion at Legal & General.\n\n## Measuring our progress\n\nIn our most recent group-wide employee survey (Voice), our people gave us a favourable score of 75% when asked if everyone has an equal chance to succeed at Legal & General - level with our 2020 score.\n\nThrough the Women In Finance Charter, we have committed to achieving overall workforce gender balance by 2025; 40% female representation among managers and senior managers; and 33% female representation on our Board. We support the FCA's recent consultation on increasing Board representation for women to 40%.\n\n| Legal & General's workforce   | Female   | Male   |\n|-------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Board directors               | 3        | 7      |\n| Executive Committee           | 3        | 9      |\n| Middle/senior management      | 1,570    | 2,769  |\n| All employees                 | 4,779    | 5,964  |\n\nAs at 31 December 2021\n\nThis year, we additionally committed to achieving 8% representation for ethnic minority employees among senior leaders and on our Group Board, both of which we achieved during 2021 (at 12% and 20% respectively).",

We also attained the level of 'Advanced Employer' in the Investing in Ethnicity Maturity Matrix, recognising our commitment and progress to ensure equal opportunity and representation, regardless of ethnicity.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\nIn 2021 we again saw a continued, progressive narrowing of our median pay gap, from 26.6% to 24.1%, with positive movement in all our reportable entities.\n\nPlease see our separate gender pay gap report for full data and commentary.\n\n| Gender  pay gap   | 2021   Mean   | 2021  Median   | 2020   Mean   | 2020  Median   |\n|-------------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Hourly pay        | 26.3%         | 24.1%          | 30.8%         | 26.6%          |\n| Bonus             | 53.1%         | 42.1%          | 48.0%         | 40.6%          |\n\n## Employee wellbeing Supporting our employees' wellbeing\n\nIf 2020 was characterised by protecting our employees from the physical and mental wellbeing threat of Covid-19, 2021 was a year in which we supported them through a safe return to workplaces and continued to offer support on both physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nFor those employees accessing or returning to our workplaces, we continued to apply safety measures in line with government guidance, including social distancing, sanitisation, temperature checks and providing lateral flow tests (before these were made available on the NHS in the UK). Throughout the return to the office, we worked in partnership with the trade union Unite and our own management consultative forum.\n\n## A commitment to mental health\n\nWe are committed to supporting our people with their mental health. This includes providing a safe and open environment where colleagues feel empowered to speak up about any mental health challenges they may be facing. Therefore, communicating our mental health provision to employees remained a focus during 2021. We marked Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK and US, as well as World Mental Health Day, with internal communications. All of these were opportunities to remind employees about our support offering:\n\n- \u00b7 our network of 100 mental health first aiders.\n- \u00b7 our partnership with market-leading mental health app Unmind.\n- \u00b7 our employee assistance programme and private healthcare provision.\n\nOur communications focused on the importance of normalising discussions about mental health, and included personal testimonials from our Chief Technology Officer and a wellbeingthemed conversation between Jeff Davies, Group Chief Financial Officer and executive sponsor for wellbeing, and Sir Nigel Wilson, Group Chief Executive Officer, which was published on our intranet.\n\nOur efforts to support employee wellbeing were recognised by the City Mental Health Alliance's award of an 'Excelling' accreditation mark in its annual Thriving at Work assessment.\n\nWe take a data-driven approach to managing workplace mental health. We draw insights from a range of sources including our Voice surveys (see page 50) and sickness and other employee data and use these to inform our existing strategies and policies on topics including diversity and inclusion, stress and flexible working, among others.\n\nIn response to employee feedback, we launched our first menopause policy in 2021, covering all employees in our core UK businesses and setting out our approach to supporting those experiencing the menopause.\n\n## Employee engagement Keeping our people connected and informed\n\nDuring 2021 we built on the progress made during 2020 in keeping our employees informed about life at Legal & General and connected with our corporate purpose. We continued to focus on managing the impacts of Covid-19, with communications to keep employees informed about the practical measures taken to keep them safe, and new messages developed and communicated about our future hybrid ways of working.\n\nOngoing remote or hybrid working has presented the risk of erosion of organisational culture and, to mitigate this, we increased our efforts to communicate our corporate purpose to our employees. We continued to deliver virtual town halls, both at a divisional and group level, including for our full-year results, and launched a new video series, 'Your Question Time', in which employees are invited to ask members of the Executive Committee questions of interest. The recordings are shared on the corporate intranet. Topics covered include wellbeing, inclusive capitalism and emerging technology.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to supporting our people with their mental health. This includes not only providing services and help for those who su/ffer directly with mental ill-health, but also creating a safe and open environment where employees feel supported, connected and engaged in meaningful work. It is also important that we tackle stigma by empowering them to speak up about any mental health challenges they are facing.'\n\n## Sir Nigel Wilson\n\nGroup Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender pay gap report\n\nOur 2021 gender pay gap report is available on our group website.

        "page_content": "## A sustainable business continued\n\nIn our November 2021 employee survey (Voice), 83% of employees either agreed or strongly agreed with the statement 'I can get the support I need from my line manager' (up 1% vs 2020). 70% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement 'My overall level of personal wellbeing is good' (a new measure for 2021).\n\nThe operation of our core offices is managed via a health and safety system aligned with ISO45001 and audited by the consultancy RPS.\n\n## Listening to our people's views\n\nDuring 2021 we issued two Voice surveys. With our focus shifting from managing the acute pandemic crisis to planning for a post-lockdown future, we consulted with our employees through bespoke 'future of work' surveys in March 2021. The insights and data gathered, supplemented by stakeholder interviews and engagement with employee representatives, helped inform our planning for the post-Covid workplace.\n\nMore information on employee engagement can be found in an update from Lesley Knox, our designated workforce director, on page 74.\n\n## Learning and development Empowering our people to perform at their best\n\nWe are committed to empowering our people to perform at their best in their role today, develop in their career tomorrow and connect with peers to drive business performance.\n\nThis approach to learning and development informed our activity during 2021. We routinely identify opportunities for our people through:\n\n- \u00b7 our strategic workforce planning process, which defines our future capability needs and aligns these with our business and financial plans.\n- \u00b7 use of employee feedback, received both through direct conversation with our talent and development practitioners and through our employee survey, Voice.\n- \u00b7 applying qualitative and quantitative impact analysis from previous learning interventions and business metrics to shape future programmes.\n\nWe apply this methodology to help us build a data-led, consistent development experience for all our employees. It also helps us to focus on driving our four strategic outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 leaders who deliver change and business results through inclusive leadership. This year, we launched Thriving, a global leadership programme, to three cohorts of leaders.\n- \u00b7 employees who can access talent and development experiences in a straightforward way. We appointed a new managed learning service provider to enable this.\n\nEmployee satisfaction index\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 a workforce which consists of future-ready professionals with the skills they need both now and in future. In 2021, we rolled out the Critical Capabilities programme - see page 47 for more.\n- \u00b7 a performance-driven culture characterised by high levels of trust and challenge.\n\n## Supply chain A sustainable supply chain\n\nWe believe that the sustainability of our supply chain goes beyond risk avoidance: it is also about positive impact, for people and the planet. We recognise the importance that deepening our understanding of the impacts our supply chain can have, as well as improving procurement professionals' knowledge of sustainability. In 2021 we engaged third-party experts to help us build and deliver training to procurement team members and supplier relationship managers to help us adapt what we procure and how we source; scrutinise our procurement partners; and influence our suppliers to improve.\n\nAlongside this activity, we took steps to improve elements of our supply chain governance. We further refined our sustainable sourcing principles statement to aid ease of use, make the case for the importance of sustainable sourcing and provide tangible actions. This has created what we consider to be a more compelling document which will engage and inspire people in our business to become part of our sustainable sourcing mission.\n\nWe also completely redesigned our supplier questionnaire on corporate responsibility. This incorporates 35 questions on themes including firms' carbon reduction intentions, deforestation, the circular economy, living wages and working hours, D&I and social enterprises. The use of question targeting, scoring and weighting alongside guidance notes - helps us to assess results and therefore pre-qualify and score suppliers and 'request for proposal' responses. The revised questionnaire will be used with our supplier relationship management teams to ensure that any in-contract risks are captured and monitored, along with the maturity of our supply chain.\n\n## Purpose: Measures employee satisfaction in response to the statement 'I am happy working at Legal & General'\n\n77% of employees took part in the fourth quarter Voice survey, providing 27,684 individual comments. Our employee satisfaction score fell by one point to 76 compared to October 2020, although it remains above pre-pandemic levels (74 in March 2020). Our research indicates that our employees have adapted well to changes in the way we work, enabled by their line managers, but work-life balance remains a challenge for some.",

        "page_content": "We have become an active member of the Supplier Diversity Council UK with the goal of providing practical guidelines and support on implementing a supplier diversity programme which is inclusive of all.\n\n## Modern slavery and human rights\n\nWe believe that setting and progressing a clear strategy, as well as working in partnership with suppliers, is key to addressing and eliminating modern slavery from supply chains.\n\nWe have created a risk assessment process which we will complete for the remainder of our supply chain, allowing us to categorise each key supplier, strategic partner or contractor based on modern slavery risk criteria.\n\nAlongside Stronger Together, we delivered training to 40 of our suppliers on spotting signs of modern slavery in their own operations and supply chain.\n\nOur human rights policy, published in 2020, sets out our position on these issues in our own operation and our supply chain. We support the principles set out in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; the International Bill of Human Rights; and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Core Conventions.\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe will not tolerate any person acting on behalf of the group participating in any form of corrupt practice and we will not accept, promise, offer or give anything that may be considered a bribe. Our financial crime risk policy applies across the group and mandates that controls are put in place to detect and prevent such activity. Controls include an annual bribery and corruption risk assessment; regular training; due diligence measures; reporting of suspicions of bribery and corruption; and the control and approval of giving and receiving of gifts and hospitality, political and charitable donations, and corporate sponsorship.\n\n## Responsible investing\n\nOur position as a leading asset manager gives us an opportunity to influence other companies' approaches to meeting their ESG obligations.\n\nClimate change remains a dominant theme of engagement, as we continue to hold companies to account on their progress to net zero. Alongside this, we are committed to stepping up action on the interrelated issues of deforestation and biodiversity loss, as outlined in our biodiversity policy and our deforestation commitment.\n\nIn 2021, our investment management business continued to actively engage in sustainability policy dialogue with policy-makers and regulators around the world, primarily with leaders in UK, EU, US, Japanese and Australian markets. Topics have ranged from strengthening transparency across sustainable finance and the improvement and harmonisation of disclosure standards, to minority shareholder rights and supporting policies that credibly deliver on the transition to net zero.\n\nWe have further deepened our commitment to gender diversity , taking it beyond the board level to ensure the largest companies in the US and UK also have a minimum of one female on the Executive Committee. We will begin voting in line with this expectation in 2022.\n\nFollowing our support of the Parker review on diversity on UK boards, 2022 will see us applying voting sanctions against large UK and US companies with no board members from an ethnic minority background.\n\nGood health is the basis on which social wellbeing and economic prosperity are built. In 2022, we will continue to promote awareness and action on antimicrobial resistance, access to medicine and access to nutrition. This includes a willingness to file or co-file shareholder resolutions, as recently demonstrated at Moderna. Inequality and health are interconnected; through our ongoing work on income inequality we are increasingly emphasising the importance of employee wellbeing.\n\n## Non-financial and sustainability reporting statement\n\nUnder sections 414CA and 414CB of the Companies Act 2006, we are required to include in our strategic report a non-financial information statement.\n\nThis section of the strategic report (pages 42 to 51) provides the following information required to be included in the non-financial information statement:\n\n- \u00b7 environmental matters\n- \u00b7 our employees\n- \u00b7 social matters\n- \u00b7 human rights\n- \u00b7 anti-corruption and bribery.\n\nIn addition, other required information can be found on the following pages:\n\n- \u00b7 business model (pages 12 to 17)\n- \u00b7 principal risks and how they are managed (pages 52 to 59)\n- \u00b7 non-financial key performance indicators (pages 42 to 51).\n\nDetails of relevant policies, due diligence processes, the outcome of these policies and processes, and our non-financial key performance indicators are contained throughout the strategic report.\n\nOur non-financial and sustainability reporting statement focuses on the stakeholders and issues that are important for us to deliver on our purpose of inclusive capitalism.\n\nPublicly pre-declaring our vote intentions is an important tool for our engagement activities. 2021 was the first year LGIM centralised the reporting of our vote intentions in advance of a company's AGM.",

        "page_content": "## Our risk landscape\n\nOur risk landscape comprises asset, insurance, operational and business related risks. Our largest risk exposures are to credit and longevity.\n\n## Asset risks\n\nMarket, credit and counterparty risks arise from holding portfolios of assets, including property, to meet our obligations to our customers and to deliver returns to shareholders. Liquidity risks also arise from holding illiquid assets and from investment market conditions. Interest rates and inflation are also risk factors.\n\nCredit risk largely arises in our portfolio of corporate bonds and within our direct investment portfolio. As an investor for the long term, assessing and managing credit risk is a core competency, and alongside setting a range of tolerances to diversify our portfolios, we seek to continuously track a variety of risk factors that could adversely impact credit markets.\n\n## Insurance risks\n\nLongevity, mortality and other insurance risks are transferred to us by the customers of our pension risk transfer, annuities and protection businesses. The period that customers continue their policies is also important for profitability, as is our ability to control product expenses in line with pricing assumptions.\n\nLongevity risks arise in our pension risk transfer and retail annuity\n\nbusinesses. Over the years we have built significant expertise in understanding and pricing for longevity, with a range of disciplines including actuarial, medical, public health, statistical analysis and modelling. Mortality, morbidity and policy lapse are inherent risks to our protection businesses, which we assess and price for.\n\n## Our risk management approach\n\nSee page 54\n\nWhere our businesses directly engage in house building and property development, we are exposed to risks associated with the management of construction projects, including health and safety risks. Alongside construction-related risks, wider safety risks arise in the operation of retirement villages and our affordable homes businesses. The management of health and safety and the broader risks of building safety are an integral part of our wider risk framework, with expertise in risk management embedded across our business operating model.\n\n## Operational and business risks\n\nOperational risks arise in respect of our business processes and IT systems, as well as broader regulatory and legislative risks that can arise in the environments in which we operate. All our businesses have inherent exposure to operational risk.\n\nOur risk management and internal control framework seeks to identify areas of potential weakness that could otherwise lead to customer detriment, reputation damage or financial loss and ensure that appropriate measures are in place to mitigate adverse outcomes.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nOur risk appetite sets the ranges and limits of acceptable risk taking for the group as a whole. We express our overall attitude to risk using the statements and measures in the table opposite.\n\nWe set further risk tolerances covering our specific exposures to market, credit, insurance, and operational risks including, where appropriate, limits on concentrations and significant aggregation of risks. Our risk appetite is used to govern the nature and quantity of risks that we are exposed to.\n\nWhether we are making a direct property investment or pricing a pension risk transfer deal, we use our risk management framework to assess the risk profile and potential rewards to ensure we continue to operate within the ranges of acceptable risk taking that we have set.\n\n| Strategy     | We manage a diversified portfolio in which we accept risk in the normal course of business  and aim to deliver sustainable returns on risk-based capital in excess of the cost of capital. Monitoring metric: minimum return on capital over the planning cycle.  We have an appetite for risks we understand and are rewarded for, and which are consistent  with delivery of our strategic objectives.   |\n|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Capital      | We aim to maintain an appropriate buffer of capital resources over the minimum regulatory  capital requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Earnings     | Monitoring metrics: capital coverage ratios.

The skills to assess and price for risk form part of our first line business management activity. For example, in our pension risk transfer and annuities businesses, we have a deep understanding of longevity risk and the science of life expectancy. LGIM, as one of the world's largest asset managers, has extensive business expertise in managing credit risk.\n\nWithin our insurance business, as the UK's largest provider of individual life cover, we have extensive knowledge of mortality and morbidity risks.\n\n- \u00b7 second, our risk oversight function under the direction of our Group Chief Risk Officer. The team of risk professionals provides our businesses with expert advice and guidance on risk and capital management, alongside ensuring risk taking remains within acceptable parameters.\n- \u00b7 third, our group internal audit function provides independent assurance on the effectiveness of business risk management and the overall operation of our risk framework.\n\n## Our principal risks\n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties reflect those factors that may threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity.\n\n## Our risk landscape Principal risks and uncertainties\n\nGrowth drivers\n\n| Operational and   | Investment market performance and conditions in the broader economy  may adversely impact earnings, profitability or surplus capital.      | 1, 2, 3   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Operational and   | In dealing with issuers of debt and other types of counterparty the group  is exposed to the risk of financial loss.                       | 1, 2      |\n| Operational and   | We fail to respond to the emerging threats from climate change for our  investment portfolios and wider businesses.                        | 3, 6      |\n| Operational and   | Reserves and our assessment of capital requirements may require revision  as a result of changes in experience, regulation or legislation. | 1,4       |\n| business risks    | Changes in regulation or legislation may have a detrimental effect  on our strategy.                                                       | 1, 2, 4   |\n| business risks    | New entrants may disrupt the markets in which we operate                                                                                   | 1, 3, 5   |\n| business risks    | A material failure in our business processes or IT security may result  in unanticipated financial loss or reputation damage.              | 5         |\n| business risks    | The success of our operations is dependent upon the ability to attract  and retain highly qualified professional people                    | 5         |\n\n## Own risk and solvency assessment (ORSA)\n\nOur ORSA process is an ongoing analysis of the group's risk profile and the sufficiency of capital resources to sustain our business strategy over the plan horizon. The process, which covers the whole group, considers how the financial and broader business risks to which we are exposed may evolve over the planning cycle. Stress and scenario testing is an essential element of the ORSA. It is used to show us how key risk exposures respond to different risk factors, together with the sensitivity and the resilience of capital and earnings to a range of extreme but plausible events. The stress testing component of our framework assesses the effect of a move in one or more risk factors at a point in time. The scenario element considers group-wide multi-year projections of capital and earnings across a range of downside conditions in financial markets, demographics and the broader economy. The ORSA process is integrated into our business risk and capital management activities and aligned with the strategic planning process to inform forwardlooking decision making. As such, it is a key business management tool.\n\n## Capital management\n\nOur risk-based capital model seeks to provide a quantitative assessment of the group's risk exposures. It forms part of the suite of tools we use to evaluate our strategic plans, set risk appetite, allocate capital and evaluate product pricing. Our model is also used to assess significant transactions, including large pension risk transfer deals.\n\n## Growth drivers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.\n\n- Ageing demographics\n\n2.\n\nGlobalisation of asset markets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 3.

        "page_content": "## Group Board viability statement\n\n## Group Board viability statement\n\nThe group's strategy is developed, and economic decisions are made, around meeting the long-term protection and savings needs of its customers, and around creating long-term value for customers and shareholders over a period of many years. This reflects the group's business and investment models which combine managing credit, longevity and market risks over long-term relationships.\n\n## The group's long-term prospects\n\nThe group's prospects are primarily assessed through our strategic and planning processes. Performance against our annual strategic planning process is continuously monitored, and it underpins our business planning model. We consider the sustainability and resilience of our business model over the long-term (including strategic factors detailed on pages 10 and 11, as well as longer term trends in areas such as technology and climate change), as our investment and insurance products and customer relationships are long-standing ones.\n\nThe group is also subject to regulation and supervision, which requires us to manage and monitor solvency, liquidity and longer-term risks, to ensure that we can continue to meet our policyholder obligations.\n\nThis long-term prospect assessment is over a longer period than that over which the Board has assessed its viability.\n\n## Period of viability assessment\n\nWhile the Board has considered adopting a longer period, it believes that five years is the most appropriate time-frame over which we should assess the long-term viability of the group, as required within provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code. The following factors have been taken into account in making this decision:\n\n- \u00b7 We have reasonable clarity over a five-year period, allowing an appropriate assessment of our principal risks to be made; and\n- \u00b7 The assessment is underpinned by our business planning process, and so aligns to the period over which major strategic actions are typically delivered, and takes account of the potentially evolving economic environment and political and regulatory landscape during the relevant period.\n\nOur business planning process is an annual process and culminates in the production and review of the group's business plan. Our plan is built up from divisional submissions, and considers the profitability, liquidity, cash generation and capital position of the group. This projection process involves setting a number of key assumptions, which are inherently volatile over a much longer reporting period such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, economic growth rates, the continued optimisation of capital strategies for Solvency II, and the impact on the business environment of changes in regulation or similar events.\n\nThe Board carries out a detailed review of the draft plan at the Group Board's annual strategy assessment, and amendments are made accordingly. Part of the Board's role is to consider the appropriateness of any key assumptions made. The latest annual plan was approved in December 2021, resulting in our current five-year business plan.\n\n## How we assessed our viability\n\nThe Board regularly considers the potential financial and reputational impact of the group's principal risks (as set out on pages 56 to 59) on our ability to deliver the business plan. We regularly refresh our principal risks to reflect current market conditions and changes in our risk profile, and as a result we have included the impact of climate change as one of our principal risks. In its assessment of viability, not just long-term prospects, the Board has taken into consideration all of the group's principal risks, as any significant change in the risk profile or outlook of those principal risks, or inadequate mitigation, could have a significant impact on the group's viability over the assessment time-frame.\n\nQuantitative stress and scenario testing is undertaken to enable the Board to consider the group's ability to respond to a number of plausible individual and combined shocks, both financial and operational, which could adversely impact the profits, capital and liquidity projections in the group plan. For example, during 2021, the Board considered the impacts of higher inflation and interest rates, as well as a severe market event. The severe market event was set with reference to the Bank of England latest 'Annually Cyclical Scenario', but modified to reflect the group's underlying risk profile. The scenario is broadly based on the Global Financial Crisis\n\nof 2008 for market risks exposures and 2002 experience for rating transitions (downgrades and spreads). In addition, we have continued to consider the potential implications of Covid-19, and related longer-term trends, to our business model.\n\nThe scenarios tested showed that the group would continue to have sufficient headroom to maintain viability over the five year planning period, after taking into account mitigating actions to manage the impacts on capital and liquidity. This includes maintaining the group's current dividend policy under the late cycle market shock scenario, but this and other commitments would be reassessed if the circumstances determined this to be necessary over the longer term. In response to a potential severe economic downturn, credible buffers and a suite of management actions are at the group's disposal to maintain resilience and preserve the group's viability. It is clearly possible that shocks could be more severe, occur sooner and/or last longer than we have currently considered plausible.\n\nAdditionally, reverse stress testing and contingency planning gives the Board a solid understanding of the group's resilience to extremely severe scenarios which could threaten the group's business model and viability. This analysis assists in identifying any mitigating actions that could be taken now, or triggers to put in place for future actions. Potential scenarios that were explored included severe capital market stresses, adverse regulatory changes, reputational and internal/external events causing falls in business volumes, and severely adverse claims experience. The results confirmed that the group remains resilient to extreme stresses as a result of the risk management system in place and the diverse range of mitigating actions available, such as the raising of capital or reduction in the payment of dividends.\n\n## Our conclusion on viability\n\nFollowing this assessment, taking into account the group's current position and principal risks, the Board can confirm that it has a reasonable expectation that the group will continue in operation and meet its liabilities, as they fall due, over a viability horizon of five years. The Board's five year viability and longer-term prospects assessment is based upon information known today.",

        "page_content": "## Letter from the Chairman\n\nSir John Kingman Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI am delighted to present our 2021 Governance report which provides insight into how we, the Board, have approached our responsibilities during this year.\n\nCovid-19 has continued to affect each of us and has had an unprecedented impact on our customers, employees and society at large. Throughout this crisis our business has been very resilient and continued to provide the products and services that our customers need. I am proud to report that, even during another challenging year, our colleagues have continued to adapt and have remained professional, committed and resilient in the face of adversity. I would like to extend my thanks to all our valued colleagues for their continued hard work and commitment to doing the best for our customers.\n\nThe strength of our diversified business model meant we were able to weather the volatility of 2020 and were well positioned to deliver profitable growth again during 2021. While the pandemic and its effects will no doubt be with us for some time, the Board is also looking to the future and to the many opportunities for Legal & General to make investments that are economically, environmentally and socially valuable, in line with our long-term commitment to delivering inclusive capitalism and supporting the Building Back Better and Levelling Up agendas. In particular, addressing climate change (one of Legal & General's six strategic growth drivers) remains at the forefront of our minds as we face not only the biggest challenge, but also the biggest investment opportunity, of our lifetimes. The Board was\n\nproud to see Michelle Scrimgeour, Chief Executive, Legal & General Investment Management, play such a central role in COP26 as co-chair of the COP26 Business Leaders Group.\n\n## Our approach to governance\n\nAs a Board, it is our role to promote the highest levels of corporate governance and ensure these values are embedded within our culture and throughout the organisation.\n\nAs our business continues to evolve and as we pursue our strategic objectives in an ever-changing environment, our strong governance framework supports the Board in ensuring that across the group we make decisions in the right way. The Board has worked closely with the Executive team throughout this year as the business has continued to navigate the challenges presented by Covid-19 to ensure our business can continue to flourish. Our governance framework has supported us well to be able to continue to make agile and robust decisions throughout this period.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, we were required to measure ourselves against the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code'). The Board has considered carefully the requirements of the Code and I am pleased to report that we have complied with all provisions of the Code throughout the year, save in respect of pensions alignment required under Code provision 38 where we will achieve full compliance by 31 December 2022 as further detailed on page 103. Further details on our compliance with the Code and how we have applied the various principles can be found on pages 80 to 81.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nIn light of the UK Government's Covid-19 restrictions in 2021, and with the wellbeing of our shareholders and colleagues as our primary concern, it was with much regret that we were\n\nunable to hold a physical 2021 Annual General Meeting (AGM). We were however very pleased to be able to invite shareholders to join the AGM virtually via an online video platform. Through the platform, shareholders were able to view a live video stream of our AGM and participate in a live Q&A session with the Board. I am delighted that a number of our shareholders were able to join us virtually on the day to hear from myself, Sir Nigel Wilson and our Committee Chairs and I would like to thank those who participated in our live Q&A session or who submitted questions in advance.\n\nThe Board also recognises that the AGM presents an important opportunity for our shareholders to get to know newer Board members and to understand the skills and experience that they bring to the Board. In the absence of a physical meeting, we made available on our website a recorded interview with our two newest non-executive directors, Ric Lewis and Nilufer von Bismarck OBE. We hope that shareholders found this useful and informative.\n\nThe Board also took the opportunity to ask shareholders to support a proposal to change our articles of association to allow us to hold hybrid AGMs in the future. A hybrid AGM allows shareholders to attend and vote either in person or virtually. The Board recommended the change in order to allow our shareholders to have greater flexibility in deciding how they wish to participate in our AGMs and with a view to promoting greater participation and engagement. We are pleased that shareholders supported this proposal and we look forward to holding our first hybrid AGM this year.\n\nWhilst last year's arrangements were no substitute for meeting shareholders in person, we hope that shareholders still felt connected to, and heard by, the Board through the steps that we took and I would like to thank shareholders for their understanding during this challenging period.\n\nThe 2022 AGM will be held on Thursday 26 May 2022 at 11am at the British Medical Association, BMA House, Tavistock Square, Bloomsbury, London WC1H 9JP with additional facilities for shareholders to join and vote electronically. Full details of the business to be considered at the meeting and any special arrangements that may be in place in light of Covid-19 will be included in the Notice of Annual General Meeting that will be sent to shareholders by their chosen communication means and published on our website: group.legalandgeneral.com/AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Board has previously welcomed the changes to the Code aimed at promoting greater transparency around stakeholder engagement. As a Board, we are conscious of the impact that our business and decisions have on our stakeholders, as well as our wider societal impact. We keep the interests of the group's shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and our wider stakeholders at the heart of our decision making and how we deliver our strategy to achieve long-term, sustainable success. Whilst Covid-19 has continued to create challenges this year, there has never been a more important time to stay connected with all of our stakeholders. Further information on how we, as a Board, have fulfilled our duties to our stakeholders under s.172 of the Companies Act 2006, including a case study of our engagement in practice, can be found on pages 68 to 73.\n\n## Board changes and succession planning\n\nLegal & General continues to benefit from a high-quality Board with a diverse range and depth of expertise and skills. During the year we have continued to assess the composition of the Board. In March 2021, Julia Wilson retired as Senior Independent Director after a nine-year tenure on the Board, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code requirement. I would like to once again thank Julia for her enormous contribution to the Board and the Company and for her valued support to me during my time as Chairman. Philip Broadley succeeded Julia as our Senior Independent Director and I would also like to thank him for his support during this year.\n\nNilufer von Bismarck OBE joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 May 2021. Nilufer has spent a large part of her 34-year legal career working with major international financial institutions and also has considerable experience across a range of other industries and sectors, including real estate, green infrastructure and fintech. In November 2021, we announced the appointment of Laura Wade-Gery as an independent non-executive director with effect from 3 January 2022. Laura's extensive knowledge of digital transformation and customer experience will further bolster the Board as the Company seeks to become a market leader in the digital provision of insurance and other financial solutions. We also announced the appointment of Tushar Morzaria who will join the Board as an independent non-executive director and will take over from Philip Broadley as Audit Committee chair when he joins us in May 2022. As the current Group Finance Director of Barclays Plc and with extensive financial services experience, Tushar is well positioned to fulfil the duties as Audit Committee chair and I look forward to welcoming him in May. We have also recently announced that Toby Strauss will stand down from the Board in April 2022 following his recent appointment as the Chair of Age UK.\n\nI would like to thank Toby for his very considerable contribution to the Board and especially as Chair of the Risk Committee. I will assume the role as the Chair of the Risk Committee on a temporary basis pending the appointment of Toby's successor.\n\nThis year, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, together with the Board, has continued to focus on succession planning. We review both our Group Board and Executive Committee succession plans regularly and fully. I am pleased to report that Nilufer von Bismarck will succeed Lesley Knox as the designated workforce director with effect from April 2022. Lesley has done an outstanding job in establishing the role of the designated workforce director since it was created in 2018 and has discharged her role with great commitment and rigour. Lesley has championed the voice of our employees during Board discussions and has ensured that the Board has received regular and valuable insights into our employees. I would like to thank Lesley for the dedication she has shown to this role during her tenure.\n\nAs a Board, we consider the climate emergency to be a real and emerging risk to our business and the communities in which we operate. However, we also recognise the potential opportunities that can be created. Our commitment to climate issues is detailed on pages 18 and 19 and also in our climate report which can be found at group.legalandgeneral.com/reports. We consider that it is vital that the Board remains focused on this important topic and the Board is therefore pleased to have appointed Nilufer von Bismarck to the new role of designated non-executive director for climate. The Board agreed that Nilufer was an excellent candidate for both this role and as successor to Lesley as the designated workforce director, particularly as the climate emergency is an issue which our employees feel passionately about.\n\nThere were also a number of executive changes during the year. Laura Mason succeeded Kerrigan Procter as Chief Executive, Legal & General Capital and Kerrigan has moved to a new role as President of Asia to co-ordinate the group's expansion plans in Asia. In addition, since 1 January 2022, Andrew Kail has been appointed as Chief Executive, Legal & General Retirement Institutional and the Group's Retail businesses (Legal & General Insurance and Legal & General Retirement Retail) have been combined under the leadership of Bernie Hickman. We continue to closely monitor diversity in our succession plans to ensure that we are attracting, developing and progressing diverse talent.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe stand for diversity and inclusion: for a workplace where we all have the opportunity to perform at our best, no matter who we are. The Board is responsible for overseeing the\n\ngroup-wide diversity and inclusion policy, ensuring that everyone across Legal & General understands their responsibilities in driving an inclusive and diverse culture and the opportunities it can bring. We continue to develop a robust governance framework and use data and insights to shape our actions, measure our progress and drive accountability.\n\nDiversity is important to us because it generates a wider pool of talent, reflecting the broadest range of human attributes, experience and backgrounds. We are building an inclusive culture that celebrates diversity and creates fair opportunities for all.\n\nLaura Mason continues in her role as executive sponsor for diversity and inclusion, and great progress has been made with our diversity and inclusion initiatives across the group. See page 48 for more about these initiatives.\n\n## Subsidiary boards\n\nAt Legal & General we have benefited from a strong governance framework operating at subsidiary level for many years now. Our framework of guiding principles remains in place governing the relationship between the Group Board and the Boards of the group's principal subsidiaries, promoting effective interaction across all levels of the group.\n\nLesley Knox and Henrietta Baldock continue in their roles as the Chairs of our two principal operating subsidiaries: Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) Limited (LGIM(H)) and Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), respectively. Interlinking our Group Board directors and principal subsidiary boards allows greater interactions, information flows and promotes enhanced collaboration.\n\nThe Board welcomes the positive and constructive working relationships we have with our subsidiaries and we have benefited greatly from the addition of independent non-executive directors to many of our subsidiary boards.\n\n## Board effectiveness\n\nThe Board conducted an internal Board review in 2021 which was externally facilitated by the Board evaluation specialists Independent Board Evaluation and included a review of the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. Further details of the process and outcome of this evaluation can be found on pages 78 and 79.\n\nSir John Kingman Chairman\n\n<!-- image -->",

They also provide the Board with regular feedback on investors' views on business strategy and the market environment.\n- \u00b7  Each year the Group CEO and CFO meet with investors and analysts following the release of our half-year and full-year financial results.\n- \u00b7  The AGM provides an important opportunity each year for the Board to engage with all shareholders, particularly retail shareholders who might otherwise have limited direct engagement with the Board. In 2021 our AGM was held in One Coleman Street and, due to Covid-19, shareholders were not able to attend in person but were invited to join virtually via an online video platform. The Board was delighted to provide shareholders with the opportunity to ask live questions during the meeting.\n- \u00b7  We provide easy access for our shareholders to the company's announcements, results and investor information through a dedicated shareholder section of our website. The website contains the Company's London Stock Exchange regulatory announcements and a copy of our annual reports and other relevant publications. A webcast of half-year and full-year results presentations for the current period is also made available via a link on the website which is permanently available.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  In May, the Group CFO met with several investors to gain insights on their views at the Autonomous Insurers and Asset Wealth Manager Financials Forum.\n- \u00b7  In September, the Chairman participated in the Goldman Sachs Chairman's Forum where he engaged with a range of different types of investor. Feedback from investor meetings was shared with the wider Board throughout the year.\n- \u00b7  In October, we hosted a Capital Markets event for investors and analysts at our London Headquarters. Investors also had the opportunity to join virtually. The event focused on Legal & General Capital (LGC) and consisted of presentations on LGC's strategy, its approach and investment capability, financial performance and ambitions, and included a live Q&A with the Group CEO and the LGC management team. All of the material from the event was made available on the investors section of the group website.\n\nThe below sets out our s.172 statement which provides details of the Board's engagement with our key stakeholders during the year and how stakeholder considerations have helped shape Board decisions and outcomes. Additional details of our key stakeholders and why they are important to us are set out on pages 16 to 17.\n\nThrough its engagement with key stakeholders, the Board seeks to understand the views, priorities and issues of each stakeholder group so that these can be carefully considered and balanced by the Board as part of its decision making. Additionally, the Group Company Secretary attends each Board meeting and is available to provide support to the Board in ensuring that sufficient consideration is given in relation to stakeholder views during Board discussions.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- \u00b7  The Board is committed to continuing to enhance its engagement and interaction with our shareholders. Accordingly, the Board sought shareholder approval to make a change to the company's Articles of Association to permit hybrid AGMs. The Board hopes that this change will encourage more shareholders to participate in our AGM. The Board is very much looking forward to holding its first hybrid AGM on 26 May 2022.\n- \u00b7  A full year dividend of 18.45 pence was approved by the Group Board on 8 March 2022.",

Early and active engagement, with both government and our regulators, helps to ensure we understand changing requirements and can take timely action to implement the regulatory change required, optimising outcomes for our customers and our people, where possible.\n\n## Engagement\n\n## Continuing engagement\n\n- \u00b7  The Legal & General Resources Limited Board, our main contracting entity for suppliers, receives a procurement update at each Board meeting, including an update on material procurements, relationships with suppliers and associated performance. The Group Board has sight of the minutes of each of these Board meetings and any issues are escalated to the Group Board where necessary.\n- \u00b7  In accordance with the Group Board matters reserved, any expenditure in relation to a supplier in excess of an amount determined by the group from time to time is put to the Board for consideration and approval, as required.\n- \u00b7  The Group Chief Financial Officer and the Legal & General Resources Board continued to receive updates regarding any supplier performance issues associated with Covid-19, including the continued work undertaken with suppliers to mitigate any risks.\n- \u00b7  Lesley Knox is the Group Board sponsor for modern slavery and drives this agenda through her membership of the Modern Slavery and Human Rights Committee.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  The Executive Risk Committee, Group Risk Committee and Group Technology Committee received reports relating to cyber security and supplier governance throughout the year.\n- \u00b7  The Legal & General Resources Board and Group Environmental Committee were updated throughout the year on the progress of topics such as supplier diversity and modern slavery as well as the environment.\n- \u00b7  Outputs from a current review of potential supply chain risks due to logistics delays, price increases and shortages will be presented to senior management during 2022.\n- \u00b7  Throughout the year the Modern Slavery and Humans Rights Committee has been progressing risk assessments for the balance of our supply chain and has incorporated these results into our Financial Watchlist for material suppliers. See page 50 for information on our sustainable supply chain.\n\n## Engagement\n\n## Continuing engagement\n\n- \u00b7  Certain non-executive directors of the Group Board and subsidiary non-executive directors attend individual meetings with both the PRA and FCA on a frequency determined by the regulators for each supervisory cycle. Topics covered include strategy, financial performance, Board effectiveness and wider governance, operational resilience, cyber, culture, regulatory matters (including the review of Solvency II) and customer outcomes. The directors share insights from these meetings at each Group Board meeting.\n- \u00b7  At each meeting, the Group Board receives a conduct report from the Chief Risk Officer which contains an update on prudential regulation. The Chief Risk Officer periodically attends Group Board meetings to present to the Board.\n- \u00b7  To mark the beginning of each two-year supervisory cycle, the FCA attends a Group Board meeting to discuss its priorities. The PRA attends the Group Board annually as part of the PRA's Periodic Summary Meeting (PSM) cycle.\n- \u00b7  Throughout 2021 we continued to hold quarterly meetings with both the FCA and PRA on our plans to transition away from the interest rate benchmark LIBOR.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  At the beginning of 2021, we were still working closely with the PRA and FCA on our response to Covid-19, with interactions decreasing after the first quarter 2021.\n- \u00b7  Regular meetings continue to take place between management, our risk function and the PRA and FCA. We continue to brief the FCA on a programme to transform our financial crime risk management framework, and on the progress to close out a programme of work reviewing group-wide conflicts of interest. Additionally, there have been regular engagement meetings regarding the transformation of LGIM's middle office function and its move to a strategic target operating model.\n- \u00b7  The Group Board values its open dialogue with the PRA and therefore invited the PRA to attend its July Board meeting to discuss and share its views on the 2021 PSM Letter.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- \u00b7  This year we joined the Supplier Diversity Council UK to take a lead role in progressing this important topic and help shape the principles and toolkits needed. The Council meets regularly with the objective of raising awareness, sharing knowledge and looking at ways of helping to drive greater opportunity for small and diverse firms.\n- \u00b7  We also enhanced our Sustainable Sourcing Principles Statement in November 2021 to bring greater clarity and detail in the guidance to buyers and supplier managers.\n- \u00b7  Group Procurement is continuing to progress its five-year transformation journey. Once finalised, this will include the deployment of e-sourcing and supplier management tools which is anticipated to bring more granular analytics as well as digital sourcing capabilities.\n- \u00b7  Following feedback from key stakeholders, our purchase order system continues to be utilised to drive payment efficiencies and cost controls.\n- \u00b7  Our senior management team worked in collaboration with Stronger Together to deliver external workshops to over 40 suppliers in relation to human rights and spotting the signs of modern slavery. We have also delivered extensive training to promote awareness of this important topic. For more information on our activities in relation to modern slavery, refer to page 51.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- \u00b7  We have proactively engaged with our regulators this year to feed back industry views on Solvency II reform, including the PRA's Quantitative Impact Study to test a range of policy options which could lead to reform of the current solvency regulation for insurers; we hope these interactions make a positive contribution to the work of our regulators in achieving their statutory objectives. We have also used these opportunities to gain insights to requirements which have improved our own approach to regulatory compliance.\n- \u00b7  Following extensive scrutiny and review at the Group Risk Committee, in May the Group Board approved the submission of the Internal Model Major Change application to the PRA. Our regular, transparent and constructive dialogue with the PRA helped to ensure that we received approval for this enhancement in December.\n- \u00b7  In July, we actively engaged with the PRA to achieve approval for the PRA's non-objection to the redemption of \u00a3300m 10% subordinated notes due in 2041 and issued by the Company.\n- \u00b7  Our Affordable Homes business worked closely with the Regulator of Social Housing to achieve approval for the creation of four newly incorporated entities within the group that are registered providers of social housing, to facilitate the provision of affordable housing across England.\n- \u00b7  The Group Chief Financial Officer joined the Productive Finance Working Group, a joint forum of the Bank of England, Her Majesty's Treasury and FCA, with the objective of finding solutions to overcome the barriers to investing in long term, less liquid assets, with a particular focus on DC pension scheme investment.",

These Board members drive the agenda in relation to the respective subject area, receive reports back on targets and plan the upcoming five-year strategy.\n- \u00b7  Our continued relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh's Award Scheme enables us to support young people across the UK and US, especially important given the impacts of Covid-19 on young people's prospects.\n- \u00b7  Sir Nigel Wilson, our Group Chief Executive, continued as a member of the government's expert advisory groups on social care and life sciences, as well as chairing the Bank of England/FCA Climate Financial Risk Forum workstream on innovation.\n- \u00b7  We demonstrate our continued commitment to net zero through our membership of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Net Zero Asset Owner's Alliance.\n- \u00b7  Responding to the challenges of ageing demographics is a strategic priority for us and we are pleased to continue to support the University of Edinburgh's Advanced Care Research Centre.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  Michelle Scrimgeour, CEO of our investment management business, led our engagement at the COP26 summit in Glasgow in November in her capacity as co-Chair of the government's COP26 Business Leaders Group. As part of our engagement with COP26, we made a range of commitments in support of our ambition to align with the 1.5\u00b0C 'Paris' objective. Michelle and John Godfrey, our Group Corporate Affairs Director, delivered an update on COP26 outcomes to the GEC in November to develop the Committee's knowledge and outlook.\n- \u00b7  In October, Philip Broadley, our Senior Independent Director, hosted a business breakfast with His Royal Highness the Earl of Wessex and a number of high profile business leaders at our London Headquarters to discuss employers' roles in supporting young people's prospects in employment.\n- \u00b7  Following LGC's launch of its residential housing arm, Suburban Build to Rent, members of the Group Board visited one of our Build to Rent sites in Bristol to see first-hand the impact of the investment on the community. The Board also held a strategy event in Oxford and received a tour of the city which highlighted the impact of our investments.\n- \u00b7  Members of the Group Board visited The Interchange building in Cardiff Central Square. The Interchange is a testament to our purpose of inclusive capitalism, as we continue to invest pension money in the future of cities and towns across the UK and develop buildings with net zero carbon targets. In addition, The Interchange will be the new office for our Cardiff-based colleagues.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- \u00b7  Page 73 provides examples of some of our recent investments which have positively impacted communities.\n- \u00b7  We have established a partnership with Sir Michael Marmot and the University College of London Institute of Health Equity in order to explore the specific role of business in addressing health inequity. An update was delivered to the Group Board in May and the Board were enthusiastic and supportive of the partnership, demonstrating our continued commitment to inclusive capitalism.\n- \u00b7  This year represented an important milestone for our Modular Homes business with contracts to deliver 185 Modular Homes in Bristol and 95 highly-sustainable, energy efficient and affordable homes in Warminster. Legal & General Modular Homes are leading the way in the delivery of high-quality, affordable and sustainable homes with each home achieving a minimum of energy performance certificate ''A' rating by design. Currently fewer than 2% of new build homes in the UK achieve this high standard. This will help support local communities by enabling councils and housing associations to deliver future development and housebuilding projects in shorter timescales. In September, the CEO of Modular Homes hosted a site visit in Bristol for members of the Group Board which included an overview of the Modular Homes housing delivery programme and sustainability benefits. The CEO of Modular Homes also provided an update to the Group Executive Committee in September.\n- \u00b7  In April we joined the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a global coalition of leading financial institutions committed to accelerating the decarbonisation of the economy.\n- \u00b7  As we look to implement our climate change commitments and targets, Nilufer von Bismarck was appointed as the designated non-executive director for climate and will act as a single point of contact for the business and as a conduit for the Board.\n- \u00b7  Sir Nigel Wilson became a member of the Prime Minister and Chancellor's Build Back Better Business Council which brings together a broad range of business leaders from across the whole British economy to work in partnership with the government in an effort to unlock investment and boost job creation.",

The report provides an update on progress made in relation to the customer journey and a view for the year ahead.\n- \u00b7  The Group Risk Committee receives detailed customer Management Information (MI) at each meeting and the Customer Champion attends each meeting to present to the Committee.\n- \u00b7  Subsidiary Boards are also in receipt of regular updates regarding customers.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  In April, Sir John Kingman visited our Hove office and undertook various call listening activities to gain a deeper understanding of the customer journey.\n- \u00b7  In November, Nilufer von Bismarck, one of our non-executive directors, spent a day with our Home Finance and Financial Advice team in Solihull. The team walked through the customer journey, shared insights from customer feedback and provided an overview of the future roadmap for developments. Nilufer also spent time call listening with our Retail Protection team in Cardiff in September to gain further insights into the customer journey.\n- \u00b7  The managing director of our newly formed Retirement Solutions business presented to the Board in July to provide insight into how customers are at the heart of our strategy. This included an overview of the extensive customer research that has taken place to develop our understanding of customer needs and expectations.\n- \u00b7  During the first half of 2021, the Group Executive Committee received regular updates on customer performance to ensure any detrimental impacts to customer service as a result of Covid-19 were minimised.\n- \u00b7  The CEO of our LGI Retail Protection business shares an additional monthly update with the Board which details the service recovery plan for customer claims and which includes detailed customer MI.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- \u00b7  Throughout the year customer feedback has been positive, with 80% of respondents scoring us 7 or above in customer satisfaction ratings (65% of respondents gave us a 9 or 10).\n- \u00b7  Our telephony service level agreements (SLAs) have generally been strong and improved throughout the year. This was helped as our call centre colleagues were able to return to the office. Where SLAs have not quite been reached, the challenge and focus from the Board has helped shape the recovery plans of respective businesses.\n- \u00b7  After reviewing the customer journey and our customer research, we have delivered improvements that make it easier for our customers to connect with us. The number of customer logins to our digital portals increased by 30% in 2021 vs 2020. We've also improved our online functionality and introduced new self-service options which has led to a reduction in a number of our end-to-end customer journey times and increased self-service transactions by 29%.\n- \u00b7  A strong and persistent Board focus on our retail protection claims experience has improved claims timings throughout the year. In Q4 2021, the time it took us to settle non-medical claims reduced by 19 days compared to Q2 2021.\n- \u00b7  Our continued focus on vulnerable customers has meant that our teams are better placed to identify and respond to instances of vulnerability. Some of our key successes have emerged from relationships with third-party organisations and charities. Across the group, we have used their expertise to help us understand customer needs, train our staff, improve our documentation, and provide additional support to our customers where appropriate.\n- \u00b7  In January, we launched two new services in an effort to make life simpler for our customers and address a growing customer need - a 'stand-alone' tracing service to help customers track down lost or forgotten pension pots, and a consolidation solution, for those wanting to bring their various pension savings together.\n- \u00b7  To help our customers approaching retirement understand their options and better manage their financial affairs in later life, we have introduced a free online course with The Open University to equip our customers with knowledge of retirement planning.",

The surveys continue to provide us with valuable insights on what is important to our employees. During 2021, the Board and Group Executive Committee received periodic reports on Voice data.\n- \u00b7  To continue to ensure engagement with employees during Covid-19, we continued with our efforts to update employees through our internal communications. Dedicated business partnering teams and a central internal communications function continued to provide updates, especially through The Hub, our digital workspace. This allowed members of our Group Executive Committee to communicate regularly with all employees on a range of themes including (but not limited to) business strategy, commercial updates, wellbeing, inclusion and climate change.\n- \u00b7  We continued to engage closely with employee representatives particularly through our partnership with Unite - to ensure that our offices remained Covid-19 safe.\n- \u00b7  Our D&I Council - chaired by Laura Mason, CEO of LGC, and comprising senior leaders from across the business - continued to meet.

Philip Broadley serves as the Group Board's whistleblowing champion.\n\n## Additional current year engagement\n\n- \u00b7  Members of the Group Board hosted a celebratory employee lunch to mark the 25th anniversary of the group's presence in Cardiff. This enabled the Board members to meet with, and listen to insights from, a range of employees from our different teams in Cardiff.\n- \u00b7  As previously noted, members of the Group Board met with employees from our offices in Hove, Cardiff and Solihull this year. The Board welcomes the invaluable opportunities site visits provide the Board in being able to hear, first hand, insights and opinions from our employees.\n- \u00b7  The Group Chairman and Lesley Knox also took part in The Listening Project, during which they heard first hand from employees from a range of ethnic backgrounds about their experience at Legal & General in a focus group setting.\n- \u00b7  With the shift in focus from managing the acute crisis of Covid-19 towards planning for a post-lockdown future, we engaged with our employees through our Future of Work surveys in March 2021.\n- \u00b7  Building on our 2020 efforts, further virtual town hall meetings were held during 2021, including for our full-year results. During 2021 we also launched a new video series, Your Question Time, in which employees were invited to ask members of the Group Executive Committee questions of interest.\n\n## Outcomes\n\n- \u00b7  This year Lesley Knox, in her role as designated workforce director, has attended virtual meetings across our operating divisions, as well as in-person meetings where possible. A report from the designated workforce director, including details of activities throughout the year and the output of this engagement, is provided on page 74.\n- \u00b7  77% of employees took part in the fourth quarter Voice survey, providing 27,684 individual comments. Our employee satisfaction score fell by one point to 76 compared to October 2020, although it remained above pre-Covid-19 levels (74 in March 2020).\n- \u00b7  Our D&I Council sponsored Count Me In, a communication campaign designed to improve the quality and quantity of diversity data we hold on our people. This led to an improvement in the completeness of our data. For instance, data held on ethnicity increased from 52.6% (December 2020) to 67.9% (December 2021).\n- \u00b7  To recognise the importance of mental and physical wellbeing to our employees, our Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Davies, was named as our executive sponsor for wellbeing. We continued to support our Mental Health First Aider network and promote employee access to wellbeing resources including our Employee Assistance Programme and Unmind mobile app, as well as introducing new wellbeing-focused training for line managers, a constituency we identified as key for promoting overall wellbeing. We also arranged virtual wellbeing and mindfulness sessions for employees led by individuals with personal experience, such as Fearne Cotton and Roman Kemp, our Wellbeing Ambassador.\n- \u00b7  This year we launched a new menopause policy as a result of feedback from our employees about the need for better provision on this topic.\n- \u00b7  The insights and data gathered from our Future of Work surveys, which was supplemented by stakeholder interviews and engagement with employee representatives, has helped inform our Group Executive Committee's planning for the post-Covid-19 workplace.",

The migration process completed in December 2021. The PI Business comprised approximately 280,000 customers invested in ISA, Junior ISA and General Investment Account products, holding LGIM Funds. Post-transfer, the migrated customers remain invested in LGIM funds (unless they elect to transfer their investments to alternative funds) for which LGIM will continue to earn an investment management fee.\n\nOur stakeholder impact analysis identified the following risks and benefits to our key stakeholders:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk                                                                          | Mitigant/Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Risks associated  with a failure to  deliver the required  customer outcomes. | The impact on customers was a key consideration for the Board when  considering and implementing the sale and transition of the PI Business to  Fidelity.

        "page_content": "## Employee engagement\n\nLesley Knox Designated workforce director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCovid-19 overshadowed 2020 and has also impacted 2021, but for many employees 2021 has been a return to more normal ways of working and a gradual return to the o/ffice. This meant that as the year went on, the issues and feedback raised by employees with me changed too.\n\nThroughout the year, I continued to meet employees, both virtually and in person, as part of my plan to engage with them and represent their views. My model of 'listen, reflect and represent' has held good throughout this time. The frequency of discussion about people issues at the Board throughout the past three years shows how seriously Legal & General takes understanding the views of its people.\n\nDuring the first half of 2021, the safe re-occupation of our office spaces was the key concern raised in meetings. Understandably, there were health and safety questions, especially amongst those who had not accessed offices at all during lockdown. The work we did during 2020 to keep offices safe stood us in good stead for 2021: safety measures were well understood, observed very strictly, and audited by Unite and the Health and Safety Executive.\n\nDuring the first half of the year in particular, our employees took a keen interest in the future of work: our way of thinking about and describing how we will use office and home-based working in combination in future. We knew from research carried out during the initial lockdown that employees valued elements of home working but missed the interpersonal contact that office working brings, as well as, in some cases, being in far from ideal situations for working at home.\n\nFurther research carried out during March 2021, borne out by conversations I have had with employees, showed that the preference for the majority of our people would be a form of hybrid working, which is the assumption on which we have based our future of work plans.\n\nOther issues have also come to the fore during my engagements with employees. Some of them have been specific to us, especially relating to the quality of office facilities. But issues larger than Legal & General have been part of the dialogue too. Examples include diversity and inclusion and wellbeing, which are all of great interest to the Board. I was pleased to be part of the Company's 'Listening Project', in which the Chair and I met employees from various ethnic minority communities in order to understand their views on lived experience at Legal & General and in industry more broadly. Alongside similar sessions run for the Executive team, these were helpful in focusing the Company's diversity and inclusion efforts in 2021.\n\nAs in 2019 and 2020, the mainstay of my engagements in 2021 was through informal and formal meetings with various groups of employees. This ranged from attending sections of team away days through to joining groups such as the Hove Health and Safety Committee, the LGC culture champions and the Modern Slavery Committee. I also received regular updates on the results of our employee survey, Voice, which are presented to the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee as a matter of course.\n\nOur employees continue to give positive feedback about the efforts taken by Legal & General to keep them informed, through online communications, virtual town halls and video content, including the short videos designed to introduce our new non-executive directors.\n\n2021 was the final year of my role as the employee representative on the Board as I hand over to my successor Nilufer von Bismarck in April 2022, but I will continue to be interested in our employees and I look forward to hearing Nilufer's reports to the Board. I would like to thank the employees I have spent time with over the last three years. Their openness in talking about working at Legal & General and their suggestions have helped make it a better place for everyone to work.",

        "page_content": "## Governance report\n\n## The UK Corporate Governance Code committed to the highest standards\n\nThe 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code') emphasises the role of good corporate governance in achieving long-term sustainable success. The principles of the Code are the standards against which we are required to measure ourselves during the year. Pages 80 to 81 set out at a high level how we have complied with each of the principles, save in respect of pensions alignment required under Code provision 38 where we will achieve full compliance by 31 December 2022 as further detailed on page 103. The information required under Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rule 7.2.6 can be found in the Directors' report on pages 234 to 237. Each year, the Board reviews the group's corporate governance framework and compliance with the Code.\n\nThe Board is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance across the group to support the delivery of our strategy, positive stakeholder relationships and the creation of long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.\n\n## The Board\n\nThe table in the adjacent column sets out the changes to the Board that have taken place over the course of the year. Nilufer von Bismarck OBE was appointed to the Board as an independent non-executive director in May 2021, bringing to the Board extensive experience in financial services. Laura Wade-Gery was appointed to the Board in January 2022. Laura has extensive knowledge of digital transformation and customer experience. Laura's appointment reflects the Company's commitment to technological innovation as it seeks to become a market leader in the digital provision of insurance and other financial solutions. We also announced the appointment of Tushar Morzaria who will join the Board in May 2022 as an independent non-executive director. Tushar will also take over from Philip Broadley as Audit Committee chair when he joins us. As the current Group Finance Director of Barclays Plc and with extensive financial services experience, Tushar is very well positioned to fulfil the duties as Audit Committee chair. We have also recently announced that Toby Strauss will stand down from the Board at the end of April 2022 following his recent appointment as the Chair of Age UK and I would like to thank him for his very considerable contribution to the Board and especially as Chair of the Risk Committee. I will assume the role as the Chair of the Risk Committee on a temporary basis pending the appointment of Toby's successor.\n\nJulia Wilson retired from the Board on 31 March 2021 following a nine-year tenure in accordance with the Code. Philip Broadley has succeeded Julia as Senior Independent Director.\n\nWhen considering the appointment of new directors, the Board has been mindful of the contribution and skillset that each new appointee will bring to the Board. The Board continues to focus on maintaining a well-balanced and diversified Board, with the right mix of individuals who can apply their wider business knowledge and experiences to the setting and oversight of delivery of the group's strategy.\n\n## Changes to the Board during the year and to the date of this report\n\n| Appointments                    | Retirements                |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Nilufer von Bismarck 1 May 2021 | Julia Wilson 31 March 2021 |\n| Laura Wade-Gery 3 January 2022  | Toby Strauss 29 April 2022 |\n| Tushar Morzaria 27 May 2022     |                            |\n\n## How the Board operates\n\nThe Board is led by the Chairman, Sir John Kingman. The day-to-day management of the company is led by Sir Nigel Wilson, the Group Chief Executive Officer. The non-executive directors play a key role in our governance framework and culture, and their roles are not limited to the boardroom. Examples of some of the other activities they have undertaken during the course of the year are set out on pages 68 to 72.\n\nThe Board is accountable for the long-term success of the Company by setting the group's strategic objectives and monitoring performance against those objectives. The Board meets formally on a regular basis and at each meeting considers business performance, strategic proposals, acquisitions and material transactions in the context of the group's strategic plans, risk appetite, the interests of the group's stakeholders and our social purpose. The Board and the boards of the group's subsidiaries operate within a clearly defined delegated authority framework, which is fully embedded across the group.\n\nThe delegated authority framework ensures that there is an appropriate level of Board contribution to, and oversight of, key decisions, and that the day-to-day business is managed effectively. The delegated authority framework includes a clearly defined schedule of matters reserved for the Board. The types of matters reserved include, amongst other things, matters relating to the group's strategic plan, material transactions, risk appetite, and oversight of systems of internal control and corporate governance policies. Those matters which are not reserved are delegated by the Board to group-level committees and to the Group Chief Executive Officer who then delegates decision making onward to the Group Capital Committee, an executive decision-making forum, and his direct reports.\n\n## How the Board spent its time in 2021\n\nThe Board held eight full formal Board meetings during 2021, including two strategy events. Board sub-committees were also constituted on a number of occasions in order to deal with matters arising in the ordinary course of business outside of the formal schedule of meetings. The Board also held a number of Board calls between formal meetings to keep abreast of business developments. A table of individual Board member attendance at the formal Board and Committee meetings is provided on page 78. The non-executive directors have a private meeting without the executives present after each Board meeting and otherwise when required. The non-executive directors, led by the Senior Independent Director, meet without the executive directors and the Chairman periodically to review the Chairman's performance. Board members also meet informally with the executive and senior management on a regular basis outside of the formal meeting schedule.\n\nThe Board agenda is set by the Chairman and consists of the following broad discussion areas:\n\n- \u00b7 an update from the Group Chief Executive Officer, the Group Chief Financial Officer and a report from each of the key business divisions on business performance, key business initiatives, customer and employee engagement, control environment and culture.\n- \u00b7 regular updates from the Chair of each of the Group Committees and designated workforce director.\n- \u00b7 discussions on strategic ambitions, acquisitions, material transactions and other material initiatives.\n- \u00b7 risk and compliance matters.\n- \u00b7 legal and governance matters.\n- \u00b7 people and employee engagement matters\n- \u00b7 ESG considerations.\n\nThe Board informs itself of the views of shareholders on a regular basis through updates from the Group Chief Executive Officer and Group Chief Financial Officer, as well as an update from the Chairman following his annual schedule of investor meetings. The Board also receives regular updates from the Chairman and the Senior Independent Director following investor engagement.\n\nMembers of the senior management team and, as appropriate, individuals from the relevant business areas are invited to attend Board meetings in relation to key items, allowing the Board the opportunity to debate and challenge on initiatives directly with the senior management team along with the executive directors.",

This included a review of the divisional  strategic objectives, initiatives and financial and non-financial Key Performance Indicators. \u00b7  The Board held a full-day strategy event in April which covered, among other things, the opportunities for the group to deliver value creation  through ESG and the continued focus on scaling asset origination capabilities in LGC. The Board further discussed in detail the group's  medium-term strategy which includes scaling our alternative asset businesses and internationalising the group's diverse businesses  in selected markets with a focus on growth in the US and Asia, leveraging existing strengths across the group.  \u00b7  The Board held a further two-day offsite strategy event in November which covered areas such as our people and the retail retirement  strategy. The Board also discussed internationalisation opportunities for LGIM. The event was held in Oxford and the Board visited a number  of development sites as part of our Oxford University Development partnership.                                |\n| Governance and  risk management | \u00b7  Discussions and actions focused on ensuring the continued resilience of the group both financially and operationally, the continued servicing  of the group's customers and ensuring the safety of the group's people, in addition to the close monitoring of the wider macro-economic  environment. \u00b7  Following an external Board evaluation in 2020, the Board conducted an internal Board evaluation in 2021 which was externally facilitated  by Board evaluation specialists Independent Board Evaluation. An action plan was drafted and agreed by the Board following the evaluation. \u00b7  Following recommendations from the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board approved the appointment of two new  non-executive directors to the Board.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Stakeholders                    | regulation and governance changes. \u00b7  The Board regularly received and discussed reports from the Chief Risk Officer on risk and compliance matters, including an annual report  on whistleblowing and the report on our review of management of conflicts of Interest. \u00b7  During the year, the Board regularly considered the group's relationship with various stakeholder groups. It discussed customers,  shareholder matters, employee engagement, and the group's impact on, and relationship with, wider society and the environment. \u00b7  The Board has focused deep dives, for example sessions with the executive nominated as the Group's Customer Champion, and it  considered these matters as part of its decision making on strategic proposals. \u00b7  Employee engagement continued to be a focus for the Board in 2021 with Lesley Knox, the designated workforce director, providing regular  updates on engagement with the workforce, the results of the employee surveys and visits to a number of Legal & General office locations.  \u00b7  The Board approved a proposal to update the Company's Articles of Association to permit hybrid AGMs to allow our shareholders to have |\n| ESG                             | \u00b7  The Board regularly received updates and discussed the range of activities the group is pursuing in respect of climate change.

        "page_content": "## Ensuring our directors have the right skills and experience to maintain an effective Board\n\nThe Board believes that continual director training and development is important to maximise the effectiveness of the Board. The Chairman is assisted by the Group Company Secretary in providing all new directors with a comprehensive induction programme on joining the Board. This includes a series of meetings with members of the Board and with the group's operational and functional leadership, external advisers to the group and a programme of meetings with employees. This ensures directors obtain a detailed insight into the group, it's businesses and governance framework as well as the regulatory macro environment in which it operates.\n\nThe key areas of the Board's induction programme include:\n\n- \u00b7 an introduction to the group's corporate structure, governance framework and guiding principles.\n- \u00b7 a meeting with the Group Company Secretary who provides detail on the roles and responsibilities of the Board, delegated authority framework, listed company requirements and the requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code, and how the group complies with its principles.\n- \u00b7 meetings with the CEO of each business division to receive an overview of each business area, including information around strategic goals, risk overview and management, customers, and key financial and non-financial KPIs.\n- \u00b7 meetings with members of the Board, the Executive Committee and senior management, covering areas such as:\n- -group risk management\n- -compliance\n- -group internal audit\n- -finance\n- -remuneration\n- -investor relations and corporate affairs.\n- \u00b7 a meeting with the Group Actuary focusing on regulatory capital and the group's Internal Model.\n- \u00b7 meetings with the Chairs of the Risk, Remuneration and Audit Committees.\n- \u00b7 a meeting with the external auditor.\n\nIn addition, all Board members receive continuing education and development at regular intervals throughout the year. It is the responsibility of the Chairman to ensure all directors have the necessary knowledge and training. Board and Committee meetings are used regularly to update the Board on developments in the areas in which the group operates, and specific training sessions for directors are scheduled for key topical issues. In the year, each director was given the opportunity to meet with the Group HR Director to discuss any specific focus areas for training.\n\nFor example, in 2021 the Board received detailed training sessions on technology risk and governance, cyber security and IFRS 17. The Board non-executive directors also visited our business operations in different locations and attended one-to-one briefing sessions with key members of the senior management team on a regular basis over the year.\n\n## Technology Committee\n\nThe Technology Committee was established in January 2018 primarily to provide assurance to the Board on the delivery of the group's programme to implement planned enhancements to the group's IT estate, and to ensure the group was operating within it's targeted access management, information security and cyber risk appetite. Following the successful delivery of the 2018 enhancements to the IT estate and significant improvements in the group's IT controls, in July 2020 the Technology Committee decided to focus its attention on more strategic matters. As part of this transition, two executive committees reporting into the Technology Committee were refocused to allow the Technology Committee to place reliance on the IT mechanisms and controls in place at an executive level. In addition, the meetings were lengthened to facilitate more comprehensive strategic discussion. The Technology Committee now focuses primarily on the Company's IT, digital and cyber strategies and their implementation plans and strategic technology opportunities for the group.\n\nIts other responsibilities include:\n\n- \u00b7 overseeing the control environment in place for information technology and cyber security.\n- \u00b7 overseeing technology aspects of major change programmes and understanding their strategic contribution and risks.\n- \u00b7 reviewing risks relating to IT and cyber security and plans for mitigation or treatment.\n- \u00b7 reviewing and approving any proposed technology projects and contracts within its remit of responsibility.\n- \u00b7 considering current capability relating to technology, cyber and digital skills and plans to address any gaps.\n- \u00b7 considering the adequacy, resilience and performance of suppliers and supply chains for IT and cyber.\n\nDuring 2021, the Committee membership comprised the Chairman and four independent non-executive directors, including the Senior Independent Director and the Chairs of the Audit Committee and Risk Committee. In addition, one of the Group CEO, Group CFO, Chief Risk Officer and Chief Technology Officer are expected to attend all meetings; in practice, all four of these executive members attend. The Committee is advised by three independent cyber and IT experts. The Committee met four times during 2021.\n\nThe group IT community was at the forefront of the group's Covid-19 response as the group moved to a more agile way of working. The Technology Committee continued to assess the impact of Covid-19 on the group's technology estate and our technology suppliers throughout 2021.\n\nIn 2021 the Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 received regular updates from the Technology Executive Committee and the Executive Security Committee.\n- \u00b7 reviewed risks relating to cyber security and the cyber-resilience of suppliers.\n- \u00b7 Focused on the group's cyber security, information security and access management programmes.\n- \u00b7 reviewed and endorsed the organisation and operating model in place for IT and cyber security and subsequently considered its ongoing suitability.\n- \u00b7 maintained oversight of the overall resilience of the group's IT systems and reviewed and approved divisional technology transformation programmes.\n- \u00b7 maintained oversight of the group's IT, digital and cyber strategies and the corresponding implementation plans.\n- \u00b7 received deep dive insights into major IT and cyber programmes across the group.\n- \u00b7 received updates on the technological threats and opportunities available to the group.\n- \u00b7 received updates on the group's data capabilities and the opportunities this could create.\n- \u00b7 received presentations from external speakers to provide an overview of industry trends and potential threats in relation to cyber security.",

The Board undertakes a formal and rigorous review of its performance and that of it's Committees and individual directors each year. In accordance with the Code, the Board commissions externally facilitated reviews regularly. The Board conducted an external evaluation in 2020 which was facilitated by Ffion Hague at Independent Board Evaluation (IBE), an external Board review specialist. IBE had not previously undertaken a Board evaluation for the Company and has no other connection with the Company or individual directors. The recommendations from the 2020 evaluation were reviewed and approved by the Board and regular updates on progress were provided at each Board meeting throughout the year. There is further detail on the progress the Board has made against those recommendations reported on the following page. In 2021 the Board undertook an internal review which was externally facilitated by IBE and commenced in October 2021. In addition, the Senior Independent Director formally appraised the Chairman's performance. The Board has reviewed the findings and approved the associated actions. The Board is kept up to date on the progress made against the agreed actions.\n\nThe aim of the review was to assess the effectiveness of the Board, both as a collective unitary Board, and at individual Board member level, in order to implement any actions required to become a more effective Board. The performance of each of the Board Committees was also assessed. Questionnaires were issued to every Board member, according to a set agenda tailored for the Board, which had been agreed in advance with the Chairman and Group Company Secretary. Following the final report, recommendations were considered by the Board and an action plan for areas of focus was agreed.\n\nThe Board review focused on, among other things: Board accountability, focus and priorities; Board composition, expertise, decision-making and dynamics; succession planning; selection and induction of new members; oversight and implementation of strategy; communication and relationship with stakeholders; risk management; governance, including links with subsidiary boards; and Board support, including resourcing and quality and volume of papers and presentations. The tone of the feedback was very positive overall and indicated that the Board is working effectively, with Board members noting the further strengthening of the Board in key areas with new non-executive director appointments. The key recommendations\n\n## Committee membership key\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinue to reflect important focus areas for the Board, namely (i) the continued and active oversight of Board and senior management succession and (ii) developing newer nonexecutive directors' knowledge of the business, including through site visits to see the business and investments first-hand. Furthermore, the Board is focused on embedding relationships following a period where physical engagement has been made more challenging as a result of Covid-19. Progress to implement the recommendations is underway and is monitored by the Group Company Secretary and reported to the Board at each Board meeting.",

Board leadership and company purpose A. Board's role\n\nThere is a formal schedule of matters reserved for the Board that sets out the structure under which the Board manages its responsibilities, providing guidance on how it discharges its authority and manages the Board's activities. The schedule of matters reserved is reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis. Our governance framework means we have a robust decision-making process and a clear framework within which decisions can be made and strategy can be delivered. Our delegated authority framework ensures that decisions are taken by the right people at the right level with accountability up to the Board, and enables an appropriate level of debate, challenge and support in the decision-making process. The Company continues to be led by an effective and entrepreneurial Board; a yearly planner is reviewed at each Board meeting to ensure the most important and current topics are discussed at meetings throughout the year. Board members are encouraged to discuss strategic matters with relevant executives on an ongoing basis. The Board's main activities throughout the year are detailed on page 76.\n\n## B. Purpose and culture\n\nThe Board held a strategy meeting in April 2021 and met for a two day, offsite strategy event in November 2021 to consider the group's strategy. The Board regularly reviews the Chief Risk Officer's conduct report, providing insight into culture across the organisation and helping to ensure behaviours throughout the business align with the Company's purpose, values and strategy. Furthermore, the Board is responsible for overseeing implementation of the groupwide diversity and inclusion policy which applies to all individuals directly employed by the group and forms the basis of engagement with customers and suppliers. Board members participate in site visits enabling them to meet with a number of our stakeholders and gain first-hand insight into culture in the various business divisions. As part of these site visits, Board members will set aside time to meet with smaller groups of employees to speak directly with them both with and without management present. Employees are invited to ask questions and feedback is provided to the next Board meeting. The Chairman, Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer have also hosted virtual town hall events throughout the year. Lesley Knox, designated non-executive\n\ndirector for engagement with the workforce, provided feedback at each Board meeting, alongside periodic feedback from the Voice survey and the annual performance review process which helps directors to assess Company culture. Lesley Knox has also met with employees to discuss Legal & General's culture and values and has attended various team meetings and away days to experience the culture herself. Lesley encourages an open and transparent question and answer session at each meeting she joins and will progress actions arising from these meetings. Additionally, when the Board is considering entering a new market or business area, culture plays a major part in discussions and Board members remain conscious of the need to embed the Company's inclusive culture in any new business. Building an inclusive culture enables innovation, better decision making and embodiment of our three behaviours: straightforward, collaborative and purposeful. Further information on the purpose of the company is provided on page 2.\n\n## C. Resources and controls\n\nThe Board's agenda is set by the Chairman and deals with those matters reserved for the Board, including matters relating to the group's strategic plan, risk appetite, and systems of internal control and corporate governance policies. Matters delegated to the Group Chief Executive Officer include managing the group's business in line with the strategic plan and approved risk appetite and responsibility for the operation of the internal control framework. The Group Risk Committee assists the Board in the oversight of the risks to which the group may be exposed and provides the Board with strategic advice in relation to current and potential future risk exposures. The risk management framework supports the informed risk taking by our businesses, setting out those rewarded risks that we are prepared to be exposed to and the risks that we want to avoid. Further information on risk management can be found on pages 52 to 59.\n\n## D. Stakeholder engagement\n\nBoard members take an active role in engaging with shareholders and wider stakeholders. Further information on the Board's engagement with stakeholders can be found on pages 68 to 72. Board members receive feedback at each Board meeting from Lesley Knox on her role as designated workforce director and periodic feedback from the employee Voice survey enabling them to assess and monitor culture. Board members were able to visit a number of Legal & General sites throughout the year and engaged with employees and members of the community.\n\n## E. Workforce engagement\n\nIn addition to Board members' site visits, the designated workforce director meets with employees of various grades and across business divisions throughout the year, enabling visibility of workforce policies and practices across the organisation and how these align with the Company's values and the group's behaviours. There is a whistleblowing hotline available for any members of the workforce who wish to raise any concern of wrongdoing in the workplace. The Board has oversight of whistleblowing and routinely receives updates on this. Additionally, employees are encouraged to share their views through the Voice survey and with Lesley Knox, the designated workforce director. Further details are available on page 74. Details on the company's approach to investing in and rewarding its workforce can be found on page 16 and page 112.\n\n## 2. Division of responsibilities F. Role of the Chairman\n\nThe Chairman sets the agendas for meetings, manages the meeting timetable and encourages an open and constructive dialogue during meetings, inviting the views of all Board members.\n\n## G. Composition of the Board\n\nIn addition to the Chairman, there were two executive directors and seven independent non-executive directors on the Board as at year-end. In January 2022, a further nonexecutive director joined the Board bringing the number of independent directors to eight. The roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive are clearly defined, and the role profiles are reviewed as part of the annual governance review undertaken by the Board. Sir John Kingman, the Chairman, is responsible for leading the Board while Sir Nigel Wilson, Group Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Company within the parameters of the strategy set by the Board. Sir John Kingman was identified by the directors as being independent on appointment.\n\n## H. Role of the non-executive directors\n\nThe non-executive directors' engagement with management, constructive challenge and contribution to Board discussion are assessed as part of the Board's annual effectiveness review. The non-executive directors' letters of appointment set out the time commitment expected from them. At times, this time commitment may go beyond that set out in the letter of appointment and is therefore reviewed regularly. External commitments, which may have an impact on existing time commitments, must be agreed in advance with the Chairman and approved by the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee under its delegation from the Group Board. In addition, the policy for the identification and management of directors' conflicts of interest is reviewed on an annual basis. The significant commitments of each",

Role of the Company Secretary\n\nProcedures are in place to ensure that Board members receive accurate and timely information via a secure electronic portal and all directors have access to the advice of the Group General Counsel and Company Secretary as well as independent professional advice at the expense of the Company.\n\n## 3. Composition, succession and evaluation\n\n## J. Appointments to the Board and succession planning\n\nThe Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for assessing the composition of the Board and, in making recommendations for appointments to the Board, the Committee considers the balance of skills, experience and knowledge needed in order to enhance the Board and support the company in the execution of its strategy. The Committee is committed to ensuring that all appointments are made on merit having evaluated the capabilities of all potential candidates against the requirements of the Board, with due regard for the benefits of all types of diversity, including gender. The Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy is published externally on the Company's website: group.legalandgeneral.com/en/ about-us/corporate-governance/diversity A summary can be found on page 84 to 85.\n\n## K. Skills, experience and knowledge of the Board\n\nIn making recommendations for appointments, the Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee considers the balance of skills, experience and knowledge needed in order to enhance the Board and support the group in the execution of its strategy. Further details of the appointments undertaken during the year can be found on pages 82 to 83. All directors are subject to shareholder election or re-election at the AGM, with the exception of those directors who are retiring at the conclusion of the meeting. None of the non-executive directors have currently served over nine years on the Board.\n\n## L. Board evaluation\n\nThe Board undergoes an externally facilitated evaluation every three years. An external Board evaluation was undertaken during 2020. The 2021 annual report includes details of the 2021 internal review which was externally facilitated by the Board evaluation specialists Independent Board Evaluation and commenced in October 2021. An update on the progress made against the recommendations from the 2020 external review is also provided.\n\n## 4. Audit, risk and internal control M. Internal and external audit\n\nThe Audit Committee comprises four independent non-executive directors and the Board delegates a number of responsibilities to the Audit Committee, including oversight of the group's financial reporting processes, internal control and risk management systems and the work undertaken by the external and internal auditors. The Committee also supports the Board's consideration of the Company's viability statement and its ability to operate as a going concern. The Audit Committee chair provides regular updates to the Board on key matters discussed by the Committee. Details of how the Committee assesses the effectiveness and independence of the external auditors can be found on page 91. KPMG were appointed as the group's external auditors with effect from the financial year ended 31 December 2018 following a tender process in 2016.\n\n## N. Fair, balanced and understandable assessment\n\nThe Strategic report, located on pages 2 to 59, sets out the performance of the Company, the business model, strategy, and the risks and uncertainties relating to the Company's future prospects. When taken as a whole, the directors consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## O. Risk management and internal control framework\n\nThe Board sets the Company's risk appetite and annually reviews the effectiveness of the Company's risk management and internal control systems. A description of the principal risks facing the Company is set out on page 56. Page 55 sets out how the directors have assessed the prospects of the Company, over what period they have done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate (the 'viability statement'). The Group Risk Committee considers assessments of the group's current risk profile and emerging risk factors, facilitated by the Group Chief Risk Officer. The activities of the Group Audit and Risk Committees are set out on pages 86 to 93.\n\n## 5. Remuneration\n\n## P. Remuneration policies and practices\n\nThe Company aims to reward employees fairly and its remuneration policy is designed to promote the long-term success of the Company whilst aligning the interests of both the executive directors and shareholders. An updated remuneration policy was approved by shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. The directors' remuneration policy is set out on pages 100 to 101.\n\n## Q. Executive remuneration\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for setting the remuneration for executive directors. No director is involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome.\n\n## R. Remuneration outcomes and independent judgement\n\nDetails of the composition and the work of the Remuneration Committee are reflected in the Remuneration Committee Terms of Reference and set out in the Directors' report on remuneration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nA full version of the Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council's website.

The Committee has overall responsibility for leading the process for new appointments to the Board. It also ensures that these appointments bring the required skills and experience to the Board to support the Board's role in the development and oversight of the group's strategy. As part of this, the Committee reviews the structure, size and composition of the Board to ensure the Board is made up of the right people with the necessary skills and experience whilst striving to achieve a Board composition that promotes diversity of thought and approach.\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities are:\n\n- \u00b7 regularly reassessing the structure, size and composition of the Board and recommending any suggested changes.\n- \u00b7 considering succession planning for directors and other senior executives. This takes into account the promotion of diversity and inclusion, the challenges and opportunities facing the company, and the skills and expertise needed by the Board in the future. In addition, the Committee ensures the continued ability of the company to compete effectively for talent in the market place.\n- \u00b7 reviewing the criteria for identifying and nominating candidates for appointment to the Board based on the specification for a prospective appointment including the required skills and capabilities.\n- \u00b7 identifying and nominating for approval of the Board, candidates to fill Board vacancies as and when they arise, taking into account other demands on directors' time.\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the time commitment required from non-executive directors and assessing the non-executive directors' other significant commitments to ensure that they continue to be able to fulfil their duties effectively.\n- \u00b7 overseeing and monitoring the company's corporate governance framework, ensuring compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code while promoting the highest standards of corporate governance across the group.\n- \u00b7 monitoring and assessing the group's commitment to diversity and inclusion across the group.\n\n## How the Committee spent its time in 2021 Board composition and succession\n\nIn the first half of the year, the Committee undertook a rigorous review of the Board's composition to support discussions on non-executive director succession. This included a capability assessment of Board members' knowledge, skills and experience in the context of the Company's short and medium-term strategy, supported by a self-assessment analysis undertaken by each individual director, as well as various other considerations including the tenure and independence of directors, and diversity. A key theme that emerged from the review was that the Board's effectiveness in driving and monitoring technological innovation, one of the six growth drivers of the Company's strategy, could be further enhanced with the addition of a director with digital or technology experience. A second theme, looking to Committee composition in particular, was that additional accounting and financial services experience would be a beneficial addition to the Board's knowledge and skills. The recruitment of the two new non-executive directors, Laura Wade-Gery, who joined the Board in January 2022, and Tushar Morzaria, who will join the",

        "page_content": "Board in May 2022 was undertaken with these themes as a priority, in addition to the overarching requirement that the appointee must be able to operate at a high level of financial and technical complexity, to maintain effectiveness in overseeing the Company's core strategic priorities.\n\nThe Committee engaged independent external search firm Spencer Stuart to undertake a full search against a description of the roles, the time commitment expected of directors and the Board diversity policy. Spencer Stuart was chosen for its deep knowledge of the financial services and other relevant industries and its strong experience in finding diverse and inclusive leaders. A list of potential candidates was identified and these candidates were assessed against the role specification, merit and with due regard for the benefits of all forms of diversity on the Board, including diversity of gender, ethnicity and background. A short list of candidates was narrowed down from those on the long list and those candidates were invited to an interview process facilitated by the Chairman, the Group CEO, the Group HR Director and members of the Board. Following this extensive search, selection and interview process, the Committee, following discussion, recommended Laura Wade-Gery and Tushar Morzaria's appointment to the Board. The Board approved the two appointments. Laura's appointment took effect on 3 January 2022. Tushar Morzaria will join the Board from 27 May 2022.\n\nLaura and Tushar are  highly experienced and respected individuals and will add further valuable experience and insight to the Board. The biographies of these two new non-executive directors are set out on pages 62 to 63  and show the strength and depth of skills and experience they bring to the Board.\n\n## Succession\n\nIn addition to reviewing Board composition, and in line with the recommendations coming out of the 2020 Board evaluation, in 2021 the Committee continued to focus on short, medium and long-term succession planning for the executive and senior management, with particular emphasis on how the composition of the executive management and senior leadership teams can facilitate delivering on the group's six strategic growth drivers. The Committee reviewed management succession plans and debated areas for growth, strengthening and consolidation in the context of the Company's strategy. Executive leadership of the Legal & General Institutional Retirement (LGRI) business was an important short-term succession focus for the Committee in 2021 and critical for the delivery of the strategic pillar to be a global leader in pensions de-risking and retirement income solutions. A formal process\n\nwas undertaken which included both internal and external candidates to identify the successor to Laura Mason as Chief Executive, following her appointment as Chief Executive, Legal & General Capital. At the conclusion of that process and following Committee discussions, a number of changes to our executive team were announced in October 2021, including Andrew Kail's appointment to the role of Chief Executive, LGRI. In 2021, the executive organisation structure was reviewed to understand opportunities to maximise effectiveness on delivering on another strategic pillar of helping people take responsibility for their own financial security through insurance, pensions and savings. Following discussions, it was further agreed that the group's retail businesses (Legal & General Insurance and Legal & General Retail Retirement) would be combined under the leadership of Bernie Hickman. Following well-planned and appropriate handovers, the changes to the executive team took place in January 2022.\n\nThe Committee also discussed succession planning for the chair of our Audit Committee, following Philip Broadley's six year tenure in the role and his appointment as the Senior Independent Director in 2021. Tushar Morzaria will take over from Philip as Audit Committee chair when he joins the Board in May 2022. As the current Group Finance Director of Barclays Plc, the chair of the audit committee at BP plc and with extensive accounting and financial services experience, Tushar is very well positioned to fulfil the duties as Audit Committee chair. When considering Tushar's appointment as Audit Committee chair, the Committee thought carefully about the time commitment required to undertake both this role and his other external commitments and satisfied itself that Tushar has sufficient time to fully commit to the role.\n\nThe Committee also spent time considering the successor to Lesley Knox in her role as the designated workforce director. This was an important decision for the Committee as the group's people are its most important asset. It therefore remains vital for the Board to ensure that it continues to hear the voice of the group's employees through a variety of channels, including the designated workforce director. The Committee determined that Nilufer von Bismarck OBE will be an excellent successor.\n\ndetermined that Nilufer von Bismarck has the necessary skills and experience to take on the role as the Board's designated non-executive director for climate. Nilufer's appointment will further bolster the Board's focus on the group's climate commitments.\n\nThe Committee is responsible for evaluating the independence of all non-executive directors and undertakes an annual review of each nonexecutive director's other interests. The Board, on the recommendation of the Committee, is satisfied that each non-executive director serving at the end of the year remains independent and continues to have sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities to the company. The Committee is also responsible for overseeing and monitoring the group's corporate governance framework which includes the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 monitoring the group's compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.\n- \u00b7 promoting the highest standards of corporate governance across the group.\n- \u00b7 considering and approving directors' additional external appointments, taking into account other demands on directors' time.\n- \u00b7 ensuring that on appointment to the Board non-executive directors receive a formal letter of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of them in terms of time commitment, Committee service and involvement outside Board meetings.\n- \u00b7 overseeing the process for ensuring that non-executive directors have tailored induction programmes on appointment and ongoing development programmes, including regular Executive Business Awareness sessions, designed to maximise their effectiveness.\n- \u00b7 overseeing the process by which the Board, each Committee and individual directors assess their effectiveness (including the use of an external facilitator periodically, as well as self-assessment) and reporting to the Board on the findings and recommendations.\n\nDetails of the group's compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code have been provided on pages 80 and 81.\n\nAs detailed on pages 18 and 19, the group continues to show its commitment to addressing climate change, one of the group's strategic growth drivers. As part of this, and to ensure the Board's continued effectiveness in overseeing the successful implementation of the group's strategy, the Committee was delighted to recommend to the Board a designated non-executive director for climate matters across the group.

        "page_content": "## Nominations and Corporate Governance Committee report continued\n\n## Our approach to diversity and inclusion\n\nOur ambition is to create an inclusive culture at Legal & General, where we can all perform at our best, no matter who we are. We believe not only that this is the right thing to do, but also that this aim is consistent with our objectives around inclusive capitalism. There is a clear commercial logic as well as a compelling moral case for this, and it underpins the actions we take to improve diversity and inclusion across the organisation.\n\nThe Committee has three key areas of focus for the Board as part of driving diversity and inclusion across the group.\n\n## 1. Building a diverse and inclusive Board\n\nAn effective Board is one that embodies diversity of thought and background, and one which reflects our people as well as the businesses and communities our organisation serves. Ensuring appropriate diversity in Board composition with the right mix of skills and experience has been a key focus for the Committee during the year.\n\nWe are proud to have a Board which is diverse, both in terms of gender and ethnicity, but also diversity of thought and background. Our Board currently comprises 36% women and 64% men (this figure was 30% women and 70% men as at 31 December 2021, prior to Laura Wade-Gery joining the Board on 3 January 2022).\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, 20% of the Board was from an ethnically diverse background, which exceeds the target in our Board Diversity Policy and the recommendations of the Parker Review.\n\n## 2. A more diverse and inclusive Senior Leadership Team\n\nA diverse Senior Leadership Team is as important as a diverse Board, because we believe that executive decision-making is more effective if it takes into account a wider range of views and opinions. Therefore, we continue to hold ourselves to the stretching aspirational targets we set in 2017:\n\n- \u00b7 40% female representation at middle/senior management level.\n- \u00b7 50% female representation across our total employee base.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, female representation across the group stood at 44.5%, down 0.2% vs our position at the end of 2020. At the middle/ senior management level, representation was 35.9%, up 0.3% vs our position at the end of 2020.\n\nOur Executive Committee comprises 25% women and 75% men, with two of our five operating businesses led by a female CEO.\n\nWhilst we originally intended our gender targets to be achieved by the end of 2020, we have revised the outcome date to 2025. Our initial targets were aspirational, and, whilst it is disappointing to have missed them, we strongly believe in setting stretching targets to create focus. The new timeline remains challenging, although we have a clear plan to deliver against it.\n\nWe are committed to increasing the ethnic diversity of our workforce, including at our most senior grades. We have a clear strategy and plan to do this, which includes a focus on recruitment and retention of minority ethnicity talent and the creation of career development and progression opportunities for under-represented groups. Employee data is important to help us track progress and identify issues and we are keen to improve the quality of the data that we hold. As data is disclosed on a discretionary basis by employees, we have put our efforts into communicating the importance of this data, with the result that disclosure rates, for ethnicity, have increased in the year, from 52.6% to 67.9%. We will continue to engage our employees about the importance of sharing diversity data in 2022.\n\nRecognising that our ethnicity data is not complete, as of 31 December 2021, minority ethnicity representation across the group stood at 11.9%. At senior management level, representation was 12.0%.\n\nWe continue to take practical and purposeful steps towards redressing under-representation in our workforce, including, during 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 a diversity and inclusion-led audit of our recruitment processes (early careers, core and volume hiring) across all diversity and inclusion dimensions including gender and ethnicity.\n\n- \u00b7 ongoing investment in development for line managers, with around 200 line managers taking part in either 'D&I Basics' or 'Inclusive Line Management' training.\n- \u00b7 the introduction of anonymised CVs into the recruitment process.\n- \u00b7 continued investment in our employee networks across the full spectrum of D&I themes, including gender and ethnicity: 2021 saw the launch of a new internal Women & Tech network to connect women working in technology and data roles and the development of a tech and digital recruitment campaign which cited attracting more women into these roles as an explicit objective.\n- \u00b7 provision of wellbeing resources including access to a backup network for child, adult and elder care.\n- \u00b7 ongoing external validation and benchmarking through the Women in Finance Charter, the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index, Invest in Ethnicity Matrix, Social Mobility Employers Index and HamptonAlexander Review.\n\n## 3. Broadening the diversity & inclusion agenda across our organisation\n\nOur Global Diversity and Inclusion Council (D&I Council) continued to promote our agenda of creating a diverse and inclusive business. It is chaired by Laura Mason, CEO of LGC and our Global Diversity and Inclusion Sponsor. The D&I Council is tasked with developing our plans for improving diversity and inclusion across the group.\n\nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the implementation of our group-wide D&I policy. During 2021, members of the Board, including the Chairman, participated in The Listening Project, an exercise which involved Legal & General employees sharing their perspectives on ethnic diversity and lived experience as employees of the group.\n\nOur D&I policy applies to everyone directly employed by the group and forms the basis of our engagement with our clients, suppliers and other third-party providers. Our standards include:\n\n- \u00b7 we will be fair and transparent, and treat our people with integrity and openness. We will be respectful of differences and we will not tolerate behaviour that marginalises, disadvantages or devalues others.\n- \u00b7 we will aim to build a workforce that reflects the diverse communities we serve. We will invest in our hiring processes so we can attract a more diverse pool of people, and we will tackle barriers that prevent us from attracting and retaining more diverse talent.\n- \u00b7 we will create an inclusive environment where people feel comfortable sharing their opinions and feel like they belong. We will encourage our people to embrace difference, to listen to other points of view, and work together to achieve the best outcome.",

As at 8 March 2021, the Committee comprises 44% women and 56% men and comprises individuals from the following ethnic groups:\n\n- \u00b7 Asian - 11%.\n- \u00b7 Black - 11%.\n- \u00b7 White - 78%.\n\nThe Committee only engages executive search firms that are signatories to the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, which promotes gender diversity and best practice for corporate board searches. During the year, the company engaged Spencer Stuart, which is a signatory to this Code. This search firm has no other connection to the company or individual directors.\n\nThe Committee briefs the search firm to ensure that the pool of candidates presented includes a diverse range of candidates with an appropriate range of experience, knowledge and background, and who demonstrate independence of approach and thought. As detailed on pages 82 to 83, this process was followed for the recruitment of our new non-executive directors.\n\n## Diversity Gender\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 the Board comprised:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 30% Women\n\n70%\n\nMen\n\nAs at 8 March 2022: 36% Women and 64% men\n\n## Tenure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 the length of tenure of the non-executives varied:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 0% Over six years\n\n75%\n\nBetween three and six years\n\n25%\n\nBetween zero and three years\n\n## Ethnicity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs at 31 December 2021 the Board comprised individuals from the following ethnic groups:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10% Asian\n\n10%\n\nBlack\n\n80% White\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Finding what you need online\n\nWe have published our gender pay gap data which can be found online at group.legalandgeneral.com/reports\n\nA summary is available on page 49 of this report.",

The table below sets out its membership during the year.\n\n| Members                              |\n|--------------------------------------|\n| Philip Broadley (Chairman)           |\n| Nilufer von Bismarck (from May 2021) |\n| George Lewis                         |\n| Toby Strauss                         |\n| Henrietta Baldock (until March 2021) |\n| Lesley Knox (until March 2021)       |\n| Julia Wilson (retired March 2021)    |\n\nOther regular attendees at Committee meetings include the following:\n\nGroup Chairman; Group Chief Executive; Group Chief Financial Officer; Group Chief Risk Officer; Director of Group Finance; Group Chief Internal Auditor; Legal & General Retirement Finance Director; Group Actuary; Chief Tax Officer; Representatives of the external auditor, KPMG LLP.\n\n## Letter from the Chairman Dear Shareholder\n\nI am pleased to present the Audit Committee report for the year ended 31 December 2021. The report explains the work of the Committee during the year and meets the disclosure requirements set out in the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (the 'Code').\n\nThe Code requires that the Audit Committee must operate effectively and efficiently and that its members have a balance of skills and experience to deliver its responsibilities.\n\nThe members of the Audit Committee have a wide range of experience, including as executives in the financial services and other sectors, as non-executive directors, and as board members responsible for financial reporting. The Board considers that I meet the requirements of the Code in having recent and relevant financial experience, as do other members of the Committee. The full biographies of all Committee members can be found on pages 62 to 63. At the end of March, Julia Wilson retired from the Audit Committee and resigned from her role on the Board. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Julia for her considerable support and wise counsel during her time as both a member and former Chair of the Committee.\n\nIt is worth highlighting that all members of the Committee are also members of the Risk Committee, which ensures that there is appropriate identification and management of any issues that are relevant to both committees.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with the external auditor and the Group Chief Internal Auditor. These meetings allow for regular and open dialogue of any issues relevant to the Committee's work. Audit\n\nCommittee members also meet regularly with management outside of formal Committee meetings to discuss topical issues and maintain their understanding of the group's businesses.\n\nDuring 2021, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy issued an extensive and wide-ranging consultation on 'Restoring trust in audit and corporate governance.' Members of the Committee reviewed the consultation and considered its implications for both the group and the Audit Committee more specifically, as well as in the wider context of ensuring that the UK remains an attractive market for shareholders, investors and broader stakeholders. We are supportive of the early establishment and empowerment of the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (ARGA) to ensure that reforms and associated standards are suitably embedded in relevant professional and corporate bodies, and the Committee will continue to keep a close focus on any proposed legislation, changes in corporate governance requirements and emerging best practice to ensure that the group continues to be seen as a strong advocate of high quality and transparent audit and corporate governance.\n\n## Audit Committee focus for 2021\n\nThe Audit Committee met five times in accordance with its annual plan and additional informal meetings were arranged as necessary. In line with its purpose, the Committee's time over the course of the year was spent in consideration of:\n\n- \u00b7 the resilience of operational and financial controls in a continuing hybrid working environment.\n- \u00b7 the integrity of the company's financial statements and Solvency II disclosures, including consideration of the viability statement and going concern assessments.\n- \u00b7 key accounting, financial reporting and actuarial areas of judgement, including the impact of Covid-19, the presentation and transparency of the group's financial disclosures, including consideration of the group's Alternative Performance Measures.\n- \u00b7 the adequacy of climate disclosures, including consideration of the group's climate report.\n- \u00b7 the adequacy and effectiveness of our systems of internal control, including whistleblowing.\n- \u00b7 the effectiveness, performance and objectivity of both the internal and external audit functions including an externally facilitated review of the Group Internal Audit function.\n- \u00b7 the group's preparations for the transition to the new accounting standard for insurance contracts, IFRS 17.",

        "page_content": "While the global outbreak of Covid-19 has continued to have a profound impact on society, the direct impacts on the group have lessened or been mitigated during 2021, and this has allowed the Committee to adjust its activities to look at other areas of focus. One area associated with Covid-19 where the Committee has continued to spend a proportion of its time is in respect of the move to a hybrid working model. While this is recognised more and more as a 'new normal', and brings with it many benefits from an individual employee and company perspective, it also carries a new set of risks and it is right for the Committee to focus on the resilience of the control environment in light of this changed operating model, including how it is monitored and overseen in the future.\n\nAs the implementation date of IFRS 17 draws closer, the Committee's focus on the group's preparedness has continued to increase. While the Committee has continued to monitor the implementation of the systems, processes and operating model to support the delivery of the new financial reporting requirements, time has also been spent in reviewing and approving certain methodologies, policies, assumptions and reporting metrics, supported by a number of Board technical awareness sessions held outside of the normal Committee meetings.\n\nFinally, the Committee has spent time during 2021 in consideration of the scope, focus and quality of the various sources of assurance from which it is able to gain comfort. This has included: working with Group Internal Audit to incorporate timely and independent assurance over specific elements of the IFRS 17 programme; monitoring the continued development and embedding of the group's Model & Financial Control Framework (MFCF), including the receipt and review of regular reporting on the outcome of design and operating effectiveness testing; and a decision to require independent limited assurance over certain elements of the group's climate report.\n\n## Effectiveness reviews\n\nThe Committee's performance was externally evaluated  by  Independent  Board  Evaluation  (IBE) in December 2020. The Committee identified two actions as part of its evaluation: undertaking a review of the Committee's composition to ensure that it operated as efficiently and effectively as possible; and enhancing the Committee's engagement with both Group Internal Audit and the external auditor. In\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Audit Committee's terms of reference, which set out full details of its responsibilities, can be viewed on our website group.legalandgeneral. com/committees\n\nresponse to the evaluation, which suggested that the Committee would benefit from a smaller more technically focused membership, the composition of the Committee was revised on 1 May 2021 and Nilufer von Bismarck was appointed as a member of the Committee. Feedback was also provided to the Internal Audit Function to enhance communication and individual briefing sessions with external auditors were scheduled regularly.\n\nIn 2021 the Board undertook an internal evaluation, which was externally facilitated by IBE and included an effectiveness review of the Board Committees, including the Audit Committee. Committee members were satisfied with the effectiveness of the Committee and the progress that had been made on the Committee's succession plans.\n\nI am pleased to report that the Committee continues to operate effectively. Looking ahead to the coming year, I expect the Committee to be focused on an ever-broadening range of topics. IFRS 17 will inevitably require a deeper and more concentrated focus as the group begins to produce comparative information for the year ending 31 December 2022, as KPMG undertakes more detailed audit work on those comparatives, and as the new financial reporting operating model goes through final implementation and testing in advance of go-live in 2023. At the same time, the Committee will continue to consider and review wider aspects of the group's reporting, particularly Alternative Performance Measures under the new accounting standards and the increasing stakeholder focus on non-financial metrics, as well as the continued embedding of the MFCF to support and demonstrate the robustness of the financial reporting control environment.\n\nThis will be my last report as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Tushar Morzaria will join the Board in May and will succeed me as Chairman of the Committee upon his appointment. Tushar has a wealth of recent and relevant expertise in financial services and will bring a fresh view to the work of the Committee. I will remain as a member of the Committee to provide continuity of experience.\n\nThe information on the following pages sets out in detail the activities of the Committee during the year. I hope that you will find this report useful in understanding our work and I welcome any comments from shareholders on my report.\n\nPhilip Broadley Chairman of the Audit Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the principal responsibilities to assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities with regard to monitoring the integrity of the group's financial statements, monitoring the effectiveness of the internal control (including financial internal control) framework and overseeing the independence and objectivity of the internal and external auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for advising the Board on whether the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and for reviewing the basis on which the Board provides the viability statement and going concern assessment.\n\nThe Audit Committee has an annual work plan aligned with the financial reporting cycle of the Company. The Audit Committee's activities fall into three principal areas:\n\n- \u00b7 accounting and financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 internal and external audit.\n- \u00b7 internal control.\n\n## Accounting and financial reporting\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the appropriateness of the half year and annual financial statements, which it carries out with both management and the external auditors. This review includes ensuring that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable, as well as covering compliance with disclosure requirements and the material areas in which significant judgements have been applied.\n\nIn collaboration with the Risk Committee, the Audit Committee also reviews the disclosures to be made in relation to internal control and risk management, as well as the principal risks and uncertainties the group faces.\n\nThe Committee can confirm that the key judgements and significant issues considered in relation to the 2021 financial statements are consistent with the disclosures of key estimation uncertainties and critical judgements as detailed in Note 1 on page 139.\n\nRobust year-end governance processes are in place to support the Audit Committee's considerations which include:\n\n- \u00b7 ensuring that all of those involved in the preparation of the Company's annual report have been appropriately trained and fully briefed on the 'fair, balanced and understandable' requirements.\n- \u00b7 internal legal verification of all factual statements, and descriptions used within the narrative.\n- \u00b7 regular engagement with and feedback from senior management on proposed content and changes.\n- \u00b7 feedback from external advisors (corporate reporting specialists, remuneration and strategic reporting advisors, external auditor) to enhance the quality of our reporting.\n- \u00b7 early opportunity for review and feedback on our annual report by Audit Committee members.\n\nDuring the year, the Audit Committee has continued to keep abreast of significant and emerging accounting and reporting developments, including consideration of changes in disclosures arising from best practice application and Financial Reporting Council (FRC) publications on aspects of UK reporting.",

In this regard the Committee  has reviewed the group's use of APMs in light of the FRC's thematic review in October 2021. The Committee has reviewed the application of adjusted operating profit, and specifically the inclusion of certain |\n| a range of these metrics to enhance understanding  of the group's performance.

IFRS  17 is expected to have a significant impact on the | items either as part of adjusted operating profit or investment variances, to ensure that they are aligned to both  the group's disclosed policies on these APMs, and the underlying principles of fair and consistent reporting.  Where appropriate the Committee has reviewed additional disclosures provided to enhance transparency in  respect of the group's APMs.                                                                           |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The Committee concluded that the use and disclosure of APMs, including the clarity of labelling the prominence  of APMs versus statutory measures, are appropriate for inclusion in the annual report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | As well as continuing to monitor the preparedness of the group to implement IFRS 17, the Committee has  reviewed a number of papers during 2021, covering various areas of policy, methodology and assumptions,  such as the application of the General Measurement Model.                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| reporting of the group's financial performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | In particular, the Committee has reviewed the methodology and assumptions to support the transition to IFRS 17,  including the decision to apply the fair value approach to calculate the contractual service margin on transition for  annuities issued prior to 2016.                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The Committee has further reviewed certain demographic assumptions which will be applied as part of the  transition, as well as broader additions to the group's Accounting Policy Manual in respect of IFRS 17.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The Committee concluded that the disclosures in respect of IFRS 17 included in Note 1 Basis of Preparation are  appropriate for inclusion in the annual report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\nThe Audit Committee, having completed its review, recommended to the Board that, when taken as a whole, the 2021 annual report is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy and the business risks that it faces. The Audit Committee, together with the Risk Committee, reviewed the key assumptions and methodologies of the risk-based capital model as well as related Solvency II disclosures. The statement is underpinned by the Committee's belief that all important information has been disclosed and that the descriptions and reviews of the group's business and performance as set out in the Strategic Report are consistent with the financial reporting in the group's financial statements.\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board has delegated responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the group's systems of internal control to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for the oversight of the group's system of internal controls including controls over financial reporting and the work of the\n\ninternal audit function. The Audit Committee, in collaboration with the Risk Committee, seeks to ensure that the group operates within a framework of prudent and effective controls that allow risk to be identified, assessed and managed.\n\nThe Audit Committee has completed its review of the effectiveness of the group's system of internal control policies and procedures, during the year and up to the date this report was approved, in accordance with the requirements of the Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related Financial and Business Reporting published by the FRC. During this review, the Audit Committee did not identify any weaknesses which were determined to be significant to the preparation of the financial statements. Where areas for improvement were identified, processes are in place to ensure that the necessary actions are taken and progress is monitored by the Audit Committee.\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Audit Committee monitored and reviewed the scope, extent and effectiveness of the activity of the Group Internal Audit function. In particular, the Audit Committee evaluates the alignment of the internal audit plan with the group's key risks and strategy.\n\nThe Group Chief Internal Auditor has a standing agenda item at each Audit Committee meeting to update the Audit Committee on audit activities, progress of the audit plans, the results of any unsatisfactory audits and the action plans to address these areas. The group has adapted quickly to the adoption of a hybrid working model, and Internal Audit were able to undertake all the audits within their Internal Audit Plan, including some additional reviews to test the continued effectiveness of the overall control environment as remote working continued during the year, as approved by the Committee, completing 115 audits in 2021. There was a particular focus on key themes including: the effectiveness of the control framework in a remote working environment; cyber/data management and governance; financial control framework; digital business and regulatory change; conduct risk; financial management and control; model and end user computer risk; outsourcing/vendor management and economic and political volatility.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets with the Group Chief Internal Auditor in private throughout the year. The Committee, in line with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors Financial Services Code of Practice, conducted an assessment of, and were able to confirm, the independence of the Group Chief Internal Auditor.",

        "page_content": "## The external auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee has the primary responsibility for overseeing the relationship with, and performance of, the external auditor. This includes making recommendations for their appointment, re-appointment, removal and remuneration.\n\n## Appointment\n\nThe Audit Committee is cognisant of the requirements governing the appointment of an external auditor, notably the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Uses of Competitive Tender Process and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014, including requirements for mandatory audit firm rotation. The Company confirms that it has complied with such requirements for the financial year under review.\n\nFollowing a competitive tender carried out in 2016, KPMG was appointed as the group's external auditors with effect from the financial year ended 31 December 2018. In May 2021, KPMG was reappointed as the group's external auditor for the financial year ended 31 December 2021, which is their fourth year as the group's external auditor. Rees Aronson, who has been the lead audit partner for KPMG since appointment, continued in that role for the year ended 31 December 2021. Mr Aronson will retire from KPMG during the course of 2022. The Committee accepted KPMG's proposal that Salim Tharani succeeds Mr Aronson as lead audit partner for 2022. Mr Tharani has been involved as a partner on the audit for the past four years.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external auditor against the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 provision of timely and accurate industryspecific and technical knowledge.\n- \u00b7 maintaining a professional and open dialogue with the Audit Committee Chair and members at all times.\n- \u00b7 delivery of an efficient and effective audit and the ability to meet objectives within the agreed timeframes.\n- \u00b7 the quality of its judgements and audit findings, management's response and stakeholder feedback.\n\nThe Audit Committee receives regular reports from the external auditor on audit findings, significant accounting and actuarial issues, and internal control matters. During 2021, there has been an increase in reporting relating to IFRS 17,\n\nincluding work on key judgement areas, accounting policies, actuarial assumptions and the impact of the transition to IFRS 17 on audit approach and planning.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets the external auditor in private throughout the year.\n\nAs in the prior year, as a result of Covid-19 much of KPMG's audit work has been undertaken remotely. The Audit Committee has sought to understand whether this has impacted KPMG's audit plan or their ability to undertake their work effectively. KPMG's regular reporting throughout the year has demonstrated no significant or adverse impact from remote working, and the Committee is comfortable that there has been no undue impact on their effectiveness.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews and approves the terms of engagement of the external auditor and monitors its independence. This includes maintaining the policy for overseeing the engagement of the external auditor for pre-approved audit services, audit-related services and other non-audit work. The non-audit services policy includes a 'whitelist' of permitted audit and audit-related services along with a list of prohibited services. The policy, the purpose of which is to ensure that the independence of the external auditor is not impaired, is approved by the Audit Committee and meets the requirements of the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nOur practice is to approach other firms for significant non-audit work. The group's policy requires that all services with an anticipated cost in excess of a specified amount are subject to a full competitive tender involving at least one other alternate party in addition to the external auditor. If the external auditor is selected following the tender process, the Audit Committee is responsible for approving the external auditors' fees on the engagement.\n\nFor services with an anticipated cost below the specified amount, the Group Chief Financial Officer has authority to approve the engagement. The external auditor and management are required to report regularly to the Audit Committee on the nature and fees relating to non-audit services provided under this authority.\n\nKPMG annually reports on whether and why it deems itself to be independent. The Audit Committee remains satisfied that KPMG continues to be independent.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nIn 2021, the group spent \u00a31.3 million on non-audit services provided by KPMG. It spent \u00a31.3 million on audit-related services required by legislation, which is excluded from any calculation of the ratio of non-audit to audit fees in accordance with the UK FRC Revised Ethical Standard for Auditors (2019). Further details can be found in Note 31 to the consolidated financial statements. The non-audit fee represents 11% of the total audit fee for 2021.\n\n## Analysis of current and prior-year spend on audit, other assurance and nonassurance services\n\n|                                        | 2021   | 2020   |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Audit                                  | 9.3    | 10.1   |    7.1 |\n| Audit-related required  by legislation | 1.3    | 1.4    |    0.8 |\n| Other audit-related                    | 1.2    | 0.6    |    1.1 |\n| Other assurance                        | 0.1    | 0.6    |    0.3 |\n| Non-assurance                          | -      | -      |    0.2 |\n| Total                                  | 11.9   | 12.7   |    9.5 |",

The table below sets out its membership during the year.\n\n## Members\n\nToby Strauss (Chairman)\n\nHenrietta Baldock\n\nNilufer von Bismarck (from July 2021)\n\nPhilip Broadley\n\nLesley Knox\n\nGeorge Lewis\n\nRic Lewis\n\nJulia Wilson (retired March 2021)\n\nOther attendees at Committee meetings include the following:\n\nGroup Chairman; Group Chief Executive; Group Chief Financial Officer; Group Chief Risk Officer; Group Chief Internal Auditor; Representatives of the external auditor, KPMG LLP.\n\nThe role of the Committee is to assist the Board in the oversight of the risks to which the group may be exposed and to provide the Board with strategic advice in relation to current and potential future risk exposures. This includes reviewing the group's risk profile and appetite for risk and assessing the effectiveness of the group's risk management framework. The group's approach to the management of risk is set out in more detail on pages 52 to 59.\n\nThe work of the Committee is supported by the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Company Secretary, who assist the Committee chair in planning the Committee's work and ensuring that the Committee receives accurate and timely information. The Committee met five times during 2021.\n\n## Group Chief Risk Officer's report\n\nThe Committee receives at each meeting a formal report from the Group Chief Risk Officer. This report brings to the Committee's attention key factors in the operating environment of the group's businesses and an assessment of the potential risks that may emerge. The review includes analysis of risks arising from the macro-economic outlook and conditions in financial markets, together with geopolitical, legislative and regulatory change risks that may impact the group's businesses, and risks associated with the implementation of the group's business strategy.\n\nAlongside the Group Chief Risk Officer's report the Committee is provided with management information on risk appetite, comparing actual positions relative to the group's risk appetite statement and quantitative analysis of the group's exposures to financial and operational risks, including risk-based capital requirements in relation to the core risks implicit in the group's businesses. The Committee also receives an\n\nassessment of the overall profile of conduct risks for the group; analysis and trends in complaints data and a suite of customer service metrics designed to enable the Committee to assess the management of the customer journey across the group's financial services products.\n\n## Assessing the risk impacts of Covid-19\n\nThe Committee has continued to engage with executive and operational management during the pandemic to consider the responses being taken to the range of risks presented by Covid-19, and the wider impacts for our businesses from the global lockdown.\n\nAs well as ensuring the wellbeing of those at Legal & General, the Committee has considered the actions taken to maintain the availability of customer facing services, and the resilience of supporting business activities.\n\nThe Committee has also considered assessments on the effects of the lockdown for the global economy and our investment portfolios, including the outlook for credit assets. Reviews of credit exposure have included sectors at risk from the global economic downturn and the longer-term impacts from changes in behaviours as a result of the pandemic. Trends in mortality for the group's UK and US protection businesses, and offsetting effects with the group's annuity portfolios have also been evaluated.\n\n## Focused business and risk reviews\n\nFocused 'deep dive' reviews of particular risk areas are undertaken at each Committee meeting. The purpose of these reviews is to enable Committee members to examine the risk profile of the core business lines and to consider the robustness of the frameworks in place to manage the key risk exposures. Committee members are invited to participate in setting the agenda for these deep dive reviews, considering both the current operating environment and emerging risk factors. Below are examples of some of the key reviews that took place during 2021, and the areas of focus by the Committee.\n\n- \u00b7 Operational risk management within LGIM: consideration of the operational risks implicit in LGIM's core institutional investment management business, the appetite for those risks and the control processes deployed by management.\n- \u00b7 Outsourcing and supply chain risks: review of the group's framework for oversight of third-party supply and service arrangements, and the group's approach to ensuring compliance with new regulatory standards to be implemented in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Financial crime risks: assessment of the evolving types of financial crime risk to which the group may be exposed, and the evolution of the group's risk management framework in response.",

In December, the Committee considered the risk profile of the group's strategic plan and its alignment with the group's overall risk appetite.\n\n## Risk-based capital model\n\nThe group's risk-based capital model (internal model) is used to determine the capital requirements for the group and forms the calculation engine for the Solvency II internal model. As well as reviewing and using the output of the model in its understanding of the group's risk profile, the Committee is the focal point for model governance with specific consideration of the:\n\n- \u00b7 key assumptions, methodologies and areas of expert judgement used within the model.\n- \u00b7 activities undertaken to validate the outputs of the model.\n- \u00b7 development of the model to ensure that it reflects the business lines and risk profile of the group.\n- \u00b7 processes to ensure that changes applied in the model are undertaken in a controlled manner, and in line with model development plans.\n\n## Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)\n\nThe ORSA is an ongoing assessment of the risks to which Legal & General is exposed and an evaluation of the sufficiency of capital resources to sustain the business strategy over the plan horizon. Over the course of the year, the Committee considered different aspects of the group's ORSA process. This included the review of proposed stress tests and scenarios to be used in the evaluation of capital adequacy, the profile of risks within the group's strategic plan and how they may change over the planning period, and the group's overall capacity to bear the risks identified.

The Committee is mindful of the UK Corporate Governance Code's six principles in relation to remuneration (clarity, simplicity, risk, predictability, proportionality and alignment to culture) when it considers remuneration. The Committee's view is that the remuneration framework at L&G is aligned with these areas and it will ensure that the new remuneration policy tabled in 2023 continues to be so aligned.\n\n## Link between pay and performance\n\nAgainst a challenging global backdrop, Legal & General's resilience and sound business model has enabled the company to return to growth with post tax profits exceeding \u00a32 billion for the first time, earnings per share (EPS) up 19% on 2019 and ROE of 20.5%.\n\n## Annual Variable Pay (AVP)\n\nFor executive directors, 70% of the bonus opportunity is determined by group financial performance, measured against pre-determined targets. The outcome for all of the group financial KPIs in 2020 was below threshold, due to Covid-19 disruption, and this resulted in no bonus payments for executive directors in 2020 based on group financial performance.\n\n2021 targets were set based off the group business plan and also recognised that there remained considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of Covid-19. As the year progressed, it became clearer that the impact on 2021 would be less than 2020 and accordingly the Committee debated whether to revise the targets mid-year,\n\nbut decided to review the outcome at the end of the full year. The outcome for 2021, was a 12% increase in net release from operations, an 11% increase in adjusted operating profit, and a 72% increase in earnings per share (with the 2020 EPS comparator excluding the one-off mortality reserve release of \u00a3153 million and the \u00a3271 million gain on the Mature Savings disposal in 2020 with no equivalent in 2021). This performance was then considered in the light of the levels to which targets might have been revised in mid-2021 and also the performance in 2020 and 2019. The Committee considered the outcome of maximum bonuses for the financial performance achieved was appropriate. The targets are shown in this report on page 104.\n\nStrategic objectives determine the other 30% of bonus opportunity, including customer, culture and environment, social and governance (ESG) metrics, as described in more detail on page 105 and in our 2021 climate report. The environmental performance measures for 2021 are aligned to the key commitments in our 2020 Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, and progress against these environmental commitments will continue to be a feature of the bonus plan.\n\nAs noted above and consistent with previous years, the Committee chose to exclude the beneficial impact of mortality assumption changes from the financial results when determining bonus awards. Even excluding these items, 2021 performance significantly exceeded that for 2020 and 2019, resulting in bonus outcomes of 94.5% and 92.2% of maximum for the executive directors. Targets and outcomes are summarised in the 'Quick read' section on page 99 and in further detail on page 104.",

        "page_content": "## Performance Share Plan (PSP)\n\nThe long-term incentive (PSP) awards granted in 2019 were subject to EPS growth and total shareholder return (TSR) out-performance over the three-year period ended 31 December 2021. EPS grew by 41.9% over the period (12.4% per annum), and TSR grew by 46.3%, out-performing the median of the FTSE-100 and also the bespoke comparator group. This resulted in 82.9% of the 2019 PSP award vesting with the remaining 17.1% forfeited.\n\nIn accordance with the remuneration policy, the Committee assessed the formulaic outcome, considering overall performance, risk management, progress against our environmental commitments, and other capital and solvency measures, and determined that the outcome was appropriate in all the circumstances, and no downward adjustment was required. Under the terms of the PSP plan for executive directors, the vested shares will be deferred for a further two years and released in 2024. The PSP performance targets and outcomes are summarised in the 'Quick read' section on page 99.\n\nPSP awards are normally granted each year, subject to performance. As reported last year, the awards granted in 2020 are subject to an additional provision enabling the Committee to reduce the number of shares at vesting and/or impose further conditions to neutralise any 'windfall gain' that might arise as a result of a rebound in the share price after grant. The 2020 awards were granted at an average share price of \u00a3229.26p and are scheduled to vest in 2023. The Committee will determine at that time whether any 'windfall' adjustment should be made.\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standard 17 (IFRS 17), relating to profitability recognition for insurance contracts, will replace the current reporting standard (IFRS 4) with effect from 1 January 2023. For the 2022 year, key financial results will be disclosed under IFRS 4 and subsequently under IFRS 17 in 2023. This will be the only accounting period where the results under both IFRS 4 and IFRS 17 will be presented.\n\nThe current PSP performance metrics use EPS growth over a three-year period to determine 50% of the PSP award. The change in accounting reporting standard during a performance period prevents EPS from being measured on the same basis from the start to the end of that period. The Committee has considered this issue, to determine the fairest way to measure EPS growth for performance periods spanning the change in accounting reporting standard. This issue will be considered in more detail during 2022, and the methodology adopted will be disclosed in the Remuneration Committee's report for 2023.\n\n## Base pay\n\nAs reported in our annual report last year, base pay increases for executive directors were paused in 2021 due to the economic uncertainty caused by Covid-19. With that uncertainty now diminishing, the Committee considered the broader market and overall business performance, and reviewed pay and conditions across the group to determine any base pay increase for executive directors in 2022. The average base pay increase for UK employees was 2.2% in 2021 and will be 5.2% in 2022, and within the context of the total increase received by other employees in 2021 and 2022, the Committee has determined to increase base pay for Nigel Wilson (Group Chief Executive) by 5.0% and Jeff Davies (Group Chief Financial Officer) by 7.1% with effect from 1 March 2022.\n\nAs previously indicated, pension contributions for executive directors will reduce to 10% of base pay in December 2022, to align with that available to the majority of the UK workforce.\n\n## Consideration of the wider workforce\n\nThe Committee has regard for the remuneration of all employees across the group, and perform this responsibility in the knowledge that Legal & General are an accredited Living Wage employer certified by the Living Wage Foundation. The policies and practices applying to executive directors are the same as for the wider workforce in most instances, although quantum and participation by location and grade may vary. During both 2020 and 2021, it remained important to protect employees against the effects of Covid-19, with work-from-home and protected office facilities made available. All UK employees have access to private medical insurance and a 24/7/365 employee assistance helpline.\n\nWellbeing support is also available to employees and their family members, including childcare and eldercare support, healthcare apps, and preferential borrow/save/advance finance facilities through our partner organisation, Salary Finance. UK employees also have the opportunity to invest their own money and become shareholders in Legal & General through the Employee Share Purchase and ShareSave plans. More than two-thirds of employees now participate in these plans.\n\nAs the group's designated workforce director, I have had the opportunity to meet with a broad range of employees during the year, in-person and remotely, to ensure their views are appropriately represented in the Boardroom, including when considering Remuneration Committee matters. My report on page 74 provides details of some of those activities, including our continuing work on employee engagement, diversity and inclusion, and achieving a further narrowing of the gender pay gap.\n\n## 2022 and beyond\n\nAt the AGM in 2023, we shall submit a new directors' remuneration policy for approval by shareholders, being the maximum three years since our current remuneration policy was approved in 2020. During 2022, the Committee will closely examine our remuneration principles and policies to ensure that they remain appropriate to support future business strategy and reflect evolving best practice. I look forward to engaging with shareholders and representative bodies to seek input to this process and reporting back to you with our proposals next year.\n\nAgain this year, to improve the transparency and clarity of our remuneration report, we have included a 'Quick read' section summarising our current remuneration policy and its implementation in 2021, showing graphically the outcomes against the various performance targets and the remuneration received by executive directors. Full details continue to be disclosed on pages 102 to 117 in accordance with the remuneration reporting regulations.\n\nI hope that you will find this report a clear account of the Committee's considerations and decisions, and the remuneration outcomes for the year.\n\nLesley Knox Chairman of the Remuneration Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe average annual base pay increase for UK employees was around 5.2% in 2022, in recognition of the labour market and rising costs for many employees. Most employees are eligible to be considered for a bonus payment based on group, divisional, individual and/or other specific performance metrics, with bonuses for 2021 paid shortly after the year end, at the same time as bonuses are paid to executive directors.",

2022 award, the following performance measures will be used:\n\n- \u00b7 TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 (25% of award)\n- \u00b7 TSR performance relative to a bespoke comparator group of companies (25% of award).\n- \u00b7 EPS growth (50% of award).\n\nVesting of awards will be subject to an assessment of performance against Solvency II objectives and progress against long-term ESG objectives.\n\nHaving considered the business plan over the next three years and market expectations of performance, and given the level of stretch within the TSR performance conditions, the Committee considered it appropriate for vesting to be based on performance as set out in the table below:\n\n|                 | Below Threshold   | Threshold   | Maximum         |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Vesting         | 0%                | 15%         | 100%            |\n| TSR performance | Below median      | Median      | 80th percentile |\n| EPS growth      | <5% p.a.          | 5% p.a.     | 12% p.a.        |\n\nPerformance below threshold results in nil vesting, and performance between threshold and maximum vests on a straight line basis between 15% and 100% of maximum.",

The 2009 PSP vested in full in 2012. The PSP figure that vested for Tim Breedon is shown in his figure as it vested during the time he was Group Chief Executive.\n\nDue to the timing of the vesting of PSP awards, initially PSP figures within the single figure of remuneration are calculated based on the average share price for the three months ended 31 December in the respective year. As noted under the single figure of remuneration table on page 102, the figures are restated in the following year's report to reflect the actual share price on the vesting date. The figures in the table above have been restated to reflect the actual share price on vesting for the years 2015 - 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Vesting will be based on performance as set out in the table below:\n\n|                 | Below threshold   | Threshold   | Maximum         |\n|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Vesting         | 0%                | 15%         | 100%            |\n| TSR performance | Below median      | Median      | 80th percentile |\n| EPS growth      | <5% p.a.          | 5% p.a.     | 12% p.a.        |\n\nPerformance below threshold results in a nil vesting, and performance between threshold and maximum vests on a straight line basis between 15% and 100% of maximum.\n\nAt the end of the three-year performance period commencing 1 January 2021, the Committee will assess whether the formulaic vesting outcome is justified by looking at a number of factors including: whether the result is reflective of overall performance and has been achieved within the Company's risk appetite, the Solvency II coverage ratio, the quality of earnings, nature of any changes in leverage or key assumptions and progress against long-term ESG objectives. If such considerations mean that the formulaic outcome of the vesting is not considered to be justified, the Committee can amend the vesting downwards (but not increase the level of vesting). The Remuneration Committee may also consider reducing the number of shares vesting and/ or impose further conditions on the award to neutralise any 'windfall gain' that may have arisen.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Payments for loss of office and to past directors\n\nThere were no payments to directors for loss of office and no payments to past directors during 2021.\n\n## Statement of directors' shareholding and share interests\n\nTotal shareholding of executive directors:\n\n|                  |         |                                |                                      | Total vested and  unvested shares  (excludes any   |                                       | Shares sold or acquired during the period  1 January 2022 and 8 March 2022   | Shares sold or acquired during the period  1 January 2022 and 8 March 2022   |\n|------------------|---------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  | Type    | Owned outright/  vested shares | Subject to deferral/  holding period | shares with  performance  conditions)              | Subject to   performance   conditions | Owned outright/  vested shares                                               | Subject to deferral/ holding period                                          |\n| Sir Nigel Wilson | Shares  | 3,637,332                      | 530,996                              | 4,168,328                                          | -                                     | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n|                  | ESP     | 19,324                         | 5,295                                | 24,619                                             | -                                     | 132                                                                          | 73                                                                           |\n|                  | Options | -                              | 475,161                              | 475,161                                            | 2,728,558                             | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n| Jeff Davies      | Shares  | 244,739                        | 311,031                              | 555,770                                            | -                                     | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n| Jeff Davies      | ESP     | 3,476                          | 1,282                                | 4,758                                              | -                                     | 132                                                                          | 73                                                                           |\n|                  | Options | -                              | 269,933                              | 269,933                                            | 1,630,824                             | -                                                                            | -                                                                            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Closing share price as at 31 December 2021: \u00a32.975\n\n## Notes\n\nShares used for the above calculation exclude those with performance conditions, any unexercised options, those shares subject to a period of deferral and any shares held in a private trust where the executive director is not a trustee. They include vested shares where the executive director has beneficial ownership, shares independently acquired in the market and those held by a spouse or civil partner or dependant child under the age of 18 years.\n\nAlthough the shareholding requirement is not contractually binding, executive directors are expected to retain any after tax vested share awards until their shareholding requirements are met, and maintain that shareholding requirement (or their actual shareholding at the date of leaving, if lower) for at least two years after leaving employment. The Committee retains the discretion to withhold future grants under the PSP if executives are not making sufficient progress towards their shareholding requirement. Once shareholding requirements have been met, executive directors may sell shares in excess of the shareholding requirement if they wish. The Committee has discretion to allow executive directors to sell shares prior to the shareholding requirement being met in extenuating situations, for example, a change to personal circumstances or ill health, etc.\n\n## Share options exercised during 2021\n\nPSP awards may be granted in the form of nil-cost options with an exercise date no earlier than the normal vesting date. Executive Directors may also participate in the Company's ShareSave scheme.

Deferred awards are normally held in shares for three years and are subject to malus and clawback.                                                                                                                                     |\n|                                             | The company reserves the right to adjust deferral levels for Code staff as deemed necessary to comply with regulatory  requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Performance  share plan (PSP)               | Participation in the PSP is offered to a small number of senior management each year in recognition of the strategic and  influential role that they hold in terms of driving company performance, as well as their individual contribution. Participation  in the plan for one year does not guarantee participation in future years.                            |\n|                                             | PSP awards were made to around 92 employees during 2021.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|                                             | Where appropriate, grants under the PSP may also be made for new employees who join the company during the year in key roles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Other share plans  and long-term incentives | The Company operates a Share Bonus Plan (SBP) which provides the vehicle for deferral of annual bonuses in the majority  of cases and also allows for a limited number of awards of shares to high potential individuals and those with critical skills.                                                                                                          |\n| Employee  share plans                       | All employees are given the opportunity to participate in a ShareSave plan and an Employee Share Purchase plan. These are  both HMRC-approved plans which offer all employees the opportunity to share in the success of the business.                                                                                                                            |",

Part of the pay review process is an annual equal pay review that reviews pay and bonus decisions by gender, ethnicity, age and full-time versus part-time working. In addition, it considers the application of the pay policy more widely, in particular looking at decisions made in the annual pay review across grades, functions and divisions.\n\n## Gender pay reporting\n\nThe group has published its gender pay report for 2021. Further details can also be found on page 49 of the annual report.\n\n## Pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer\n\nSince 2016 we have voluntarily disclosed details of the pay ratio in relation to the Group Chief Executive Officer and the wider UK employee population. From 2018 we made some amendments to how we report the information in order to align with the reporting requirements set out by BEIS, which came into effect for financial years starting 1 January 2019.\n\nThe tables below provide the ratio between the base pay and single figure total remuneration of the Group Chief Executive Officer and the base pay and total remuneration of UK employees at the upper quartile (75th percentile), median (50th percentile) and lower quartile (25th percentile).\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n|      |        | Pay ratio       | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio       | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   |\n|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Year | Method | 75th percentile | Median      | 25th percentile | 75th percentile      | Median               | 25th percentile      |\n| 2021 | B      | 50              | 86          | 129             | 90,039               | 52,466               | 34,974               |\n| 2020 | A      | 26              | 48          | 81              | 78,989               | 43,726               | 25,839               |\n| 2019 | A      | 61              | 105         | 167             | 70,892               | 40,982               | 25,814               |\n| 2018 | A      | 49              | 83          | 132             | 69,923               | 40,814               | 25,730               |\n| 2017 | A      | 52              | 89          | 137             | 66,572               | 38,802               | 25,023               |\n\n## Base pay\n\n|      |        | Pay ratio       | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio       | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   | All UK employees \u00a3   |\n|------|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Year | Method | 75th percentile | Median      | 25th percentile | 75th percentile      | Median               | 25th percentile      |\n| 2021 | B      | 14              | 22          | 34              | 68,832               | 43,579               | 28,500               |\n| 2020 | A      | 15              | 26          | 42              | 65,101               | 37,677               | 23,232               |\n| 2019 | A      | 16              | 27          | 42              | 60,000               | 35,000               | 22,550               |\n| 2018 | A      | 16              | 27          | 41              | 57,853               | 34,475               | 22,781               |\n| 2017 | A      | 16              | 27          | 42              | 58,020               | 33,649               | 22,148               |\n\n## Pay ratio commentary\n\nBetween 2020 and 2021 the ratio of total remuneration for the Group CEO compared to UK employees has increased. The increase is the result of the higher bonus award and vesting level of the 2019 PSP compared with the PSP awards in the previous year.\n\n## Methodology\n\nThe Companies (Miscellaneous Reporting) Regulations 2018 permit different options for calculating the pay ratio. We have chosen option B as our method for calculating the pay ratio for 2021, consistent with the methodology for gender pay reporting. The total remuneration figures for the UK employees are based on salaries at 1 December 2021. Bonus amounts for 2021 are not able to be determined for some eligible employees until after publication of this report, and therefore it is not possible to determine the exact 2021 total remuneration for all UK employees as is required for option A within this timescale. For completeness and transparency, we have included the pay ratios based on the option A method for previous years and we will also retrospectively disclose the pay ratio for 2021 based on the option A method in the 2022 report. We do not believe that this will result in pay ratio figures that are materially different to the 2021 figures disclosed above.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender pay gap report\n\nOur 2021 gender pay gap report is available on our group website.

This group was chosen because it includes a wider cross section of the group's employees. The increase in benefits for the employee comparator group relates to the impact of base pay increases.\n\n## Relative importance of spend on pay\n\nThe chart opposite shows the relative importance of expenditure on pay compared to share dividends, adjusted operating profit and tax for the year. Adjusted operating profit has been shown because it is a key performance indicator of the business. No share buybacks were made in 2020 or 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where appropriate, the Group Chief Executive, the Group HR Director, Group Reward Director, Head of Executive Compensation, Director of Group Finance and Group Chief Risk Officer also attend meetings. No person is present during any discussion relating to that person's own remuneration.\n\nAt the invitation of the Remuneration Committee, a representative from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) also attends Committee meetings. During 2021, PwC principally advised the Committee on external developments affecting remuneration as well as specific matters raised by the Remuneration Committee. PwC were appointed by the Committee. The Committee reflects on the quality of advice provided and whether it properly addresses the issues under consideration as part of its normal deliberations. The Committee is satisfied that the advice received from the PwC engagement team is objective and independent. PwC are signatories to the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. The total fees paid to PwC in relation to Remuneration Committee work during 2021 were \u00a3131,650 (excluding VAT). While fee estimates are required for bespoke pieces of work, fees are generally charged based on time with hourly rates in line with the level of expertise and seniority of the adviser concerned. During the year, PwC also provided the Company with HR consulting services including advice to management on regulatory aspects of reward, as well as other professional services including tax, consulting, accounting regulatory compliance, and other advice to the group.",

        "page_content": "## Annual report on remuneration\n\n## continued\n\n## Terms of reference\n\nThe Committee's terms of reference are available on the Company's website. The remit of the Committee includes the remuneration strategy and policy framework for the group as well as for the executive directors.\n\nThe Committee particularly focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7 Determining the individual remuneration for executive directors and for other designated individuals or for those who are discharging a head of control function role.\n- \u00b7 Undertaking direct oversight on the remuneration of other high earners in the group.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of the remuneration of Code staff and employees in the control and oversight functions.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of remuneration policies and structures for all employees.\n\n## Considering risk\n\nThe Reward Steering Committee (RSC) and the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function make a key contribution to the process of designing reward structures and evaluating whether achievement of objectives and any payment from plans have taken into account the overall risk profile of the group.\n\n## Reward Steering Committee (RSC)\n\nReporting to the Remuneration Committee, the RSC helps set the framework within which incentive arrangements are normally reviewed and implemented, with a view to supporting business strategy, whilst acting within the group's risk appetite. The members of the RSC include the Group HR Director, Group Chief Risk Officer, Group Conduct Risk Director, Regulatory Risk Director, LGIM Chief Compliance Officer, the Director of Group Finance, the Group Reward Director and the Head of Executive Compensation.\n\nWhere a business unit tables a proposal for consideration, the relevant business manager is required to attend the RSC meeting to explain the background and to answer any questions from the RSC.\n\n## Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function\n\nThe Remuneration Committee also works closely with the Group Regulatory Risk and Compliance Function with respect to remuneration proposals.\n\nIn particular, the function reports to the Committee on an annual basis on whether any risks have been taken outside of pre-agreed parameters, whether there have been regulatory breaches, or they are aware of any other considerations that may lead the Committee to consider whether it should impact payments to employees (including in particular the executive directors and Code staff).\n\nThe Group Chief Risk Officer also specifically looks at the overall risk profile of the group and whether executive directors have achieved objectives within the group's accepted risk appetite, and the CRO also reviews the executive directors' objectives for the forthcoming year to ensure they are in line with the risk parameters.\n\nSince the implementation of a new Solvency II remuneration policy in 2016, the scope of the Group Chief Risk Officer's report has been extended to consider whether there are any risk considerations which may warrant adjustments to the overall level of corporate annual variable pay awards.\n\n## Engagement with key stakeholders\n\nThe Committee seeks to maintain an active and productive dialogue with investors on developments in the remuneration aspects of corporate governance and any changes to the group's executive pay arrangements. During 2019, we reviewed our approach to remuneration in the context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice, and sought feedback from shareholders and representative bodies. The responses that we received helped shape our thinking with respect to the new remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM in May 2020.\n\nDuring 2022 the Committee will closely examine our remuneration principles and policies to ensure they remain appropriate in the context of future business strategy, updated investor guidelines and evolving best practice and will consult with the group's largest shareholders on any proposed changes, prior to presenting the remuneration policy for shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM.\n\nWe engaged regularly with our workforce throughout 2021, including via our workforce representative bodies Unite (the trade union) and our Management Consultative Forum, on a number of topics including pay and propose to continue this dialogue in 2022, including in relation to our new remuneration policy.",

We summarise below the key audit matters (unchanged from 2020), in decreasing order of audit significance, in arriving at our audit opinion above, together with our key audit procedures to address those matters and, as required for public interest entities, our results from those procedures. These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, in the context of, and solely for the purpose of, our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and consequently are incidental to that opinion, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities\n\nUK annuity policyholder liabilities included within non-participating insurance contract liabilities of \u00a389,755 million; (2020: \u00a388,958 million)\n\nRefer to page 89 (Audit Committee Report), page 140 (accounting policy) and page 179 (financial disclosures).\n\n## The risk\n\n## Our response\n\n## Subjective valuation:\n\nThe valuation of the UK annuity liabilities is an inherently subjective area, requiring management judgement in the setting of key assumptions. The longevity, expense and credit risk assumptions involve the greatest level of subjectivity. A small change in these assumptions can have a significant impact on the liabilities. We consider the risk remains increased in the current year due to the higher degree of estimation uncertainty resulting from changes in demographic and economic conditions caused by the Coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19).\n\n## Longevity assumptions\n\nLongevity assumptions have two main components which include mortality base assumptions and the rate of mortality improvements. Changing trends in longevity and emerging medical trends means that there is a high level of uncertainty in the assumptions. This uncertainty remains heightened in the current year due to the potential longer-term impacts of Covid-19 on trends in longevity. There is also a high degree of reliance on Continuous Mortality Investigations ('CMI') models, and convergence across the industry on its parameterisation. Hence there is a risk that other mortality and health data sources are not appropriately considered under the assumption setting methodology.\n\n## Credit assumptions\n\nThe valuation discount rate (Valuation Interest Rate, 'VIR') is derived from the yield on the assets backing the annuity liabilities. In setting the VIR, an explicit allowance for credit risk is deducted from the yield on debt and other fixed income securities.\n\nThe assumptions surrounding this deduction require significant judgement and there is a risk that changes in investment yields, market spreads, current actual default experience and anticipated trends are not appropriately reflected.\n\n## Expense assumptions\n\nManagement judgement is required in setting the maintenance expense assumption which is based on the directors' long-term view of the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies.\n\n## Data capture:\n\nThere is a risk that incomplete and inaccurate data is used in the calculation of liabilities resulting from inaccurate transfer or conversion of aggregate data from the policy administration systems into model point files used to value the liabilities in the actuarial models. In addition there is a risk that incomplete or inaccurate asset data is used to calculate the default adjustment applied to the VIR.\n\n## Calculation error:\n\nThe group uses actuarial models to calculate policyholder liabilities. There is a risk that unauthorised or erroneous changes to the models may occur.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty:\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of insurance contract liabilities has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements disclose the sensitivities (Note 19) estimated by the group.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- -Control design and operation: testing of reconciliation controls to assess completeness of data flows from policy administration systems to the actuarial valuation models;\n- -Test of detail: testing the completeness of data used in the valuation of annuity liabilities by reconciling the data from the policy administration system to the data used in the actuarial models;\n- -Test of detail: By utilising data and analytics procedures, testing the accuracy of the historical data input into the actuarial valuation model by comparing the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2021 to the data used for reporting as at 31 December 2020 in relation to policies that were still in force at that time;\n- -Test of detail: Tracing a sample of new business policyholder data inputs into the actuarial valuation model to the underlying policy documents;\n- -Test of detail: Reconciling the completeness and accuracy of the assets used in the calculation of the VIR to the assets used to back the insurance liabilities; and\n- -Test of detail: For a sample of assets, validating the accuracy of the asset data used to project the cash flows used in the calculation of the VIR and, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, re-projecting these cash flows.\n\nWe used our own actuarial specialists to assist us in performing our procedures in this area, including:\n\n- -Methodology choice: assessing the appropriateness of the methodology for selecting assumptions by applying our understanding of developments in the business and expectations derived from market experience, including consideration of the effects of Covid-19 on policyholder mortality and credit risk. For longevity assumptions, this includes consideration of the cause of death modelling performed by the group and other non-CMI sources alongside the CMI modelling used across the industry.\n- -Benchmarking assumptions : assessing mortality improvement assumptions against industry data on expected future mortality rate improvements and industry historic mortality improvement rates and assessing the appropriateness of the credit risk assumptions by comparing to industry practice and our expectations derived from market experience.\n- -Historical comparisons: evaluating the mortality base assumptions used in the valuation of the annuity liabilities by comparing to the group's historic mortality experience; assessing the credit default assumptions by comparing to the historical performance of the asset portfolio; and assessing whether the expense assumptions reflect the expected future costs of administering the underlying policies by analysing the allocations of the forecast 2022 costs to maintenance expenses, with reference to historical allocations and planned actions.\n- -Test of detail: testing that changes to the actuarial model from the prior year have been appropriately approved within the group; and evaluating the appropriateness of the financial impact of the changes made to the model during the year.\n- -Assessing transparency: considering whether the disclosures in relation to the assumptions used in the calculation of valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities are compliant with the relevant accounting requirements and appropriately represent the sensitivities of these assumptions to alternative scenarios and inputs.\n\n## Our results\n\n- - We found the resulting estimate of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities within non-participating insurance contract liabilities to be acceptable (2020 result: acceptable).",

Their carrying amount is not at a high risk of significant misstatement or subject to significant judgement. However, due to their materiality in the context of the parent company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.\n\nWe performed the tests below rather than seeking to rely on any of the group's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- -Independent re-performance: comparing the carrying amount of the parent company's investments, with the subsidiaries' financial information to identify whether their net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, were in excess of their carrying amount and assessing whether those subsidiaries have historically been profit-making.\n\n## Our results\n\n- - We found the parent company's conclusion that there is no impairment of its investment in subsidiaries to be acceptable (2020 result: acceptable).\n\n## Valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments\n\nLifetime mortgages of \u00a36,857m (2020: \u00a36,036m), private credit portfolios of \u00a316,304m (2020: \u00a314,357m), investment property of \u00a310,150m (2020: \u00a38,475m) and income strips of \u00a31,626m (2020: \u00a31,449m).\n\nRefer to page 89 (Audit Committee Report), page 140 (accounting policy) and page 161 (financial disclosures).\n\n## The risk\n\n## Our response\n\n## Subjective valuation:\n\n6.7% (2020: 6.0%) of the investment portfolio is classified as Level 3 assets, of which we consider the valuation of lifetime mortgages, private credit, investment property and income strips involve the greatest level of subjectivity. The subjectivity due to Covid-19 on asset valuations remains heightened. However, we consider the subjectivity to have decreased from the prior year, driven by actual experience to date and significant developments made in the UK and US with its response to Covid-19.\n\nFor these positions a reliable third-party price from a recent market transaction is not readily available and therefore the application of expert judgement from the group in the valuations adopted is required.\n\nThe key assumptions underlying the valuations are:\n\n- - Lifetime mortgages: property price at valuation date, property price inflation, property index volatility, voluntary early redemption rate and the illiquidity premium added to the risk-free rate;\n- - Private credit: yields of selected comparator securities and credit ratings derived from credit rating models; and\n- - Investment property and income strips: estimated rental value and yield of the property.\n\n## Data capture:\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nThere is a risk that incomplete data is used in the calculation of lifetime mortgages because data does not transfer appropriately from the policyholder system to the actuarial models.\n\n## Calculation error:\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nThe group uses a complex actuarial model to calculate the valuation of lifetime mortgages. There is a risk that unauthorised or erroneous changes to the model may occur.\n\n## Estimation uncertainty\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (Note 10) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the group.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\n- -Control design and operation: testing of the design, and implementation of key controls over the valuation process for the hard to value (Level 3) investments, including the testing of operating effectiveness of key controls relating to the valuation of private credit assets and lifetime mortgages.\n\n## -Our valuation expertise:\n\n- - using our own valuation specialists to assess the suitability of the valuation and credit rating methodologies; to independently revalue a sample of the private credit investments and assess the suitability of comparator securities utilised in the valuation on a sample basis;\n- - using our own valuation specialists to assess the suitability of the valuation methodologies used by the group; and\n- - using our own actuarial specialists to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the valuation of lifetime mortgages with reference to market data and industry benchmarks.\n- -Assessing valuers' credentials: assessing the objectivity, professional qualifications and competence of external valuers of private credit and investment property investments used by the group and reconciling the valuations provided by them to the valuations recorded in the financial statements.\n- -Methodology choice: assessing the appropriateness of the pricing methodologies for private credit and investment property investments with reference to relevant accounting standards and the group's own valuation guidelines as well as industry practice.\n- -Benchmarking assumptions: evaluating and challenging the key assumptions upon which the valuations of lifetime mortgages and investment property investments were based, including consideration of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, by making a comparison to our own understanding of the market, comparable evidence relied on by the valuers used by the group and to industry benchmarks.\n- -Test of detail:\n- - Testing that changes to the actuarial model for lifetime mortgages from the prior year have been appropriately approved within the group; and evaluating the appropriateness of the financial impact of the changes made to the model during the year; and\n- - Testing the completeness of data used in the valuation of lifetime mortgages by reconciling the data from the policy administration system to the data used in the actuarial valuation models.\n- -Assessing transparency: assessing whether the disclosures in relation to the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments are compliant with the relevant financial reporting requirements and appropriately present the sensitivities of the valuations to alternative assumptions.\n\n## Our results\n\n- - We found the resulting estimate of the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments to be acceptable (2020 result: acceptable).",

This is lower than the materiality we would otherwise have determined by reference to total assets to reflect that the parent company is a component of the group, and represents 0.23% of the parent company's total assets (2020: 0.23%).\n\nIn line with our audit methodology, our procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\nPerformance materiality for the group and parent company was set at 65% (2020: 65%) of materiality for the financial statements as a whole, which equates to \u00a369.6 million (2020: \u00a370.0 million) and \u00a318.2 million (2020: \u00a318.9 million) respectively.\n\nWe applied this percentage in our determination of performance materiality based on the level of identified immaterial unadjusted differences and control deficiencies noted during prior periods.\n\nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding \u00a34.8 million (2020: \u00a35.4 million), in addition to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nIn addition, we applied materiality of \u00a34.4 billion (2020: \u00a34.2 billion) to the classification of unit linked assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and related notes, determined with reference to a benchmark of total unit linked financial investments and investment property, of which it represents 1.0% (2020: 1.0%). This materiality was applied solely for our work on matters for which a misstatement is likely only to lead to a reclassification between line items within assets and liabilities, in accordance with FRC Practice Note 20 The Audit of Insurers in the United Kingdom.\n\nWe agreed to report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected classification misstatements in unit linked assets and liabilities exceeding \u00a3197 million (2020: \u00a3208 million).\n\nOf the group's audit components, we subjected 8 (2020: 7), which are comprised of 18 reporting packs (2020: 13), to full scope audits for group purposes and 8 (2020: 4), which are comprised of 11 reporting packs (2020: 7), to specified risk-focused audit procedures over financial investments, investment property, cash and cash equivalents, defined benefit obligations, and other expenses. The components for which we performed specified risk-focused procedures were not individually financially significant enough to require an audit for group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed.\n\n## PBTCO\n\n(normalised) \u00a32,262m (2020: \u00a32,184m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group Materiality\n\n\u00a3107.0m (2020: \u00a3108.0m)\n\n## \u00a3107.0m (2020: \u00a3108.0m)\n\nWhole financial statements materiality\n\n## \u00a369.6m (2020: \u00a370.0m)\n\nWhole financial statements performance materiality\n\n## \u00a370.0m (2019: \u00a370.0m)\n\nRange of materiality at 16 components (\u00a36.0m-\u00a370.0m) (2020: \u00a35.4m-\u00a370.0m)\n\n## \u00a34.8m (2020: \u00a35.4m)\n\nMisstatements reported to the Audit Committee\n\nGroup profit before tax\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFull scope for group audit purposes 2021\n\nSpecified risk-focused audit procedures 2021\n\nFull scope for group audit purposes 2020\n\nSpecified risk-focused audit procedures 2020 Residual components\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages above.\n\nFor the residual components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within these.

        "page_content": "The group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The group team approved the component materialities, which ranged from \u00a36.0 million to \u00a370.0 million (2020: \u00a35.4 million to \u00a370.0 million), having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the group across the components.\n\nWhilst the ability to perform site visits was limited in 2021 due to the restrictions imposed as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic, the group team held video and telephone conference meetings with 10 (2020: 11) component locations in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and the United States (2020: United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and the United States), to assess the audit risk and strategy. At these meetings, the findings reported to the group team were discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the group team was then performed by the component auditor.\n\nThe work on 10 of the 16 components (2020: 9 of the 11 components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, was performed by the group team.\n\nWe were able to rely upon the group's internal control over financial reporting in several areas of our audit, where our controls testing supported this approach, which enabled us to reduce the scope of our substantive audit work; in the other areas the scope of the audit work performed was fully substantive.\n\n## 4 The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the group's business and its financial statements.\n\nClimate change, and the associated initiatives and commitments, impact the group in a variety of ways including the potential financial risks which could arise from the associated physical and transitional risks and the greater narrative and disclosure of the impact of climate change risk that is incorporated into the annual report. The group's exposure to climate change is primarily through climate related transition risks which potentially impact the carrying amount of investments and potential reputational risk associated with the group's delivery of its climate related commitments. The group has set out its commitments under the Paris objective to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in its Strategic Report on page 33.\n\nAs a part of our audit we have made enquiries of management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the group's financial statements, including how climate is considered as part of the investment making and monitoring processes, and the group's preparedness for this. We have performed a risk assessment of how the impact of climate change may affect the financial statements and our audit. This included evaluating the impact of management's stress test scenarios and holding discussions with our own climate change professionals to challenge our risk assessment.\n\nOn the basis of the risk assessment procedures performed above, and taking into account the nature of the group's assets and basis of the related valuations, we concluded that, while climate change may pose a risk to the determination of asset values, the risk was not significant in the current year. As a result, there was no significant impact from climate change on our key audit matters.\n\nWe have also read the disclosures of climate related information in the Strategic Report as set out on pages 43 to 45 and considered consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of these disclosures.",

They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\nWe used our knowledge of the group and parent company, its industry, and the general economic environment in which it operates to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the group and parent company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that were considered most likely to adversely affect the group's and parent company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- \u00b7 Adverse impacts arising from fluctuations or negative trends in the economic environment including, but not limited to, wider credit spreads and defaults which affect regulatory capital solvency coverage ratios, liquidity ratios, the valuations of the group's investments and valuation of policyholder liabilities; and\n- \u00b7 Severely adverse policyholder lapse or claims experience.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as the failure of counterparties who have transactions with the group (such as banks and reinsurers), which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe, but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources by the group's financial forecasts.\n\nWe considered whether the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) to the financial statements gives a full and accurate description of the directors' assessment of going concern, including the identified risks and related sensitivities.\n\n## Our conclusions based on this work:\n\n- \u00b7 we consider that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate;\n- \u00b7 we have not identified, and concur with the directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's or parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- \u00b7 we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in Note 1 (ii) to the financial statements on the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the group and parent company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in Note 1 (ii) to be acceptable; and\n- \u00b7 the related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 237 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nHowever, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the group or the parent company will continue in operation.\n\n## 6 Fraud and breaches of laws and regulations - ability to detect\n\nIdentifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 enquiring of directors, the Audit Committee, internal audit, Group Financial Crime and inspection of policy documentation as to the group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- \u00b7 reading Board, Audit Committee and Risk Committee meeting minutes;\n- \u00b7 considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management; and\n- \u00b7 consulting with professionals with forensic knowledge to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the group.\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the group audit team to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nAs required by auditing standards and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, we perform procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries and the risk of bias in accounting estimates and judgements such as the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities and the valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments.",

        "page_content": "On this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because there is limited management judgement involved in the recognition of and measurement of the transaction price for all material revenue streams.\n\nWe also identified fraud risks related to the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments in response to possible pressures to meet profit targets.\n\nFurther detail in respect of the valuation of UK annuity policyholder liabilities and valuation of hard to value (Level 3) investments is set out in the two key audit matters disclosures in section 2 of this report.\n\nWe also performed procedures including:\n\n- \u00b7 identifying journal entries to test for full-scope components, based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included, but were not limited to, journals impacting cash balances that were identified as unusual or unexpected in our risk assessment procedures;\n- \u00b7 evaluating the business purpose of significant unusual transactions; and\n- \u00b7 assessing significant accounting estimates for bias.\n\n## Identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the group's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the group audit team to full scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at group.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\nFirstly, the group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\nSecondly, the group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the group's license to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: Listing Rules, Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules, regulatory capital and liquidity requirements and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the financial and regulated nature of the group's activities and certain regulated subsidiaries. Auditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore, if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it.\n\nIn addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.",

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or, except as explicitly stated below, any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether, based on our financial statements audit work, the information therein is materially misstated or inconsistent with the financial statements or our audit knowledge. Based solely on that work we have not identified material misstatements in the other information.\n\n## Strategic report and directors' report\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information:\n\n- \u00b7 we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report and the directors' report;\n- \u00b7 in our opinion the information given in those reports for the financial year is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 in our opinion those reports have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Directors' Remuneration Report\n\nIn our opinion the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' confirmation within the statement on page 56 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- \u00b7 the Principal Risks and uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified, and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- \u00b7 the directors' explanation in the Group Board viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Group Board viability statement, set out on page 55 under the Listing Rules. Based on the above procedures, we have concluded that the above disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the group's and parent company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Corporate governance disclosures\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the directors' corporate governance disclosures and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have concluded that each of the following is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the directors' statement that they consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position and performance, business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report describing the work of the Audit Committee, including the significant issues that the Audit Committee considered in relation to the financial statements, and how these issues were addressed; and\n- \u00b7 the section of the annual report that describes the review of the effectiveness of the group's risk management and internal control systems.\n\nWe are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified by the Listing Rules for our review, and to report to you if a corporate governance statement has not been prepared by the company. We have nothing to report in these respects.\n\nBased solely on our work on the other information described above with respect to the Corporate Governance Statement disclosures about internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial reporting processes and about share capital structures:\n\n- \u00b7 we have not identified material misstatements therein; and\n- \u00b7 the information therein is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 in our opinion, the Corporate Governance Statement has been prepared in accordance with relevant rules of the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but does not guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.\n\n## 10 The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRees Aronson (Senior Statutory Auditor) for and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor Chartered Accountants 15 Canada Square, London, E14 5GL\n\n8 March 2022",

        "page_content": "## Primary statements and performance continued\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation\n\nLegal & General Group Plc, a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales, operates across four broad business areas of retirement, investment management, capital investment and insurance through its subsidiaries and associates in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States and other countries throughout the world.\n\n## (i) Significant accounting policies\n\nThe group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards, comprising International Accounting Standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and related interpretations issued by the IFRS Interpretations Committee. Endorsement is granted by the UK Endorsement Board (UKEB). The group financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investment property, available-for-sale financial assets, and certain financial assets and financial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe group has selected accounting policies which state fairly its financial position, financial performance and cash flows for a reporting period. The accounting policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated. Accounting policies that relate specifically to a balance or transaction are presented above the relevant numerical disclosure.\n\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are disclosed gross in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a legally enforceable right of offset exists and there is an intention to settle recognised amounts on a net basis. Income and expenses are not offset in the Consolidated Income Statement unless required or permitted by any accounting standard or International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretation, as detailed in the applicable accounting policies of the group.\n\n## (ii) Going concern\n\nThe group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position in the current economic environment are set out in this Annual Report & Accounts. The financial position of the group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in these consolidated financial statements. Principal risks and uncertainties are detailed on pages 56 to 59.\n\nThe directors have made an assessment of the group's going concern, considering both the current performance and the outlook for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, which takes account of the current and future impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, using the information available up to the date of issue of this Annual Report & Accounts.\n\nThe group manages and monitors its capital and liquidity, and various stresses are applied to those positions to understand potential impacts from market downturns. Our key sensitivities and the impacts on our capital position from a range of stresses is disclosed in section 5.01 of the Full year results 2021 Press Release 1 . These stresses, including additional considerations relating to Covid-19, do not give rise to any material uncertainties over the ability of the group to continue as a going concern. Based upon the available information, the directors consider that the group has the plans and resources to manage its business risks successfully and that it remains financially strong and well diversified.\n\nHaving reassessed the principal risks and uncertainties (both financial and operational) in light of the current economic environment, as detailed on pages 56 to 59, the directors are confident that the group and Company will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements and therefore have considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.\n\n## (iii) New standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards that have been adopted by the group\n\nThe group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time in its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2021.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 - Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n\nThese amendments, issued in August 2020, address issues that might affect financial reporting after the reform of an interest rate benchmark, including its replacement with alternative benchmark rates. In particular, they offer practical expedients, under certain conditions, when a financial contract is modified due to a change resulting directly from IBOR reform. They also allow a series of exemptions from the current rules around hedge accounting. The amendments will be considered as new interest rate benchmarks are introduced.\n\nNew disclosure requirements have also been introduced as part of Phase 2, and in line with these the group has provided the below details around the nature and extent of risks to which it is exposed arising from financial instruments subject to IBOR reform, how such risks are managed and the group's progress in completing its transition to alternative benchmark rates.\n\nIn the UK, GBP LIBOR has been replaced by SONIA from the end of 2021, and USD LIBOR is expected to be replaced by mid-2023. Euribor will remain but will be administered by EMMI (Euro Money Markets Institute).\n\nThe key challenges for the group arose in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 All financial contracts that reference LIBOR needed to be amended;\n- \u00b7 Derivatives and assets on balance sheet that were exposed to changes in market value when the reference rate changes needed to be considered;\n- \u00b7 Discount rates that were based on risk free curves, if the risk free curves were based on LIBOR changed. This primarily affected the Solvency II balance sheet, but the resulting impact was small;\n- \u00b7 Customers of the group needed to understand the implications for their products and agree the necessary changes.\n- 1.

        "page_content": "To deal with these risks and to manage the groupwide conversion, the group initiated a project in 2019 to transition away from LIBOR by 31 December 2021. LGIM is the reportable segment whose operations were most impacted regarding investments linked to LIBOR. Business as usual processes were enhanced to include increased market surveillance on LIBOR trading, added record-keeping specific to LIBOR trades, increased client communications and additional complaints monitoring processes.\n\nThe largest shareholder exposures related to LIBOR-linked derivatives that are used for hedging the annuity business. In 2021, the group stopped trading assets referenced to LIBOR (except in some very limited circumstances) and initiated a programme of replacing legacy assets denominated in LIBOR with new SONIA based positions.\n\nFor GBP LIBOR, in the third quarter of 2021 it was decided to allow remaining cross-currency positions maturing in March 2022 to roll off rather than actively transition to a new risk-free rate. A residual amount of floating-rate notes remains which will reference a 'synthetic' LIBOR as permitted, and this will be reviewed annually.\n\nTrading out of USD LIBOR has been more gradual as a result of the transition date moving to 23 June 2023, however this has now accelerated following guidance by US regulatory authorities that no new USD LIBOR investments should be made from 1 January 2022.\n\nThe following table contains details of all the financial instruments currently subject to the IBOR reform that the group holds on its balance sheet at 31 December 2021 which have not yet transitioned to SONIA or an alternative interest rate benchmark. The amounts of non-derivative financial assets are shown at their carrying amounts and derivatives are shown at their notional amounts.\n\n|                                 | GBP LIBOR  2021 \u00a3m   | USD LIBOR  2021 \u00a3m   | Total  2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|\n| Non-derivative financial assets |                      |                      |                  |\n| Debt securities                 | 229                  | 55                   | 284              |\n| Derivatives                     | 743                  | 59,356               | 60,099           |\n\n## (iv) Standards, interpretations and amendments to published standards which are not yet effective\n\nCertain standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published which are mandatory for the group's accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022 or later periods and which the group has not adopted early, as disclosed below.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' was originally issued in May 2017 by the IASB, and subsequent amendments were issued in June 2020. The standard is expected to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 but remains subject to endorsement for use in the UK. The standard will be applied retrospectively, subject to the transitional options provided for in the standard and provides a comprehensive approach for accounting for insurance contracts including their measurement, income statement presentation and disclosure.\n\nIFRS 17 is an accounting change and therefore while it will have an impact on the timing and profile of profit recognition, we expect the underlying economics and cash generation of the group's businesses will remain the same. While the group is still refining its methodology and completing the development of models and operational capabilities, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the impact on adopting IFRS 17, nor of the ongoing impact on the group's financial results.\n\nIn terms of key accounting policies and approaches, the group is able to set out the following at this time:\n\n- \u00b7 The group will be applying the General Measurement Model to all business measured under IFRS 17.\n- \u00b7 On transition to IFRS 17, the group will apply the fully retrospective approach unless impracticable. In some instances, this will lead to the modified retrospective and fair value approaches being used for specific groups of insurance contracts.\n- \u00b7 For annuity business the selection of a rate at which to discount future cashflows for groups of insurance contracts is a key determinant in the valuation of the insurance liability. We intend to apply a top down discount rate to such groups, starting from an appropriate asset portfolio with economic deductions.\n- \u00b7 IFRS 17 requires an accounting policy decision as to whether to recognise all finance income or expense in the profit and loss or whether to disaggregate the income or expense that relates to changes in financial assumptions into other comprehensive income. All finance income and expense will be included in profit or loss except for protection business where we intend to disaggregate such changes.\n\nThe group has a fully mobilised programme to implement the standard. Work will continue throughout 2022 to ensure technical compliance as well as to test and embed the required systems and operational capability. Communication and training plans are in place for impacted employees, and the impact on resources across the Finance function is being assessed to ensure the business is ready to implement the new standard.",

The standard replaces IAS 39, 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'. It includes new principles around classification and measurement of financial instruments, introduces an impairment model based on expected credit losses (replacing the current model based on incurred losses) and new requirements on hedge accounting. The IASB subsequently issued 'Amendments to IFRS 4: Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts' which allows entities which meet certain requirements to defer their implementation of IFRS 9 until adoption of IFRS 17, 'Insurance Contracts' or 1 January 2021, whichever is the earlier. In June 2020, the IASB agreed to extend the temporary exemption in IFRS 4 from applying IFRS 9 to annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. The group qualifies for, and is making use of, this deferral option.\n\nIn December 2021, in order to alleviate operational complexities and potential one-off accounting mismatches in comparative information between insurance contract liabilities and related financial assets on the initial application of IFRS 17, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 17 titled 'Initial Application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17 - Comparative Information'. If an entity applies IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 at the same time, this amendment permits it to present comparative information about financial assets derecognised in the comparative period as if the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 had been applied to them. The group has chosen to restate comparative information and to apply this classification overlay to all financial assets in scope. While the group is still refining its methodology and completing the development of models and operational capabilities, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the impact on adopting IFRS 9, nor of the ongoing impact on the group's financial results.\n\nIFRS 9 classifies financial assets into the following three categories: amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification of financial assets is based on the entity's business model for managing them, as well as their contractual cash flow characteristics. The group expects to reclassify a certain amount of financial assets as a result of these assessments, in order to better align the accounting treatment of assets that are backing insurance contract liabilities under IFRS 17.\n\nWith the exception of financial assets measured under FVTPL, the group will apply an expected credit loss impairment model to all financial assets in scope (including lease receivables and contract assets). The new impairment model requires utilising not only past events and current conditions but also reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, in order to assess the credit risk profiles of those financial assets in scope. The group will recognise either twelve months' or lifetime expected credit losses in the Consolidated Income Statement at each reporting period. The group intends to use the practical expedient for financial assets with low credit risk at the reporting date, which allows recognising twelve months' expected credit losses. Additionally, for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables, the group plans to use a provision matrix method to calculate and recognise lifetime expected credit losses.\n\nFinancial liabilities are expected to be classified and measured under their current categories (FVTPL or amortised cost) under IFRS 9.\n\nThe group has a fully mobilised programme to implement the standard. Work will continue throughout 2022 to ensure technical compliance as well as to test and embed the required systems and operational capability. Communication and training plans are in place for impacted employees, and the impact on resources across the Finance function is being assessed to ensure the business is ready to implement the new standard.\n\n## Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, make minor amendments to IFRS 1, 'First-time Adoption of IFRS', IFRS 9, 'Financial Instruments', IAS 41, 'Agriculture' and the Illustrative Examples accompanying IFRS 16, 'Leases'. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 16 - Property, plant and equipment\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, prohibit a company from deducting from the cost of property, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognise such sales proceeds and related cost in profit or loss. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 37 - Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, specify which costs a company includes when assessing whether a contract will be loss-making. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS 3 - Business Combinations\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2020, update a reference in IFRS 3 to the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting without changing the accounting requirements for business combinations. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements\n\nThese amendments, issued in February 2021, intend to help preparers in deciding which accounting policies to disclose in their financial statements on or after 1 January 2023, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.",

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Tax\n\nThese amendments, issued in May 2021, clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, subject to UK endorsement. The group does not expect the impact to be significant.\n\n## (v) Critical accounting policies and the use of estimates\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, material adjustments could be made to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. The Audit Committee reviews the reasonableness of judgements associated with and the application of significant accounting policies. The significant accounting matters considered by the Audit Committee in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021 are included within the Audit Committee Report on page 89.\n\nThe preparation of the financial statements has also considered the impact of climate change, and as at 31 December 2021 management does not consider this to be a significant area of accounting judgement or source of estimation uncertainty. Specific considerations in respect of climate change have been presented in this Annual Report & Accounts in the following sections:\n\n- \u00b7 Asset risk (Note 7)\n- \u00b7 Financial investments and investment property (Note 10)\n- \u00b7 IFRS sensitivity analysis (Note 19)\n\nThe major areas of critical accounting judgement on policy application are considered below:\n\n## Insurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 20 and 21): Product classification and the assessment of the significance of insurance risk transferred to the group in determining whether a contract should be accounted for as an insurance or investment contract.\n\nContracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the group are classified as insurance contracts. Contracts that transfer financial risk (e.g. change in interest rate or security price) to the group but not significant insurance risk are classified as investment contracts.\n\nJudgement is required in order to assess the significance of the transfer of insurance risk within a contract. This assessment is based on whether the occurrence of an insured event could cause the group to make significant additional payments, i.e. if the occurrence of the event causes significantly higher cash out flows for the group than its non-occurrence.\n\nCertain contracts, which are both insurance and investment, can contain discretionary participating features representing the contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits under certain conditions, being:\n\n- \u00b7 that the additional benefits are a significant portion of the total contractual benefits;\n- \u00b7 the amount and timing of the additional benefits is at the discretion of the group; and\n- \u00b7 that the additional benefits are contractually dependent upon the performance of a company, fund or specified pool of assets.\n\nInsurance contracts and investment contracts with such discretionary participation features are accounted for under IFRS 4, while investment contracts without discretionary participation features are accounted for as financial instruments under IAS 39.\n\nJudgement is therefore required in order to establish whether any additional benefits in an insurance or investment contract meet the above requirements for being considered discretionary participation features.\n\n## Consolidation (Notes 42-44): Assessment of whether the group controls underlying entities and should therefore consolidate them.\n\nThe assessment takes account of various criteria, including decision making ability, equity holding and the rights to a variable return from the entity.\n\nControl arises when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.",

Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital (structured entities), are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe group invests in various fund and unit trust entities where it also acts as the asset manager to those entities. In these instances, in determining whether the group controls the entities, the assessment focuses on the aggregate economic interests of the group (direct interest and expected management fees) and on whether the group acts as a principal or agent. This includes an assessment of the removal rights of other investors (their practical ability to allow the group not to control the fund). Additionally, holdings in such investments can fluctuate on a daily basis according to the participation of the group and other investors in them. As a result, in determining control, we look at an assessment of these factors over a longer period to mitigate the impact of daily fluctuations which do not reflect the wider facts and circumstances of the group's involvement. This is performed in line with the following principles:\n\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity exceeds 50%, the group is judged to have control over the entity;\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity is between 30% and 50%, the facts and circumstances of the group's involvement in the entity are considered, including the rights to any fees earned by the asset manager from the entity, in forming a judgement as to whether the group has control over the entity; and\n- \u00b7 where the entity is managed by a group asset manager, and the group's ownership holding in the entity is less than 30%, the group is judged to not have control over the entity, but again the facts and circumstances of the group's involvement in the entity are considered.\n\nThe following sets out information about the critical accounting assumptions made by the group about the future, and other major sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period, that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year:\n\n## Valuation of insurance and investment contract liabilities (Notes 18-21)\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of longevity, mortality and morbidity assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance contract liabilities; the assumptions for the rate of future longevity, mortality and morbidity are based on the group's internal experience and judgements about how experience may vary in the future. This assessment takes into account market benchmarking, internal experience studies and independent industry data.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the expense assumptions used in the calculation of the insurance liabilities that represent the expected future costs of administering the underlying insurance policies; the expense assumptions are based on management's best estimate of these future costs, and appropriate allocation between servicing new and existing business.\n- \u00b7 Determination of valuation interest rates used to discount the liabilities are sensitive to the assumptions made, for example, on credit default of the backing assets; these assumptions take into account consideration of market experience and historic internal data. The valuation interest rate is also sensitive to the selection of assets chosen to back the liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Determination of the target long-term asset portfolio at certain period ends, depending on the quantum and timing of pension risk transfer (PRT) volumes; this assumption is used to present LGR's new business metrics.\n\nInsurance and investment contract liabilities are of a long-term nature, and as such, the ultimate impact of Covid-19 will emerge over a long period of time. As at 31 December 2021, there was insufficient certainty in more recent data to revise long-term assumptions in response to emerging claims experience relating to the effects of the pandemic, with the exception of certain short-term allowances in protection contracts.\n\n## Valuation of unquoted illiquid assets and investment property (Note 10)\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of fair value of unquoted and illiquid assets, and investment property involves judgements in model valuations, through the incorporation of both observable and unobservable market inputs, which include assumptions that lead to the existence of a range of plausible valuations for financial assets.\n\nIn assessing asset valuation, in line with applicable standards and guidance, the group has both projected the short-term impact on earnings and cash flows of the current market volatility, while continuing to review the assets' ability to deliver longer-term returns aligned to their investment cases.\n\n## Defined benefit pension plan (Note 23)\n\n- \u00b7 Determination of pension plan assumptions including mortality, discount rates and inflation; these assumptions have been set in accordance with the requirements of IAS 19, 'Employee Benefits' and include consistent judgements with those in setting the annuity liabilities where possible. Note 23 includes a sensitivity analysis to alternative assumptions.",

All intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated in full.\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the group directly or indirectly has control (i.e. when the group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee) (Note 42). Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control. Puttable instruments held by external parties in consolidated investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nThe group has interests in associates and joint ventures (Note 43) which form part of an investment portfolio held through private equity vehicles, mutual funds, unit trusts and similar entities. In accordance with the choice permitted by IAS 28, 'Investments in associates', these interests have been classified as fair value through profit or loss and measured at fair value within financial investments, with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nAssociates which do not form part of an investment portfolio are initially recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at cost. The carrying amount of the associate is increased or decreased to reflect the group's share of total comprehensive income after the date of the acquisition.\n\n## (vii) Product classification\n\nThe group's products are classified for accounting purposes as either insurance or investment contracts. The basis of accounting for these products is outlined in Notes 20 and 21 respectively. The following table summarises the classification of the group's significant types of non-participating insurance and investment contracts as described in Note 6 for each applicable reportable segment.\n\n| Reportable segment   | Non-participating insurance contracts                                                                              | Non-participating investment contracts                                                                                                          |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LGR                  | \u00b7  Pension risk transfers \u00b7  Individual annuities \u00b7  Longevity insurance \u00b7  Lifetime Care Plan                     | \u00b7  Lifetime mortgages \u00b7  Fixed term individual annuities \u00b7  Assured payment policies \u00b7  Retirement interest only mortgages \u00b7  Workplace Savings |\n| LGI                  | \u00b7  UK Retail protection  \u00b7  UK Group protection \u00b7  US Protection  \u00b7  US Universal life  \u00b7  US Individual annuities |                                                                                                                                                 |\n| LGIM                 |                                                                                                                    | \u00b7  Institutional Pension \u00b7  Segregated investment management mandates \u00b7  Collective Investment Schemes                                          |\n\n## (viii) Fiduciary activities\n\nAssets associated with fiduciary activities and the income arising from those assets, together with associated commitments to return such assets to customers, are not included in these financial statements. Where the group acts in a fiduciary capacity, for instance as a trustee or agent, it has no contractual rights over the assets concerned.\n\n## (ix) Foreign exchange and exchange rates\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. The functional currency of the group's foreign operations is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The assets and liabilities of all of the group's foreign operations are translated into sterling, the group's presentation currency, at the closing rate at the date of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates. On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to a separate component of shareholders' equity.\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow\n\nor net investment hedges.\n\nThe closing exchange rates at 31 December 2021 were 1.35 United States dollar and 1.19 euro (31 December 2020: 1.37 United States dollar and 1.12 euro).\n\nThe average exchange rates for the year ended 31 December 2021 were 1.38 United States dollar and 1.16 euro (31 December 2020: 1.28 United States dollar and 1.13 euro).",

LGRR includes the Workplace Savings business which was previously reported in LGIM. Prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect the change in reporting structure. Further details are provided in Note 28.\n\n- 4. Group debt costs exclude interest on non-recourse financing.\n- 5. Covid-19 costs reflected incremental operational expenses incurred as a result of Covid-19.\n- 6. The profit/(loss) before tax reflects the adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\nThis supplementary adjusted operating profit information (one of the group's key performance indicators) provides additional analysis of the results reported under IFRS, and the group believes it provides stakeholders with useful information to enhance their understanding of the performance of the business in the year.\n\nAdjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations and exceptional items. It therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the group's insurance businesses and shareholder funds, including the traded portfolio in LGC. For direct investments, operating profit reflects the expected long-term economic return for those assets which are developed with the intention of sale, or the IFRS profit before tax for the early stage and mature businesses. Variances between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets (including direct investments) are excluded from adjusted operating profit, as well as economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business. Adjusted operating profit also excludes the yield associated with assets held for future new pension risk transfer business from the valuation discount rate on insurance contract liabilities. Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and start-up costs, are also excluded from adjusted operating profit.\n\nThe group reports its results across the following business segments:\n\n- \u00b7 LGR represents worldwide pension risk transfer business including longevity insurance (within LGRI), and retail retirement, workplace savings and lifetime mortgage loans (within LGRR).\n- \u00b7 LGIM represents institutional and retail investment management.\n- \u00b7 LGC represents shareholder assets invested in direct investments primarily in the areas of specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, housing and SME finance, as well as traded and treasury assets.\n- \u00b7 LGI primarily represents UK and US retail protection business, UK group protection and Fintech business.",

For Workplace Savings, the release from operations represents the expected annual management charges generated from the in-force business less the expected expenses. The LGI release from operations also includes dividends remitted from LGIA.\n\nNew business surplus/(strain) for LGR and LGI UK and Other represents the initial profit or loss from writing new business. This includes the costs associated with acquiring new business and setting up prudent reserves in respect of new business for UK annuities and protection, net of tax. Similarly for Workplace Savings, this includes the cost of acquiring new business in the year less the annual management charges generated by the assets under administration (AUA), net of tax. The new business surplus and release from operations for LGR and LGI excludes any capital held in excess of the prudent reserves from the liability calculation.\n\nLGR's new business metrics are presented based on a target long-term asset portfolio. At certain year ends, depending upon the quantum and timing of pension risk transfer (PRT) volumes, we may have sourced more or less of the high quality assets targeted to support that business. At year end, the profit impact of the difference between actual assets held (including alternative surplus assets where suitable) and the long-term asset mix is reflected in investment variance.\n\nNet release from operations for LGR and LGI is defined as release from operations plus new business surplus/(strain).\n\nRelease from operations and net release from operations for LGC and LGIM represents the adjusted operating profit (net of tax).\n\nSee Note 2 (iii) for more detail on experience variances, changes to valuation assumptions and non-cash items.",

        "page_content": "## 5 Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share is a measure of the portion of the group's profit allocated to each outstanding share. It is calculated by dividing net income attributable to ordinary equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding employee scheme treasury shares. For this purpose, net income is defined as the profit after tax, attributable to equity holders of the company, derived from continuing operations.\n\nFor diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue, excluding employee scheme treasury shares, is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, such as share options granted to employees. Potential or contingent share issuances are treated as dilutive when their conversion to shares would decrease net earnings per share.\n\n## (i) Basic earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                          | After tax 2021 \u00a3m   | Per share 1 2021 p   | After tax 2020 \u00a3m   | Per share 1 2020 p   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders                                       | 2,050               | 34.58                | 1,607               | 27.10                |\n| Less: coupon payable in respect of restricted Tier 1 convertible notes net of tax relief | (23)                | (0.39)               | (6)                 | (0.10)               |\n| Total basic earnings                                                                     | 2,027               | 34.19                | 1,601               | 27.00                |\n| Less: earnings derived from discontinued operations                                      | -                   | -                    | (290)               | (4.89)               |\n| Basic earnings derived from continuing operations                                        | 2,027               | 34.19                | 1,311               | 22.11                |\n\n## (ii) Diluted earnings per share\n\n|                                                                 | After tax 2021 \u00a3m   | Weighted  average  number of  shares 2021 m   | Per share 1 2021 p   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders              | 2,050               | 5,929                                         | 34.58                |\n| Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration | -                   | 59                                            | (0.34)               |\n| Conversion of restricted Tier 1 notes                           | -                   | 307                                           | (1.67)               |\n| Total diluted earnings                                          | 2,050               | 6,295                                         | 32.57                |\n\n|                                                                 | After tax 2020 \u00a3m   | Weighted  average  number of  shares 2020 m   | Per share 1 2020 p   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to equity holders              | 1,607               | 5,930                                         | 27.10                |\n| Net shares under options allocable for no further consideration | -                   | 40                                            | (0.18)               |\n| Conversion of restricted Tier 1 notes                           | -                   | 307                                           | (1.32)               |\n| Total diluted earnings                                          | 1,607               | 6,277                                         | 25.60                |\n| Less: diluted earnings derived from discontinued operations     | (290)               | -                                             | (4.62)               |\n| Diluted earnings derived from continuing operations             | 1,317               | 6,277                                         | 20.98                |",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management\n\n## 6 Principal products\n\nA significant part of the group's business involves the acceptance and management of risk.\n\nA description of the principal products offered by the group's segments is outlined below. The group seeks to manage its exposure to risk through controls which ensure that the residual exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the board. The group's risk appetite framework and the methods used to monitor risk exposures can be found on pages 52-59.\n\nDetails of the risks associated with the group's principal products and the controls used to manage these risks can be found in Notes 7 and 15 to 17.\n\n## Legal & General Retirement (LGR)\n\n## Annuity contracts\n\nAnnuity products provide guaranteed income for a specified time, usually the life of the policyholder, in exchange for a lump sum capital payment. No surrender value is available under any of these products.\n\nPension Risk Transfer (PRT) represents bulk annuities, whereby the group accepts the assets and liabilities of a company pension scheme or a life fund. These are written predominantly to UK clients but increasing internationally.\n\nImmediate annuity contracts are offered to individual policyholders. Immediate annuities provide a regular income stream to the policyholder, purchased with a lump sum investment, where the income stream starts immediately after the purchase. These annuities may include a guaranteed payment period.\n\nSome deferred annuities sold by the group contain guaranteed cash options, predominantly minimum factors for commuting part of the annuity income into cash at the date of vesting. The value of such guaranteed options is currently immaterial.\n\nThere is a block of immediate and deferred annuities within the UK business with benefits linked to changes in the RPI or for a minority the CPI, but with contractual maximum or minimum increases. In particular, most of these annuities have a provision that the annuity will not reduce if RPI, or for a minority CPI, becomes negative. The total annual annuity value of such annuities in payment at 31 December 2021 was \u00a31,510m (2020: \u00a31,170m). Thus, 1% negative inflation, which was reversed in the following year, would result in a guarantee cost of approximately \u00a315m (2020: \u00a312m). Negative inflation sustained over a longer period would give rise to significantly greater guarantee costs. Some of these guarantee costs have been partially matched through the purchase of negative inflation hedges and limited price indexation swaps.\n\nThe group also offers products for individuals that provide a guaranteed level of income over a chosen fixed period of time, in exchange for an initial lump sum payment from the policyholder. The products can provide a fixed lump sum at maturity and/or options to surrender on non-guaranteed terms.\n\nThe group writes Assured Payment Policies (APP). An APP is a long-term contract under which the policyholder (a registered UK pension scheme) pays a day-one premium and in return receives a contractually fixed and/or inflation-linked set of payments over time from the insurer.\n\n## Longevity insurance contracts\n\nThe group also provides longevity insurance products for company pension schemes, under which regular payments are made to the scheme reflecting their actual longevity experience, while the scheme makes an agreed set of regular payments in return. Some policies contain a guaranteed surrender value which is currently immaterial.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nLifetime mortgages are a form of equity release mortgage that provide non-commercial borrowers with a loan secured against their main residence, without the need for regular repayments. They are regulated retail mortgages offered only to borrowers over the age of 55 through specialist intermediaries. Interest accrues over the term of the loan and is repayable at the time the principal becomes due. Loans can be advanced in a single lump sum amount or in several subsequent drawdowns of an agreed facility. All lifetime mortgages provide a 'no negative equity' guarantee, which means that if the loan is repaid from the sale of the property and if the net sale proceeds are lower than the balance of the loan, the group will accept the net sale proceeds as full settlement.\n\n## Retirement Interest Only mortgages\n\nA Retirement Interest Only (RIO) mortgage is a standard residential mortgage available for non-commercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house.\n- \u00b7 The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term. No repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.\n\n## Lifetime Care Plan\n\nThe Lifetime Care Plan provides a monthly payment to a UK registered care provider that helps meet the cost of care for the policyholder's life. A policyholder can choose to receive a fixed monthly payment or opt to have escalation built in. A death benefit exists within the product so that if a policyholder dies within the first 6 months of the start date a percentage of the original premium less any payments already made is payable to the estate.\n\n## Workplace Savings\n\nWorkplace Savings provides corporate pension scheme solutions to enable companies to meet their auto-enrolment obligations. Workplace Savings acts as scheme operator and administrator for these products while the customers hold the individual or scheme level pension policies issued by Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS).",

Assets are managed in London and Chicago on behalf of pension funds, institutional clients, sovereign wealth clients, retail clients and subsidiary companies within the group.\n\nThe key products provided by LGIM are unit linked Institutional Pensions, Segregated investment management mandates and Collective Investment Schemes.\n\nThe core strategies applied for managing the products are set out below.\n\n## Index fund management\n\nLGIM provides a diversified range of pooled index funds, providing a wide choice and the ability to pursue specific benchmarks efficiently. In addition, segregated solutions are offered to institutional clients providing large scale customisation against established market capitalisation weighted and alternative indices.\n\nThe LGIM ETF business provides clients access to LGIM's index fund management capabilities via our Exchange Traded Fund platform. ETF products cover a broad range of traditional and thematic asset classes.\n\n## Active strategies\n\nLGIM offers a range of pooled and segregated active fixed income funds. The LGIM liquidity funds offer institutional investors a solution for their cash management requirements across a range of core currencies. The liquidity funds aim to deliver competitive returns with a high level of diversification, whilst focusing on capital preservation through portfolios of high quality, liquid assets.\n\nActive strategies also includes an active equity management business comprising focused teams managing stock selection across different regions.\n\n## Solutions and Liability Driven Investment (LDI)\n\nLGIM provides a range of pooled and bespoke solutions to help de-risk defined benefit pension schemes. These solutions will usually combine active or passive underlying portfolios with derivative overlays designed to meet clients' specific requirements. An allocation strategy service is also offered to institutional clients, which may also allocate some of the portfolio to managers other than LGIM.\n\n## Multi-asset funds\n\nMulti-asset funds for retail and institutional clients, built using LGIM's expertise in asset allocation which is informed by an in-house research capability. The underlying asset classes may be managed on an active or passive basis within LGIM.\n\n## Real assets\n\nLGIM offers a range of pooled funds, segregated accounts and joint ventures investing on behalf of UK and overseas investors across physical real estate, private corporate debt, infrastructure debt and real estate loans. The business has specialist teams of fund and asset managers and an in-house research team.\n\n## Legal & General Capital (LGC)\n\n## Investment strategy and implementation\n\nLegal & General Capital manages shareholder assets which are not directly required to meet contractual obligations to policyholders. LGC's investments fall into two distinct categories; direct investments and traded assets. The value of, and income from, both categories are sensitive to conditions within investment markets and the broader economy. Potential volatility in returns is managed using a range of techniques, including foreign exchange and interest rate hedging, and exposure concentration limits by asset type, sector and geographic region.\n\n## Direct investments and structuring\n\nDirect investments are an integral part of the wider group strategy. LGC's direct investments are typically illiquid investments entered into through acquisition, joint venture with strategic partners or by the creation of new companies. LGC seeks to make direct investments in sectors where there are structural funding shortfalls, and is organised into four sectors: specialist commercial real estate, clean energy, housing and SME finance. LGC deploys capital and sector expertise to such investments to target attractive risk-adjusted returns which can deliver higher returns and/or lower volatility for our shareholder capital than listed equity.\n\n## Legal & General Insurance (LGI)\n\nLGI business comprises UK and US retail protection, UK group protection, US universal life business and Fintech business.\n\n## UK protection business (retail and group)\n\nThe group offers protection products which provide mortality or morbidity benefits. They may include health, disability, critical illness and accident benefits; these additional benefits are commonly provided as supplements to main life policies but can also be sold separately. The benefit amounts would usually be specified in the policy terms. Some sickness benefits cover the policyholder's mortgage repayments and are linked to the prevailing mortgage interest rates. In addition to these benefits, some contracts may guarantee premium rates, provide guaranteed insurability benefits and offer policyholders conversion options.\n\n## US protection business\n\nProtection consists of individual term assurance, which provides death benefits over the medium to long-term. The contracts have level premiums for an initial period with premiums set annually thereafter. During the initial period, there is generally an option to convert the contract to a universal life contract. After the initial period, the premium rates are not guaranteed, but cannot exceed the age-related guaranteed premium.",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management continued\n\n## 6 Principal products continued\n\nReinsurance is used within the protection businesses to manage exposure to large claims. These practices lead to the establishment of reinsurance assets on the group's balance sheet. Within our US business, Legal & General America (LGA), reinsurance and securitisation are also used to provide regulatory solvency relief (including relief from regulation governing term insurance and universal life reserves).\n\n## US universal life\n\nUniversal life contracts written by LGA provide savings and death benefits over the medium to long-term. The savings element has a guaranteed minimum growth rate. LGA has exposure to loss in the event that interest rates decrease and it is unable to earn enough on the underlying assets to cover the guaranteed rate. LGA is also exposed to loss should interest rates increase, as the underlying market value of assets will generally fall without a change in the surrender value.\n\n## Annuities\n\nImmediate annuities have similar characteristics as products sold by LGR. Deferred annuity contracts written by LGA contain a provision that, at maturity, a policyholder may move the account value into an immediate annuity, at rates which are either those currently in effect, or rates guaranteed in the contract.\n\n## 7 Asset risk\n\nThe group is exposed to the following categories of asset risk as a consequence of offering the principal products outlined in Note 6. The group is also exposed to insurance risk as a consequence of offering these products - more detail on insurance risk can be found in Note 17.\n\n## Market risk\n\nExposure to loss as a direct or indirect result of fluctuations in the value of, or income from, specific assets.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nExposure to loss if another party fails to perform its financial obligations to the group.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe risk that the group, though solvent, either does not have sufficient financial resources available to enable it to meet its obligations as they fall due, or can secure them only at excessive cost.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nThe group is exposed to climate change through two broad categories: transition risks from the move to a low-carbon economy and the impact this has on asset valuation and the economy; and physical risks from the impact on asset holdings as a result of severe weather events and longer-term shifts in climate.\n\nThe group has integrated climate risk management into our governance framework and has carried out a detailed assessment of how we could expect climate risk to emerge across our business model. The group risk mitigation strategy includes setting portfolio carbon intensity targets, integrating carbon controls into the investment processes through stock exclusions and high carbon escalation, corporate engagement and implementing high energy efficiency standards into the group directly owned commercial property and housing businesses.\n\nThe group is not directly exposed to any market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk associated with LGIM's businesses. As a result, the detailed risk disclosures have not been presented.\n\nThe group seeks to manage its exposures to risk through controls which ensure that the residual risk exposures are within acceptable tolerances agreed by the Board. A description of the risks associated with the group's principal products and the associated controls is detailed below.",

Property lending counterparty risk As part of our asset diversification strategy, we hold  property lending and sale and leaseback investments.  We are inherently exposed to the risk of default by  a borrower or tenant. Banking counterparty risk The group is exposed to potential financial loss should  banks or the issuers of financial instruments default  on their obligations to us. We are also exposed to  counterparty risks in respect of the providers of  settlement and custody services. Principal risks Contingent event risk  Events that result in liquidity risk include a pandemic  that could lead to significantly higher levels of claims  than would normally be expected, or extreme events  impacting the timing of cash flows or the ability to  realise investments at a given value within a | LGR and LGC LGR, LGC and Group | the group considers only companies which have a minimum credit rating  equivalent to A- from Standard & Poor's. For each reinsurer, exposure limits  are determined based on credit ratings and projected exposure over the  term of the treaty. Actual exposures are regularly monitored relative to these  limits. Similarly, for longevity and credit risk syndication transactions, the  group targets the use of strongly rated counterparties and seeks to ensure  that positions are fully collateralised. The adequacy and quality of collateral  is subject to ongoing monitoring. Each property lending and sale and leaseback investment transaction is  subject to a due diligence process to assess the credit risks implicit in the  transaction and confirm that any risk of default has been appropriately  mitigated. We also protect our interests by taking security over the  underlying property associated with each investment transaction. The group controls its exposures to banking counterparties and the issuers  of financial instruments using a framework of counterparty limits.

Various reinsurance arrangements are in place as a mechanism to mitigate the risks.\n\nThe two categorisations presented are:\n\n## Unit linked\n\nFor unit linked contracts, there is a direct link between the investments and the obligations. Unit linked business is written in both Legal and General Assurance Society Limited and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited. The financial risk on these contracts is borne by the policyholders. The group is therefore not directly exposed to any market risk, currency risk or credit risk for these contracts.

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management continued\n\n## 9 Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets mainly consist of capitalised software costs and intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination (customer relationships and brand).\n\nWhere software costs are separately identifiable and measurable, they are capitalised at cost and amortised over their expected useful life on a straight line basis. Costs incurred to internally develop software are only capitalised if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete such development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, such costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nIntangible assets acquired via business combinations are recognised at fair value and are subsequently amortised on a straight line method over their estimated useful life. The brand balance acquired by the group is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortised.\n\nThe estimated amortisation periods for intangible assets with finite useful lives are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 IT development and software\n- 3-10 years\n- \u00b7 Customer relationship\n- 3 years\n\nAmortisation methods, useful lives and any expected residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. The amortisation charge for the year is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in Other expenses (see Note 3).\n\nFor impairment testing, other intangible assets are tested either individually or at the cash-generating unit level. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested when there are indications of impairment. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Any impairments are charged in Other expenses (see Note 3).\n\n|                                         | Capitalised software costs 1 2021 \u00a3m   | Other 2 2021 \u00a3m   | Total 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Cost                                    |                                        |                   |                 |\n| As at 1 January                         | 372                                    | 33                | 405             |\n| Additions 1                             | 120                                    | 1                 | 121             |\n| Increase due to currency translation    | 1                                      | -                 | 1               |\n| Other movements 3                       | (43)                                   | -                 | (43)            |\n| As at 31 December                       | 450                                    | 34                | 484             |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment |                                        |                   |                 |\n| As at 1 January                         | (73)                                   | (3)               | (76)            |\n| Amortisation for the year               | (39)                                   | (1)               | (40)            |\n| Impairment                              | (49)                                   | -                 | (49)            |\n| Other movements 3                       | 46                                     | -                 | 46              |\n| As at 31 December                       | (115)                                  | (4)               | (119)           |\n| Total net book value as at 31 December  | 335                                    | 30                | 365             |\n| To be amortised within 12 months        |                                        |                   | 60              |\n| To be amortised after 12 months         |                                        |                   | 305             |\n\n- 1.

Initial recognition of financial investments is on the trade date.\n\nIn general, the group's policy is to measure investments at FVTPL. Financial investments held by the group are designated as FVTPL as their performance is evaluated on a total return basis, consistent with asset performance reporting to the Group Investment and Market Risk Committee and the group's investment strategy. Assets designated as FVTPL include debt securities (including lifetime and retirement interest only mortgages) and equity instruments which would otherwise have been classified as AFS and reverse repurchase agreements within loans which would otherwise be designated at amortised cost. Assets backing non-participating policyholder liabilities are designated as FVTPL. The group's non-participating investment contract liabilities are measured on the basis of current information and are designated as FVTPL.\n\nAll derivatives other than those designated as hedges are classified as HFT. Financial investments classified as HFT and designated at FVTPL are measured at fair value with gains and losses reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nCertain other financial investments classified as AFS are measured at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in a separate reserve within equity. Realised gains and losses, impairment losses, dividends, interest and foreign exchange movements on non-equity instruments are reflected in the Consolidated Income Statement. Directly attributable transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the investment.\n\nFinancial investments classified as loans are either designated at FVTPL, or initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The designated at FVTPL classification currently only applies to reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nFinancial investments are recognised when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial investments are derecognised only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the investment expire, or when the group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to another entity.\n\nFinancial assets, other than those measured at FVTPL, are assessed for impairment at each balance sheet date. They are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events after initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows have been affected.\n\nInvestment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth, as well as right-of-use assets of the same nature. It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within investment return.\n\nInvestment property in the UK is valued at least bi-annually by external chartered surveyors at open market values in accordance with the 'Appraisal and Valuation Manual' of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors or using internal valuations and estimates during the intervening period. Outside the UK, valuations are produced in conjunction with external qualified professional valuers in the countries concerned. In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to reflect any material changes in fair value.\n\nRight-of-use investment property assets relate to long-leasehold interests in land held solely for the purposes of the related investment property asset. The group applies the fair value model to these interests as they meet the definition of investment property under IAS 40, 'Investment Property'.\n\nThe group receives and pledges collateral in the form of cash or non-cash assets in respect of various transactions, in order to reduce the credit risk of these transactions. The amount and type of collateral required where the group receives collateral depends on an assessment of the credit risk of the counterparty.\n\nCollateral received in the form of cash, where the group has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is recognised as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding liability for its repayment. Non-cash collateral received is not recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the counterparty defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.\n\nNon-cash collateral pledged where the group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated is not derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the group defaults on its obligations under the relevant agreement.\n\nCash collateral pledged, where the counterparty has contractual rights to receive the cash flows generated, is derecognised from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and a corresponding receivable is recognised for its return.",

The remaining risks associated with financial investments are outlined in Note 7.\n\nFinancial investments, cash and cash equivalents include \u00a33,826m (2020: \u00a34,097m) of assets pledged as collateral against net derivative liability counterparty positions. The assets used as collateral are Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA and AA Corporate Bonds and Cash (2020: Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds, AAA and AA Corporate Bonds and Cash) having a residual maturity of over 34 years (2020: over 25 years). The group is entitled to receive all of the cash flows from the asset during the period when it is pledged as collateral. Further, there is no obligation to pay or transfer these cash flows to another entity. The group can decide to substitute an asset which is designated as collateral at any time, provided the relevant terms and conditions of the International Swap Dealers Association agreement are met.\n\nFinancial investments include \u00a346,331m (2020: \u00a353,853m) of assets that have been sold but not derecognised and are subject to repurchase agreements. The related obligation to repurchase the financial assets is included within Payables and other financial liabilities (Note 24).\n\nVarious pension risk transfer deals include collateralised structures. \u00a37,586m (2020: \u00a38,022m) of Corporate Bonds and Treasury Gilts are pledged as collateral in relation to these.\n\nCollateral of \u00a3900m (2020: \u00a3760m) made up of Treasury Gilts, Foreign Government Bonds and Corporate Bonds (AAA, AA, A and BBB) was pledged out in respect of longevity swaps with reinsurance counterparties. These assets are neither past due, nor impaired. The carrying value reflects the full exposure value of these assets.\n\nFinancial investments have been allocated between those expected to be settled within 12 months and after 12 months in line with the expected settlement of the backed liabilities. Assets in excess of the insurance and investment contract liabilities have been classified as expected to be settled after 12 months.",

        "page_content": "## (iii) Fair value hierarchy\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nFair value measurements are based on observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the group's view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information. The group utilises techniques that maximise the use of observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nThe levels of fair value measurement bases are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1: fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: fair values measured using valuation techniques for all inputs significant to the measurement other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n\nLevel 3: fair values measured using valuation techniques for any input for the asset or liability significant to the measurement that is not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n\nAll of the group's Level 2 assets have been valued using standard market pricing sources, such as IHS Markit, ICE and Bloomberg, or Index Providers such as Barclays, Merrill Lynch or JPMorgan. Each uses mathematical modelling and multiple source validation in order to determine consensus prices, with the exception of OTC Derivative holdings; OTCs are marked to market using an in-house system (Lombard Oberon), external vendor (IHS Markit), internal model or Counterparty Broker marks. In normal market conditions, we would consider these market prices to be observable market prices. Following consultation with our pricing providers and a number of their contributing brokers, we have considered that these prices are not from a suitably active market and have therefore classified them as Level 2.\n\nThe group's investment properties are valued by appropriately qualified external valuers using unobservable inputs, resulting in all investment property being classified as Level 3.\n\nThe group's policy is to re-assess categorisation of financial assets at the end of each reporting period and to recognise transfers between levels at that point in time. During 2020 the group enhanced the level of market data it uses to support the determination of the observability of valuation inputs, and this has increased the sensitivity of the levelling assessment to trading volumes, which in turn has increased the number of debt securities transferring between Level 1 and Level 2. At 31 December 2021 debt securities totalling net \u00a35.2bn transferred from Level 2 to Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.",

Unquoted securities include suspended securities, investments in private equity and property vehicles. Untraded debt securities include private placements, commercial real estate loans, income strips, retirement interest only and other lifetime mortgages.\n\nIn many situations, inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the group determines the level in which the fair value falls based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value. As a result, both observable and unobservable inputs may be used in the determination of fair values that the group has classified within Level 3.\n\nThe group determines the fair values of certain financial assets and liabilities based on quoted market prices, where available. The group also determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted at the appropriate current market rate. As appropriate, fair values reflect adjustments for counterparty credit quality, the group's credit standing, liquidity and risk margins on unobservable inputs.\n\nFair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that input variables and outputs are assessed independent of the risk taker. These inputs and outputs are reviewed and approved by a valuation committee and validated independently as appropriate.\n\n|                                   | Equity securities 2021 \u00a3m   | Other financial investments 2021 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2021 \u00a3m   | Total 2021 \u00a3m   | Equity securities 2020 \u00a3m   | Other financial investments 2020 \u00a3m   | Investment property 2020 \u00a3m   | Total 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|\n| As at 1 January                   | 1,801                       | 21,957                                | 8,475                         | 32,233          | 2,035                       | 19,402                                | 9,107                         | 30,544          |\n| Total gains/(losses) for the year |                             |                                       |                               |                 |                             |                                       |                               |                 |\n| - in other comprehensive income   | -                           | (3)                                   | -                             | (3)             | -                           | 2                                     | -                             | 2               |\n| - realised gains/(losses) 1       | 31                          | 12                                    | (4)                           | 39              | (39)                        | 13                                    | (280)                         | (306)           |\n| - unrealised gains/(losses) 1     | 208                         | (87)                                  | 1,028                         | 1,149           | (46)                        | 1,354                                 | 195                           | 1,503           |\n| Purchases/Additions               | 130                         | 5,429                                 | 985                           | 6,544           | 283                         | 2,491                                 | 1,019                         | 3,793           |\n| Sales/Disposals 2                 | (153)                       | (2,351)                               | (334)                         | (2,838)         | (451)                       | (1,123)                               | (1,566)                       | (3,140)         |\n| Transfers into Level 3            | 2                           | 10                                    | -                             | 12              | 52                          | -                                     | -                             | 52              |\n| Transfers out of Level 3          | (31)                        | (112)                                 | -                             | (143)           | (32)                        | (87)                                  | -                             | (119)           |\n| Foreign exchange rate movements   | -                           | 31                                    | -                             | 31              | (1)                         | (95)                                  | -                             | (96)            |\n| As at 31 December                 | 1,988                       | 24,886                                | 10,150                        | 37,024          | 1,801                       | 21,957                                | 8,475                         | 32,233          |\n\n- 1. Realised and unrealised gains/(losses) are recognised in Investment return in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n- 2. Disposals in 2020 include \u00a3926m of Investment property and \u00a3234m of Equity securities that relate to the sale of the Mature Savings business, which completed on 7 September 2020.\n\n## Climate risk\n\nThe group's asset portfolio can be exposed to climate change through both:\n\n- \u00b7 Transition risks from the move to a low-carbon economy and the impact this has on asset valuation and the economy; and\n- \u00b7 Physical risks from the impact on asset holdings as a result of severe weather events and longer-term shifts in climate.\n\nExposure to the physical risks of climate change are minimised in the direct investment portfolio through rigorous assessment of potential investments, particularly in ensuring there is low susceptibility to extreme weather events. The group monitors the carbon intensity of the investments held at a portfolio level to help understand the environmental impact and reduce high carbon intensive investments in the future. Further detail can be found in our Climate Report (TCFD).\n\nThe group's assets are valued, where possible, using standard market pricing sources or appropriately qualified external valuers and therefore reflect current market sentiments in respect of climate risk.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nLevel 3 equity securities amount to \u00a31,988m (2020: \u00a31,801m), of which the majority is made up of holdings in investment property vehicles and private investment funds. They are valued at the proportion of the group's holding of the Net Asset Value reported by the investment vehicles. Other equity securities are valued by a number of third party specialists using a range of techniques which are often dependent on the maturity of the underlying investment but can also depend on the characteristics of individual investments. Such techniques include transaction values underpinned by analysis of milestone achievement, and cash runway for early/start-up stage investments, discounted cash flow models for investments at the next stage of development and earnings multiples for more mature investments.",

Lifetime mortgages are valued using a discounted cash flow model by projecting best-estimate net asset proceeds and discounted using rates inferred from current LTM loan pricing. The inferred illiquidity premiums for the majority of the portfolio range between 100 and 300bps. This ensures the value of loans at outset is consistent with the purchase price of the loan, and achieves consistency between new and in-force loans. The mortgages include a no negative equity guarantee (NNEG) to borrowers. This ensures that if there is a shortfall between the sale proceeds of the property and the outstanding loan balance on redemption of the loan, the value of the loan will be reduced by this amount. The NNEG on loan redemption is valued as a series of put options, which we calculate using a variant of the Black-Scholes formula. Key assumptions in the valuation of lifetime mortgages include short-term and long-term property growth rates, property index volatility, voluntary early repayments and longevity assumptions. The valuation as at 31 December 2021 reflects a long-term property growth rate assumption of 2.9% annually, after allowing for the effects of dilapidation. The values of the properties collateralising the LTM loans are updated from the date of the last property valuation to the valuation date by indexing using UK regional house price indices.\n\nPrivate credit loans (including commercial real estate loans) amount to \u00a313,521m (2020: \u00a311,889m). Their valuation is determined by discounted future cash flows which are based on the yield curve of the LGIM approved comparable bonds and the initial spread, both of which are agreed by IHS Markit who also provide an independent valuation of comparable bonds. Unobservable inputs that go into the determination of comparators include: rating, sector, sub-sector, performance dynamics, financing structure and duration of investment. Existing private credit investments, which were executed back as far as 2011, are subject to a range of interest rate formats, although the majority are fixed rate. The weighted average duration of the portfolio is 10.8 years, with a weighted average life of 13.1 years. Maturities in the portfolio currently extend out to 2064. The private credit portfolio of assets has internal ratings assigned by an independent credit team in line with internally developed methodologies. These credit ratings range from AAA to BB-.\n\nPrivate placements held by the US business amount to \u00a31,762m (2020: \u00a32,049m). They are valued using a pricing matrix comprised of a public spread matrix, internal ratings assigned to each holding, average life of each holding, and a premium spread matrix. These are added to the risk-free rate to calculate the discounted cash flows and establish a market value for each investment grade private placement. The valuation as at 31 December 2021 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 70bps.\n\nIncome strip assets amount to \u00a31,626m (2020: \u00a31,449m). Their valuation is outsourced to Knight Frank and CBRE who apply a yield to maturity to discounted future cash flows to derive valuations. The overall valuation takes into account the property location, tenant details, tenure, rent, rental break terms, lease expiries and underlying residual value of the property. The valuation as at 31 December 2021 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 1% and 9% and estimated rental values (ERV) between \u00a310 and \u00a3338 per sq.ft.\n\nCommercial mortgage loans amount to \u00a31,021m (2020: \u00a3419m) and are determined by incorporating credit risk for performing loans at the portfolio level and adjusted for loans identified to be distressed at the loan level. The projected cash flows of each loan are discounted along stochastic risk-free rate paths and are inclusive of an Option Adjusted Spread (OAS), derived from current internal pricing on new loans, along with the best observable inputs. The valuation as at 31 December 2021 reflects illiquidity premiums between 20 and 30bps.\n\nOther debt securities which are not traded in an active market amount to \u00a399m (2020: \u00a3115m). They have been valued using third party or counterparty valuations, and these prices are considered to be unobservable due to infrequent market transactions.\n\n## Investment property\n\nLevel 3 investment property amounting to \u00a310,150m (2020: \u00a38,475m) is valued with the involvement of external valuers. All property valuations are carried out in accordance with the latest edition of the Valuation Standards published by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, and are undertaken by appropriately qualified valuers as defined therein. Whilst transaction evidence underpins the valuation process, the definition of market value, including the commentary, in practice requires the valuer to reflect the realities of the current market. In this context valuers must use their market knowledge and professional judgement and not rely only upon historic market sentiment based on historic transactional comparables.\n\nThe valuation of investment properties also includes an income approach that is based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts, where the uplift and discount rates are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions. These inputs are deemed unobservable. The valuation as at 31 December 2021 reflects equivalent yield ranges between 1% and 13% and ERV between \u00a31 and \u00a3338 per sq.ft.\n\nThe table below shows investment property by sector.\n\n|                                 | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Retail                          | 1,025     | 999       |\n| Leisure                         | 482       | 440       |\n| Distribution                    | 1,552     | 1,142     |\n| Office space                    | 4,223     | 3,703     |\n| Industrial and other commercial | 1,767     | 1,588     |\n| Accommodation                   | 1,101     | 603       |\n| Total                           | 10,150    | 8,475     |",

The table below shows the impact of applying these sensitivities on the fair value of Level 3 assets as at 31 December 2021. Further disclosure on how these sensitivities have been applied can be found in the descriptions following the table.\n\n|                           |                     | Sensitivities            | Sensitivities            |\n|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                           | Fair value  2021 \u00a3m | Positive impact  2021 \u00a3m | Negative impact  2021 \u00a3m |\n| Lifetime mortgages        | 6,857               | 234                      | (365)                    |\n| Private credit portfolios | 16,304              | 921                      | (921)                    |\n| Investment property       | 10,150              | 961                      | (793)                    |\n| Other investments 1       | 3,713               | 301                      | (269)                    |\n| Total Level 3 assets      | 37,024              | 2,417                    | (2,348)                  |\n\nThe sensitivities are not a function of sensitising a single variable relating to the valuation of the asset, but rather a function of flexing multiple factors often at individual asset level. The following sets out a number of key factors by asset type, and how they have been flexed to derive reasonable alternative valuations.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nKey assumptions used in the valuation of Lifetime mortgage assets are listed in Note 10(iii)(a) and sensitivities are applied to each assumption to arrive at the overall sensitised values in the above table. The most significant sensitivity by value is +/-10% instant reduction in property valuation across the portfolio which, applied in isolation produces sensitised values of \u00a3133m and \u00a3(271)m.\n\n## Private credit portfolios\n\nThe sensitivity in the private credit portfolio has been determined through a method which estimates investment spread value premium differences as compared to the institutional investment market. Individual investment characteristics of each holding, such as credit rating and duration are used to determine spread differentials for the purposes of determining alternate values. Spread differentials are determined to be lower for highly rated and/or shorter duration assets as compared to lower rated and/or longer duration assets. A significant component of the spread differential is in relation to the selection of comparator bonds, which is the potential difference in spread of the basket of relevant comparators determined by respective investors. If we were to take an AA rated asset it may attract a spread differential of 15bps on the selection of comparator bonds as opposed to 40bps for a similar duration BBB rated asset. Applied in isolation the sensitivity used to reflect the spread in comparator bond selection results in sensitised values of \u00a3339m and \u00a3(339)m.\n\n## Investment property\n\nInvestment property holdings are valued by independent valuers on the basis of open market value as defined in the appraisal and valuation manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). As such, sensitivities are calculated through a mixture of asset level and portfolio level methodologies which make reference to individual investment characteristics of the holding but do not flex individual assumptions used by the independent expert in valuing the holdings. Each method is applied individually and aggregated with equal weighting to determine the overall sensitivity determined for the portfolio. One method is similar to that used in the private credit portfolio as it determines the impact of an alternate property yield determined in reference to credit ratings, remaining term and other characteristics of each holding. In this methodology we would apply a lower yield sensitivity to a highly rated and/or shorter remaining term asset compared with a lower rated and/or longer remaining term asset. If we were to take an AA rated asset with remaining term of 25 years in normal market conditions this would lead to a 15bps yield flex (as opposed to a 35bps yield flex for a BBB rated asset with 30 year remaining term). The methodology which leads to the most significant sensitivity at the balance sheet date is related to an example in case law where it was found that an acceptable margin of error in a valuation dispute is 10% either way, subject to the valuation being undertaken with due care. If this sensitivity were to be taken without a weighting it would produce sensitised values of \u00a3708m and \u00a3(708)m.\n\nIt should be noted that some sensitivities described above are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.",

The group uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures. The group uses hedge accounting, provided the prescribed criteria in IAS 39, 'Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement' are met, to recognise the offsetting effects of changes in the fair value or cash flow of the derivative instrument and the hedged item. The group's principal uses of hedge accounting are to:\n\n- (i) Defer in equity the changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as the hedge of a future cash flow attributable to a recognised asset or liability, a highly probable forecast transaction, or a firm commitment until the period in which the future transaction affects profit or loss or is no longer expected to occur; and\n- (ii)   Hedge the fair value movements in loans due to interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations. Any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n- (iii)  Hedge a net investment in a foreign operation: a hedge of the exposure to the currency risk of a net investment in a foreign entity.\n\nThe relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, are documented at the inception of the transaction. The effectiveness of the hedge is documented and monitored on an ongoing basis. Hedge accounting is only applied for highly effective hedges (between 80% and 125% effectiveness) with any ineffective portion of the gain or loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the current year.\n\nCertain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.\n\nWhere the risks and characteristics of derivatives embedded in other contracts are not closely related to those of the host contract and the whole contract is not carried at fair value, the derivative is separated from that host contract and measured at fair value, with fair value movements reflected within investment return, unless the embedded derivative itself meets the definition of an insurance contract.\n\nCash inflows and outflows are presented on a net basis where the group is required to settle net or has a legally enforceable right of offset and the intention is to settle on a net basis.\n\n## Forward foreign exchange contracts - net investment hedges\n\nThe group hedges part of the foreign exchange translation exposure on its net investment in certain overseas subsidiaries, using forward foreign exchange contracts. It recognises the portion of the gain or loss which is determined in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, along with the gain or loss on translation of the foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Other derivative contracts - held for trading\n\nThe group uses certain derivative contracts which are effective hedges of economic exposures in accordance with the group's risk management policy, but for various reasons are not designated within a formal hedge accounting relationship. Therefore, these contracts must be designated as held for trading, and gains and losses on these contracts are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.",

Other receivables include amounts receivable from brokers and clients for investing activities, collateral pledges, unsettled cash, FX spots and other sundry balances.\n\n## (i) Receivables under finance leases\n\nThe group leases certain investment properties to third parties. Under these agreements, substantially all the risks and reward incidental to ownership are transferred to the lessee; therefore the contracts have been classified as finance leases. At the lease commencement date, the group derecognises the investment property asset and recognises a receivable asset on its balance sheet to reflect the net investment in the lease, equal to the present value of the lease payments. The group recognises finance income over the lease term to reflect the rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\nThe group acts as a lessor of certain finance leases, which have a weighted average duration to maturity of 31 years as at 31 December 2021. The counterparties, as lessee, are regarded to be the economic owner of the leased assets.\n\nThe future minimum lease payments under the arrangement, together with the present value, are disclosed below:\n\n|               |   Total future payments 2021 \u00a3m | Unearned interest income 2021 \u00a3m   |   Present value 2021 \u00a3m |   Total future payments 2020 \u00a3m | Unearned interest income 2020 \u00a3m   |   Present value 2020 \u00a3m |\n|---------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Within 1 year |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (6)                                |                       4 |\n| 1-2 years     |                              11 | (5)                                |                       6 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 2-3 years     |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |                              11 | (5)                                |                       6 |\n| 3-4 years     |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| 4-5 years     |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |                              10 | (5)                                |                       5 |\n| After 5 years |                             200 | (57)                               |                     143 |                             210 | (62)                               |                     148 |\n| Total         |                             251 | (82)                               |                     169 |                             261 | (88)                               |                     173 |",

The largest United States dollar currency exposures relate to the group's US business, Legal & General America. The majority of currency exposures relating to euros are held by Legal & General Investment Management (Europe) Limited, a subsidiary of Legal & General Investment Management (Holdings) Limited. The group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the group's business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.\n\nBusinesses aim to maintain sufficient assets in local currency to meet local currency liabilities, however movements may impact the value of the group's consolidated shareholders' equity which is expressed in sterling. This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits. These exposures are managed by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the group's regulatory capital requirements by currency. Currency borrowings and derivatives may be used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the group held 5% (2020: 14%) of its total equity attributable to shareholders in currencies, mainly United States dollar and euro, other than the functional currency of the relevant business unit. The exchange risks inherent in these exposures may be mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts.\n\nConsistent with the group's accounting policies, the profits of overseas business units (reported as functional currencies) are translated at average exchange rates and the net assets (reported as functional currencies) at the closing rate for the reporting period. A 10% increase (weakening of foreign currencies) or decrease (strengthening of foreign currencies) in these rates would increase or reduce the profit for the year and net assets as follows:\n\n|                                            | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in USD:GBP exchange rate   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | 2021  \u00a3m                                  | 2020  \u00a3m                                  | 2021  \u00a3m                                  | 2020  \u00a3m                                  |\n| Profit for the year 1                      | (2)                                       | 18                                        | 3                                         | (22)                                      |\n| Net assets attributable to USD exposures 1 | (19)                                      | (80)                                      | 23                                        | 98                                        |\n\n|                                            | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% increase in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   | A 10% decrease in EUR:GBP exchange rate   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | 2021  \u00a3m                                  | 2020  \u00a3m                                  | 2021  \u00a3m                                  | 2020  \u00a3m                                  |\n| Profit for the year 1                      | (1)                                       | -                                         | 1                                         | -                                         |\n| Net assets attributable to EUR exposures 1 | (39)                                      | (73)                                      | 47                                        | 90                                        |",

If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement. There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset. Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of assets held at amortised cost or fair value of assets classified as available for sale.\n\nThe table below includes assets at FVTPL and held at amortised cost, which provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets which have been impaired and the ageing analysis of financial assets which are past due but not impaired. Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not exposed to the risks from unit linked policies.",

In particular, there is little significant overlap between the long-term and short-term insurance business written by the group. However, there are potentially material correlations of insurance risk with other types of risk exposure. The group's capital model seeks to measure risk correlations particularly those that would tend to be more acute as the underlying risk scenarios become more extreme. An example of the accumulation of risk is the correlation between reinsurer credit risk with mortality and morbidity exposures.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risk is defined as loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or external events. Potential for exposure to operational risk extends to all the group's businesses. The group has constructed a framework of internal controls to minimise material loss from operational risk events recognising that no system of internal control can completely eliminate the risk of error, financial loss, fraudulent action or reputational damage.",

Other non-UK businesses do not constitute a material component of the group's operations and consideration of geographically determined assumptions is therefore not included.\n\nThe group seeks to make prudent assumptions about future experience based on current market conditions and recent experience. Assumptions incorporate prudent margins in excess of our best estimate assumptions to reduce the possibility of actual experience being less favourable than assumed.\n\n## (i) Mortality and morbidity\n\nMortality and morbidity assumptions for the UK business are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI), a subsidiary of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, and/or UK death registrations. US assumptions are set with reference to standard tables drawn up by the American Academy of Actuaries. Assumptions include an appropriate allowance for prudence. Tables are based on industry-wide mortality and morbidity experience for insured lives.\n\nThe group conducts statistical investigations of its mortality and morbidity experience, the majority of which are carried out at least annually. Investigations determine the extent to which the group's experience differs from that underpinning the standard tables, and suggest appropriate adjustments which need to be made to the valuation assumptions.\n\nThe higher mortality experience observed in 2020 and 2021 as a result of Covid-19 is considered to be exceptional and, due to insufficient certainty in more recent data, long-term mortality assumptions have not been revised to reflect this experience. Certain short-term allowances continue to be made for higher mortality expected in the short term.\n\nIn most cases, mortality rates are set separately for sex and smoker status, and the percentage of mortality table will vary for the first 2-5 years of the policy's duration to allow for underwriting selection.\n\n| Mortality tables                           | 2021                                                                          | 2020                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-linked individual assurance business   |                                                                               |                                                                              |\n| UK term assurances 1                       | 99%-101% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                      | 99%-101% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                     |\n| UK term assurances with terminal illness 1 | 63%-95% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                       | 63%-95% TM08/TF08 Sel 5                                                      |\n| UK term assurances with critical illness 2 | 107%-159% ACL08 Sel 2                                                         | 107%-159% ACL08 Sel 2                                                        |\n| US term assurances 3                       | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                         | Adjusted SOA 2014 VBT                                                        |\n| Whole of Life Protection Plan 4            | Bespoke Tables based on TM08/TF08,  PCMA00/PCFA00 and UK death  registrations | Bespoke Tables based on TM08/TF08,  AM92/AF92 and UK death registrations     |\n| Whole of Life over 50 4                    | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15 and  Whole of Life Protection Plan assumptions  | Bespoke Tables based on ELT15 and  Whole of Life Protection Plan assumptions |\n| Annuity business                           |                                                                               |                                                                              |\n| UK Annuities in deferment 5                | 70.9%-81.1% PNMA00/PNFA00                                                     | 71.9%-81.9% PNMA00/PNFA00                                                    |\n| UK Vested annuities 6                      |                                                                               |                                                                              |\n| Pension risk transfer                      | 71.6%-81.1% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                     | 72.7%-81.9% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                    |\n| Other annuities                            | 59.3%-98.4% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                     | 57.6%-105.1% PCMA00/PCFA00                                                   |\n| US annuities 7                             | Bespoke tables based on RP-2014  Healthy Annuitant Total table                | Bespoke tables based on RP-2014  Healthy Annuitant Total table               |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## (ii) Valuation rates of interest and discount rates\n\nThe valuation interest rate used to discount the cash flows for the purpose of valuing insurance contract liabilities is based on the yield on the assets backing the contract.\n\nFor annuity business, an explicit allowance for risk is deducted from the yield. The allowance for risk comprises long-term assumptions about defaults on a prudent basis or, in the case of lifetime mortgage assets, a prudent expectation of losses arising from the No Negative Equity Guarantee. These allowances vary by asset category and for some asset classes by rating. The allowance for risk for government backed bonds equated to 9bps (2020: 9bps) and 43bps for corporate bonds and direct investments (2020: 45bps). This is equivalent to a default provision of \u00a33.4 billion at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a33.5 billion). For lifetime mortgage business, the allowance for risk in respect of lifetime mortgage assets is equivalent to \u00a30.6 billion at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a30.6 billion).\n\nFor UK assurance business, a change in methodology was introduced in 2021, to allow for an illiquidity premium in the valuation interest rate calculation. Different rates apply depending on whether the liabilities are positive or negative. An appropriate valuation interest rate is applied at all times during the projection, i.e. when liabilities switch from being negative to positive the valuation interest rate will also switch from being high to low. The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level.\n\nFor US assurance business, the valuation interest rate is derived by combining the risk free yield curve (based on US Treasuries) plus a risk adjusted spread addition based on the portfolio of assets LGA invest in. It includes prudent adjustments for default and reinvestment risk.\n\n| Rate of interest/discount rates   | 2021             | 2020             |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| UK Life assurances                | 1.40%-2.52% p.a. | 0.72%-2.24% p.a. |\n| UK Pension assurances             | 1.40%-2.52% p.a. | 0.25%-2.15% p.a. |\n| US Life assurances                | 1.20%-3.80% p.a. | 0.80%-2.40% p.a. |\n| UK Annuities - Fixed              | 1.78% p.a.       | 1.28% p.a.       |\n| UK Annuities - Index Linked       | (1.88%) p.a.     | (1.85%) p.a.     |\n| US annuities                      | 2.62% p.a.       | 2.29% p.a.       |\n\n## (iii) Persistency\n\nThe group monitors its persistency experience and carries out detailed investigations annually. Persistency experience can be volatile and past experience may not be an appropriate future indicator.\n\nThe group tries to balance past experience and potential future conditions by making prudent assumptions about expected long-term average persistency levels.\n\nWhere explicit persistency assumptions are not made, prudence is also incorporated into the liabilities by ensuring that they are sufficient to cover the more onerous of the two scenarios where the policies either remain in-force until maturity or where they discontinue at the valuation date.\n\nFor UK term assurance business, the margin acts to increase the best estimate lapse rate in the early part of a policy's lifetime (when it is treated as an asset) but to reduce the best estimate lapse rate later in the policy's lifetime (when it is treated as a liability). The crossover point at which the margin changes direction is assessed for broad product groups but applied at a policy by policy level. Any liability to reinsurers on discontinuance within the first four years from inception is allowed for explicitly in the cash flows, using the valuation lapse basis, together with a prudent allowance for clawback of commission from agents upon lapse.\n\nFor US term assurance, a single margin is used across guaranteed period durations for a given policy. All US term assurance contracts are assumed to lapse at the end of the guaranteed period. Policies past the guaranteed period as of the valuation date are assumed to lapse on the next premium due date.\n\n| Lapse rates                             | 2021       | 2020       |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| UK Level term                           | 1.6%-34.5% | 2.3%-25.7% |\n| UK Decreasing term                      | 5.3%-18.0% | 6.1%-14.6% |\n| UK Accelerated critical illness cover   | 2.6%-37.3% | 2.6%-26.4% |\n| Pensions term                           | 2.3%-3.8%  | 2.3%-3.8%  |\n| Whole of Life (conventional non profit) | 0.5%-6.1%  | 0.5%-6.1%  |\n| US term - 10 year guarantee period      | 5.7%-6.5%  | 5.7%-6.5%  |\n| US term - 15 year guarantee period      | 3.4%-4.6%  | 3.4%-4.6%  |\n| US term - 20 year guarantee period      | 2.4%-4.9%  | 2.4%-4.9%  |\n| US term - 30 year guarantee period      | 1.7%-5.2%  | 1.7%-5.2%  |\n| US Universal Life                       | 1.9%       | 1.9%       |\n\n## (iv) Expenses\n\nThe group monitors its expense experience and carries out detailed investigations regularly to determine the expenses incurred in writing and administering the different products and classes of business. Adjustments may be made for known future changes in the administration processes, in line with the group's business plan, as well as for changes in allocations. An allowance for expense inflation in the future is also made in line with RPI, taking account of both salary and price information. The expense assumptions and expense inflation assumption include an appropriate allowance for prudence.",

The group pre-tax profit and equity impacts may arise from asset and/or liability movements under the sensitivities. The current disclosure reflects management's view of key risks in current economic conditions.\n\nIn calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged. In practice, items of the group's experience may be correlated.\n\nThe sensitivity analyses do not take into account management actions that could be taken to reduce the impacts. The group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position. A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities. The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.\n\nThe sensitivity of profit to changes in assumptions may not be linear. They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.\n\nThe change in interest rate stress assumes a 100 basis point increase and a 50 basis point decrease in the gross redemption yield on fixed interest securities together with the same change in the real yields on variable securities. Valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields, adjusted to allow for prudence calculated in a manner consistent with the base results.\n\nThe inflation stress adopted is a 0.5% per annum (p.a.) increase in inflation, resulting in a 0.5% p.a. reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield. In addition, the expense inflation rate is increased by 0.5% p.a.\n\nIn the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress above.\n\nThe equity stresses are a 25% rise and 25% fall in listed equity market values.\n\nThe property stresses adopted are a 15% rise and 15% fall in property market values including lifetime mortgages. Rental income is assumed to be unchanged. Where property is being used to back liabilities, valuation interest rates move with property yields, and so the value of the liabilities will also move.\n\nThe credit default assumption is set based on the credit rating of individual bonds and their outstanding term using Moody's global credit default rates. The credit default stress assumes a +/-10bps stress to the current unapproved credit default assumption, which will have an impact on the valuation interest rates used to discount liabilities. Other credit default allowances are unchanged. All lifetime mortgages are excluded, as their primary exposure is to property risk, and therefore captured under the property stress above.",

In addition, given the uncertain nature of the risks from climate change, and the lack of historical data to support decision making, a specific scenario testing approach over a longer term time horizon has been developed by the group to manage the risks from climate change. To understand our exposures and how these risks may emerge we have developed climate scenario modelling capabilities. Possible climate pathways and their impact are considered in the climate scenario analysis detailed in the 2021 Climate Report (TCFD).\n\n## 20 Insurance contract liabilities\n\nInsurance contracts are contracts which transfer significant insurance risk to the insurer at the inception of the contract. This is the case if, and only if, an insured event could cause an insurer to make significant additional payments in any scenario, other than a scenario which lacks commercial substance. Such contracts remain insurance contracts until all rights and obligations are extinguished or expire. Contracts can be reclassified as insurance contracts after inception if insurance risk becomes significant. Any contracts not considered to be insurance contracts under IFRS are classified as investment contracts.\n\n## Long-term insurance\n\nDeath claims are accounted for on notification of death. Surrenders for non-linked policies are accounted for when payment is made. Critical illness claims are accounted for when admitted. All other long-term claims and surrenders are accounted for when payment is due. Claims payable include the direct costs of settlement.\n\nThe change in the insurance liability reflects the reduction in liabilities as claims are paid throughout the year, offset by liabilities arising from new business. The movement also reflects changes in expectations of future claims payments and expenses, plus changes in valuation interest rates, as set out in Note 18.\n\nUnder current IFRS requirements, insurance contract liabilities are measured using local Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), as permitted by IFRS 4, 'Insurance Contracts'.\n\nFor non-participating insurance contracts, the liabilities are calculated on the basis of current information using the gross premium valuation method. This brings into account the full premiums receivable under contracts written, having prudent regard to expected lapses and surrenders, estimated renewal and maintenance costs, and contractually guaranteed benefits. For unit linked insurance contract liabilities the provision is based on the fund value together with an allowance for any excess of future expenses over charges where appropriate.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nThe group's insurance subsidiaries cede insurance premiums and risk in the normal course of business in order to limit the potential for losses and to provide financing. Outwards reinsurance premiums are accounted for in the same accounting period as the related premiums for the direct or inwards reinsurance business being reinsured. Reinsurance assets include balances due from reinsurers for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy. Reinsurance is recorded as an asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless a right of offset exists, in which case the associated liabilities are reduced commensurately.\n\nContracts with reinsurers are assessed to determine whether they contain significant insurance risk. Contracts that do not give rise to significant transfer of insurance risk to the reinsurer are considered to be financial reinsurance and are accounted for and disclosed in a manner consistent with financial instruments.",

Unit linked borrowings are excluded from the analysis above as the risk is retained by policyholders.\n\nThe maturity profile above is calculated on the basis that a facility to refinance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related. If refinancing under the group's credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassified as repayable between one and five years.\n\nUndiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.\n\n## Syndicated Credit Facility\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the group had in place a \u00a31bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in December 2024. No amounts were outstanding at 31 December 2021.",

Where the group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benefits to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.\n\nThe group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and overseas. The assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds which are subject to regular actuarial valuations every three years, updated by formal reviews at reporting dates. The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be consistent or more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19, 'Employee Benefits' reporting.\n\nThe liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, provided any surplus in the Fund and Scheme is not restricted. Plan assets exclude the insurance contracts issued by the group. The defined benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows. The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.\n\nThe group pays contractual contributions in respect of defined contribution schemes. The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payments is available.\n\n## (i) Analysis of provisions\n\n|                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Other provisions               | 213       | 123       |\n| Retirement benefit obligations | 1,025     | 1,165     |\n| Provisions                     | 1,238     | 1,288     |\n\n## (ii) Other provisions\n\nIncluded within Other provisions are amounts relating to new and existing M&A and restructuring transactions. In 2021, the group announced that Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) is extending its existing partnership with State Street, to increase the use of Charles River technology across the front office and to deliver middle office services going forward.\n\nAs a result of this announcement, in line with the requirements of IAS 37, 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets', a provision was recognised, which reflects the costs that LGIM is committed to incur in order to implement the new arrangement. These costs include the transfer of data and operations to State Street, as well as the implementation of the new operating model. The amounts included in the provision have been determined on a best estimate basis by reference to a range of plausible scenarios, taking into account the multi-year implementation period for the project. As at 31 December 2021, the outstanding provision was \u00a389m.",

Savings Plan (US); and\n- \u00b7 CALA defined contribution pension scheme.\n\nContributions of \u00a382m (2020: \u00a375m) were made during the year in respect of defined contribution schemes.\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe group operates the following defined benefit pension schemes in the UK and overseas:\n\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund (the Fund). The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995; the latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 was completed on 1 July 2020. The triennial valuation at 31 December 2021 is in progress;\n- \u00b7 Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme). The Scheme was, with a few exceptions (principally transfers from the Fund), closed to new members from August 2000 and finally closed to new members from April 2007; the latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 was completed on 1 July 2020. The triennial valuation at 31 December 2021 is in progress;\n- \u00b7 Legal & General America Inc. Cash Balance Plan (US); the last full actuarial valuation was as at 31 December 2021; and\n- \u00b7 CALA Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme (UK). This scheme closed to new members from 31 December 2007 and closed to future accrual on 31 December 2018; the last triennial actuarial valuation was as at 6 April 2018. The triennial valuation at 6 April 2021 is in progress.\n\nThe UK defined benefit schemes operate within the UK pensions' regulatory framework.\n\nCertain of the following disclosures have only been presented in relation to the Fund and Scheme, as they represent the most significant defined benefit scheme obligations.\n\nThe UK Fund and Scheme were closed to future accrual on 31 December 2015. As part of this arrangement, payments to the Fund and Scheme in respect of future accruals ceased from this date and were replaced with a company contribution payment of between 5% and 15% into a defined contribution arrangement. In addition, as part of the closure, the company will contribute an additional \u00a33m per annum until 31 December 2024 towards the deficit.\n\nThe assets of all UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds to meet long-term pension obligations to past and present employees. Trustees are appointed to the schemes and have a responsibility to act in the best interest of the scheme beneficiaries. The trustees' long-term objectives are to minimise the risk that there are insufficient assets to meet the liabilities of the scheme over the longer term, control the on-going operational costs of the schemes and to maximise investment returns for the beneficiaries within an acceptable level of risk.\n\nThe total number of members of the Fund and Scheme was:\n\n|                    | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employed deferreds | 79     | 93     |\n| Deferreds          | 2,782  | 2,960  |\n| Pensioners         | 3,791  | 3,723  |\n| Total              | 6,652  | 6,776  |\n\nThe group works closely with the trustees to develop an investment strategy for each UK scheme in order to meet the long-term objectives of the trustees as noted above.\n\nCertain parts of the liabilities of the Fund and Scheme are secured by way of annuities purchased from the group. These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes, but at 31 December 2021 the value of these annuities, on an IAS 19 basis, was \u00a3990m (2020: \u00a31,051m).\n\nThe remainder of the liabilities of the Fund and Scheme are secured by cash or by the way of Assured Payment Policies (APPs), purchased from the group to match the majority of future expected cash flows of the remaining members of the Fund and Scheme. The APPs are recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes, and their value is included in the table summarising the plan assets. The APPs aim to match the changes in the value of the liabilities due to changes in economic factors, namely interest rates, credit spreads and inflation. The APPs do not aim to match changes in the value of liabilities due to the actual mortality experience of members being different from the assumptions made in the valuation basis.\n\nThe Fund and Scheme expose the group to a number of risks:\n\n| Risk                              | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Uncertainty in   benefit payments | The value of the group's liabilities for post-retirement benefits will ultimately depend on the amount of benefits paid out. This in turn will primarily depend  on the level of inflation and how long individuals live.                                                                                          |\n| Volatility in   asset values      | The group is exposed to future movements in the values of assets held in the Fund and Scheme to meet future benefit payments.                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Uncertainty in   cash funding     | Movements in the values of the obligations or assets may result in the group being required to provide higher levels of cash funding, although changes  in the level of cash required can often be spread over a number of years. In addition, the group is also exposed to adverse changes in pension regulation. |",

        "page_content": "These risks are managed within the risk appetite of the Fund and Scheme. The sensitivity of the net obligations to changes in any of the variables are monitored and action is taken if any risk moves outside of the appetite.\n\nFull actuarial valuations are carried out for the Fund and Scheme every three years, updated by formal reviews at each anniversary date between. The actuarial assumptions used in the triennial valuation would normally be more prudent than those used for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting. The latest triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 was completed on 1 July 2020, and the 31 December 2021 triennial valuation is underway. Where the Fund or Scheme are in deficit following the triennial valuations, the group and the trustee agree a deficit recovery plan. Both the Fund and Scheme have formal deficit recovery plans which aim to eliminate the deficits over a certain period of time. The triennial valuation at 31 December 2018 showed a total funding deficit for both the Fund and Scheme of \u00a3541m. As a result of this, a recovery plan was agreed of \u00a377m per annum from 1 January 2019 to 30 June 2020, \u00a398m per annum from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2024 and a one-off catch-up payment of \u00a333m by 31 July 2020.\n\nThe Fund and Scheme liabilities have an average duration of 17.8 years (2020: 19.0 years) and 16.9 years (2020: 18.4 years) respectively. The expected undiscounted benefits payments to members of the Fund and Scheme, including pensions in payment secured by annuities purchased from the group, are shown in the unaudited chart below:\n\n## Undiscounted benefit payments\n\nProjected benefit payments (\u00a3m)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe benefits paid from the defined benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees' final pensionable salary for each year of credited service. The group has no liability for retirement benefits other than for pensions. The Fund and Scheme account for all of the UK and over 90% of worldwide assets of the group's defined benefit schemes.\n\nThe principal actuarial assumptions for the Fund and Scheme are set out below. In 2021, the calculation of IAS 19 defined benefit obligations was performed within the group, having previously been performed by an external consultancy. The methodology underlying the assumption setting has remained unchanged, but for inflation and mortality improvements, assumptions have been set consistently with assumptions used in the calculation of other insurance liabilities within the group. The overall impact of this change to assumptions is a small increase in defined benefit obligation.\n\nThe higher mortality experience observed in 2021 as a result of Covid-19 is considered to be exceptional, and long-term mortality assumptions have not been revised to reflect this experience.\n\n|                                                            |   Fund and Scheme 2021 % |   Fund and Scheme 2020 % |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Rate used to discount liabilities                          |                     1.84 |                     1.25 |\n| Rate of increase in pensions in payment (pre-2006 service) |                     3.79 |                     3.59 |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions (pre-2006 service)   |                     3.97 |                     3.63 |\n| Rate of general inflation (RPI)                            |                     3.49 |                     2.97 |",

A premium of \u00a382m (2020: \u00a350m) was paid from the assets of the Fund and the Scheme to purchase these annuities. These annuities are not recognised as an asset for IAS 19 purposes and so the actuarial remeasurement recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes allowance for this premium payment as well as annuity receipts over 2021 of \u00a353m (2020: \u00a353m).",

The effect is shown on the defined benefit obligation, net of annuities and the APP assets. Sensitivities are broadly symmetrical, but larger sensitivities are not necessarily proportionate. In 2021, a large APP asset was purchased by the Fund, significantly reducing the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to movements in discount rates and inflation.\n\n|                                     | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| 1 year increase in life expectancy  | (76)      | (92)      |\n| 0.1% p.a. decrease in discount rate | (6)       | (27)      |\n| 0.1% p.a. increase in RPI and CPI   | (3)       | (14)      |\n\nThe fair value of the plan assets at the end of the year is made up as follows:\n\n|                           | Valuation based on   quoted market price   | Valuation based on   quoted market price   | Valuation based on other  than quoted market price   | Valuation based on other  than quoted market price   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2021    | Fund and  Scheme \u00a3m                        | CALA Homes  and Overseas \u00a3m                | Fund and  Scheme \u00a3m                                  | CALA Homes  and Overseas \u00a3m                          |\n| Equities                  | -

The inputs for these models include a range of factors which are deemed to be observable, including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, period to maturity, correlations, yield curves and volatility of the underlying instruments.\n\nRepurchase agreements are valued based on the discounted cash flows expected to be paid, using an observable market interest rate, in line with the value of the underlying security.\n\nCollateral repayable on short position reverse repurchase agreements and other financial liabilities balances, including FX spots, broker and other payables, are measured at amortised cost. The carrying value of these liabilities approximates their fair value.\n\nTrail commission represents a liability for the present value of future commission costs on distribution agreements with intermediaries, recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract. At each subsequent reporting date the liability is remeasured, with changes reflected in profit or loss.\n\n|                                                | 2021 \u00a3m   | 2020 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Derivative liabilities                         | 15,718    | 23,208    |\n| Repurchase agreements 1                        | 46,331    | 53,853    |\n| Other financial liabilities 2                  | 12,215    | 14,881    |\n| Total payables and other financial liabilities | 74,264    | 91,942    |\n| Due within 12 months                           | 53,250    | 65,316    |\n| Due after 12 months                            | 21,014    | 26,626    |\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\n| As at 31 December 2021                         | Total \u00a3m   | Level 1 \u00a3m   | Level 2 \u00a3m   | Level 3 \u00a3m   | Amortised  cost\u00b9 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|\n| Derivative liabilities                         | 15,718     | 331          | 15,316       | 71           | -                     |\n| Repurchase agreements                          | 46,331     | -            | 46,331       | -            | -                     |\n| Other financial liabilities                    | 12,215     | 5,438        | 55           | -            | 6,722                 |\n| Total payables and other financial liabilities | 74,264     | 5,769        | 61,702       | 71           | 6,722                 |\n\n| As at 31 December 2020                         | Total \u00a3m   | Level 1 \u00a3m   | Level 2 \u00a3m   | Level 3 \u00a3m   | Amortised cost\u00b9 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------|\n| Derivative liabilities                         | 23,208     | 300          | 22,826       | 82           | -                    |\n| Repurchase agreements                          | 53,853     | -            | 53,853       | -            | -                    |\n| Other financial liabilities 2                  | 14,881     | 7, 4 3 8     | 29           | 11           | 7, 4 0 3             |\n| Total payables and other financial liabilities | 91,942     | 7,738        | 76,708       | 93           | 7, 4 0 3             |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## 25 Leases\n\nThe group leases offices, vehicles, IT equipment and investment properties under non-cancellable operating lease agreements. The group has elected to make use of the recognition exemptions as permitted by the standard in respect of short-term leases (lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less), and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value. Such leases are not recognised on the consolidated balance sheet but the group recognises the associated lease payments as an expense over the lease term.\n\nAs a lessee, the group recognises leases on the balance sheet as 'right-of-use' assets and lease liabilities. The right-of-use assets are either classified as property, plant and equipment or investment property.\n\nThe right-of-use assets' value is initially recognised as the calculated value of the lease liabilities, initial direct costs and incentives received. The right-of-use assets are subsequently accounted for in accordance with the cost model in IAS 16, 'Property, Plant and Equipment' or as investment property under IAS 40, 'Investment Property'. The group also assesses right-of-use assets classified as property, plant and equipment for impairment when such indicators exist.\n\nThe initial measurement of the lease liabilities is made up of the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, including fixed lease payments and excluding lease incentive receivables. The group uses the incremental borrowing rate as a discount rate for calculating the lease liabilities. The lease liabilities are unwound over the term of the lease giving rise to an interest expense. Additionally, the liabilities are reduced when lease payments are made. The group reassesses the carrying amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets if certain events occur that modify the original assumptions used to calculate the lease balances upon initial recognition.\n\nExtension and termination options are included in various leases across the group. These are generally used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the group and not by the respective lessor.\n\nThe table below describes the nature of the group's leasing activities by type of right-of-use asset recognised on balance sheet within property, plant and equipment: 1\n\n| Carrying amount                      | Office   buildings 2021  \u00a3m   | IT 2021   \u00a3m   | Vehicles  2021  \u00a3m   | Total 2021   \u00a3m   | Office   buildings 2020  \u00a3m   | IT 2020   \u00a3m   | Vehicles 2020   \u00a3m   | Total 2020   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------|\n| As at 1 January                      | 167                           | 35             | 3                    | 205               | 189                           | 46             | 3                    | 238               |\n| Additions                            | 14                            | -              | -                    | 14                | 7                             | 1              | 1                    | 9                 |\n| Depreciation for the period          | (23)                          | (13)           | (2)                  | (38)              | (27)                          | (12)           | (1)                  | (40)              |\n| Disposals                            | (1)                           | -              | -                    | (1)               | -                             | -              | -                    | -                 |\n| Decrease due to currency translation | -                             | -              | -                    | -                 | (2)                           | -              | -                    | (2)               |\n| As at 31 December                    | 157                           | 22             | 1                    | 180               | 167                           | 35             | 3                    | 205               |\n\nThe maturity profile of lease liabilities is presented in the table below.

Extension and termination options are included in various leases across the group and are used to maximise operational flexibility in terms of managing the assets used in the group's operations. The majority of extension and termination options held are exercisable only by the group and not by the respective lessor.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the group had committed to no additional leases which had not yet commenced (2020: committed to no additional leases).\n\nIncome from sub-leasing right-of-use assets is presented within Investment return (see Note 29).\n\n## 26 Management of capital resources Solvency II\n\nThe Solvency II financial information in this note is estimated and unaudited.\n\nThe group calculates its Solvency II capital requirements using a Partial Internal Model. The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Partial Internal Model basis approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA). Capital requirements for a few smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The group's US insurance businesses and Legal & General Reinsurance Company No. 2 (L&G Re 2 - a new subsidiary incorporated in 2021) are valued on a local statutory basis, following the PRA's approval to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.\n\nThe table below shows the group Own Funds, Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Surplus Own Funds, based on the Partial Internal Model, Matching Adjustment and Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP) (recalculated as at 31 December 2021). The TMTP incorporates impacts of 31 December 2021 economic conditions and changes during 2021 to the Internal Model and Matching Adjustment. This is in line with the group's management of the capital position on a dynamic TMTP basis.\n\nIn previous years, the capital position was shown on a 'shareholder view', where the contribution from the final salary pension schemes was excluded from the group position. The impact of excluding the contribution is now less than 1% and so the results below, which are on a proforma basis, include the impact of the final salary pension schemes. The 2020 results have been adjusted to be consistent with 2021.\n\nThe group is required to measure and monitor its capital resources on a regulatory basis and to comply with the minimum capital requirements of regulators in each territory in which it operates. At a group level, Legal & General has to comply with the requirements established by the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, and on the above basis, the group had a surplus of \u00a38,185m (31 December 2020: \u00a37,436m) over its Solvency Capital Requirement, corresponding to a Solvency II capital coverage ratio of 187% (31 December 2020: 175%).

Solvency II Own Funds do not include an accrual for the final dividend of \u00a3790m (31 December 2020: \u00a3754m) declared after the balance sheet date.\n\n## Capital management policies and objectives\n\nThe group aims to manage its capital resources to maintain financial strength, policyholder security and relative external ratings advantage. The group also seeks to maximise its financial flexibility by maintaining strong liquidity and by utilising a range of alternative sources of capital including equity, senior debt, subordinated debt and reinsurance.\n\n## Capital measures\n\nThe group measures its capital on a number of different bases, including those which comply with the regulatory frameworks within which the group operates and those which the directors consider most appropriate for managing the business. The measures used by the group include:\n\n## Accounting and Economic bases\n\nManagement use financial information prepared on both an IFRS and Economic Capital basis to manage capital and cash flow usage and to determine dividend paying capacity.\n\nThe group maintains a risk-based capital model that is used to calculate the group's Economic Capital position and support the management of risk within the group. This modelling framework, suitably adjusted for regulatory constraints, also meets the needs of the Solvency II regime. Our Economic Capital model has not been reviewed by the Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), nor will it be.\n\n## Regulatory bases\n\nThe financial strength of the group's insurance subsidiaries is measured under various local regulatory requirements (see below).\n\n## Basis of regulatory capital and corresponding regulatory capital requirements\n\nIn each country in which the group operates, the local insurance regulator specifies rules and guidance for the minimum amount and type of capital which must be held by insurance subsidiaries in excess of their insurance liabilities. The minimum capital requirements have been maintained at all times throughout the year. This helps to ensure that payments to policyholders can be made as they fall due.\n\nThe required capital is calculated by either assessing the additional assets which would be required to meet the insurance company's liabilities in specified, stressed financial conditions, or by applying fixed percentages to the insurance company's liabilities and risk exposures. The requirements in the different jurisdictions in which the group operates are detailed below:\n\n## Group regulatory basis\n\nThe group is required to comply with the Solvency II capital requirements calculated using the group's Partial Internal Model. The vast majority of the risk to which the group is exposed is assessed on the Internal Model basis approved by the PRA. The group capital requirements for a handful of smaller entities are assessed using the Standard Formula basis on materiality grounds. The group's capital requirements in respect of its US insurance businesses and Legal & General Reinsurance Company No. 2 (L&G Re 2) are valued on a local statutory basis, following PRA approval of the group's application to use the Deduction and Aggregation method of including these businesses in the group solvency calculation.\n\n## UK regulatory basis\n\nAt the balance sheet date, required capital for the life business was based on the Solvency II Framework Directive, as adopted by the PRA. All material EEA insurance firms, including Legal and General Assurance Society Limited, and Legal and General Assurance (Pensions Management) Limited (LGIM's insurance subsidiary) are required to hold eligible own funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement, calculated on an Internal Model basis. These firms, as well as the non-EEA insurance firm (Legal & General Reinsurance Company Limited (LGRe) based in Bermuda) contribute over 93% of the group's SCR.\n\n## US regulatory basis\n\nRequired capital is determined to be the Company Action Level Risk Based Capital (RBC) based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners RBC model. RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations, taking into account its size and risk profile. The calculation is based on applying factors to various asset, premium, claims, expense and reserve items, with higher factors used for those items with greater underlying risk and lower factors for less risky items.",

        "page_content": "## Balance sheet management continued\n\n## 26 Management of capital resources continued\n\nSolvency II continued\n\nBermudan regulatory basis\n\nBermudan regulated insurers are required to hold sufficient capital to meet 120% of the Bermudan Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR). The BSCR model follows a standard formula framework; capital attributed to each risk is calculated by applying specified stresses to the assets and liabilities. The individual risk elements (excluding operational risk) are combined using a covariance matrix and then added to an operational risk charge.\n\n## 27 Disposals\n\nDuring 2021, the group made the following disposals, the impacts of which are recognised in other operational income in the Consolidated Income Statement:\n\n- \u00b7 On 3 August 2021, the group entered into a 15 year joint venture arrangement with NatWest Group Pension Trustee Limited (NWPTL), the defined benefit pension scheme of NatWest Group, in order to invest up to \u00a3500m of equity into later living communities which will be developed and operated by Inspired Villages Group, a group subsidiary. As part of the transaction, the group sold a 50% stake in the entities which own the portfolio of property sites to NWPTL for \u00a3127m, and its interest in such entities reduced from 100% to 50%. This resulted in a change of control for a number of subsidiaries, which have been deconsolidated and are now equity accounted. The group has recognised a pre-tax gain on disposal, net of transaction costs, of \u00a323m, which includes \u00a313m related to the portion of the gain attributable to remeasuring the remaining interests to fair value as at the date of the transaction.\n- \u00b7 On 2 November 2021, the group completed the disposal of its 10% stake in Current Health Limited to Best Buy for \u00a330m, which resulted in a pre-tax gain on disposal, net of transaction costs, of \u00a321m.\n- \u00b7 On 3 November 2021, the group completed the disposal of its 50% stake in Peel Holdings (Media) Limited (MediaCity) to LandSec for \u00a3141m, which resulted in a pre-tax gain on disposal, net of transaction costs, of \u00a37m.",

        "page_content": "## Additional /financial information\n\n## 28 Segmental analysis\n\nThe group provides a segmental analysis to enhance the understanding of the financial statements.\n\nUnder the requirements of IFRS 8, 'Operating segments', operating and reportable segments are presented in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker, which has been identified as the Board of Legal & General Group Plc.\n\nIn 2021, the group operated five core businesses across four reportable segments that are continuing operations, with Legal & General Retirement Retail (LGRR) and Legal & General Retirement Institutional (LGRI) combined into a single segment for reporting purposes, being Legal & General Retirement.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022, the group has announced changes to the business unit responsibilities within the Executive Committee. Andrew Kail will become the Chief Executive Officer of LGRI, succeeding Laura Mason who has previously moved to become CEO of Legal & General Capital (LGC). Our two retail businesses, LGRR and LGI, will come together under the leadership of Bernie Hickman. As noted on page 14 of the strategic report, this will enable the creation of a single interface for the group's UK retail customers.\n\nAs a result of these changes, from 1 January 2022 the group will align its reportable segments to the five core businesses, comprising LGRI, LGRR, LGI, LGIM, and LGC. Group central expenses and debt costs will continue to be reported separately.\n\nIn 2021, management of the Workplace Savings business has transferred from LGIM to LGRR, where it complements their retirement solutions offering and retail customer focus. The change in reporting structure has no impact on the profit or loss, or net assets, of the group. To enable comparison, segmental information for prior year has been restated accordingly.\n\nIn 2020, continuing operations exclude the results of the Mature Savings business, the sale of which was completed on 7 September 2020.\n\nReporting of assets and liabilities by reportable segment has not been included, as this is not information that is provided to key decision makers on a regular basis. The group's asset and liabilities are managed on a legal entity rather than reportable segment basis, in line with regulatory requirements.\n\nFinancial information on the reportable segments is further broken down where relevant in order to better explain the drivers of the group's results.\n\n## (i) Profit/(loss) for the year\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2021                     | LGR 1 \u00a3m   | LGIM 1 \u00a3m   | LGC \u00a3m   | LGI \u00a3m   | Group  expenses and  debt costs 2 \u00a3m   | Total  continuing  operations \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)                        | 1,506      | 422         | 461      | 268      | (395)                                  | 2,262                              |\n| Investment and other variances                          | 242        | (11)        | 19       | 111      | (128)                                  | 233                                |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -          | -           | -        | -        | (7)                                    | (7)                                |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 1,748      | 411         | 480      | 379      | (530)                                  | 2,488                              |\n| Tax (expense)/credit attributable to equity holders     | (276)      | (79)        | (93)     | (59)     | 62                                     | (445)                              |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 1,472      | 332         | 387      | 320      | (468)                                  | 2,043                              |\n\n| For the year ended 31 December 2020                     | LGR 1 \u00a3m   | LGIM 1 \u00a3m   | LGC \u00a3m   | LGI \u00a3m   | Group  expenses and  debt costs 2 \u00a3m   | Total  continuing  operations \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted operating profit/(loss)                        | 1,728      | 407         | 275      | 189      | (415)                                  | 2,184                              |\n| Investment and other variances                          | 15         | 1           | (299)    | (459)    | 24                                     | (718)                              |\n| Losses attributable to non-controlling interests        | -          | -           | -        | -        | (36)                                   | (36)                               |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax attributable to equity holders | 1,743      | 408         | (24)     | (270)    | (427)                                  | 1,430                              |\n| Tax (expense)/credit attributable to equity holders     | (228)      | (65)        | (8)      | 58       | 94                                     | (149)                              |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                              | 1,515      | 343         | (32)     | (212)    | (333)                                  | 1,281                              |\n\n- 2.

        "page_content": "## Additional /financial information continued\n\n## 28 Segmental analysis continued\n\n## (ii) Revenue\n\nRevenue comprises of the following:\n\n## Net premiums earned\n\nRevenue from insurance and investment contracts has been described in section (e) of this Note.\n\n## Investment return\n\nInvestment return has been described in Note 29 of this report.\n\n## Fees from fund management and investment contracts*\n\nThe group generates revenue from acting as the investment manager for clients. Fees charged on investment management services are based on the contractual fee arrangements applied to assets under management and recognised as revenue as the services are provided.\n\nThe group's income from investment contracts is primarily derived from fees for administration and managing of funds in pension plans. Revenue generated on investment contracts is recognised as services are provided. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price. In the instances of performance fees where revenue is subject to meeting a certain performance threshold, such revenue is not recognised until the condition has been met, and it is highly probable that no significant reversal of amounts would occur. Variable costs directly related to securing new contracts are capitalised and amortised over the estimated period over which the revenue is earned.\n\nTransaction fees are charged to implement trades for clients. Such fees are charged at the time the transaction takes place and are based on the size of the underlying contract.\n\n## House building*\n\nHouse building revenue arises from the sale of residential properties and land, and is recognised net of discounts and sales incentives. Sales of private houses are recognised on legal completion. Following the implementation of IFRS 15, 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers', the sale proceeds of part exchange properties are also included in revenue. Sales of social housing, where multiple units are developed and sold under a contractual agreement with a single customer, typically a housing association, are recognised over time in accordance with construction progress. Sales of land and commercial property are recognised on unconditional exchange, namely when contracts are exchanged or missives concluded and, where appropriate, construction is complete. The transaction price is determined using extensive research and expert judgement, current market values and regional variations.\n\nWarranties are provided on all properties and range from 2-10 years. Due to their features, these do not represent separate performance obligations.\n\n## Professional services fees*\n\nThe group's professional services fees revenue arises from professional services provided by employed surveyors and third party providers, panel management fees and administration fees. These fees are based on fee scales or contracts. Revenue is recognised when the service has been rendered.\n\nIn addition, the group derives professional fees from facilitation of mortgage arrangements and related products such as conveyancing. These are based on an agreement/contract and could be Tiered based on volume. The obligation in such instances is satisfied on completion of the mortgage/service, at which point the revenue is recognised. There is no significant judgement applied on the timing or amount of fee recognised.\n\n## Insurance broker*\n\nFees are charged on each performance obligation offered to the customer as per agreed structure. Revenue for placement services is recognised at the point in time when the intermediary has satisfied its performance obligation, that is when the terms of the insurance policy have been agreed contractually by the insurer and policyholder, and the insurer has a present right to payment from the policyholder. No significant judgements are applied on the timing or transaction price.\n\n- *  Contracts are either expected to last one year or less, or reflect the right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of the performance completed to date. As permitted under IFRS 15, the transaction price allocated to any unsatisfied contracts is not disclosed.",

        "page_content": "## Additional /financial information continued\n\n## 30 Tax\n\nThe tax shown in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income comprises current and deferred tax.\n\n## Current tax\n\nCurrent tax comprises tax payable on current year profits, adjusted for non-tax deductible or non-taxable items, and any adjustments to tax payable in respect of previous periods. Current tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement unless it relates to items which are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or directly in equity.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is calculated on differences between the accounting value of assets and liabilities and their respective tax values. Deferred tax is also recognised in respect of unused tax losses to the extent it is probable that future taxable profits will arise against which the losses can be utilised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income or charged or credited directly in equity.\n\n## Tax attributable to policyholders and equity holders\n\nThe total tax expense shown in the group's Consolidated Income Statement includes income tax borne by both policyholders and equity holders. This has been split between tax attributable to policyholders' returns and equity holders' profits. Policyholder tax comprises the tax suffered on policyholder investment returns, while equity holder tax is corporation tax charged on equity holder profit. The separate presentation is intended to provide more relevant information about the tax that the group pays on the profits that it makes.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nTax balances include the use of estimates and assumptions which affect items reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Income Statement. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current circumstances and future events and actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\nFor tax this includes the determination of assets and liabilities recognised in respect of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of future taxable income supporting deferred tax asset recognition.\n\nAs the group operates internationally, it is exposed to uncertain tax positions and changes in legislation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The assessment of uncertain tax positions is subjective and significant management judgement is required. This judgement is based on interpretation of legislation, management experience and professional advice. The directors have assessed the group's uncertain tax positions and are comfortable that the provisions in place are not material individually or in aggregate, and that a reasonable possible alternative outcome in the next financial year would not have a material impact to the results of the group.\n\n## Tax rates\n\nThe table below provides a summary of the standard corporate income tax rates of the main territories we operate in.\n\n|         | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------|--------|--------|\n| UK      | 19.0%  | 19.0%  |\n| USA     | 21.0%  | 21.0%  |\n| Bermuda | 0.0%   | 0.0%   |\n| Ireland | 12.5%  | 12.5%  |",

Liabilities of operations classified as held for sale relate to the Mature Savings business, the sale of which completed on 7 September 2020.\n- 3.   Overseas deferred tax liability is wholly comprised of US balances as at 31 December 2020.\n- 4.   The US deferred tax liability of \u00a340m in respect of US bond contracts has been reclassified from Accounting provisions and other to Realised and unrealised gains on investments. The net impact on the total balance is \u00a3nil.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax assets\n\nThe group has the following unrelieved tax losses and deductible temporary differences carried forward as at 31 December 2021. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these as at 31 December 2021 (or 31 December 2020), as it is not probable that there will be suitable taxable profits emerging in future periods against which to relieve them. These tax assets will only be recognised if it becomes probable that suitable taxable profits will arise in future periods.\n\n|                                                  |   Gross 2021 \u00a3m |   Tax 2021 \u00a3m |   Gross 2020 \u00a3m |   Tax 2020 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|---------------|\n| Trading losses 1                                 |             172 |            36 |             190 |            31 |\n| Capital losses                                   |              74 |            19 |              70 |            13 |\n| Excess management expense                        |               9 |             2 |              60 |            12 |\n| Unrelieved interest payments on debt instruments |              14 |             4 |              14 |             3 |\n| Unrecognised deferred tax assets\u00b2                |             269 |            61 |             334 |            59 |\n\n- 1.

        "page_content": "## 33 Share-based payments\n\nThe fair value at the date of grant of the equity instrument is recognised as an expense, spread over the vesting period of the instrument. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. At each balance sheet date, the group revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments which are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment is made to equity. On vesting or exercise, the difference between the expense charged to the income statement and the actual cost to the group is transferred to retained earnings. Where new shares are issued, the proceeds received are credited to share capital and share premium.\n\n## (i) Description of plans\n\nThe group provides a number of equity settled share-based long-term incentive plans for directors and eligible employees.\n\nThe Savings Related Share Option Plan (ShareSave) allows employees to enter into a regular savings contract over three and/or five years, coupled with a corresponding option over shares of the group. The grant price is equal to 80% of the quoted market price of the group shares on the invitation date. Fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes model.\n\nNil Cost Options can be granted to senior managers under the Performance Share Plan (PSP), based upon individual and company performance. Pre the 2014 award, the number of performance shares transferred to the individual at the end of the three year vesting period was dependent on the group's relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR). New performance conditions attached to awards from 2014 result in the number of options that vest being equally dependent on the group's relative TSR and Earnings per Share (EPS)/Dividend per Share (DPS) growth. In addition, the awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds over three, four and five years. Further changes were made to the performance conditions for awards granted in 2018. The number of options that vest in respect of these awards is equally dependent on the group's relative TSR and EPS growth (subject to Solvency II objectives). The majority of awards vest after the end of the three year performance period and become exercisable in thirds in year three, four and five. Awards granted to Executive Directors and Persons Delivering Managerial Responsibilities vest after three years but any options that vest will not become exercisable until year five.\n\nThe Share Bonus Plan (SBP) awards conditional shares, restricted shares, combined awards of CSOP options and restricted shares and combined awards of CSOP options and nil-paid options. Recipients of restricted shares are entitled to both vote and receive dividends. Fair value is calculated as the market value on the grant date, adjusted to reflect the eligibility for dividend payments. Conditional Share awards, which include awards to Executive Directors, do not have voting or dividend rights.\n\nUnder the HMRC tax-advantaged Employee share plan (ESP), UK employees may elect to purchase group shares from the market at the prevailing market price on a monthly basis. The group supplements the number of shares purchased by giving employees one free matching share for every one share purchased up to the first \u00a320 of the employees' contributions and one free matching share for every two shares purchased with contributions between \u00a320 and \u00a3125. There is currently no match on contributions between \u00a3125 and \u00a3150. From time to time, the group may make an award of free shares. Both the free and matching shares must be held in trust for three years. The fair value of awarded shares is equal to the market value on award date.\n\nThe weighted average fair value of options and awards granted during the year, estimated by using Monte Carlo simulations were 61.9p and 197.3p for the SAYE options and PSP awards respectively.\n\nThe fair values of the share awards made during the year have been calculated using the following assumptions:\n\n| Award date                              | SAYE 09 April 2021   | PSP 13 April 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Weighted average share price (pence)    | 296.4                | 294.2               |\n| Weighted average exercise price (pence) | 230.0                | n/a                 |\n| Expected volatility                     | 38%                  | 44%                 |\n| Expected life                           | 3 - 5 years          | 3 - 5 years         |\n| Risk free investment rate               | 0.13 - 0.36%         | 0.09%               |\n| Dividend yield                          | 7.7%                 | 6.0%                |",

It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if:\n\n- \u00b7 there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms; and\n- \u00b7 the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the group exchanging a fixed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.\n\nWhere any group entity purchases the company's equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders. Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.

The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity. During the year coupon payments of \u00a328m were made (2020: \u00a37m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to shareholders. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the Issuer at the prevailing conversion price.\n\nThe notes are treated as restricted Tier 1 own funds for Solvency II purposes.\n\n## 36 Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent third party interests in direct equity investments, including private equity, which are consolidated in the group's results.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, non-controlling interests primarily represent third party ownership in Thorpe Park Holdings, a mixed residential/commercial retail space in which the group holds 50%.\n\nNo other individual non-controlling interest is considered to be material on the basis of the year end carrying value or share of profit or loss.\n\n## 37 Other liabilities\n\n|                         |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Accruals                |       454 |       410 |\n| Deferred income         |        26 |         2 |\n| Other                   |       445 |       344 |\n| Total other liabilities |       925 |       756 |\n| Due within 12 months    |       887 |       715 |\n| Due after 12 months     |        38 |        41 |\n\n## 38 Reconciliation of assets under management to Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\n|                                                                                | 2021 \u00a3bn   | 2020 \u00a3bn   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Assets under management\u00b9                                                       | 1,421      | 1,279      |\n| Derivative notionals\u00b9 ,  \u00b2                                                     | (383)      | (340)      |\n| Third party assets\u00b9 ,  \u00b3                                                       | (480)      | (419)      |\n| Other\u00b9 ,  4                                                                    | 7          | 33         |\n| Total financial investments, investment property and cash and cash equivalents | 565        | 553        |\n\n- 1.

Contributions to the post-employment defined benefit plans were \u00a3109m (31 December 2020: \u00a3137m) for all employees.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 and 31 December 2020 there were no loans outstanding to officers of the company.\n\nThe aggregate compensation for key management personnel, including executive and non-executive directors, is as follows:\n\n|                                       |   2021 \u00a3m |   2020 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Salaries                              |        10 |         8 |\n| Share-based incentive awards          |         5 |         5 |\n| Key management personnel compensation |        15 |        13 |\n\n## (ii) Services provided to and by related parties\n\nAll transactions between the group and associates, joint ventures and other related parties during the year are on commercial terms which are no more favourable than those available to companies in general.\n\nLoans and commitments to related parties are made in the normal course of business.\n\nThe group has entered into the following material related party transactions during the year:\n\n- \u00b7 Annuity contracts issued by Legal and General Assurance Society Limited for consideration of \u00a382m (2020: \u00a350m) have been purchased by the group's UK defined benefit pension schemes, priced on an arm's length basis.\n- \u00b7 The Legal & General Group UK Pension and Assurance Fund (the Fund) completed an Assured Payment Policy (APP) transaction with Legal and General Assurance Society Limited (LGAS), a group company. An APP is an investment contract product sold by LGR which, issued to a pension scheme, provides the scheme with a fixed or inflation linked schedule of payments to match the scheme's expected liabilities. In June 2021, \u00a3925m was paid by the Fund to LGAS, and LGAS and the Fund recognised an investment contract liability and an APP plan asset of the same amount, respectively.\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, LGAS recognised a liability related to this APP transaction with the Fund of \u00a3882m which is included in the group's non-participating investment contract liabilities. Following a similar transaction in 2020 between the Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme (the Scheme) and LGAS, a further \u00a3332m (2020: \u00a3396m) is included in the group's non-participating investment contract liabilities as at 31 December 2021. The Fund and Scheme hold transferable plan assets of the same amounts which do not eliminate on consolidation.\n\n- \u00b7 Loans outstanding from related parties at 31 December 2021 of \u00a315m (2020: \u00a389m), with a further commitment of \u00a32m.\n- \u00b7 The group has total other commitments of \u00a31,158m to related parties (2020: \u00a31,207m), of which \u00a3726m has been drawn at 31 December 2021 (2020: \u00a3772m).\n\n## 40 Contingent liabilities, guarantees and indemnities\n\nProvision for the liabilities arising under contracts with policyholders is based on certain assumptions. The variance between actual experience from that assumed may result in those liabilities differing from the provisions made for them. Liabilities may also arise in respect of claims relating to the interpretation of policyholder contracts, or the circumstances in which policyholders have entered into them. The extent of these liabilities is influenced by a number of factors including the actions and requirements of the PRA, FCA, ombudsman rulings, industry compensation schemes and court judgments.\n\nVarious group companies receive claims and become involved in actual or threatened litigation and regulatory issues from time to time. The relevant members of the group ensure that they make prudent provision as and when circumstances calling for such provision become clear, and that each has adequate capital and reserves to meet reasonably foreseeable eventualities. The provisions made are regularly reviewed. It is not possible to predict, with certainty, the extent and the timing of the financial impact of these claims, litigation or issues.\n\nGroup companies have given warranties, indemnities and guarantees as a normal part of their business and operating activities or in relation to capital market transactions or corporate disposals. Legal & General Group Plc has provided indemnities and guarantees in respect of the liabilities of group companies in support of their business activities including Pension Protection Fund compliant guarantees in respect of certain group companies' liabilities under the group pension Fund and Scheme. Legal and General Assurance Society Limited has provided indemnities, a liquidity and expense risk agreement, a deed of support and a cash and securities liquidity facility in respect of the liabilities of group companies to facilitate the group's matching adjustment reorganisation pursuant to Solvency II.",

A complete list of the group's subsidiaries, associates, joint ventures and significant holdings is provided in Notes 42 and 43.\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities (including special purpose entities, mutual funds and unit trusts) over which the group directly or indirectly has the power to govern the operating and financial policies in order to gain economic benefits. Profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired during the year are included in the consolidated results up to the date of disposal or from the date of gaining control. The interests of parties, other than the group, in investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, are classified as liabilities and appear as 'Net asset value attributable to unit holders' in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The basis by which subsidiaries are consolidated in the group financial statements is outlined in the basis of preparation (Note 1).\n\nThe particulars of the company's subsidiaries, mutual funds and partnerships that have been consolidated as at 31 December 2021 are listed below. The main territory of operation of subsidiaries incorporated in England and Wales is the UK. For overseas subsidiaries the principal country of operation is the same as the country of incorporation. All subsidiaries have a 31 December year end reporting date and are 100% owned, unless stated otherwise. The registered office of all subsidiaries in England and Wales is One Coleman Street, London EC2R 5AA, United Kingdom, and in Ireland is Dillon Eustace, 33 Sir John Rogerson's Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland, unless otherwise noted. All subsidiaries are held through intermediate holding companies unless noted that they are held direct by the company. Subsidiaries that are consolidated where the group owns less than 50% of the ordinary share capital, are consolidated based on an assessment of control normally arising from special rights attaching to the class of share owned, other contractual arrangements and factors such as the purpose of the investee, the nature of its relevant activities, voting rights (including potential voting rights) and substantive and protective rights.\n\nThe group reassesses the appropriateness of the consolidation of an investee whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there has been a change in the relationship between the group and the investee which affects control.",

The group has interests in investment vehicles which, depending upon their status, are classified as either consolidated or unconsolidated structured entities as described below:\n\n- \u00b7 Debt securities, consisting of traditional asset backed securities, together with securitisation and debentures and Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs);\n- \u00b7 Investment funds, largely being unit trusts; and\n- \u00b7 Specialised investment vehicles, analysed between Irish Collective Asset-management Vehicles (ICAVs), Open Ended Investment Companies (OEICs), Societes d'Investissement a Capital Variables (SICAVs), Specialised Investment Funds (SIFs), Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund (QIAIF), Liquidity funds, Common Contractual Fund (CCF), ICAVs, and Property unit trusts.\n\nAll of the group's holdings in the above vehicles are subject to the terms and conditions of the respective investment vehicle's offering documentation and are susceptible to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of those investment vehicles. The investment manager makes investment decisions after extensive due diligence of the underlying investment vehicle, including consideration of its strategy and the overall quality of the underlying investment vehicle's manager.\n\nAll of the investment vehicles in the investment portfolio are managed by portfolio managers who are compensated by the respective investment vehicles for their services. Such compensation generally consists of an asset-based fee and a performance related incentive fee, and is reflected in the valuation of the investment vehicles.\n\n## (a) Interests in consolidated structured entities\n\nThe group has determined that where it has control over an investment vehicle, that investment is a consolidated structured entity. The group has not provided, and has no intention to provide, financial or other support to any other structured entities which it does not consolidate.\n\n## (b) Interests in unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAs part of its investment activities, the group also invests in unconsolidated structured entities. As at 31 December 2021, the group's interest in such entities reflected on the group's Consolidated Balance Sheet and classified as financial investments held at fair value through profit or loss was \u00a321,216m (2020: \u00a316,230m).

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of land and buildings and derivative financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit and loss.\n\nThere were no material critical accounting estimates used or judgements made by management in the preparation of these financial statements.\n\nThe following exemptions from the requirements of IFRS have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements, in accordance with FRS 101:\n\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2, 'Share-based payment' (details of the number and weighted-average exercise price of share options, and how the fair value of goods or services received was determined).\n- \u00b7 The requirement of paragraphs 91 to 99 of IFRS 13, 'Fair value measurement', where equivalent disclosures are included in the consolidated financial statements of the group.\n- \u00b7 The following paragraphs of IAS 1, 'Presentation of financial statements':\n- -10(d), (statement of cash flows),\n- -10(f) and 40A (presentation of a third balance sheet),\n- -16 (a statement of compliance with all IFRS),\n- -38 in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) (outstanding shares comparative),\n- -38A (requirement for minimum of two primary statements, including cash flow statements),\n- -38B-D (additional comparative information),\n- -111 (cash flow statement information), and\n- -134-136 (capital management disclosures);\n- \u00b7 IAS 7, 'Statement of cash flows';\n- \u00b7 IFRS 7, 'Financial Instrument Disclosures';\n- \u00b7 Paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8, 'Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors' (requirement for the disclosure of information when an entity has not applied a new IFRS that has been issued but is not yet effective);\n- \u00b7 The requirements in IAS 24, 'Related party disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group and key management compensation.\n\nThe company's financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Section 394 and 396 of the Companies Act 2006 adopting the exemption of omitting the income statement conferred by Section 408 of that Act.\n\nThe company's financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. See Note 1 of the group consolidated financial statements for further information on the Directors' assessment of the going concern basis.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nOn initial recognition, financial assets are measured at fair value. Subsequently, they can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). The classification depends on two criteria:\n\n- (i)  the business model within which financial assets are managed; and\n- (ii) their contractual cash flow characteristics (whether the cash flows represent 'solely payments of principal and interest' (SPPI)).\n- A debt instrument is measured at amortised cost if it meets the following conditions:\n- (i)  it is held within a business model that has an objective to hold financial assets to collect contractual cash flows; and\n- (ii) the contractual terms of the financial asset result in cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI).\n- A debt security is measured at FVOCI if it meets the following conditions:\n- (i)  it is held for collection of contractual cash flows and for selling the financial assets; and\n- (ii) the asset's cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\nMovements in the carrying amount are recognised in other comprehensive income except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses and interest revenue which are recognised in the income statement. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\nAssets that are held at FVTPL include derivative assets which are held for trading (HFT) and financial assets that fail both the business model and SPPI tests. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVTPL is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe company has no equity instruments other than investments in subsidiaries.\n\nLoans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently held at amortised cost using the effective interest method.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment\n\nFor financial assets held at amortised cost or FVOCI the company reviews the carrying value of its assets at each balance sheet date. For such assets, the company determines forward looking expected credit losses (ECL), based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive. The shortfall is then discounted at an approximation to the asset's original effective interest rate.\n\nThe company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs, except for debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date and other debt securities for which credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. In these cases, ECLs are based on the 12-month ECL, which is the ECL that results from a possible default up to 12 months after the reporting date. The company uses relevant quantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on historical experience, and informed credit assessment including forward-looking information in order to evaluate the credit-worthiness of each security at each reporting date, to determine whether a significant increase in credit risk since origination occurred. Should this be the case, the allowance will be based on the lifetime ECL.\n\nECLs are calculated by considering the probability of default (PD), the loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). The PD is determined by reference to third party information on available companies, or using qualitative information available to the company, and depends on whether a financial asset requires determination of a 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL. The LGD is determined with reference to any exposure reducing instruments such as collateral or liquid assets that the counterparty may have. The EAD is determined as the amount of the loan balance outstanding at the reporting date.\n\n## Investment income\n\nInvestment income includes dividends and interest. Dividends receivable from group companies are recognised in the period in which the dividends are declared and approved at the general meeting or paid. Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\n## Distributions\n\nDividend distribution to the company's shareholders is recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the company.\n\n## Interest expense\n\nInterest expense reflects the underlying cost of borrowing, based on the effective interest method and includes payments and receipts made under derivative instruments which are amortised over the interest period to which they relate.\n\n## Investment in subsidiary undertakings\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are held at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe company's activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The company uses derivatives such as foreign exchange forward contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.\n\nChanges in the fair value of any derivative instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Borrowings\n\nBorrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs. Borrowings classified as liabilities are subsequently stated at amortised cost. The difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the borrowing period using the effective interest method.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.\n\nA net deferred tax asset is recognised as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying temporary differences can be deducted.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items are maintained at historic rates. Exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Company /financial statements continued\n\n## 1 Accounting policies continued\n\n## Pension costs\n\nThe company participates in the group defined benefit schemes, which are defined benefit plans that share risks between entities under common control. There is no contractual agreement or stated policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for the plans as a whole to individual group entities, therefore the company's cost of participation has been treated as that of defined contribution schemes for reporting purposes. The net defined benefit cost has been recognised in the separate financial statements of Legal & General Resources Limited, the sponsoring employer for the plans.\n\nIn addition to these schemes the company also contributes to defined contribution schemes. The company charges the costs of its pension schemes against profit as incurred. Any difference between the cumulative amounts charged against profits and contribution amounts paid is included as a provision or prepayment in the balance sheet.\n\nThe assets of the defined benefit schemes and the defined contribution schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds, which have been subject to regular valuation every three years and updated by formal reviews at reporting dates by qualified actuaries.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe company operates a number of share-based payment plans on behalf of its subsidiaries. Full disclosure of these plans is given in Note 33 of the group consolidated financial statements. The costs associated with these plans are borne by all the participating group businesses where they relate to their employees and, where relevant, the company bears an appropriate charge. As the majority of the charge to the company relates to awards and options issued to the directors, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors' report on remuneration, no further disclosure is provided here.\n\n## 2 Dividends\n\n|                                                            | Dividend 2021 \u00a3m   | Per share 2021 p   | Dividend 2020 \u00a3m   | Per share 2020 p   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Ordinary dividends paid and charged to equity in the year: |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| Final 2019 dividend paid in June 2020                      | -                  | -                  | 754                | 12.64              |\n| Interim 2020 dividend paid in September 2020               | -                  | -                  | 294                | 4.93               |\n| Final 2020 dividend paid in June 2021                      | 754                | 12.64              | -                  | -                  |\n| Interim 2021 dividend paid in September 2021               | 309                | 5.18               | -                  | -                  |\n| Total dividends                                            | 1,063              | 17.82              | 1,048              | 17.57              |\n| Ordinary share dividend proposed 1                         | 790                | 13.27              | 754                | 12.64              |\n\n## 3 Directors' emoluments and other employee information\n\nFull disclosures of Legal & General Group Plc directors' emoluments are contained within those parts of the Directors' Report on Remuneration which are described as having been audited.

The notes are callable at par between 24 March 2031 and 24 September 2031 (the First Reset Date) inclusive and every 5 years after the First Reset Date. If not called, the coupon from 24 September 2031 will be reset to the prevailing five year benchmark gilt yield plus 5.378%.\n\nThe notes have no fixed maturity date. Optional cancellation of coupon payments is at the discretion of the issuer and mandatory cancellation is upon the occurrence of certain conditions. The Tier 1 notes are therefore treated as equity and coupon payments are recognised directly in equity. During the year coupon payments of \u00a328m were made (2020: \u00a37m). The notes rank junior to all other liabilities and senior to equity attributable to shareholders. On the occurrence of certain conversion trigger events the notes are convertible into ordinary shares of the Issuer at the prevailing conversion price.\n\nThe notes are treated as restricted Tier 1 own funds for Solvency II purposes.",

The Company's Articles of Association were last amended at its Annual General Meeting held on 20 May 2021.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with the Companies Act 2006, the Board has adopted a policy and procedure for the disclosure and authorisation (if appropriate) of conflicts of interest, and these have been followed during 2021.\n\n## Powers of directors\n\nThe directors (as detailed on pages 62 to 63) may exercise all powers of the Company subject to applicable legislation and regulation and the Company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Appointment and replacement of directors\n\nWith regards to the appointment and replacement of directors, the Company is governed by its Articles of Association, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation. Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of the Company or by the Board, in each case subject to the provisions of the Company's Articles of Association. The Company may, by way of special resolution, remove any director before the expiration of that director's period of office. The Company's Articles of Association (in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code) require all the directors to retire from office at each Annual General Meeting of the Company.\n\n## Share capital\n\nAs at 31 December 2021, the Company's issued share capital comprised 5,970,415,817 ordinary shares each with a nominal value of 2.5 pence. Details of the ordinary share capital can be found in Note 34 to the group consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, the Company was granted authority by shareholders to purchase up to 596,759,391 ordinary shares, being 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2021. In the year to 31 December 2021, no shares were purchased by the Company. This authority will expire at the 2022 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.\n\nAt the 2021 AGM, the directors were given the power to allot shares up to an amount of \u00a349,729,949, being 33% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2021. This authority will also expire at the 2022 AGM. As such, a resolution is proposed in the Notice of AGM seeking shareholder approval to renew this authority.\n\nFurther resolutions are proposed, as set out in the Notice of AGM, that will, if approved by shareholders, authorise the directors to issue shares up to the equivalent of 10% of the company's issued share capital as at 31 March 2022 for cash without offering the shares first to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings.\n\nDetailed explanatory notes to these resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM.\n\nOther than the above, the directors have no current intention of issuing further share capital and no issue will be made which would effectively alter control of the company without prior approval of shareholders in a general meeting.\n\n## Interests in voting rights\n\nInformation on major interests in shares provided to the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) of the UK Listing Authority is published via a Regulatory Information Service and on the Company's website: www.legalandgeneralgroup.com. As at 31 December 2021, the Company had been advised of the following significant direct and indirect interests in the issued share capital of the Company:\n\n|                | Number  of ordinary  shares of 2.5p   |   % of   capital 1 | Total   interest  in issued  share capital   |\n|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| BlackRock Inc. | 298,315,445                           |              5     | Indirect                                     |\n| RBC            | 181,825,498                           |              3.045 | Indirect                                     |\n\nNo material changes to the interests have been disclosed between 31 December 2021 and 4 March 2022.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe Company may, by ordinary resolution in a general meeting, declare dividends in accordance with the respective rights of the members, but no dividend can exceed the amount recommended by the Board. The directors propose a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2021 of 13.27 pence per ordinary share which, together with the interim dividend of 5.18 pence per ordinary share paid to shareholders on 20 September 2021, will make a total dividend for the year of 18.45 pence (2020: 17.57 pence). Subject to shareholder approval at the AGM, the final dividend will be paid on 1 June 2022 to shareholders on the share register on 22 April 2022 provided that the Board may cancel payment of the dividend at any time prior to payment in accordance with the Articles of Association, if it considers it necessary to do so for regulatory capital purposes.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nDetails of related party transactions are set out in Note 39 to the group consolidated financial statements.",

Under the Companies Act 2006 and the Articles of Association, directors have the power to suspend voting rights and, in certain circumstances, the right to receive dividends in respect of shares where the holder of those shares fails to comply with a notice issued under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe Board can decline to register a transfer of any share which is not a fully paid share. In addition, registration of a transfer of an uncertificated share may be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules and where the number of joint holders exceeds four. The Board may also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless:\n\n- a)  the instrument of transfer is duly stamped and is left at the Company's registered office or such other place as the Board may from time to time determine, accompanied by the certificate for the share to which it relates and such evidence as the Board may reasonably require to show the right of the transfer or to make the transfer.\n- b)  the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of share; and\n- c)  the number of joint holders does not exceed four.\n\nSubject to the provisions of the Companies Act 2006, all or any of the rights attaching to an existing class of shares may be varied from time to time, either with the consent in writing of the holders of not less than three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class (excluding any treasury shares) or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of those shares.\n\nShares acquired through the employee share plans rank equally with all other ordinary shares in issue. Zedra Trust Company (Guernsey) Limited, as trustee of the Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust, held 0.69% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 4 March 2022 in trust for the benefit of the executive directors, senior executives and employees of the group. The trustee of Legal & General Employees' Share Ownership Trust has waived the right of that trust to receive dividends on unallocated shares it holds. The voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the trustee. The trustee may vote or abstain from voting, or accept or reject any offer relating to shares, in any way it sees fit, without incurring any liability and without being required to give reasons for its decision. Under the rules of the Legal & General Group Employee Share Plan (the 'Plan'), eligible employees are entitled to acquire shares in the Company. Plan shares are held in trust for participants by Link Market Services Trustees Limited, which held 0.28% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 4 March 2022. Voting rights are exercised by the trustees on receipt of the participants' instructions. If a participant does not submit an instruction to the trustees, no vote is registered. In addition, the trustees do not vote on any unallocated  shares held in the trust.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders which may result in restrictions on the transfer of securities and/or voting rights.\n\n## Change of control\n\nThere are no agreements between the Company and its directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment (whether through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) in the event of a takeover bid, except for those relating to normal notice periods. The rules of the Company's share plans contain provisions under which options and awards to participants, including executive directors, may vest on a takeover or change of control of the Company or transfer of undertaking. The Company has a committed \u00a31 billion bank syndicated credit facility which is terminable if revised terms cannot be agreed with the syndicate of banks in a 30-day period following a change of control. As at 8 March 2022, the Company has no borrowings under this facility. There is no change of control conditions in the terms of any of the company's outstanding debt securities. The terms of the Company's agreements with its banking counterparties, under which derivative transactions are undertaken, include in some instances the provision for termination of transactions upon takeover/ merger depending on the rating of the merged entity. The Company does not have any other committed banking arrangements, either drawn or undrawn, which incorporate any unilateral change of control conditions.\n\n## Use of financial instruments\n\nInformation on the group's risk management process is set out on pages 52 to 59. More details on risk management and the financial instruments used are set out in Notes 15 to 17 of the group consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Indemnities\n\nThe Company has agreed to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each of the directors against any liability incurred by a director in respect of acts or omissions arising in the course of their office. Qualifying pension scheme indemnities (as defined in section 235 of the Companies Act 2006) apply, to the extent permitted by law, to certain directors of the Company's pension schemes. The indemnities were in force throughout 2021 and remain so. Copies of the deeds containing the relevant indemnity are available for inspection at the Company's registered office and will also be available at the AGM.\n\n## Requirements of Listing Rule 9.8.4\n\nInformation to be included in the annual report and accounts under Listing Rule 9.8.4 may be found as follows:\n\n| Relevant Listing Rule   |   Page |\n|-------------------------|--------|\n| LR 9.8.4R (12)          |    235 |\n| LR 9.8.4R (13)          |    235 |\n\n## Political donations\n\nNo political donations were made during 2021.\n\n## Insurance\n\nThe Company has arranged appropriate directors' and officers' liability insurance for directors. This is reviewed annually.",

        "page_content": "have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK accounting standards and applicable law, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework.\n\nUnder company law, the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the group and the Company for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.\n- \u00b7 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent.\n- \u00b7 for the group financial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 for the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent Company financial statements.\n- \u00b7 assess the group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern.\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent Company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole.\n- \u00b7 the strategic report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nIn accordance with the principles of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, we have processes and procedures in place to ensure that the information presented in the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable. We describe these processes and procedures on page 88.\n\nOn the advice of the Audit Committee, the Board considers that the annual report, as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies\n\nOur critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies conform with UK-adopted international accounting standards and are set out on page 139 of the consolidated financial statements. The directors have reviewed these policies and applicable estimation techniques and have confirmed them to be appropriate for the preparation of the 2021 consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Disclosure of information to auditors\n\nAs far as each of the directors in office at the date of this Directors' Report is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418 (3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the Company's auditors are unaware, and each such director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Strategic report on pages 2 to 59 of this report includes information on the group structure and business principles, the performance of the business areas, the impact of regulation and principal risks and uncertainties.\n\nThe group performance detailed on pages 24 to 27 includes information on the group financial results, financial outlook, cash flow and balance sheet position. The consolidated financial statements include information on the group financial investments and investment property (Note 10), derivatives (Note 12), cash and cash equivalents (Note 14), asset risk (Note 7), market, credit and insurance risks (Notes 15 to 17) and borrowings (Note 22).\n\nIn line with IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', and revised FRC guidance on 'risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting', and as set out in the Basis of preparation (Note 1), management has taken into account all available information about the future for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements when assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nDetails of the main risks affecting the group and how we manage and mitigate them are set out in 'Managing risks' on pages 52 to 59.\n\nHaving assessed the main risks and other matters discussed in connection with the Group Board viability statement set out on page 55, in accordance with the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC guidance, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements.\n\nThe Directors' report and Strategic report were approved by the Board and signed on its behalf.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\nG J Timms Company Secretary\n\n<!-- image -->",

They may offer to sell shares that turn out to be worthless or non-existent, or to buy shares at an inflated price in return for an upfront payment. While high profits are promised, if you buy or sell shares in this way you will probably lose your money.\n\n## How to avoid share fraud\n\nHave you been:\n\n## Contacted out of the blue\n\nPromised tempting returns and told the investment is safe.\n\n## Called repeatedly; or\n\nTold the offer is only available for a limited time? If so, you might have been contacted by fraudsters.\n\n## Reject cold calls\n\nIf you've been cold called with an offer to buy or sell shares, chances are it's a high risk investment or a scam. You should treat the call with extreme caution. The safest thing to do is to hang up.\n\n## Check the firm on the FS register at fca.org.uk/register\n\nThe Financial Services Register is a public record of all the firms and individuals in the financial services industry that are regulated by the FCA.\n\n## Get impartial advice\n\nThink about getting impartial financial advice before you hand over any money. Seek advice from someone unconnected to the firm that has approached you.\n\nIf you suspect that you have been approached by fraudsters, please tell the FCA using the share fraud reporting form at fca.org.uk/scamsmart where you can find out more about investment scams. You can also call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\nIf you have lost money to investment fraud, you should report it to Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040 or online at actionfraud.police.uk.\n\nIf you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

        "page_content": "## Alternative Performance Measures\n\nAn alternative performance measure (APM) is a financial measure of historic or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, other than a financial measure defined under IFRS or the regulations of Solvency II. APMs offer investors and stakeholders additional information on the company's performance and the financial effect of 'one-off' events, and the group uses a range of these metrics to enhance understanding of the group's performance. However, APMs should be viewed as complementary to, rather than as a substitute for, the figures determined according to other regulations. The APMs used by the group are listed in this section, along with their definition/explanation, their closest IFRS measure and reference to the reconciliations to those IFRS measures.\n\nThe APMs used by the group may not be the same as, or comparable to, those used by other companies, both in similar and different industries. The calculation of APMs is consistent with previous periods, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Adjusted operating profit\n\n## Definition\n\nAdjusted operating profit is an APM that supports the internal performance management and decision making of the group's operating businesses, and accordingly underpins the remuneration outcomes of the executive directors and senior management. The group considers this measure meaningful to stakeholders as it enhances the understanding of the group's operating performance over time by separately identifying non-operating items.\n\nAdjusted operating profit measures the pre-tax result excluding the impact of investment volatility, economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations and exceptional items. It therefore reflects longer-term economic assumptions for the group's insurance businesses and shareholder funds, including the traded portfolio in LGC. For direct investments, operating profit reflects the expected long-term economic return for those assets which are developed with the intention of sale, or the IFRS profit before tax for the early stage and mature businesses. Variances between actual and long-term expected investment return on traded and real assets (including direct investments) are excluded from adjusted operating profit, as well as economic assumption changes caused by changes in market conditions or expectations (e.g. credit default and inflation) and any difference between the actual allocated asset mix and the target long-term asset mix on new pension risk transfer business. Adjusted operating profit also excludes the yield associated with assets held for future new pension risk transfer business from the valuation discount rate on insurance contract liabilities. Exceptional income and expenses which arise outside the normal course of business in the year, such as merger and acquisition and start-up costs, are also excluded from adjusted operating profit.\n\nIn certain disclosures, the group may use the term 'operating profit' as a substitute for adjusted operating profit, but in all circumstances it carries the same definition and meaning.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary adjusted operating profit information - section (i).\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n## Definition\n\nROE measures the return earned by shareholders on shareholder capital retained within the business. ROE is calculated as IFRS profit after tax divided by average IFRS shareholders' funds (by reference to opening and closing shareholders' funds as provided in the IFRS consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year).\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nCalculated using:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit attributable to equity holders\n- \u00b7 Equity attributable to owners of the parent\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nCalculated using profit attributable to equity holders for the year of \u00a32,050m (31 December 2020: \u00a31,607m) and average equity attributable to the owners of the parent of \u00a39,994m (31 December 2020: \u00a39,270m), based on an opening balance of \u00a39,502m and a closing balance of \u00a310,486m (2020: based on an opening balance of \u00a39,038m and a closing balance of \u00a39,502m).\n\n## Assets under management\n\n## Definition\n\nFunds which are managed by our fund managers on behalf of investors. It represents the total amount of money investors have trusted with our fund managers to invest across our investment products.\n\n## Closest IFRS measures\n\n- \u00b7 Financial investments\n- \u00b7 Investment property\n- \u00b7 Cash and cash equivalents\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 38 - Reconciliation of Assets under management to Consolidated Balance Sheet financial investments, investment property and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Net release from operations\n\n## Definition\n\nRelease from operations plus new business surplus/(strain). Net release from operations is also referred to as cash generation, and includes the release of prudent margins from the back book, together with the premium received less the setup of prudent reserves and associated acquisition costs for new business. Net release from operations is a component of adjusted operating profit (after tax), and excludes predominantly the impact of experience variances and changes in valuation assumptions.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary adjusted operating profit information - sections (i) and (ii).\n\n## Adjusted profit before tax attributable to equity holders Definition\n\nThe APM measures profit before tax attributable to shareholders incorporating actual investment returns experienced during the year and the pre-tax results of discontinued operations.\n\n## Closest IFRS measure\n\nProfit before tax attributable to equity holders.\n\n## Reconciliation\n\nNote 2 - Supplementary adjusted operating profit information - section (i).",

Services provided in respect of assets under administration are of an administrative nature, including safekeeping, collecting investment income, settling purchase and sales transactions and record keeping.\n\n## Assets under management (AUM)*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Assured Payment Policy (APP)\n\nAn APP is a long-term contract under which the policyholder (a registered UK pension scheme) pays a day-one premium and in return receives a contractually fixed and/or inflation-linked set of payments over time from the insurer.\n\n## Back book acquisition\n\nNew business transacted with an insurance company which allows the business to continue to utilise Solvency II transitional measures associated with the business.\n\n## CAGR\n\nCompound annual growth rate.\n\n## Cash generation\n\nCash generation is an alternative term for net release from operations.\n\n## CCF - Common Contractual Fund\n\nAn Irish regulated asset pooling fund structure. It enables institutional investors to pool assets into a single fund vehicle with the aim of achieving cost savings, enhanced returns and operational efficiency through economies of scale. A CCF is an unincorporated body established under a deed where investors are 'co-owners' of underlying assets which are held pro rata with their investment. The CCF is authorised and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.\n\n## Credit rating\n\nA measure of the ability of an individual, organisation or country to repay debt. The highest rating is usually AAA and the lowest Unrated. Ratings are usually issued by a credit rating agency (e.g. Moody's or Standard & Poor's) or a credit bureau.\n\n## Deduction and aggregation (D&A)\n\nA method of calculating group solvency on a Solvency II basis, whereby the assets and liabilities of certain entities are excluded from the group consolidation. The net contribution from those entities to group Own Funds is included as an asset on the group's Solvency II balance sheet. Regulatory approval has been provided to recognise the (re)insurance subsidiaries in the US and Bermuda on this basis.\n\n## Defined benefit pension scheme (DB scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan in which an employer/sponsor promises a specified monthly benefit on retirement that is predetermined by a formula based on the employee's earnings history, tenure of service and age, rather than depending directly on individual investment returns.\n\n## Defined contribution pension scheme (DC scheme)\n\nA type of pension plan where the pension benefits at retirement are determined by agreed levels of contributions paid into the fund by the member and employer. They provide benefits based upon the money held in each individual's plan specifically on behalf of each member. The amount in each plan at retirement will depend upon the investment returns achieved as well as the member and employer contributions.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are not a separate asset class but are contracts usually giving a commitment or right to buy or sell assets on specified conditions, for example on a set date in the future and at a set price. The value of a derivative contract can vary. Derivatives can generally be used with the aim of enhancing the overall investment returns of a fund by taking on an increased risk, or they can be used with the aim of reducing the amount of risk to which a fund is exposed.\n\n## Direct investments\n\nDirect investments, which generally constitute an agreement with another party, represent an exposure to untraded and often less volatile asset classes. Direct investments also include physical assets, bilateral loans and private equity, but exclude hedge funds.\n\n## Dividend cover\n\nDividend cover measures how many times over the net release from operations in the year could have paid the full year dividend. For example, if the dividend cover is 3, this means that the net release from operations was three times the amount of dividend paid out.\n\n## Early stage business\n\nA recently created company in the early stage of its life cycle (typically up to 18 to 24 months since establishment), which has not broken even yet. This usually means the entity is not fully operational yet, and the management team is still being developed.\n\n## Earnings per share (EPS)\n\nEPS is a common financial metric which can be used to measure the profitability and strength of a company over time. It is the total shareholder profit after tax divided by the number of shares outstanding. EPS uses a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.\n\n## Eligible Own Funds\n\nEligible Own Funds represents the capital available to cover the group's Solvency II Capital Requirement. Eligible Own Funds comprise the excess of the value of assets over liabilities, as valued on a Solvency II basis, plus high quality hybrid capital instruments, which are freely available (fungible and transferable) to absorb losses wherever they occur across the group.",

This form of investing is most prominent in final salary pension plans, whose liabilities can often reach into billions of pounds for the largest of plans.\n\n## Lifetime mortgages\n\nAn equity release product aimed at people aged 55 years and over. It is a mortgage loan secured against the customer's house. Customers do not make any monthly payments and continue to own and live in their house until they move into long-term care or on death. A no negative equity guarantee exists such that if the house value on repayment is insufficient to cover the outstanding loan, any shortfall is borne by the lender.\n\n## Longevity\n\nMeasure of how long policyholders will live, which affects the risk profile of pension risk transfer, annuity and protection businesses.\n\n## Matching adjustment\n\nAn adjustment to the discount rate used for annuity liabilities in Solvency II balance sheets. This adjustment reflects the fact that the profile of assets held is sufficiently well-matched to the profile of the liabilities, that those assets can be held to maturity, and that any excess return over risk-free (that is not related to defaults) can be earned regardless of asset value fluctuations after purchase.\n\n## Mature business\n\nA company which has been operative for more than three to five years. It generates regular revenue streams but the growth rate in its earnings is expected to remain broadly flat in the future. At this point in its life cycle, a complete and experienced management team is in place.\n\n## Morbidity rate\n\nRate of illness, influenced by age, gender and health, used in pricing and calculating liabilities for policyholders of life products, which contain morbidity risk.\n\n## Mortality rate\n\nRate of death, influenced by age, gender and health, used in pricing and calculating liabilities for policyholders of life and annuity products, which contain mortality risks.\n\n## Net release from operations*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Net zero carbon\n\nAchieving an overall balance between anthropogenic carbon emissions produced and carbon emissions removed from the atmosphere.",

This metric provides an understanding of the impact of new contracts on the IFRS profit for the year.\n\n## OEIC - Open Ended Investment Company\n\nA type of investment fund domiciled in the United Kingdom that is structured to invest in stocks and other securities, authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\n## Overlay assets\n\nOverlay assets are derivative assets that are managed alongside the physical assets held by LGIM. These instruments include interest rate swaps, inflation swaps, equity futures and options. These are typically used to hedge risks associated with pension scheme assets during the derisking stage of the pension life cycle.\n\n## Paris Agreement\n\nThe Paris Agreement is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change effective 4 November 2016. The Agreement aims to limit the increase in average global temperatures to well below 2\u00b0C, preferably to 1.5\u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels.\n\n## Pension risk transfer (PRT)\n\nPRT represents bulk annuities bought by entities that run final salary pension schemes to reduce their responsibilities by closing the schemes to new members and passing the assets and obligations to insurance providers.\n\n## Persistency\n\nPersistency is a measure of LGIM client asset retention, calculated as a function of net flows and closing AUM.\n\n## Platform\n\nOnline services used by intermediaries and consumers to view and administer their investment portfolios. Platforms usually provide facilities for buying and selling investments (including, in the UK products such as Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), Self-Invested Personal Pensions (SIPPs) and life insurance) and for viewing an individual's entire portfolio to assess asset allocation and risk exposure.\n\n## Present value of future new business premiums (PVNBP)\n\nPVNBP is equivalent to total single premiums plus the discounted value of annual premiums expected to be received over the term of the contracts using the same economic and operating assumptions used for the new business value at the end of the financial period. The discounted value of longevity insurance regular premiums and quota share reinsurance single premiums are calculated on a net of reinsurance basis to enable a more representative margin figure. PVNBP therefore provides an estimate of the present value of the premiums associated with new business written in the year.\n\n## Proprietary assets\n\nTotal investments to which shareholders are directly exposed, minus derivative assets, loans, and cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## QIAIF - Qualifying Investor Alternative Investment Fund\n\nAn alternative investment fund regulated in Ireland targeted at sophisticated and institutional investors, with minimum subscription and eligibility requirements. Due to not being subject to many investment or borrowing restrictions, QIAIFs present a high level of flexibility in their investment strategy.\n\n## Real assets\n\nReal assets encompass a wide variety of tangible debt and equity investments, primarily real estate, infrastructure and energy. They have the ability to serve as stable sources of long-term income in weak markets, while also providing capital appreciation opportunities in strong markets.\n\n## Release from operations\n\nThe expected IFRS surplus generated in the period from the difference between IFRS prudent assumptions and our best estimate of future experience for in-force LGR and UK Insurance businesses, the post-tax adjusted operating profit on other UK businesses, including the medium term expected investment return on LGC invested assets, and dividends remitted from LGIA.\n\n## Retirement Interest Only Mortgage (RIO)\n\nA RIO mortgage is a standard retirement mortgage available for noncommercial borrowers above 55 years old. A RIO mortgage is very similar to a standard interest-only mortgage, with two key differences:\n\n- \u00b7 The loan is usually only paid off on death, move into long-term care or sale of the house.\n- \u00b7 The borrowers only have to prove they can afford the monthly interest repayments and not the capital remaining at the end of the mortgage term.\n\nNo repayment solution is required as repayment defaults to sale of property.\n\n## Return on Equity (ROE)*\n\nRefer to the alternative performance measures section.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nThe aggregate level and types of risk a company is willing to assume in its exposures and business activities in order to achieve its business objectives.\n\n## SICAV - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Investissement \u00e0 Capital Variable\n\nA publicly traded open-end investment fund structure offered in Europe and regulated under European law.\n\n## SIF - Specialised Investment Fund\n\nAn investment vehicle regulated in Luxembourg targeted to well-informed investors, providing a great degree of flexibility in organisation, investment policy and types of underlying assets in which it can invest.\n\n## Single premiums\n\nSingle premiums arise on the sale of new contracts where the terms of the policy do not anticipate more than one premium being paid over its lifetime, such as in individual and bulk annuity deals.\n\n## Solvency II\n\nThe Solvency II regulatory regime is a harmonised prudential framework for insurance firms in the EEA. This single market approach is based on economic principles that measure assets and liabilities to appropriately align insurers' risk with the capital they hold to safeguard the policyholders' interest.\n\n## Solvency II capital coverage ratio (SCR)\n\nThe Eligible Own Funds on a regulatory basis divided by the group solvency capital requirement. This represents the number of times the SCR is covered by Eligible Own Funds.",

It is based on assumed real world returns and best estimate non-market assumptions. It includes the impact of management actions to the extent that, at the start of the year, these were reasonably expected to be implemented over the year.\n\n## Solvency II risk margin\n\nAn additional liability required in the Solvency II balance sheet, to ensure the total value of technical provisions is equal to the current amount a (re)insurer would have to pay if it were to transfer its insurance and reinsurance obligations immediately to another (re)insurer. The value of the risk margin represents the cost of providing an amount of Eligible Own Funds equal to the Solvency Capital Requirement (relating to non-market risks) necessary to support the insurance and reinsurance obligations over the lifetime thereof.\n\n## Solvency II surplus\n\nThe excess of Eligible Own Funds on a regulatory basis over the SCR. This represents the amount of capital available to the company in excess of that required to sustain it in a 1-in-200 year risk event.\n\n## Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR)\n\nThe amount of Solvency II capital required to cover the losses occurring in a 1-in-200 year risk event.\n\n## Total shareholder return (TSR)\n\nTSR is a measure used to compare the performance of different companies' stocks and shares over time. It combines the share price appreciation and dividends paid to show the total return to the shareholder.\n\n## Transitional Measures on Technical Provisions (TMTP)\n\nThis is an adjustment to Solvency II technical provisions to bring them into line with the pre-Solvency II equivalent as at 1 January 2016 when the regulatory basis switched over, to smooth the introduction of the new regime. This will decrease linearly over the 16 years following Solvency II implementation but may be recalculated to allow for changes impacting the relevant business, subject to agreement with the PRA.\n\n## Yield\n\nA measure of the income received from an investment compared to the price paid for the investment. It is usually expressed as a percentage.",
