Additionally, as an annex to this document, we published our first management report related to climate change, aligned with the TCFD 1 guidelines, which reflects our great commitment towards this world phenomenon.\n\nOur responsible management also implies continuing to advance in equity, diversity and inclusion of our employees and customers, under the conviction that this starts with our own governing bodies and our workforce. Today, on average, 30% of the members of our Boards of Directors are women and 39% of management positions within our organization are held by women.\n\nMoving on with the social front, initiatives like our youth Call Center and our segmented strategies of financial literacy stand out, these initiatives reflect our input towards work inclusion and financial health for everyone.

As part of our climate change strategy, we adhered to the TCFD 42 in 2020, pledging to continue implementing actions to mobilize ourselves and our customers towards the achievement of global goals. In 2021 we published our first report in accordance with this reporting framework.\n\n## \u00b7 Climate change management\n\nWe manage climate change as a cross-cutting issue across the organization. Our strategy is strengthened through processes, products, programs, and initiatives that enable us to contribute to specific measures designed to mitigate or adapt, and to seize related opportunities, through the following processes:\n\n- 1. Social and Environmental Risk Management System (SARAS) 43 Includes climate change risk assessment: physical and transitional.\n- 2. Eco-efficiency We manage the environmental impact associated with our operations.\n- 3. Environmental products and programs We finance climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.\n\nWe made significant progress in climate change management in 2021. Since our review of material issues, this issue has gained relevance and prompted us to consolidate and strengthen our climate change strategy in line with the recommendations provided by the TCFD. This is how we address our performance in accordance with recommendations focused on 4 relevant topics, which provide us with a comprehensive understanding.\n\n## Relevant climate change management issues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Metrics and objectives\n\nInternal (eco-efficiency) and external figures and goals (green lines, products and pilots)\n\n## Risk management\n\nComprehensive risk management and its relationship with climate issues, especially with a focus on physical and transition risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n53\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 42 TCFD (Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures): A guide for identifying the opportunities, risks and impacts of climate change finance.\n- 43 SARAS (Environmental and Social Risk Analysis System): Series of policies, mechanisms and procedures to identify, evalutate and monitor potential environmental and socila risks generated by a client or a project.",

Since 2011, we have been actively engaged in climate change issues through our environmental policy, which we have strengthened by adopting best practices, such as those proposed by the TCFD.\n\nOur performance has yielded significant results in this regard:\n\n## \u00b7 Governance\n\nThe highest governance body, in terms of planning, control and follow-up on Climate Change related matters, is the Board of Directors, fulfilling the duties established in the bylaws and regulations, specifically those related to the strategy, monitoring, remuneration, and execution of governance matters related to climate change. Furthermore, there are committees in place to support the Board, such as the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee and the Corporate Risk Committee, which are responsible for establishing guidelines and following up on this matter. The presidential committee is another internal control body, which defines, approves, and manages policies and integrates such policies into the business strategy. These committees meet on a regular basis throughout the year.\n\nThe areas responsible for monitoring and compliance on Climate Change are the Sustainability Department, the Vice-Presidency of Credit Risk, and the Administrative Services Department, which coordinate and integrate internal and business actions in order to approach this issue at a\n\ntactical and strategic level. Climate change risk management is included in the Environmental and Social Risk Management System - SARAS, which itself is part of the Comprehensive Risk System, the highest governance body for planning, control, and follow-up on Climate Change matters.\n\n## \u00b7 Strategy\n\nAs part of our sustainability strategy and the identification of key areas for development in 2021, we recognized climate change as the most relevant or material issue given the impact we have as a banking entity, not only on our stakeholders, but also on the risks and opportunities posed to the business. Therefore, we continue to strengthen our commitment and transparency with climate change prevention and mitigation measures through our first TCFD report.\n\nWe are therefore working to strengthen our climate change strategy by managing material issues related to sustainable finance, sustainable funding, eco-efficiency, and circular economy.\n\nIn addition, we rely on expert consultants who support us in strengthening our strategy in the medium and long term.\n\n## \u00b7 Risk management\n\nWithin the framework of climate change risk management, we increased our understanding of physical risks by identifying and classifying risk levels for flood and landslide hazards as part of the underwriting of loan applications and for the mortgage and construction portfolios. Additionally, we improved our ability to understand and integrate data from future climate scenarios.\n\nIn relation to transition risks, we structured a methodology that allows us to analyze, through heat maps, the associated risk levels. We have performed exploratory exercises for analysis and adjustments, to find the most suitable procedures that may be integrated into the current processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe identified climate change as the most relevant material issue due to the impact we have as a banking entity, not only on our stakeholders, but also because of the risks and opportunities that this means for the business.",

The Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee monitors our progress in the comprehensive management of sustainable finances.\n\nFurthermore, to successfully integrate ESG criteria in the products we offer, our risk management department evaluates, using the Environmental and Social Risk Management System (SARAS), applications submitted by our business and construction customers to develop projects or activities that are environmentally sensitive, thereby identifying potential risks and making informed decisions.\n\nWe identify and mitigate environmental and social risk when we finance sensitive projects and industries. The SARAS is included in our comprehensive risk management process and is managed by the Environmental and Social Risk Department within the Vice Presidency of Credit Risk, under the supervision of the Corporate Risk Committee, the Credit Risk Committees and the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee. It covers the policies and procedures to be applied when underwriting loans in the corporate, construction, business, and leasing segments, when evaluating investment decisions, and for the strategic management of suppliers\n\nThe SARAS methodology has defined its scope, based on amounts, terms, sensitive activities and local regulations, as well as when required by credit approval agencies. Furthermore, it is aligned with the standards, performance norms, and exclusion list of the IFC. For large infrastructure projects, the evaluation considers the elements of the Equator Principles methodological benchmark, including due diligence by an independent advisor.\n\n## The following aspects are assessed:\n\n- Compliance with applicable local legislation\n- Labor and working conditions\n- Assessment and management of environmental and social risks and impacts\n- Resource use of efficiency and pollution prevention\n- Cultural heritage\n- Environmental and/or social certifications and awards\n- Community education and income programs\n- Indigenous peoples\n- Community health and safety\n- Climate change adaptation and mitigation\n- Land acquisition and involuntary resettlement\n- Biodiversity conservation and sustainable management of living natural resources\n- Promotion of best practices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For infrastructure projects (project finance), we support the process from the loan structuring stage. As part of the SARAS process, we include procedures and work plans for climate change and human rights risk management.\n\n## \u00b7 Main achievements\n\n- In 2021 we continued strengthening our environmental and social credit lines in the countries where we operate. This portfolio accounted for 9.3% of loans in 2021. This resulted in COP 11.1 trillion in sustainable projects financed in 2021, an 8.1% increase over the previous year.\n- We assessed 338 projects totaling COP 12.5 trillion. New assessments increased by 56% and we continued monitoring 891 projects using SARAS in the countries where we operate.\n\nThese achievements stem from our business lines' strong performance in the placement of our own resources, rediscounting resources and resources from multilateral entities (To learn more, visit our Sustainable Funding section).\n\nThrough our green credit lines, we promote sustainable development by financing energy efficiency projects, renewable energy, cleaner production, sustainable infrastructure, electric and hybrid vehicles, green mortgages, and sustainable construction. In Colombia, our overall portfolio balance for green or environmentally beneficial financing reached COP 1.7 trillion, while in Central America it reached USD 321 million.\n\nThrough our social credit lines, we have focused on closing gaps for first-time homebuyers through mortgage loans for low-income housing (VIS), including a credit line focused on women, as well as the Women-Owned SME credit line, which is already present in Colombia and El Salvador.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n57\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we financed sustainable housing and construction projects, under sustainable building projects with LEED or EDGE certification for residential and commercial use, reaching a COP 336.1 billion portfolio balance. Additionally, we financed COP 202.9 billion in green mortgages and electric and hybrid vehicles.\n\nColombia\n\nCosta Rica\n\nEl Salvador\n\nHonduras\n\nPanama\n\nThrough green leasing, we supported our customers to mitigate the environmental impact associated with their activities under our Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy strategy, aimed at financing photovoltaic solar energy, boilers, transformer replacement, electric vehicles and, in general, projects that include machinery or equipment, and that allow at least 15% energy savings. In 2021, the balances of these lines of credit totaled COP 59.5 billion. Furthermore, we financed COP 2.3 billion for electric vehicles production.\n\nLikewise, in conjunction with development banks, through rediscount portfolios (Banc\u00f3ldex and Findeter), we offered special lines featuring attractive rates to our clients, along with analysis, disclosure, and advisory activities to adequately direct these businesses. In 2021, the portfolio balances of these credit lines with environmental benefits totaled COP 586.9 billion.\n\nIn 2021, we promoted projects certified for sustainable construction, granting mortgage loans to 515 families through our green mortgages line. In addition, through eco auto, there are already over 400 hybrid and electric vehicles rolling down the roads throughout the country.\n\nThere are 15 active projects: 12 in solar energy, 2 in wind energy (pioneering in the financing of this type of energy generation in the country) and 1 in biomass energy. We estimate a reduction of more than 1 million tons of CO/two.denominator thanks to these projects. Under the ' Partnership for Central America' program, Davivienda El Salvador became the first private bank to offer the largest guarantee program in Central America, USD/uni00A031 million, and will focus on financing SMEs led by women.\n\nWe financed recycling operations (metals, aluminum, and plastic) and supported companies engaged in energy efficiency projects to upgrade to solar plants in their operations. In social matters, we made progress in financing productive sectors led by women, who account for 28% of the SME portfolio. Similarly, we helped Honduran families build their equity by providing subsidized social mortgage loans at preferential rates to over 3 thousand families with incomes below 4 times the minimum wage.\n\nWe continued developing proposals for financing clean energy, such as solar plants. In addition, we will seek partnerships with NGOs to encourage women's entrepreneurship. Regarding low-income housing, 140 families fulfilled their dream of owning their own home and, through the eco auto line, we financed the purchase of over 90 hybrid cars.\n\n*Representative Market Rate as of December 2021: COP 3,981 pero dollar.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n159 projects with environmental benefit in Corporate banking, between green lines and leasing. 127 of them correspond to renewable energy projects.\n\nWe will continue providing sustainable solutions to our clients and strengthening their skills and ours, as we generate positive impacts; one of our most significant goals is to increase the participation of our sustainable financing portfolio to 30% by 2030.

In 2021 we assessed 61 vendors, 27 of which were classified in environmental and social risk category B (medium) and 34 in category C (low).\n\nIn 2021, we launched a joint work plan with Fiduciaria Davivienda under the Environmental Policy framework, to identify businesses subject to SARAS assessment, based on the fact that the client requested a loan from the Bank to finance its project and also set up a Structured Trust product with Fiduciaria Davivienda.\n\nFollowing this review, we identified 168 businesses in common, representing 105 clients managed by Fiduciaria Davivienda and the Bank, and whose projects were evaluated under SARAS because they met the defined policies and included environmental and social characteristics.\n\nThus, we complied with the environmental policy established by Fiduciaria Davivienda and evaluated 9% of its customers for environmental and social risk.\n\nSubsequently, it became evident that there is a need to create a work plan for a Phase II of this exercise, which will allow for a broader scope covering the structured trust business.\n\nWITH SARAS, OUR GOAL IS TO APPLY THE ASSESSMENT TO 100% OF THE CREDIT APPLICATIONS THAT MEET THE CRITERIA.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The assessment includes a review of the potential and actual impacts of activities on human rights, as well as the monitoring of management measures to avoid or minimize risks, and to address adverse impacts.\n\nBased on monitoring of our credit lines and vendors, there is no evidence of any residual high-level risks of human rights violations in 2021.\n\nRegarding our clients, when assessing the environmental and social risk of loans, we are mindful that the financing does not have a negative impact on people, therefore:\n\n- We check that our clients are not adversely affecting the collective rights of ethnic minorities, and that they are respecting their right to prior consultation when required by law.\n- We encourage our customers to identify and mitigate potential opportunities to strengthen existing policies or create new ones that have not yet been prioritized, avoiding discrimination and inequality, promoting safe working conditions and environments, and the existence of constructive relationships among employees.\n- We are vigilant to ensure that the operations we finance do not involve child labor or any form of slavery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00b7 ESG Evaluation\n\nWe are guided by a responsible investment policy.

As of December 2021, approximately 85% of Banco Davivienda's portfolio is comprised of issuers at 'outstanding' and 'acceptable' levels.\n\nIn 2021 we adjusted the ESG rating model for issuers by incorporating new evaluation aspects and weighting various topics in a differentiated basis for the Real Sector and the Financial Sector. This new evaluation was applied at the end of the year to issuers with assigned investment limits, covering 117 in the Financial Sector and 94 in the Real Sector.\n\nThe evaluation was performed based on the information reported in the 2020 management and/or sustainability reports submitted by each issuer. In 2022 we will continue to evaluate issuers that are approved for portfolios and to be marketed to clients.\n\n## \u00b7 Training\n\nEAs part of our desire to raise awareness about SARAS among our employees, in 2021 we conducted an annual training program entitled 'No fear of risk: Environmental and social risk', reinforcing knowledge and highlighting case studies related to environmental and social incidents involving different economic sectors.\n\n## Training on environmental and social issues\n\n| Modality   | Topic                          | Number of  employees   |   Hours of  training |\n|------------|--------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Internal   | No Fear of Risk                | 10.6 mil               |                    1 |\n| Internal   | Green Financing                | 34                     |                   69 |\n| Internal   | SARAS Policy                   | 84                     |                   49 |\n| External   | Data Analytics                 | 4                      |                  297 |\n| External   | Climate change                 | 18                     |                   24 |\n| External   | Green building                 | 8                      |                   20 |\n| External   | Human rights                   | 8                      |                   13 |\n| External   | Green finance                  | 4                      |                    3 |\n| External   | Environmental and social risks | 12                     |                   17 |\n| External   | Sustainability                 | 9                      |                   16 |\n|            | Green taxonomy                 | 3                      |                    4 |\n\nIn addition, we encouraged continuous training for SARAS team members, reinforcement learning with external training, and constantly enhancing existing procedures and policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021 we made an adjustment to the ESG rating model of the issuers: we incorporated new aspects of evaluation and weighted the issues in a differentiated manner for the financial and the real sector.\n\n- 45 Heatmap: Type of graph that shows the results of a measurement by areas of different colors.",

This allowed us to provide people with disabilities with tools such as sign language interpreters and Braille signage throughout our various channels, such as our branches, in addition to the availability of approximately 700 accessible ATMs. Internally, we also offer courses for people with cognitive disabilities.\n- In 2021, a woman was appointed for the first time to the Board of Directors of Davivienda Colombia as a main member, providing women with representation in the organization's key decisions.\n\nWe are an inclusive organization that values diversity and promotes equal opportunity environments. Therefore, we monitor key indicators that allow us to identify opportunities and challenges in the areas of equality, diversity, and inclusion. That is why we count on a Diversity\n\nand Inclusion Policy that clearly states the practices we have applied for years in terms of diversity at all levels: cultural, gender, sexual orientation, generational, skills, etc.\n\n## \u00b7 Women and leadership at Davivienda\n\nCommitted to gender equality, we participate in training and mentoring sessions through our partnership with FAFW (Financial Alliance for Women), in order to acquire knowledge on topics such as the development and implementation of products and services for women, as well as strengthening on issues related to empowerment, women's development and gender strategy.\n\nIn 2021, 30% of the board members of our national and international subsidiaries were women.\n\n## Participation of women on our boards of directors 2021\n\n| Subsidiary                        | Women   |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|\n| Davivienda Colombia               | 14%     |\n| Davivienda Costa Rica             | 13%     |\n| Davivienda Honduras               | 38%     |\n| Davivienda El Salvador            | 40%     |\n| Davivienda Panama                 | 29%     |\n| Fiduciaria Davivienda             | 20%     |\n| Corredores Davivienda             | 30%     |\n| Corporaci\u00f3n Financiera Davivienda | 40%     |\n| Cobranza Sigma                    | 33%     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are an inclusive organization, we value differences, and we promote environments of equal opportunities.

In 2021 we measured our carbon footprint and implemented the following programs:\n\n- We replaced all our ATMs and outdoor signs in Colombia with LED lighting (completed). We also replaced air conditioning systems with more efficient technologies.\n- Specialized management of utilities to reduce GHG emissions and implementation of training and environmental awareness programs aimed at the efficient use of energy and water.\n- Vetting the technological products procured by the Bank to ensure their energy efficiency. We installed and started the operation of 10 solar panel systems. To date, we have 16 of these systems in Colombia.\n- Continued digitization of processes to reduce paper consumption and leveraging of technological tools to reduce air travel.\n- Offset 76.4% of the carbon footprint generated in 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Emissions management\n\n|                                                                                                                          | 2019     | 2020     | 2021   | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Scope 1 *                                                                                                                |          |          |        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Emissions from consumption of refrigerant  gases for air-conditioning and power plant  fuels (Tons CO/two.denominatoreq) | 2,904    | 2,596    | 2,620  | We decreased total Scope 1 emissions by  9.8% with respect to 2019, meeting the  established target.                                                                                                                                      |\n| Ton CO/two.denominatoreq/FTE                                                                                             | 0.29     | 0.25     | 0.26   | We decreased total Scope 1 emissions by  9.8% with respect to 2019, meeting the  established target.                                                                                                                                      |\n| Ton CO/two.denominatoreq/m/two.numerator                                                                                 | 0.01     | 0.01     | 0.01   | We decreased total Scope 1 emissions by  9.8% with respect to 2019, meeting the  established target.                                                                                                                                      |\n| Scope 2 ** Emissions from electricity consumption   (Tons CO/two.denominatoreq)                                          | 7, 0 0 5 | 4,894    | 4,668  | Total Scope 2 emissions decreased by 33%  due to a reduction in energy consumption.

In 2021, we acquired 50 thousand plastics for credit cards, that met environmental specifications: 100% recycled plastic (as an alternative to 100% recycled PVC cards), which reduces the carbon footprint with respect to traditional cards made of virgin material; we also use materials from different industries, such as the packaging, printing, and automotive industries.\n- Distribution: We work closely with our vendors and partners to foster a culture of environmental stewardship for the efficient use of resources. In 2021, we trained 707 employees from our cleaning and cafeteria vendor in comprehensive waste management and energy efficiency.\n\n## Reuse and repair:\n\n- Internal: We refurbished 372 chairs through cleaning, upholstery, and repair processes. We reused this furniture in the Bank's headquarters and branches.\n- External: We donated 2 thousand chairs, 325 workstations, 267 filing cabinets and 247 desks to 3 foundations, to be delivered to communities that have suffered natural disasters in Guajira, Chamba and Chipuelo. In addition, we sold 2.5 thousand assets to our employees and 5 thousand chairs to our vendors. We managed 78.3 tons of materials from disused furniture, through cleaning, repair, and refurbishment processes; these materials were sold by the vendor .\n\n- Collection: This line includes projects for the collection of disused assets and goods, as well as the toner reverse logistics program with Lexmark, in which we properly disposed of 631 toner cartridges under a zero-landfill and zero-incineration policy.\n- Recycling and waste management: This front includes all processes related to recycling, use, treatment, destruction, composting and final disposal of waste, in an effort to reduce and maximize the use of as many materials as possible, as well as to reduce the hazardous nature of the waste, when applicable.\n\nAs part of our circular economy strategy, we actively participate in Andi's 52 30/30 Vision group to comply with Resolution 1407 of 2018 and contribute to the national packaging management goal.

This program is tied to the Green Savings accounts, under which we encourage our customers to participate in the conservation of this key species for the health of the ocean. By opening a Mobile Account, DaviPlata, or Digital Term Deposit between August and December 2021, customers contributed to the release of 3 sea turtle hatchlings. Our commitment is to release 120 thousand hatchlings by 2022. In 2021, 95.8 thousand hatchlings were released, for a total of 1.36 million hatchlings since the beginning of our partnership with Funzel.\n\nAdditionally, we continue supporting the tagging of female turtles that return to the country's coasts, which allows us to advance research on their reproductive biology, movements, distribution, and growth rates, so as to implement programs aimed at conserving the species. A total of 800 turtles have been tagged and their tags have been registered in the world inventory of sea turtles.\n\nWe also continued the mangrove conservation program; in 2021 we contributed to the conservation of 7 hectares in the Ramsar de Barra de Santiago Site and planted 23 thousand mangrove seeds. In 2021, we implemented the third phase of the ' Comprehensive Solid Waste Management' project in Los C\u00f3banos and Barra de Santiago, where we worked with 13 restaurant owners to promote environmental responsibility in tourism and organized waste collection days. We have managed a total of 357 kg of recyclable waste and have used organic waste through composting in the community garden.\n\nFinally, we held a Circular Economy workshop for 108 students from 5 universities, who collected 808 kg of waste to be delivered to organizations for proper recycling. Additionally, we facilitated 8 workshops called 'Environmentally Correct' for 268 university students from 8 educational institutions.\n\n## Progress in El Salvador\n\n| Indicador                                         | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                | 1,286  | 1,016  | 1,096  |\n| Scope 2 (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                | 5,109  | 4,339  | 4,400  |\n| Scope 3 (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                | 141    | 56     | 46     |\n| Total carbon footprint (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq) | 6,536  | 5,411  | 5,542  |\n| Energy (MW)                                       | 7, 515 | 6,383  | 6,472  |\n| Energy (MW/FTE)                                   | 4.2    | 3.7    | 3.8    |\n| Energy (MW/m/two.numerator)                       | 0.3    | 0.2    | 0.2    |\n| Renewable energy installation (kWp installed)     |        | 267    | 267    |\n| Renewable energy generation (MWh/year)            |        | 73     | 399    |\n| Water m/three.numerator                           | 53,091 | 45,052 | 33,591 |\n| Water (m 3 /FTE)                                  | 30     | 26     | 20     |\n| Water (m/three.numerator/m/two.numerator)         | 4.0    | 1.5    | 1.1    |\n| Paper consumption (Tons)                          | 69     | 39     | 48     |\n| Paper consumption (kg/FTE)                        | 39     | 22     | 28     |\n| Usable waste (Tons)                               | 52     | 13     | 12     |\n| Usable waste (kg/FTE)                             | 29     | 7      | 7      |\n\nAcciones\n\nWe reduced Scope 1 emissions by 15% compared to 2019, and\n\nfootprint was reduced by 15% compared to 2019, equivalent to\n\nreduced Scope 2 by 14% and Scope 3 by 67%.

Personal wellbeing for employees and their families\n\nIn 2021, we leveraged our digital transformation to adapt our wellbeing programs to online environments, achieving broader cross-cutting experiences that reached more than 80% of our teams and their families.\n\nWe continued working on innovative ideas, such as digital platforms for gift selection for various celebrations; we also launched the Davipass mobile application, powered by blockchain technology, for customized assignment and consultation of benefits. Additionally, we developed the first Human Talent Benefits Fair with a 3D avatar, an experience that allowed us to interact with more than 9,800 employees and their families, with more than 81,000 online queries submitted to our expert areas and partners.\n\nWe also helped 1,638 people, including employees and their families, through our Family Guidance Center (COF) with services such as Psychological Counseling, Legal Advice, Tax Advisory, and Career Planning, among others.\n\n- 2. Financial well-being for the different stages of life\n\nWe offer solutions to contribute to the financial stability of our employees throughout their lives. We offered several financial alternatives in 2021 to improve the quality of life of our employees.\n\n- 3. Rojot\u00fa, a lifestyle, in line with the digital transformation.\n\nWe continued designing the Rojot\u00fa lifestyle, at everyone's reach. This year, we launched the 2022 collection inspired by a natural and eco-friendly connection inspired by sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021 we adapted our wellness programs to virtual formats, achieving greater cross-cutting experiences and reaching more than 80% of our teams and their families.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Bank would be affected by portfolio deterioration caused by a reduced capacity from its customers to pay financial obligations, save, and invest.\n\n2021 was shaped by the covid-19 pandemic. The large-scale roll-out and distribution of vaccines and improved hospital infrastructure allowed for significant improvements in travel, which led to a worldwide economic recovery, while countries implemented fiscal and monetary measures.

Furthermore, there is still uncertainty about the effectiveness of vaccines and their capacity to control new variants of the virus.\n\nSecondly, the problems derived from the performance of the Chinese economy. Chinese companies have based much of their growth on a sharp increase in investment levels, but also on their debt, to such an extent that today China is one of the countries with the highest corporate debt as a proportion of GDP. In the case of Evergrande 64 , the excess leverage of companies in that country can spill over to others in the same country. On the other hand, an unordered deleveraging of companies could be a more traumatic process, limiting the country's growth. The trade war with the United States, ongoing despite a change in the U.S. administration, remains an important risk factor.\n\nSocial unrest and political decisions: The last few years the world, and particularly in Latin America, have been characterized by an increase in social outcries. This phenomenon, rooted in a complex interplay of factors, including many economic disparities, and accelerated by the massive use of social media, was somewhat overshadowed by the effects of the pandemic, especially by lockdowns and social distancing. Colombia experienced these protests in April and May 2021, resulting in significant disruptions in transportation, with consequences on several economic sectors and a decline in trust in the country. In 2022, presidential and congressional elections will be held, which generates uncertainty about the political decisions that are to come in the coming years.\n\nTo manage these risks, the economic research area periodically analyzes international economic policy and reports to senior management and the Board of Directors on the main developments in the financial markets, as well as the local and international macroeconomic outlook, including projection models. Likewise, the risk committees and business areas continue to monitor the savings and payment performance of our clients and the industries in which they operate, so as to generate the necessary action plans.\n\n## \u00b7 Risk arising from new disruptive competitors\n\nThe pandemic energized already existing transformation processes within banks, driven by the acceleration of digital adoption by customers and retail trade, which bolstered the trend of electronic transactions. The expectations of financial consumers were rapidly transformed in this new 100% digital environment, and new players arrived to offer financial products and services based on agile business models and high service standards, characterized by support and advisory services without resorting to physical channels.\n\nOn top of this, these new players offer low costs, with fees near zero, which could imply a loss of market share for Davivienda (and, of course, of customers), a decrease in income and costly adjustments to the functionality of its channels.\n\nWe conceive this new reality as an opportunity to create new business models powered by cutting-edge technologies and agility, allowing us to serve all segments of the population with products and services tailored to each profile. To this end, in conjunction with the progress in our digital transformation process, we have defined additional strategic fronts that will allow us to embrace this new environment.\n\nIn 2021, DaviPlata continued to consolidate itself as a digital native bank that totaled, by the end of 2021, 13.8 million customers and covered 98% of Colombia's municipalities. This platform will continue to develop its financial and non-financial offerings, as well as new ecosystems.\n\nRappiPay, our partnership with Rappi, also stands out, continuing to advance towards the incorporation of a financial offer into the successful ecosystem of this Colombian unicorn.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## THE NEW NORMAL IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE BUSINESS MODELS BASED ON HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND AGILITY, TO SERVE ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ADJUSTED TO EACH PROFILE.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The materialization of this type of attacks has serious consequences for the operation and availability of systems and service channels, due to possible breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information of the Bank and its customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continue to strengthen our strategy, deepening and developing different roles in order to prevent, detect and react in a timely manner to any event.\n\nThe main impacts that could be generated by the materialization of this risk are:\n\n- Adverse effects on the brand (reputational risk).\n- Possible depreciation of the value of intellectual property.\n- Higher operational expenses for prevention of future attacks, containment, and recovery from materialized threats.\n- Potential impact on insurance premiums against future events\n- Regulatory penalties and fines for regulatory non-compliance.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, we continue to strengthen our strategy, strengthening and developing different roles within the organization in order to prevent, detect and react promptly to any potential incident; furthermore, we continuously adopt new techniques, methodologies and tools that allow for early identification through alert analysis and reaction to possible events or atypical behaviors that may turn into cyber-attacks on the Bank and its subsidiaries.\n\nDuring 2020 and 2021, we made the following efforts towards managing this risk:\n\n- Adoption of best practices in cybersecurity and information security to improve the processes underlying the strategy.\n- Attention and response to the different requirements of the regulatory entities in aspects concerning information security and cybersecurity.\n- Active participation in industry working groups with government entities for risk mitigation.\n- Participation in cyber-attack drills to strengthen our capacity to respond to this type of incidents.\n- Started internal drills to strengthen our response and crisis management processes in the event of this type of incident.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

An example of our commitment is that in 2021 the Bank did not report any non-compliance with the Code of Good Corporate Governance.\n\nAdditionally, in 2021 the Bank was not involved in any pending or finalized legal proceedings with respect to anti-competitive practices or violations of laws regarding antitrust or monopolistic practices.\n\n## TRANSPARENCY HOTLINE\n\nBetween January and December 2021, the Transparency Hotline received 191 cases, all of which were managed within the deadlines defined by the organization in accordance with each category. 62% of these cases were closed after corrective actions were implemented, involving an action plan and follow-up. 73% of cases were received via telephone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The World Bank estimated that the world economy would grow at a rate of 5.5% 69 . For Latin America, the agency forecasted a 3.7% growth at the beginning of the year, but the estimated growth rate now stands at 6.7%. This improved global outlook is related to several factors, including the large-scale deployment of covid-19 vaccines and persistently low interest rates in the developed world, coupled with fiscal stimulus programs in several countries, particularly in the U.S.\n\nOil prices rebounded sharply over the year, in line with global economic recovery. On average, the Brent benchmark crude oil price reached USD 70.8 per barrel, well above the figure recorded in 2020 (USD 41.9), and even higher than the 2019 price (USD 64.0).\n\n## \u00b7 Gross domestic product\n\nAccording to DANE, Colombia's GDP expanded by 10.6%, positively surprising most analysts and multilateral organizations. Although GDP growth in the second and third quarters of the year (17.6% and 13.2%, respectively) was the highest since quarterly records have been kept, this was largely due to the 'rebound effect' following the collapse of economic activity in 2020 as a result of the pandemic and the measures adopted to control the spread of the virus.\n\n## GDP growth in Colombia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReal value compared to the same quarter of the previous year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Dane\n\n- 68 Document elaborated by the Executive Department of Economic Studies, with information available as of January 2022.\n- 69 See Global Economic Perspectives, World Bank, January 2022.",

On the other hand, 'Agriculture, hunting, livestock, forestry and fishing', 'Real estate activities' and 'Exploitation of mines and quarries' recorded the slowest growth. The latter rounded off 2 consecutive years of contraction.\n\nThe monthly economic activity indicator (ISE) shows that the positive performance of the economy continued throughout the last quarter of the year. Based on this index, the real annual variation of economic activity between October and November reached 9.3% and 9.6%, respectively. Likewise, an analysis based on the components of aggregate demand indicates that domestic final demand expanded by 13.3% in real terms over 2021.\n\n## 2021 closed with the highest inflation in the last five years: 5.62%.\n\n## INFLATION\n\n## Annual inflation\n\nJUL 2019 JAN 2020 JAN 2019 JUL 2018 JUN 2021 DEC 2021 DEC 2020 JUN 2020 JAN 2018 Source: Dane\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021 closed with the highest inflation in the last five years.

This, added to a soaring increase in the price of raw materials and the world logistics crisis, involving supply chain problems and disruptions in the operation of the main maritime ports, exacerbated the inflation problem.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

On the other hand, the IBR in the overnight term closed at 2.99%, while the 3-month rate reached 3.51%, reflecting agents' expectations regarding the future performance of the monetary policy rate.\n\n## FISCAL POLICY\n\n2021 was an eventful year in fiscal terms in Colombia. After a sharp deterioration in public finances in 2020, the authorities set goals in the Medium-Term Fiscal Framework that contemplated increasing the Government's fiscal deficit from 7.8% to 8.6%, seeking to maintain assistance programs for vulnerable populations introduced the previous year and to implement new measures to support economic recovery over the course of the year. In line with these goals, the Government presented a tax reform called the 'Sustainable Solidarity Bill' for consideration by Congress, whereby it expected to collect COP 25 trillion. However, the bill sparked strong protests from certain segments of the population, compelling the Government to withdraw the bill and to replace the head of the Ministry of Finance.\n\nFollowing the uncertainty caused by social unrest and doubts about the continuity of the fiscal consolidation process, Standard and Poor's downgraded Colombia's long-term foreign currency sovereign risk rating from BBB- to BB+, and changed its outlook from negative to stable, and became the first rating agency to downgrade the country's foreign currency investment grade, followed by Fitch, who made a similar announcement.\n\nMoody's did not downgrade Colombia's rating; conversely, on October 6, 2021, Moody's announced the ratification of Colombia's sovereign risk rating at Baa2, one notch above investment grade, and changed its outlook from negative to stable.\n\nUnder a different approach to the one initially presented, the Government submitted to Congress a new tax reform bill, this time expecting to collect COP 15.2 trillion, approved under the name of 'Social Investment Law'. This law included measures to increase the tax burden on companies and to strengthen the country's fiscal rule by including a debt ceiling in the fiscal policy objectives.\n\n## EXCHANGE RATE\n\nIn 2021, Latin American currencies were subject to considerable pressure from several factors, including the appreciation of the US dollar internationally and the fiscal deterioration in some countries following their efforts to address the adverse fallout from Covid-19.\n\nIn Colombia, the exchange rate depreciated substantially over 2021, 15.9%, from COP 3,432 at the beginning of the year to COP 3,981 on the last day of the year. This trend is largely attributable to an increased risk profile for the country and the appreciation of the US dollar globally. Regarding the first factor, 10-year CDS levels experienced a marked upward trend, reaching 277 points at the end of the year, that is, 125 points higher than the public finances, making Colombia one of the few countries where the deficit as a proportion of GDP increased during the year, despite significant economic growth.\n\nEven though in 2021 there was a net inflow of foreign portfolio investment amounting to nearly USD 100 million, portfolio capital outflows from Colombian investors abroad were significantly higher, reaching USD 1.17 billion. Consequently, portfolio capital flows confirmed the greater preponderance of upward factors in the USD - COP exchange rate in 2021.\n\n## Exchange rate\n\n(Colombian pesos per US dollar)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Financial Superintendence of Colombia\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCOP 3,981 Exchange rate as of December 31, 2020.

This performance was driven by a global economic recovery, the depreciation of the domestic currency, and an increase in the international prices of commodities, such as oil, coal, and coffee. In terms of product categories, external sales of fuels amounted to USD 17.3 billion, a 42% hike, and remained as the largest export item among total exports (46.7%). These were followed by exports of agricultural products, food, and beverages, which increased by 21%, and manufactured goods, up 29.8%.\n\nImports totaled USD 54.9 billion, growing by 39.5%, mainly due to purchases of manufactured goods such as vehicles and pharmaceuticals abroad. In terms of economic use or destination, imports of raw materials and intermediate goods increased 54.4% relative to 2020. Imports of capital goods and consumer goods increased by 29.2% and 25.4%, respectively.\n\nAs a result, between January and November 2021 the trade deficit of the Colombian economy amounted 71 to USD 14.3 billion, a USD 5.1 billion difference with respect to 2020.\n\nAs of October 2021, the profitability of the financial system as measured by return on assets (ROA) 72 and return on equity (ROE) 73 improved significantly, reaching 1.71% (compared to a 0.79% as of December 2020) and 12.43% (compared to a 5.86% as of December 2020), respectively.

As of December 2021, the total amount placed, without considering the exchange rate effect, increased by 2% on an annual basis, reflecting the greater demand for operations in local currency.\n\nOn the other hand, total liquidity moderated as a result of lower uncertainty regarding the evolution of the pandemic and the economic recovery. At the end of 2021, the indicator recorded a 5.2% annual variation, significantly below the peak recorded in August 2020 (14.1%), while savers continued to show greater preference for foreign currency-denominated assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal Assets as of November 2021.\n\nUSD 62.2 billion\n\nUSD 53.3 billion\n\nTotal Liabilities as of November 2021.\n\n## Costa Rica / Main financial sector figures and indicators\n\n(Figures in USD billions, except percentages)\n\n|                                  | Amount   | Amount   | Amount   | Variation/one.numerator   | Variation/one.numerator   |\n|----------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                  | Nov. 19  | Nov. 20  | Nov. 21  | 2021 / 2020               | 2020 / 2019               |\n| Total assets                     | 58.8     | 60.8     | 62.2     | 6.4%                      | 11.4%                     |\n| Investments                      | 9.7      | 11.9     | 13.8     | 20.2%                     | 31.7%                     |\n| Overall loans                    | 39.5     | 37.6     | 37. 3    | 3.4%                      | 2.5%                      |\n| Commercial/two.numerator         | 13.7     | 13.4     | 13.4     | 4.2%                      | 1.9%                      |\n| Consumer/two.numerator           | 12.0     | 11.2     | 10.6     | -1.5%                     | -3.1%                     |\n| Mortgage/two.numerator           | 10.2     | 10.2     | 10.3     | 4.5%                      | 5.6%                      |\n| Other assets/three.numerator     | 9.5      | 11.3     | 11.1     | 1.8%                      | 27.8%                     |\n| Liabilities                      | 50.0     | 52.3     | 53.3     | 6.1%                      | 12.7%                     |\n| Term deposits                    | 22.0     | 20.5     | 19.4     | -1.3%                     | 0.3%                      |\n| Savings                          | 8.1      | 9.6      | 10.5     | 13.4%                     | 28.7%                     |\n| Other liabilities/four.numerator | 11.0     | 11.0     | 10.4     | -0.8%                     | 7. 5%                     |\n| Checking accounts                | 8.9      | 11.2     | 13.0     | 20.3%                     | 35.0%                     |\n| Equity                           | 8.8      | 8.6      | 8.9      |                           |                           |\n| ROA/five.numerator               | 0.95%    | 0.68%    | 0.84%    |                           |                           |\n| ROE/six.numerator                | 6.33%    | 4.80%    | 5.88%    |                           |                           |\n\n- 1  The variation is based on the local currency.\n- 2  Loans by type are extracted from loans by type to the private sector (BCCR), therefore the sum of the different types of loans is not equal to the overall portfolio of Sugef's Financial Sector Balance Sheet.

Similarly, vaccination efforts have been successful, with 66% of the population fully vaccinated by the end of 2021, surpassing the average figures for Latin America and the Caribbean (56%).\n\nAfter the 2020 economic downturn, when GDP contracted by 7.9%, the country has been experiencing positive trends. In 2021, arts, entertainment, and recreation (90%) and lodging and food service activities (39.9%) posted the highest average growth.\n\nOver the first 3 quarters of 2021, commerce grew by an average of 15.08% on an annual basis; this increase was reflected in tax collection 75 , which was 9.7% higher than estimated at the beginning of 2021 and 26.1% higher than revenue collected in 2020.

Calculation: Davivienda\n\nInflation rose sharply throughout 2021, with a 6.11% annual variation recorded in December, the highest level in a decade. In response to demand pressures, there was an increase in family remittances and government current spending. In addition, the minimum wage for all economic sectors was increased by 20%. According to the IMF, the average annual inflation rate for El Salvador will be approximately 2.9% in 2022.\n\nBased on data provided by the Ministry of Finance, as of October 2021, non-financial public sector (NFPS) debt amounted to USD 23 billion, accounting for a 6 % increase with respect to December 2020. On that same date, debt was 87.9% of GDP; based on October's projection by the Treasury for nominal GDP for 2021 (USD 27.5 billion), debt would reach 83.6% of GDP.\n\nThe fiscal deficit was 10.14% of GDP in 2020. The Ministry of Finance estimates that the deficit will end 2021 at around 7.5% of GDP. As of November 2021, the fiscal deficit amounted to USD 1.23 billion, which is equivalent to a 45.5% reduction with respect to 2020. When compared to 2019, there is a 110.8% variation, as the indicator reached a USD 584.2 million gap.\n\nOn the other hand, in July 2021, Moody's downgraded El Salvador's sovereign rating from 'B3' to 'Caa1' and maintained a negative outlook. The statement mentions that the country's fiscal conditions are vulnerable and susceptible to financing restrictions that could jeopar-\n\ndize its payment capacity. In October, S&P Global Ratings announced the revision of El Salvador's sovereign rating outlook from 'stable' to 'negative'. This decision was based on the fact that the fiscal deficit and public debt will remain at high levels, despite a significant economic recovery in 2021. The 'negative' outlook indicates a potential downgrade at the next review; currently, the country's sovereign rating is at 'B-'. Meanwhile, Fitch has maintained the country's risk rating at 'B-' with a negative outlook since 2020.\n\n6.11% Inflation annual variation as of December 2021, the highest level in a decade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n20% increase in minimum wage.",

In the third quarter of 2021, the economy experienced greater dynamism, as a result of the reactivation of domestic demand, travel, and a greater flow of goods worldwide, which led to a 25.5% increase in GDP compared to the third quarter of the previous year. The activities that contributed most to this growth included trade, construction and mining and quarrying, as well as transportation, storage and telecommunications, driven by canal operations, port services and air transportation.

Total expenses grew by 19.7% in the year to date.\n\nPanama's risk rating at the end of 2021 was 'Baa2' by Moody's, 'BBB' by Standard & Poor's and 'BBB-' by Fitch Ratings. Throughout the year, the three rating agencies revised their perception of Panama's sovereign risk. Moody's downgraded its rating in March, citing the deterioration of the country's fiscal metrics, compared to the median of Baa1 rated countries. S&P opted for a revised outlook, but maintained its credit rating, given the risks associated with a slower economic recovery and a slow policy response. Finally, Fitch downgraded the rating, citing that the economic downturn exacerbated pre-2020 fiscal constraints.\n\n## \u00b7 Financial sector\n\nAs of December 2021, assets grew by 1.5% year on year; gross loans, which accounted for 58.8% of overall assets, grew by 5.1%, coupled with a 5.1% growth in investments, which accounted for 19.05% of overall assets as of the same date.

This performance is mainly explained by gross loans, which increased by COP 11.9 trillion (annual variation of 11.2%), driven mainly by the mortgage and consumer portfolios, which expanded by 17.4% and 11.5%, respectively, while the commercial portfolio recorded a 7.8% growth. As of December 2021, gross loans accounted for 77.7% of total assets.\n\nCash and interbank funds totaled COP 15.5 trillion, increasing 29.3% on account of increased money market operations in Colombia and a higher available balance in foreign banks. The investment portfolio totaled COP 16.0 trillion, declining 0.7% due to the volatility of the trading portfolio.\n\nThe 17.4% growth of the mortgage portfolio stemmed from higher growth in the segments of residential housing (VIS) and residential leasing, especially in Colombia, consistent with the dynamics of the sector during the year.\n\nThe consumer portfolio increased by 11.5%, due to the higher disbursements of unrestricted personal loans.\n\nThe commercial portfolio closed with a COP 53.6 trillion balance, reflecting a 7.8% increase ($3.9 trillion), mainly due to the growth of the corporate, wholesale and SME segments.\n\nAs of December 2021, 90-days PDL stood at 3.35%, dropping one percentage point year-on-year, as a result of loan portfolio growth, improved collection activity and write-offs made during the year.\n\nThe PDL ratio for the commercial portfolio increased 27 basis points over the year, reflecting a deterioration in certain sectors in Colombia and Central America, tied to the pandemic.\n\nThe PDL ratio for the consumer portfolio decreased by 385 basis points over the previous year, largely due to portfolio growth, increased collections following the return of customer payments after the ending of relief programs, and write-offs made during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAPPENDICES",

On the other hand, the 120-days PDL ratio rose 79 basis points, largely because part of the portfolio shifted to higher delinquencies, an effect caused by the containment of write-offs in 2020 and 2021, as well as portfolio securitizations throughout the year.\n\n2021 closed with a 135% coverage 77 ratio for non-performing loans, 172 basis points lower than the 137% figure recorded in December 2020.\n\n## Davivienda consolidated / PDL and coverage ratio 90 days PDL and Coverage ratios\n\n|                | 2020   | 2021   |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Commercial PDL | 3.26%  | 3.53%  |\n| Consumer PDL   | 6.04%  | 2.19%  |\n| Mortgage PDL   | 4.53%  | 4.35%  |\n| Total PDL      | 4.38%  | 3.35%  |\n| Total Coverage | 137.0% | 135.2% |\n\n## Davivienda consolidated / Loan portfolio\n\n(Figures in COP trillion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n118.6\n\n## LIABILITY ANALYSIS AND STRUCTURE\n\nTotal liabilities increased by 11.9% over the previous year, reaching COP 138.4 trillion at the end of the year, mainly due to a 30.2% increase in demand deposits, which offset an 11.3% decrease in the balance of term deposits, which closed at COP 29.9 trillion.\n\nGross loans to funding sources ratio stood at 90.8%, 261 basis points lower than in the fourth quarter of 2020 (93.4%), mainly due to the fact that the growth of funding sources exceeded the growth of gross loans (COP 16.4 trillion vs. COP 11.9 trillion).\n\nBonds increased by 34.9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, largely due to the issuance of a USD 500 million AT1 perpetual bond during the second quarter of 2021, local bond issuances in the Colombian operation throughout the year, as well as local issuances in Central America.\n\nCredits with entities decreased by 1.9% during the year, mainly attributable to the payment of financial obligations to foreign entities.\n\n## Davivienda consolidated / Funding sources\n\n(Figures in COP trillion, except percentages)\n\n|                       | 2020        | 2020             | 2021        | 2021             | Variation   | Variation        |\n|-----------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Savings Accounts      | Amount 40.5 | Percentage 35.5% | Amount 52.6 | Percentage 40.3% | Amount 12.1 | Percentage 30.0% |\n| Checking Accounts     | 13.0        | 11.4%            | 17.0        | 13.0%            | 4.0         | 30.9%            |\n| Term deposits         | 33.7        | 29.5%            | 29.9        | 22.9%            | - 3.8       | -11.3%           |\n| Bonds                 | 12.5        | 11.0%            | 16.9        | 12.9%            | 4.4         | 34.9%            |\n| Credits with entities | 14.4        | 12.6%            | 14.1        | 10.8%            | - 0.3       | -1.9%            |\n| Funding sources       | 114.2       | 100.0%           | 130.6       | 100.0%           | 16.4        | 14.4%            |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Davivienda consolidated / Liabilities\n\n(Figures in COP trillion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDemand deposits\n\nTerm deposits\n\nBonds\n\nCredits with entities\n\nOthers\n\n77 Coverage Ratio = Asset Allowances / Loans > 90 days.",

This result is mainly due to lower financial expenses, a reduction in provision expenses, and higher operating income and foreign exchange and derivative income. At the end of the fourth quarter, the 12-month return on average equity (ROAE) was 9.3%, 617 basis points higher than the figure reported 12 months earlier.\n\nThe accumulated gross financial margin as of December 2021 reached nearly COP 7.5 trillion, 1.1% lower than the figure recorded in 2020; this performance is explained by lower financial income, mainly due to a 55.3% reduction in investment and interbank income, given rising interest rates throughout the year, which resulted in portfolio devaluations.\n\nLoan income decreased by 3.3% over the year, as a result of lower income generated by the commercial portfolio. The mortgage portfolio increased by 12.8% and the consumer portfolio by 2.4%, consistent with the growth dynamics of these portfolios.\n\nThe 12-month NIM 78 closed at 5.94%, decreasing 35 basis points compared to the figure reported at the end of 2020. However, if foreign exchange and derivative income is included to reflect the result of our hedging strategy, the NIM would be 6.33%, increasing 2 basis points for the year.\n\nThe impairment of financial assets (net of recoveries) as of December 2021 reached COP 3.3 trillion, decreasing by 21.4% from the figure recorded in 2020, mainly thanks to an economic recovery that improved the risk profile of the portfolio, as well as a better macroeconomic outlook for Colombia and Central America.\n\n## Davivienda Consolidated / Results as of December 2021\n\n(Figures in COP billions, except percentages)\n\n|                                | December   | December   | Variation   | Variation   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                | 2020       | 2021       | Amount      | Percentage  |\n| Financial income               | 11,448     | 10,587     | - 860       | -7. 5%      |\n| Loan income                    | 10,519     | 10,172     | - 347       | -3.3%       |\n| Investment income              | 841        | 358        | - 483       | - 5 7. 5 %  |\n| Interbank and overnight funds  | 88         | 58         | - 30        | -34.3%      |\n| Financial expenses             | 3,881      | 3,106      | - 775       | -20.0%      |\n| Gross financial margin         | 7, 5 67    | 7, 4 8 2   | - 85        | -1.1%       |\n| Provisions                     | 4,200      | 3,301      | - 899       | -21.4%      |\n| Net financial margin           | 3,367      | 4,181      | 813         | 24.1%       |\n| Operating income               | 1,272      | 1,653      | - 65        | 29.9%       |\n| Operating expenses             | 4,139      | 4,500      | 361         | 8.7%        |\n| Net exchanges and derivatives  | 25         | 498        | - 41        | 1,853.6%    |\n| Other income and expenses, net | 50         | 58         | 8           | 16.9%       |\n| Income before taxes            | 476        | 1,773      | 1,297       | 272.4%      |\n| Taxes                          | 68         | 512        | 444         | 651.3%      |\n| Net Profit                     | 408        | 1,261      | 853         | 209.1%      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

These segments are bank units dedicated to financial and banking activities, which generate income and incur expenses, and for which effective accountability is ensured, for an optimal measurement of their results, assets and liabilities, which are regularly evaluated and verified by the Strategic Committee, headed by the President of Banco Davivienda S.A. (MITDO - Maximum Instance of Operational Decision Making), for proper decision making, the appropriate allocation of resources and the respective evaluation of results.\n\nTaking into account this organization, the operating segments for the Bank were determined considering:\n\n- Activities of individuals and companies, which are reported separately in terms of assets, liabilities, income, and expenses.\n- Results that are periodically reviewed by the MITDO\n- The relationship with which discrete financial information is available.\n\nOperating segments are components of the Parent Company, which encompass the results of the various countries where Davivienda operates, and therefore their results are classified and presented in the segments established by the Bank:\n\n## 1. Retail banking\n\nThis segment includes all products and services offered to individuals. Davivienda offers a wide variety of products and services focused on meeting the needs of its customers, including investment, financing, and savings products.\n\n## 2. Commercial banking\n\nThis segment includes products and services offered to legal entities. It offers financial and transactional solutions in local and foreign currencies in addition to financing, savings and investment products aimed at meeting the needs of this type of customers across the various industries in the economy.\n\n## 3. Differentiated Financial Information ALM\n\nThe Differentiated Financial Information segment ALM (Assets and Liabilities Management) includes segments of assets, liabilities, income, and treasury expenses equal to or greater than 10% of assets, which are presented on an aggregate basis, as well as the management of market gaps and liabilities, and any effect of restatement due to foreign exchanges, either by treasury position or the banking book. This is why the result of this segment does not reflect only the result of a business line, but also reflects corporate decisions on the management of the bank's issuance and financing. Even so, as it manages the bank's liquidity resources, it is monitored by management, as are the other segments. With this consideration in mind, we present the main dynamics of the segment.\n\n## 4. International\n\nThis segment covers the Bank's international operations and therefore includes the financial information derived from the Bank's subsidiaries abroad, which are located in Panama, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras. These Subsidiaries obtain their income from a variety of financial products and services offered in each country, which are centered on offering an effective comprehensive value proposition to our Multi-Latino customers, emphasizing quality and service.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is mainly attributable to write-offs made during the year, following the effects of the pandemic on customers.\n\nThe investment portfolio closed with a COP 15.0 trillion balance, growing 2.1% in relation to December 2020. Cash and interbank funds increased by 34.7%, reflecting higher liquidity levels throughout the year.\n\nIn 2021, we remain as the second-largest bank in the country in terms of gross loans. As of december 2021, our market share in Colombia was 16% 79 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n17%\n\nMortgage portfolio growth.\n\n26.1%\n\nMarket share in the placement of mortgage loans in 2021.

We remain as the leading bank in Colombia in the placement of mortgage loans, with a market share approaching 26.1% 80 in the financial system as of the end of 2021. This means that Davivienda finances 1 out of every 4 homes in the country.\n\nFurthermore, we continue to actively participate in subsidized housing programs granted by the government to low and middle-income families.\n\nOn the other hand, consumer loans grew 10.5% over the past year, mainly driven by unrestricted personal loans, following rising demand through digital platforms.\n\nCommercial banking, including the commercial and microcredit portfolio, experienced the slowest growth compared to the previous year (4.4%). Its performance was mainly driven by disbursements in the SME and corporate segments.\n\n- 79 Information from the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC)\n- 80 Including securitized loans.",

This result is derived mainly from increased demand deposits and the issuance of an international AT1 bond during the year, worth USD 500 million.\n\nDemand deposits increased, primarily fueled by savings accounts, which offset a reduction in term deposits. Demand deposits totaled COP 55.5 trillion, a 30.8% increase, while term deposits closed at COP 19.9 trillion, a 19.3% decrease.\n\nBonds increased by 29.4%, most notably an AT1 bond issue for USD 500 million.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal liabilities in 2021. 9.8%, increase compared to the previous year.",

Furthermore, higher net income from foreign exchange and derivatives also contributed to this performance.\n\nInterest income decreased by 8.4% compared to 2020. Loan interest income decreased by 3.7%, mainly as a result of low interest rates in Colombia, higher levels of competition and a changing portfolio mix, as commercial and mortgage loans gained market share.\n\nAs of the end of 2021, accumulated investment income amounted to COP 56.7 billion, 88.5% lower than the figure recorded in the previous year. This performance is explained by financial market conditions throughout the year, which impacted portfolio valuation, mainly in the case of debt instruments.\n\nFinancial expenses decreased 21.5% compared to 2020, mainly due to low interest rates throughout the period.\n\nGiven higher interest income and lower financial expenses, the gross financial margin at the end of December 2021 increased by 2.0% with respect to the accumulated margin recorded in 2020, totaling COP 5.72 trillion.\n\nProvisions expenses contracted by 25.6% (COP 944 billion) compared to 2020, reaching COP 2.75 trillion. This performance is attributable to Colombia's economic recovery after the Covid-19 crisis. Consequently, the 12 months cost of risk 81 indicator closed 2021 at 3.01%, approximately 1.43 percentage points below the figure recorded the previous year (4.44%).\n\n## Results as of December 2021\n\n(Figures in COP billions, except percentages)\n\n|                                       | December   | December   | Variation   | Variation   |\n|---------------------------------------|------------|------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                       | 2020       | 2021       | Amount      | Percentage  |\n| Financial income                      | 8,693      | 7,963      | -730        | -8.4%       |\n| Loan income                           | 8,249      | 7, 9 4 0   | -309        | -3.7%       |\n| Investment income                     | 493        | 57         | -436        | -88.5%      |\n| Interbank and overnight funds         | -49        | -34        | 15          | 30.7%       |\n| Financial expenses                    | 2,860      | 2,246      | -614        | -21.5%      |\n| Gross financial margin                | 5,832      | 5,716      | -116        | -2.0%       |\n| Provisions                            | 3,690      | 2,746      | -944        | -25.6%      |\n| Net financial margin                  | 2,142      | 2,970      | 828         | 38.6%       |\n| Operating income                      | 1,047      | 1,352      | 305         | 29.2%       |\n| Operating expenses                    | 3,069      | 3,304      | 235         | 7. 7 %      |\n| Foreign exchange and derivatives, net | -59        | 390        | 449         | 757.6%      |\n| Other income and expenses, net        | 16         | 35         | 18          | 112.5%      |\n| Income before taxes                   | 77         | 1,442      | 1,365       | 1766.6%     |\n| Taxes                                 | -147       | 266        | 412         | 281.4%      |\n| Net Profit                            | 224        | 1,176      | 952         | 425.5%      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntrillion\n\nGross financial margin as of December 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The 12 months efficiency 82 ratio improved by 2.50 percentage points, from 46.8% in December 2020 to 49.3% at the end of 2021.\n\nAccordingly, accumulated profits before taxes for 2021 reached COP 1.4 trillion, a 1,767% yearon-year increase. Net profits totaled COP 1.2 trillion.\n\n## STOCK PERFORMANCE 83\n\n2021 was characterized by economic recovery, although affected by the downgrading of the country's investment grade, uncertainty prevailing in the financial markets, the lingering effects of the pandemic on the global and local economies and, of course, the influence of the main macroeconomic indicators and of assets in general. Within this context, markets behaved relatively stable, inclined downwards in price levels and managed balances. This was particularly evident in the Colombian stock market, in which the Colcap index contracted by 1.9% at the end of the year.\n\nThe average monthly trading volume of the PFDavvnda 84 share was COP 76.0 billion, for a daily average of COP 3.7 billion. Throughout the year, consistent with global trends, Davivienda's preferred stock contracted 13%. In December 2021, the share price closed at COP 31,800, versus COP 36,400 at the end of 2020.\n\nBy the end of the year, 23.9% of our issued shares in our shareholder composition were preferred shares traded daily on the Colombian Stock Exchange. The Bank's preferred shareholders are pension funds, holding 54.7% of preferred shares, followed by foreign investors, holding 21.8% of these shares; 17.8% are distributed among Colombian companies and the remaining 5.7% are in the hands of individuals.\n\n## Banco Davivienda / Stock performance 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVolume (COP Million)\n\n- 82 12-month efficiency = Operating expenses / (Gross financial margin + Net operating income excluding dividends + Net foreign exchange and derivatives + Net other income and expenses).\n- 83 At the end of 2020, Davivienda had 451.7 million shares outstanding.\n- 84 PFDAVVNDA: preferential shares of Banco Davivienda S.A, registered in the Colombian Stock Exchange (Bolsa de Valores de Colombia).",

To this extent, climate change is a particularly important challenge in the Bank's sustainable strategy.\n\nBy strengthening our business model, we identify and mitigate the associated risks and leverage opportunities related to climate events and initiatives, considering that we are living in a defining moment in which our actions make a difference. Consequently, we help our clients to approach major economic, environmental, and social challenges related to climate change in the best possible way.\n\nWe developed a strategy that allows us to implement the necessary actions to address climate change, thus supporting our customers through more sustainable and responsible initiatives and investments, as well as through our operation. In 2011, we created our environmental policy and implemented the SARAS (Social and Environmental Risk Management System); thus embarking on the path towards effective management of environmental issues. Over the years, our practices have been strengthened and today we celebrate publishing this first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report as a high-level commitment to our stakeholders.\n\nThe Bank is also committed to reduce its carbon footprint and to promote a culture of sustainability. These efforts have been recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), where we excel, particularly in the environmental dimension. Furthermore, we participate in\n\nlocal industry initiatives that promote best practices. Therefore, this report is another step towards building trust with our stakeholders, ensuring them that we will continue to engage in businesses aligned with climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n\nThis first report presents actions on the 4 fronts recommended by TCFD: governance, strategy, risks, and metrics, which are the pillars underlying our climate change management strategy.\n\nOur commitment will continue in the countries we serve, reaching more people and companies who are eager to partake in solutions aimed at jointly fulfilling our commitments and obligations in this area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWE ARE COMMITTED TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT AND PROMOTE A CULTURE OF SUSTAINABILITY.\n\nCONSEQUENTLY, WE HELP OUR CLIENTS TO APPROACH MAJOR ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND SOCIAL CHALLENGES RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY.",

In 2021, we conducted a materiality assessment, identifying 8 topics that address the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues of our strategy, including climate change, deemed as the most relevant.\n\nWe are committed to sustainable development and conceive crises as opportunities to shift paradigms and continue undertaking the challenges inherent to our industry and the financial sector as they pertain to climate change. We consciously strive to reduce CO/two.denominator emissions across our operations and, as part of the indirect management of our business, we promote the financing of projects and activities focused on climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as on the management of potential negative impacts.\n\nClimate change is highly relevant within our industry, as it is directly linked to potential financial consequences; this fact is prompting important conversations on climate risks, whether physical or transitional, as well as accelerating strategic decision making, encouraging the business to allocate and channel funds towards activities contributing to accelerating the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Accordingly, we joined TCFD in 2020 and now hereby submit the first report disclosing our current status and our commitments to this issue of global concern.\n\nDavivienda implements initiatives to manage climate change, such as reducing water and energy consumption, mitigating our carbon footprint, investing in sustainable construction, implementing non-conventional renewable energy projects (NCRE), and promoting a culture of sustainability among our employees. As part of our product and service offering, in 2014 we designed credit lines with environmental benefits, contributing to climate change mitigation\n\nand adaptation, we also focus on rasing awareness among our clients and generating positive impacts on their business investments.\n\nWe work towards complying with global standards and adopting best practices in climate change management. In 2014 we started reporting our climate performance through the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Moreover, we are part of the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). In 2020, we ratified our commitment by implementing the recommendations set forth by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), which enables us to rely on better data to identify, manage and disclose the opportunities, risks and financial impacts derived from climate change.\n\nThis report outlines the mechanisms we have implemented to strengthen our climate strategy and identify opportunities for continuous improvement as part of our comprehensive management approach.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSINCE 2014, WE OFFER CREDIT LINES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND ADAPTATION, WHILE ALSO FOCUSING ON RISING AWARENESS AMONG OUR CLIENTS AND GENERATING POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THEIR BUSINESS INVESTMENTS.",

The areas responsible for monitoring and advancing our climate change agenda are the Sustainability Management, the Credit Risk Vice Presidency and the Administrative Services Management; these units articulate and integrate internal and business actions for the general approach to this topic at a tactical and strategic level.\n\nThe Strategic Risk and Planning Departments monitor and control business indicators and risk appetite jointly, in line with our organizational objectives. Similarly, the Administrative Services Department is actively engaged in implementing and monitoring the operational eco-efficiency strategy. We ensure the proper implementation of these strategies by consolidating, monitoring, and reporting progress on the strategy to the Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee. Sustainability Management is responsible to brief the Board of Directors of the Bank and its subsidiaries on progress. These reports are released twice a year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe identified the current state of our climate governance model, as well as the gaps and challenges we face. Accordingly, we designed a 5-year plan that will allow us to evolve and mature our governance model by strengthening functions and roles at different levels across the organization. Thus, we will improve our practices related to the Board of Directors' oversight of climate change-related risks and opportunities, as well as enhance senior management's responsibilities in the assessment and management of climate change-related risks and opportunities.",

It was also charged with providing shareholders and the overall market with access to the Bank's corporate governance information.\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors consolidated the Corporate Governance and the Sustainability committees into a single committee, under a comprehensive ESG business perspective.\n\n## \u00b7 Duties of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee\n\nIt supports the Board of Directors and its efforts to oversee, review, and implement policies, guidelines, and procedures related to good corporate governance practices and sustainability standards, in accordance with national 87 and international 88 measures and standards, as well as voluntary agreements to be submitted to the Board of Directors for approval.\n\nThe committee is composed of 5 permanent members: a member of the Board of Directors, the President of the Bank, the Executive Vice President of Risk, the Executive Vice President of Retail and Market Banking, and the Legal Vice President. The Vice President of Credit Risk and the Director of Sustainability are permanent guests of this committee, which meets on a quarterly basis.\n\n## CORPORATE RISK COMMITTEE\n\nIt supports the Board of Directors and oversees the operation of the Enterprise Risk Management System (ERM) established for the Bank and its subsidiaries. It is composed of 3 members of the Board of Directors and meets 4 times a year or whenever one of its members deems it convenient.\n\n## \u00b7 Duties of the Committee related to climate change\n\nEvaluate the harmonious functioning of the risk systems, ensure that the levels are maintained within the established risk appetite, and strengthen the risk management culture across the Bank. In relation to climate change risk, the committee follows up on the administration and management of climate risks for the scopes outlined, the improvements of the process and the definition and adjustment of the corresponding appetite.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 86 Those in which both parties, i.e. the competent entity and the organization, voluntarily bind themselves to meet common sustainability objectives.\n- 87 Code of Best Corporate Practices - C\u00f3digo Pa\u00eds.\n- 88 Dow Jones Sustainability Index.",

This commitment was reinforced by the Bank's senior management by issuing guidelines to advance in the identification of risks and opportunities related to climate change and to embed this perspective into the business model. Furthermore, senior management has incentivized the salesforce to enhance their performance in terms of managing and mobilizing resources towards this end, and in terms of raising awareness among our customers.\n\nIn 2021, with the leadership of the Financial Superintendence of Colombia (SFC) and the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria), the financial sector was able to harmonize methodologies aimed at strengthening climate strategies. This included the identification of eligibility criteria for projects yielding environmental benefits and contributing to climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on the Green Taxonomy.\n\nWe were actively involved in Colombia's Green Taxonomy test, led by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia and the Colombian Banking Association, sponsored by technical cooperation resources from the European Union. As part of this test, we proposed a classification of prioritized activities in construction (C1 - Construction of new buildings) and transportation (T5 - Private transportation of eco-vehicles) with respect to the distribution of resources by Davivienda.\n\nThe results of this pilot test will be instrumental in building sustainability capabilities across the Colombian banking sector, considering that the analyses, lessons learned, and recommendations derived from this exercise will facilitate the alignment of the sector's portfolios with the criteria set forth in the Green Taxonomy for Colombia. This process ought to be replicated in other financial institutions nationwide.\n\nAlso in the Colombian context, the Financial Superintendence of Colombia issued Circular 031, conveying instructions regarding the disclosure of information on social and environmental issues, including climate issues. We actively participated in the review and training cycle. For its implementation, we defined with the areas involved an action plan that we must comply with by 2023, the year established for issuers in Colombia.",

These are indicators for commercial managers who advise and assist clients who benefit from loans to develop projects that yield environmental benefits, such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, cleaner production, or sustainable infrastructure.\n\nThese definitions allowed us to work in conjunction with each business line and establish budgets and goals for short-term green financing credit lines. We are also strengthening our capabilities to identify our medium- and long-term goals. By 2022, we added sustainable finance goals to the performance bonus dashboard to define performance-based variable compensations.\n\nIn an effort to seize opportunities, faithful to our commitment to deliver value, we maintain and manage resources from multilateral banks to finance projects that yield social and environmental benefits. These resources have allowed us to create strategies that support projects to mitigate the impacts and effects of climate change in Colombia.\n\nThe use of these funds also generated added value, contributing to the strengthening of skills, knowledge, and the identification of opportunities.\n\n## Resources obtained to finance projects with environmental benefit\n\n(Figures in USD million)\n\n| 2017 150           | 2019 335                                  | 2020 370                                                               |   TOTAL 885 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| IFC 150 Green Bond | 335 Women-led SMEs,  VIS, Green Portfolio | 100 Women-led SMEs, VIS, Sustainable projects                          |         585 |\n| BID                |                                           | 220 SMEs led by women, SMEs,   women-owned VIS,/uni00A0Green portfolio |         220 |\n| OFID               |                                           | 50 Women-led SMEs, VIS, Green buildings                                |          50 |\n\nOur responsible investment policy (https://sostenibilidad.davivienda.com/en/) recognizes that the environmental and social dimensions are fundamental.

This system must be aligned with methodologies to evaluate and manage the risks and opportunities derived from climate change, and to assess compliance with the established targets.\n\nThis section shares advances made regarding indicators used to guide and measure our climate strategy performance, including the CO/two.denominator emissions reports, as well as objectives and metrics used to to manage risks and opportunities associated with climate change, based on the objectives and commitments related to the management of financial resources for green lines and portfolio alignment.\n\nDavivienda monitors the results of our internal operations by measuring our carbon footprint, the use of renewable energy in our facilities, our water efficiency program, and waste management. In business-related management, by including variables for climate change risk analysis into SARAS and the financing of climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.\n\n## ECO/hyphen.capEFFICIENCY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE REQUIRES COMMITMENT FROM\n\nGOVERNMENTS, ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS AND, IN GENERAL, FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT PROGRESS IS MADE TOWARDS ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MEET THIS AMBITIOUS GLOBAL AGENDA.\n\n## Measurement of direct impacts - Eco Efficiency\n\n| Indicator                                                                                                                 | 2019     | 2020     | 2021   | Reduction  compared to 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|--------|-------------------------------|\n| Scope 1                                                                                                                   |          |          |        |                               |\n| Emissions from  consumption of refrigerant  gas for air-conditioning and  power plant fuels   (Ton CO/two.denominator eq) | 2,904    | 2,596    | 2,620  | 9.8%                          |\n| Scope 2                                                                                                                   |          |          |        |                               |\n| Emissions from electric  energy consumption   (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                                                  | 7, 0 0 5 | 4,894    | 4.668  | 33%                           |\n| Scope 3 Emissions from  consumption of reams  of paper and air travel of  employees (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)            | 1,278    | 345      | 247    | 80.7%                         |\n| Total carbon footprint  (Ton CO/two.denominatoreq)                                                                        | 11,187   | 7, 8 3 6 | 7, 534 | 32.6%                         |\n\n| Goals with respect to 2019*.       | 2022   | 2023   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carbon footprint reduction Scope 1 | 1%     | 2%     |\n| Carbon footprint reduction Scope 2 | 4%     | 6%     |\n| Carbon footprint reduction Scope 3 | 17%    | 20%    |\n| Carbon footprint offsetting        | 80%    | 85%    |\n\n* Baseline year for this measurement.\n\nThe target defined for the year 2022 is to reduce the total carbon footprint, by 5% compared to 2019, taking into account the atypical scenario of 2019 and 2020 and once we return to work models with greater presence, the reduction will not be as big as in these two years.",

These changes have always occurred naturally, but since the 19th century human activities have been the main driver, mainly due to deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, which produce heat-trapping gasses. (United Nations)\n- CDP: Carbon Disclosure Project, a non-profit organization that manages the global disclosure system for investors, companies, cities, states, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. (CDP)\n- Decarbonization: Reducing the carbon share of energy consumption on a global scale. (Robeco)\n- Ideam: Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies of Colombia. (Ideam)\n- Resilience: Capacity of a living being to adapt to a disturbing agent or an adverse state or situation. (RAE)\n- Physical risk: Arises from the physical effects of increasingly severe and frequent extreme weather and climate-related events, such as droughts, floods or hurricanes,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand from progressive longer-term changes in weather patterns, such as increases in average temperature and changes in precipitation. These phenomena can cause direct damage to assets and infrastructure, disrupt supply chains or affect agricultural production, thereby reducing the value of assets and the profitability of companies. (Green Finance for Latin America and Caribbean)\n\n- Transition risk: Arises from processes geared towards a 'carbon neutral economy' and may be driven by changes in policy, regulations, technologies, or market trends. Policy changes could be, for example, restrictions on carbon emissions, carbon pricing, or more stringent energy efficiency standards. These changes may result in the rapid repricing of a wide range of asset values through unanticipated or premature write-downs of 'carbon-intensive industries'. (Green Finance for Latin America and Caribbean)\n- TCFD: Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure, an international organization that makes recommendations for more effective climate-related disclosures that could promote more informed insurance underwriting, credit and investment decisions and, in turn, enable stakeholders to better understand carbon-related asset concentrations in the financial sector.

Accordingly, in 2021 we continued to strengthen our risk management model for third parties and partners, harmonizing efforts with related companies, in order to prevent and address threats promptly.\n\nAs a result of our efforts, in 2021 we visited new third parties who, as partners, are important players in strengthening our risk management model.\n\nBased on our response to the health emergency, we have prioritized digital interaction with third parties and continued to conduct virtual assessments and tours of the facilities where they carry out their operations.\n\nWe have decided to move from a retrospective analysis of third parties to a continuous evaluation of the effectiveness of their risk management systems. By incorporating specialized technological tools, we will ensure that the analyses have a timely and positive impact on the development of the third parties' activities, in order to improve safety and control, thereby guaranteeing the achievement of common objectives and benefits for both parties.\n\nWe continue applying our risk management model for third parties and partners, which includes monitoring the life cycle of the relationships established with different companies. We have thus ensured that our third parties keep their security and control mechanisms up to date, in order to achieve the objectives established in our business relationship, aligned with industry best practices and comply with applicable regulations.\n\nIn 2021, we evaluated the risk management practices of 132 external parties. We also remained in permanent contact with these third parties to advise them, when applicable, on specific control and safety issues inherent to the activities they were entrusted with, within the framework of the signed contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF SPECIALIZED TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS,\n\nWE WILL ENSURE THAT THE ANALYZES HAVE A TIMELY AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THIRD PARTIES, SEEKING TO IMPROVE SECURITY AND CONTROL CONDITIONS, GUARANTEEING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF COMMON OBJECTIVES AND BENEFITS FOR BOTH PARTIES.\n\n## Sustainable procurement\n\nDavivienda establishes policies for those who are interested in becoming our business partners. All suppliers are subject to the provisions defined by Davivienda, where we promote transparency and objectivity in all negotiations and in the corporate objective of the contracts. Our vendor relationship policies are published on the vendor site, which may be accessed through the link: www.proveedores.davivienda.com, Relationship section / chapter 'Relationship Policies' that govern suppliers.\n\nFor this purpose, we incorporate, among other aspects, environmental, social and economic criteria for the procurement of goods and services provided by third parties to the Bank, observing the Sustainable Procurement Management Guide for the financial system published by the Colombian Banking Association (Asobancaria). The goods and services prioritized for sustainable procurement are computer equipment, household appliances, paper, lighting supplies and security, cleaning and cafeteria services. We also assessed the environmental and social risk management practices of our strategic suppliers, considering the likelihood of greater or lesser environmental or social impact, respectively.\n\nDavivienda has established sustainability criteria for the procurement of goods and services in accordance with the 'Procurement and Vendor Management Process', which includes a specific section for prioritized products and another section for the assessment of sustainable procurement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The application of this methodology has allowed us to promote among our suppliers the importance of managing environmental, social and climate change risks, as well as to leverage opportunities to measure, manage and report environmental indicators. In 2021, we assessed 61 suppliers, 92% of which were classified in environmental and social risk category B (medium) and 8% in category C (low).\n\nWe continue to strengthen the capacities of our suppliers with good environmental and social practices in the acquisition of goods and services.

My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of Consolidated Financial Statements section of my Report. I am independent of the Group in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) included in the Information Assurance Standards accepted in Colombia, together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the consolidated financial statements established in Colombia, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n\u00a9 2022 KPMG S.A.S., sociedad colombiana por acciones simplificada y firma miembro de la organizaci\u00f3n global de firmas miembro independientes de KPMG, afiliadas a KPMG Internacional Limited, una entidad privada inglesa limitada por garant\u00eda.

That determination is one of the most significant and complex estimates in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, due to the high degree of judgment involved in the development of the models to determine the impairment based on an expected loss approach required in the IFRS 9. The value of the loan portfolio and its respective impairment as of December 31, 2021 is $118,620,359 million and $5,374,361 million, respectively.\n\nI considered the evaluation of loan portfolio impairment as a key audit matter, because it involves significant measurement complexity that required judgment, knowledge and experience in the industry especially in relation to: (1) the evaluation of the methodologies used, including the methodology for estimating the loss due to default; (2) the probability of loss given the default and its key factors and assumptions; (3) the rating of the loans and qualitative factors that are incorporated into the variables of the internal models, which include impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, established by the Group; and (4) calculations of the estimated impairment due to credit risk of the entire loan portfolio.\n\nMy audit procedures to assess the adequacy of credit risk impairment included, among others, the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Involvement of professionals with experience and knowledge in the evaluation of credit risk and information technology, to evaluate certain internal controls related to the Group's process for determining the impairment of the loan portfolio. This included controls related to: (1) validation of the models that determine the probability of loss, severity and exposure at the time of default, (2) the Group's monitoring of the determination of portfolio impairment; (3) information technology controls over input data to models that determine credit impairment, as well as related calculations; (4) evaluation to identify whether there has been a significant change in credit risk; (5) the evaluation of the macroeconomic variables and the weighted scenarios used in the models to determine the deterioration of the loan portfolio; and (6) the verification of controls related to the evaluation of commercial credits analyzed individually and write-offs.\n- \u00b7 Professionals with knowledge in credit risk assessment and information technology assisted me in: (1) evaluating the methodologies and key data used to determine the probability of loss, severity and exposure in case of default, and the parameters produced by the models; (2) evaluate the macroeconomic variables and the weighted probability scenarios used in the internal models, including the\n\n3\n\nconsideration of alternative data for certain variables; (3) recalculation of the expected loss model and its related data; and (4) evaluate the qualitative adjustments applied to the model.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 are presented solely for comparative purposes. They were audited by another public accountant, a member of KPMG S.A.S. who in his report dated February 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe administration is responsible for the other information. The other information includes the content of the annual report, related to: 'Letter from the Chairman, results of our management, financial results and annex administrative aspects', but does not include the consolidated financial statements and my corresponding audit report\n\nMy opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and I do not express any form of assurance conclusion on it.\n\nIn connection with my audit of the consolidated financial statements, my responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether there is a material inconsistency between that information and the consolidated financial statements or my knowledge obtained in the audit, or whether in any way, there appears to be a material misstatement.\n\nIf, based on the work I have performed, I conclude that there is a material error in this other information, I am required to report this fact. I have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with the Group's Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia. This responsibility includes designing, implementing, and maintaining such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my Auditor's Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events so as to achieve a fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 I obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the Entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Group's consolidated financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the Group's audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\n4. OUR ENABLERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\nI communicate with Those Charged with the Group's Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide Those Charged with Governance with confirmation that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements for independence and that I have disclosed to them all relationships and other matters that might reasonably be considered to bear on my independence and, where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, I determine the matters that were of most significance in the audit of the current period's consolidated financial statements and, therefore, are the Key Audit Matters. I describe these matters in my Auditor's Report unless law or regulation prevents public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely exceptional circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my Report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably outweigh the benefits to the public interest of such communication.\n\n(Original signed in Spanish) Gustavo Adolfo Roa Camargo Statutory Auditor of Banco Davivienda S.A.

Transactions conducted during the period corresponding to the entity and its subsidiaries were recorded and the economic facts have been recognized  for  the  appropriate  amounts,  classified,  described  and  faithfully disclosed, taking into account the aspects referred to in the Conceptual Framework and in accordance with the Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe assertions made in the Financial Statements have been previously verified, in accordance with regulatory provisions. These assertions are faithfully drawn from the books in accordance with Article 37 of Law 222 of 1995. The Bank and its Subsidiaries rely on adequate procedures for control and disclosure of financial information.

Calle 90 No. 19C - 74 Bogot\u00e1 D.C. - Colombia\n\n## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT\n\nTo the Shareholders Banco Davivienda S.A.:\n\n## Report on the Audit of the Separate Financial Statements\n\n## Opinion\n\nI have audited the separate financial statements of Banco Davivienda S.A. (the Bank), which comprise the separate statement of financial position as at December 31, 2021 and the separate statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended and notes comprising significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nIn my opinion, the aforementioned separate financial statements, prepared in accordance with information faithfully taken from the books and attached to this report, present fairly, in all material respects, the separate financial position of the Bank as of December 31 of 2021, the separate results of its operations and its separate cash flows for the year ending on that date, in accordance with Accounting and Financial Information Standards accepted in Colombia, applied uniformly with the previous year.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nI conducted my audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). My responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of Separate Financial Statements section of my Report. I am independent of the Bank in accordance with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) included in the Information Assurance Standards accepted in Colombia, together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to my audit of the separate financial statements established in Colombia, and I have fulfilled my other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. I believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in my professional judgment, were of most significance in my audit of the separate financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of my audit of the separate financial statements as a whole and in forming my opinion thereon, and I do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n\u00a9 2022 KPMG S.A.S., sociedad colombiana por acciones simplificada y firma miembro de la organizaci\u00f3n global de firmas miembro independientes de KPMG, afiliadas a KPMG Internacional Limited, una entidad privada inglesa limitada por garant\u00eda.

This assigned risk rating is incorporated as a parameter in the reference model for calculating the provisions for credit risk of the commercial portfolio.\n\nMy audit procedures to assess the assignment of the credit risk rating and the effect on the provision included, among others, the following:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n- Involvement of professionals with experience and knowledge in the evaluation of credit risk and information technology, to evaluate certain internal controls related to the process carried out by the Bank to determine the provision of commercial credits. This included controls associated with: (1) validation of the credit risk rating assignment methodology and/or models under regulatory provisions, (2) the Bank's monitoring of credit risk rating assignment and the value result of provisions, (3) information technology controls over input data to loan provision determination models, as well as provision calculations; and (4) the evaluation to identify if there was a significant change in the credit risk of the commercial portfolio.\n- Inspection of a sample of credit portfolio files, to verify that the rating given to commercial portfolio clients complies with the guidelines defined by the Financial Superintendence of Colombia for the provisioning system and that it is supported by the financial characteristics , qualitative or economic of the client and its subsequent incorporation into the reference model for the calculation of provisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2020 are presented solely for comparative purposes. They were audited by another public accountant, a member of KPMG S.A.S. who in his report dated February 24, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with the Bank's Governance for the Separate Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these separate financial statements in accordance with Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia. This responsibility includes designing, implementing, and maintaining such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of separate financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies; and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\nIn preparing the separate financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose Charged with Governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Separate Financial Statements\n\nMy objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the separate financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an Auditor's Report that includes my opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these separate financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, I exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. I also:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank's ability to continue as a going concern. If I conclude that a material uncertainty exists, I am required to draw attention in my Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the separate financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify my opinion. My conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of my Auditor's Report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure, and content of the separate financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the separate financial statements present the underlying transactions and events so as to achieve a fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 I obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the Entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Group's financial statements. I am responsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the Group's audit. I remain solely responsible for my audit opinion.\n\nI communicate with Those Charged with the Bank's Governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during my audit.\n\nI also provide Those Charged with Governance with confirmation that I have complied with relevant ethical requirements for independence and that I have disclosed to them all relationships and other matters that might reasonably be considered to bear on my independence and, where applicable, related safeguards.\n\n4. OUR ENABLERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5\n\nFrom the matters communicated with Those Charged with Governance, I determine the matters that were of most significance in the audit of the current period's separate financial statements and, therefore, are the Key Audit Matters. I describe these matters in my Auditor's Report unless law or regulation prevents public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely exceptional circumstances, I determine that a matter should not be communicated in my Report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably outweigh the benefits to the public interest of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n- 1. Based on my test results, in my opinion, during 2021:\n- a) The bookkeeping of the Bank has been kept in accordance with legal regulations and accounting techniques.\n- b) The transactions recorded in the ledgers are in accordance with the bylaws and the decisions of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n- c) Correspondence, account vouchers, minute books and share registry books are duly kept and maintained.\n- d) The Bank has complied with the regulations and instructions of the Financial Superintendence of Colombia related to the adequate management and provisioning of assets received in payment and with the implementation and impact on the statement of financial position and the statement of income for the year of the applicable risk management systems.\n- e) There is a concordance between the accompanying financial statements and the Management Report prepared by the administrators, which includes the Management's acknowledgment of the free circulation of invoices issued by vendors or suppliers.\n- f) The information contained in the self-assessment statements of contributions to the Comprehensive Social Security System, particularly that related to affiliates and their contribution base income, has been taken from the accounting records and supports. The Bank is not in arrears for contributions to the Comprehensive Social Security System.\n\nIn order to comply with the requirements of Articles 1.2.1.2. and 1.2.1.5. of the Single Regulatory Decree 2420 of 2015, in development of the responsibilities of the Statutory Auditor contained in numerals 1) and 3) of Article 209 of the Commercial Code, related to the evaluation of whether the acts of the Partnership's administrators are in accordance with the bylaws and the orders or instructions of the Shareholders'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The  Audit  and  Financial Management Department verifies the operability of such systems.\n\nLikewise, we hereby inform that no significant deficiencies have been evidenced in the design and operation of internal controls that would have prevented the Bank from  recording,  processing,  summarizing  or  adequately  presenting  its  financial information. Management control activities have been carried out to prevent the risk of fraud in processes that affect the quality of financial information and to evidence changes in its evaluation methodology.\n\nAssets, liabilities and equity existing at the balance sheet date are recorded in the separate financial statements and represent probable future rights and obligations, respectively. The transactions that occurred during the period and that correspond to the entity were recorded and the economic facts have been recognized by the appropriate amounts, classified, described, and faithfully disclosed, in accordance with the aspects set forth in the Conceptual Framework and in accordance with the Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards accepted in Colombia.\n\nThe statements included in the Financial Statements have been previously verified, in accordance with regulatory provisions, and have been faithfully taken from the books in accordance with Article 37 of Law 222 of 1995.
