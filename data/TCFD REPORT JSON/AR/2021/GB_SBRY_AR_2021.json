        "page_content": "## Chairman's letter\n\nChairman Martin Scicluna reviews the business activity in the year.\n\nThis has been a year of delivering for all our stakeholders and I am immensely proud of what our business has achieved for our customers, colleagues, communities and our shareholders.\n\nThroughout our history Sainsbury's has always tried to do the right thing and our approach to supporting people in times of need has been particularly evident throughout the pandemic. At the very beginning we gave elderly and vulnerable customers priority access to home delivery slots - the first supermarket to do so and throughout the crisis we have paid colleagues who needed to stay at home. Together with our customers and colleagues, we continue to support charities and worthy causes around the world.\n\nAs COVID-19 continues to impact the economy and the cost of fuel, energy and raw materials continues to rise, we remain committed to doing everything we can to support our colleagues and customers through what may be challenging financial times ahead.\n\nDespite the difficulties presented by COVID-19, our colleagues continue to do a brilliant job for our customers and I would like to thank all of them for their dedication and commitment. We are committed to paying our colleagues fairly and have invested over \u00a3100 million in retail colleague pay. All Sainsbury's and Argos retail store colleagues can now earn the Living Wage wherever they work in the UK.\n\nOur Chief Executive Simon Roberts, and the Operating Board, have done an excellent job delivering against the key metrics we set out in November 2020. As a result of our strong profit performance and retail free cash flow generation, we are pleased to propose to shareholders the highest final and full-year dividend for seven years. We have used our strong cash generation in recent years to reduce debt and return around 50 per cent of underlying net earnings to shareholders through ordinary dividends. With debt reduction ahead of schedule, we are increasing our payout ratio to around 60 per cent.\n\nIn January we were deeply saddened by the death of our Life President, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover. He played a vital role in leading Sainsbury's through a period of significant change and making it the business it is today. His significant philanthropic contributions include the foundation of the Linbury Trust with his wife, Baroness Sainsbury of Preston Candover CBE, which supports a wide range of charitable causes. His contribution and retailing talent remains truly inspiring and we will continue to remember him and the immeasurable impact he made.\n\n## 2021/22 highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.9p\n\nProposed final dividend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 25.4p 1\n\nUnderlying basic earnings per share, up 117% versus 11.7p underlying basic earnings per share in the 2020/21 financial year\n\n13.1p\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProposed full-year dividend per share\n\n## 29.8p 2\n\nBasic earnings per share, versus 9.4p basic loss per share in the 2020/21 financial year\n\n## Strategic progress\n\nOne year into our three-year plan to transform Sainsbury's, Simon and his team are making very good progress. They are adapting our business at pace, simplifying operations and accelerating our cost savings programmes so that we can invest in food quality, choice and consistently lower prices for customers. Our portfolio brands Nectar, Argos, Habitat, Sainsbury's Bank and Tu - support our core food business, delivering for both customers and shareholders. The focus on value, innovation and service is driving volume market share performance ahead of our key competitors and, at a time of inflationary pressures for customers, we are improving our price position versus our key competitors 3 .\n\nArgos is delivering stronger profitability and Sainsbury's Bank achieved an important milestone by declaring a dividend of \u00a350 million back to the Sainsbury's Group.\n\nYou can read more about our progress to put food back at the heart of Sainsbury's on pages 10-11.\n\nIn June we launched our new sustainability strategy, Plan for Better, a core part of our strategy. Across the Group we are embedding climate considerations into our reporting and decision making, implementing bold targets and incentives in order to achieve our goal.\n\nThis year we strengthened our commitment to tackle the climate crisis, announcing the acceleration of our target to become Net Zero across our operations by five years, from 2040 to 2035. We have also committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions by 30 per cent by 2030. As signatories of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we are committed to providing consistent information to our stakeholders and our disclosure can be found on page 17.\n\n- 1 Refer to Alternative Performance Measures on pages 203 to 207 for definition and reconciliation to statutory measures.\n- 2 The results for 2021 and 2020 have been restated - refer to note 2 of the financial statements on page 113.\n- 3 NielsenIQ Panel data (YoY and 2 year 52 weeks volume growth differential to P13 FY21/22) of the year.",

        "page_content": "Collaboration is key to tackling the climate crisis. To this end we were proud to be the Principal Supermarket Partner of the United Nation's international climate change conference, COP26, which took place in Glasgow in November. I was inspired by the encouraging steps so many businesses, including Sainsbury's, are taking to address the challenges we face. We are now well into the next phase of delivering against the commitments we have set out. We are aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and, through Plan for Better, we can identify areas which matter most to our stakeholders, helping us to make real and meaningful improvements.\n\nOur commitment to Helping everyone eat better is progressing well as we encourage customers to make food choices that are both better for them and better for the planet. As part of our commitment to measure healthy and sustainable diets, we reported against our new target to achieve at least 83 per cent of 'healthy' and 'better for you' sales by 2025, currently at 80 per cent. We also disclosed our protein sales, with 72 per cent of protein sales being plant based and meat-free products.\n\nWe report on our Plan for Better progress every six months and you can read more about what we have delivered this year on pages 13 to 17.\n\n## Delivering for our customers\n\nWe know how important value is to customers and that the cost of living crisis is putting pressure on household budgets. We are taking bold steps to enhance the value we offer to customers and we are keeping prices lower than our competitors. Through the year our Price Lock promotion fixed the price of up to 2,000 items for at least eight weeks and our Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match campaign matches the discounter's prices on 240 popular items. This year we have increased the number of entry price level lines, offering customers lower prices on the products they buy most often, including fresh produce, as well as offering choice across price points.\n\nOffering customers new and innovative products is a key priority for us and we hit our target of tripling our levels of product innovation in the year, launching 1,950 new products. We are also working with third parties such as Boparan Restaurant Group, Coco di Mama and Starbucks to offer our customers more choice and great quality food and drink to eat-in or takeaway.\n\nWe are making our customers' lives easier through improving our digital offer. We are developing SmartShop and we continue to invest in our Groceries Online business, including rapid delivery through Chop Chop, Uber Eats and Deliveroo.\n\n## Delivering for our colleagues\n\nWe are committed to paying our 151,000 retail colleagues fairly and our wage bill is our biggest operating cost. Since 2017 we have increased the pay of Sainsbury's front line colleagues by 25 per cent and we have increased Argos colleagues' pay by 31 per cent over the last five years and have removed age-related pay.\n\nAll Sainsbury's and Argos store colleagues now receive an hourly base rate of at least \u00a310 per hour. This represents an increase of at least 5.3 per cent. This new rate of pay is 50p above the government's National Living Wage and 10p above Living Wage Foundation's Living Wage. We also increased inner London pay from \u00a310.10 to \u00a311.05 in line with the London Living Wage.\n\nWe were pleased to announce in April that from 1st May 2022 the outer London rate would also be moving to \u00a311.05 from \u00a310.50. This means that all Sainsbury's and Argos retail store colleagues can earn the Living Wage wherever they work in the UK.\n\nAs we balance the needs of all our stakeholders we will continue to discuss colleague pay on a regular basis. We commit to paying above the National Minimum Wage and, when setting pay each year, will consider the Living Wage, the National Living Wage, competitor pay and the financial performance of the business. We are also committed to maintaining a dialogue with all key stakeholders on the issue.\n\n' One year into our three-year plan to transform Sainsbury's, Simon and his team are making very good progress. They are adapting our business at pace, simplifying operations and accelerating our cost savings programmes so that we can invest in food quality, choice and consistently lower prices for customers.'\n\nIt is also important for us to be an inclusive retailer with diverse representation across all levels, so I am pleased to see progress being made in this area. Initiatives such as the adoption of the Halo Code and our admission to the Black British Network are just some of the achievements made this year and I am pleased our work has been recognised, with the I AM ME Ethnically Diverse Colleague Network featured in the Top 10 Network Groups in the UK at the Ethnicity Awards. We are also featured for the first time in the FTSE 100 Top Ten Best Performers list for Women in Leadership. We are proud to have published our Gender and Ethnicity Pay Report for a second year and have seen the pay differentials reduce during that time.\n\n## Delivering for our communities\n\nWe are committed to supporting our communities and fostering our charitable partnerships. I was delighted that this year we raised over \u00a36 million for Comic Relief, in addition to the \u00a32 million we donated as a business to support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine. Through our Ukrainian Crisis Appeal, customers and colleagues have also donated over \u00a3600,000 so far and we are matching donations up to an additional \u00a3500,000.\n\nOur partnership with Neighbourly helps to manage our back of store food donation programme, helping to connect Sainsbury's stores with local partners who will redistribute food to those in need. So far we have donated over 2.5 million meals, which is equivalent to \u00a34.8 million in savings for charities and community groups. This partnership also supports our sustainability targets as we have pledged to reduce our food waste by 50 per cent by 2030.",

        "page_content": "## Financial review\n\nWe delivered a strong performance this year. Underlying profit before tax was \u00a3730 million, up 25 per cent versus the full-year 2019/20. Last year's performance reflected significant costs associated with adapting our business to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nStatutory revenue was up 2.9 per cent to \u00a329,895 million and statutory profit before tax was \u00a3854 million versus \u00a3278 million in 2019/20, reflecting lower restructuring and impairment costs and exceptional income from settling legal disputes. We achieved strong Retail Free Cash Flow of \u00a3503 million and average Free Cash Flow delivery in the three years to March 2022 of \u00a3633 million. We are on track to deliver at least \u00a3500 million retail free cash flow per year.\n\nWe also delivered non-lease Net Debt reduction of \u00a31,381 million over the three years to March 2022, ahead of the target of \u00a3950 million+ over the four years to March 2023. Underlying basic earnings per share was 25.4p and basic earnings per share was 29.8p. We remain committed to maintaining our strong value position, are on track to deliver our 200 basis points cost reduction target and will invest in making improvements to our customer offer.\n\nIn 2021 we completed a thorough review of the Financial Services business and concluded that it was in the best interest of shareholders to retain Sainsbury's Bank.\n\nMore information on our financial performance can be found in the Financial Review on pages 32 to 37.\n\n## Delivering for our shareholders\n\nThe Board proposes a final dividend of 9.9p per share, bringing the full-year dividend to 13.1p per share. This will be the highest dividend the business has paid for seven years. The shareholder dividend is being paid on the full underlying profit number of \u00a3730 million, an increase of 24 per cent on the dividend from last year.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nThe Committee has considered a number of factors when determining incentive outcomes for the year, including the impact of COVID-19 on performance.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviews the underlying performance of the business and this year determined that the COVID-19 driven elevated grocery volumes caused an estimated net financial benefit of \u00a3100 million, which is reported within our underlying profit before tax of \u00a3730 million. For incentive purposes the Committee applied downward discretion to remove this \u00a3100 million impact from both the bonus outturn and the long-term incentive plan vesting level.\n\nSimon's remuneration for the year reflects the strong performance of the business and the progress we have made against our strategy. Under his strong leadership Sainsbury's grocery market share has increased and we have made significant strides with our value proposition against our competitors. We have also exceeded our cost savings target for the year. It should be noted that Simon waived his entitlement to a bonus for the 2020/21 financial year.\n\nSimon has demonstrated outstanding drive and energy to do the right thing for our customers and colleagues throughout the challenges faced and on behalf of the Board I would like to thank him for all of his hard work and significant achievements.\n\nFor more information on this year's remuneration awards please see pages 84 to 95.\n\n## Board changes\n\nIn April we were pleased to announce that Jo Bertram will join the Board as a Non-Executive Director and member of the CR&S Committee following the AGM on 7 July 2022, subject to shareholder approval. Jo Bertram is currently Managing Director, Business & Wholesale, at Virgin Media O2. Prior to this, Jo held roles at Uber and McKinsey. She is a highly talented strategic business leader whose broad experience in technology-led sectors will bring fresh perspective to the Board.\n\nWe also announced that Dame Susan Rice will step down at Sainsbury's AGM on 7 July after nine years' service with us. Throughout her time she has been steadfast in doing the right thing for our customers and colleagues. As Chair of the Remuneration Committee Susan has played a vital role in ensuring our approach to pay reflects our culture and values at all levels of the organisation. On behalf of all our colleagues I would like to thank Susan for her commitment and dedication to Sainsbury's.\n\nFinally, I would like to thank all of my colleagues for their extraordinary efforts, support and flexibility over the past year. Once again you have all risen to the challenges faced and you have been unwavering in your commitment to do the right thing for our customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Martin Scicluna\n\nChairman",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's Q&A\n\nOne year into Sainsbury's three-year plan, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, Simon Roberts explains how the business has been relentlessly focused on putting customers and colleagues first and doing the right thing.\n\n## 1. How has your first full year as CEO of Sainsbury's been?\n\nIt has been an unprecedented year in so many ways, for our customers, our colleagues, our suppliers and the communities where we trade. Throughout, we have been relentlessly focused on putting customers and colleagues first and doing the right thing, while at the same time working across our company to deliver our plan as we put food back at the heart of Sainsbury's. We said we would invest in value, innovation and service and that is exactly what we are doing and our results are showing that as we become more competitive, more and more customers are choosing to shop with us.\n\nCOVID-19 continued to impact our business as more people ate at home and government restrictions affected our customers' and colleagues' daily lives. With safety as our number one priority throughout the pandemic, we constantly tried to stay as close as possible to what mattered most to our customers and colleagues. We encouraged face mask wearing even when it was not mandatory and kept screens in the stores where customers wanted them. We also supported all our colleagues by paying those who were self-isolating or absent with COVID-19 related sickness, irrespective of their vaccination status.\n\nThe effects of COVID-19 and the UK's decision to leave the European Union also caused disruption to the industry's supply chains. Shortages of key workers such as HGV drivers put pressure on our ability to source and move products through the food supply chain and the pandemic caused higher absence levels, both in stores and for our suppliers. This meant that availability in our stores and online was challenged. While the backdrop was difficult, particularly as we approached Christmas, our teams worked exceptionally hard end to end across our business to make sure we had food for everyone. Our suppliers also did a great job under these challenging conditions, and I thank them for all their support for our business.\n\nAs the cost of living puts pressure on household budgets, we have made massive strides to improve our value offer. This is at the very core of our strategy to be Food First and I am encouraged by the progress we have made to become more competitive. We are delivering the best value for money in at least six years and are consistently inflating behind the market on the highest volume products by investing ahead of competitors with a clear focus on fresh food. The Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match campaign is really popular and we will continue to focus on being great value for our customers on the fresh and high-volume lines that are most important to them. Through the year our Price Lock promotion fixed the price of up to 2,000 items for at least eight weeks. Customers can be assured that prices will not rise on these products, helping them to plan and budget and through Price Lock we are holding down the prices of more products than our competitors.\n\nThis year we have seen such fantastic support and hard work from all of our colleagues right across the business and above all else, I want to thank every one of my colleagues for such an outstanding team effort in what have been challenging circumstances. Over the last 18 months we have strengthened our Operating Board to help us drive our company and our performance forward and I would like to thank all my colleagues on the Board for their leadership, commitment and support. I was delighted to promote Graham Biggart and appoint\n\n## 2021/22 highlights\n\n## \u00a3730m 1,2\n\nUnderlying profit before tax, up 104% versus the 2020/21 financial year and up 25% versus the 2019/20 financial year\n\n## 3.4%\n\nRetail sales growth (inc. fuel)\n\n## 20%\n\nReduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions within our own operations, against our 2018/19 baseline\n\nhim to the newly created role of Chief Transformation Officer.

What are you most proud of?\n\nI am so proud of our colleagues and the entire Sainsbury's team. Every day across our company I see and hear about our colleagues consistently going above and beyond in showing genuine care and concern for our customers and doing their very best to help. Our colleagues have done a brilliant job, to navigate the pandemic, manage labour shortages, and more recently the impact of the devastating war in Ukraine as well as the cost of living crisis, which I know is a big concern for us all. Every one of our team has shown extraordinary resilience, determination and commitment to working as a team over the last year and I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to each and every one of them.\n\nIn recognition of the role our retail colleagues play in delivering for our customers and in all of our success, we were the first major supermarket to pay colleagues the Living Wage wherever they are in the UK.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## \u00a3854m 2\n\nStatutory profit before tax versus a loss of \u00a3164 million in the 2020/21 financial year and versus \u00a3278 million in the 2019/20 financial year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a3141m\n\nNon-lease net debt\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## ' By putting our customers and colleagues first and doing the right thing, I'm confident we can build on the momentum we have and continue to make good progress against our plan.'\n\nI am pleased with the momentum we have been building against our plan. By putting our customers first and doing the right thing for our colleagues, I'm confident we can build on this strong first year we have had in food, supported by our Brands that Deliver and Save to Invest.\n\nWe have learnt a lot over the last year as a business about where we can improve, move faster and work more effectively. We have become more agile in anticipating the rapidly changing environment around us and changes in how our customers are shopping. It will be so important we continue to push forward and while, of course, it is challenging to make the changes we are making, it has been really positive to see what we have been capable of across our entire business as we all learn to adapt and work smarter.\n\n## 3. What have been the biggest shifts in the market?\n\nThe rapid shift to customers shopping groceries online has been particularly stark. Whilst shopping patterns are beginning to return to what we saw before the pandemic began, 17 per cent of the food and groceries we sell is bought online, up from less than 9 per cent two years' ago. More than ever, customers want to be able to choose how and when to shop, fuelling the rise of On Demand services, particularly across grocery. We have responded by investing in our online and digital channels and growing our On Demand offer. Customers are now able to receive Sainsbury's orders in as little as 30 minutes through Chop Chop, our rapid delivery service, and through our partnerships with Uber Eats and Deliveroo. This rapid move online accelerated by the pandemic has continued in General Merchandise as we have accelerated the transformation of Argos. Last year 39 per cent of all our sales across the business were completed online.\n\nDuring the pandemic, cooking at home was central to the way households came together and as finances are increasingly under pressure, shoppers are looking for cost-effective ways to enjoy eating and drinking together. We are really well positioned to help customers with this, offering value across a great choice of food, at different price points. We are also innovating in response to the shift towards eating at home and cooking from scratch, developing over 200 products as part of our 'Inspired to Cook' range, which makes home cooking simple and tasty for customers. We also see customers trading up more and sales of Taste the Difference are up 15 per cent on two years ago.\n\nThe pandemic has put supplier relationships under the spotlight and those retailers like us with scale and strong networks have been able to work with suppliers to minimise the impact of rising inflation as much as possible. We have witnessed significant labour shortages and like other retailers, we increased the recruitment of online van and HGV drivers to ensure we were able to maximise delivery availability and ensure the best possible availability for our customers.\n\n## 4. What is the biggest challenge ahead?\n\nWe know everyone is feeling the impact of inflation which is why we are so determined to deliver the best value for money we can for our customers. As a result of being bold in our cost saving plans, we are able to drive investment back into lower food prices and as a result, we are consistently inflating behind competitors on the products customers buy most often. We have real momentum in the business, having outperformed key competitors on both a one and two-year\n\nbasis while also delivering strong underlying profit growth, improved returns and consistent retail cash flow. This gives us a strong foundation to keep building momentum in the year ahead and that is what we are focused on ensuring we do. We have a clear strategy and a clear plan and whilst the year ahead will be more challenging, I believe we are well set to navigate these conditions as we drive our strategy forward and continue to deliver the best value, innovation and service we can for our customers.\n\n## 5. What did you learn at COP26?\n\nWe know that the issues of climate change and protecting biodiversity are very important to all our customers and to all our colleagues. Tackling the climate crisis requires collaboration at all levels and at COP26 it was inspiring to see what can be achieved when we all pull together at the world level. COP26 was also an opportunity to drive meaningful progress and represent and campaign for real change on behalf of our industry.\n\nAlongside four other major UK retailers, we were really pleased to sign WWF's Retailers' Commitment for Nature, pledging to come together in force to halve the environmental impact of the UK food sector by 2030. And, we are also building on our commitments to reduce carbon emissions, deforestation, food waste and the packaging we produce.\n\nProgress on the critical issue of climate change can only work if countries, industries and organisations work systematically to implement change across all their operations. At COP26 we announced the acceleration of our target to become Net Zero across our own operations by five years, from 2040 to 2035, in line with the UN's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. Last year we also set an absolute target to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, and in delivering these targets we will also endeavour to help our customers make more sustainable choices when they shop with us.\n\nThe key will be for everyone to act on the promises they made at COP26 and to really focus on making the step change needed to confront global warming. We all need to be bold and constantly challenge ourselves to do better - I am really clear that we can only make the scale of change needed by working together with all our stakeholders to find new and innovative ways to adapt consumer habits and implement practices that are better for the planet, better for customers and better for everyone.\n\n## 6. How do you feel about the next 12 months?\n\nI feel really positive and energised by the momentum we have and the brilliant teams we have working across our business. We are fully committed to do everything we can to help our customers navigate the increasing costs of living and keep prices as low as we can. We start this year in a good position financially, with continued operating momentum supporting our strong competitive position.\n\nOur strong focus on delivering value, innovation and service for our customers and driving through our cost savings programme puts us in a good position relative to our competitors and we expect to continue our strong grocery volume market share performance.\n\nWe have a clear focus on keeping prices low and we will remain committed in our determination to help everyone eat better as we deliver for our customers, our colleagues, and our shareholders whatever the external environment may bring.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSimon Roberts\n\nChief Executive Officer",

        "page_content": "## The Sainsbury's Difference\n\n## Sainsbury's brand\n\nSainsbury's is a trusted, well-loved brand that has been bringing high quality, great value food to customers for over 150 years. Argos, Habitat, Tu , Nectar and Sainsbury's Bank are complementary and give customers more reasons to shop with us.\n\n## Scale\n\nWe offer customers a choice of quality products. We have scale positions in both food and non-food purchasing and can profitably deliver a wide range of products and services to customers.\n\n## Strong operating cash flows\n\nOur scale, customer proposition and operational efficiency generate strong operating cash flows to reinvest in our customer offer and adapt to rapidly changing shopping habits, while also paying dividends and strengthening the balance sheet.\n\n## Attractive customer base\n\nSainsbury's is a trusted brand, loved by millions of customers across the UK. We serve an attractive customer base and two thirds of the UK population have shopped with Sainsbury's over the last year 1 with a bias to a more affluent sociodemographic than key competitors.\n\n## How we create value\n\n## For customers\n\nWe listen carefully to our customers and we invest in what matters to them. Our focus is on offering a broad range of great value, high quality products - we then focus on strong availability and excellent customer service, all delivered through our attractive stores and a range of convenient digital channels. And we reward our customers for their loyalty. We want to help everyone eat better and are helping our customers to improve diets while reducing their impact on the environment, one plate at a time.\n\nFor more information about how we engage with our stakeholders, see pages 24 to 29.\n\n## For colleagues\n\nWe invest in our colleagues and are committed to paying them fairly for their efforts. By creating an engaged workforce that is invested in the progress of the business and the role they play in our success, we will achieve high retention rates and deliver superior customer service. See page 25 for more detail.\n\n## Stores\n\nOur stores are well-placed, with a strong presence in the South and in high footfall convenience locations. This helps us offer customers complementary products, such as Tu , Argos and Habitat, as well as complementary services such as financial services. Through our stores we can also present the offers of carefully selected concession partners.\n\n## Service\n\nCustomers come to Sainsbury's for our outstanding customer service. Our 171,000 colleagues are integral to our long-term success.\n\n## Online scale\n\nOur Groceries Online business is increasingly profitable and in the 2020/21 financial year we became the second largest online grocery retailer.\n\nArgos is the UK's third most visited online retailer and we are making good progress to reduce the number of Argos standalone stores we have and to offer more Argos stores inside Sainsbury's stores. We are improving the Argos distribution model, focusing on high volume Local Fulfilment Centres (LFCs) to improve choice and availability.\n\n## Nectar\n\nNectar provides a vital competitive advantage to our food business, our brands and a wide range of partners. It has strong profit growth prospects through data monetisation and growing coalitions. It enables us to offer our customers personalised rewards for their loyalty.\n\n## For suppliers\n\nWe are proud of our strong supplier relationships and we work collaboratively with them to grow our business and theirs. By improving technology and simplifying processes we are making it easier for our suppliers to do business with us. See page 27 for more detail.\n\n## For shareholders\n\nOur Chief Executive Simon Roberts, and the Operating Board, have done a very good job delivering against the key metrics we set out in November 2020. As a result of our strong profit performance and free cash flow generation, we are pleased to propose to shareholders the highest final and full-year dividend for seven years. We have used our strong cash generation in recent years to reduce debt and return around 50 per cent of underlying net earnings to shareholders through ordinary dividends. With debt reduction ahead of schedule, we are increasing our payout ratio to around 60 per cent.\n\n## For communities\n\nWe play an active role in local communities. Our customer feedback programme and customer surveys help shape our community programmes and this year we raised \u00a338.4 million for good causes. See page 28 for more detail.",

Our portfolio brands - Argos, Habitat, Tu , Nectar and Sainsbury's Bank -\n\nsupport our core food business, delivering for customers and shareholders in their own right.

        "page_content": "## Our priorities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are putting food back at the heart of Sainsbury's. This means we are focused on lowering prices, launching new products and improving service.\n\nWe have gained grocery volume market share from our key supermarket competitors on both a one and two-year basis 1 and sales are up 7.6 per cent on a two-year basis.\n\n## Value\n\nWe are making good progress to improve the value of our food. We know that the current cost of living situation is challenging for everyone and we are relentlessly focused on delivering consistent long-term value by offering customers great quality, tasty food at low prices. As a result of being bold in our cost savings plan, we are able to drive investment back into lower food prices and we are consistently inflating behind competitors on the products customers buy most often - including milk, eggs, potatoes, bread, vegetables, fish and meat. As a result, our relative price position has remained strong throughout the year - improving 310 basis points against Aldi, year-on-year 2 , leading to more customers shopping with us. By focusing on fresh and high-volume lines we are offering customers better value, improving price perception and delivering strong volume market performance.\n\nThrough the year our Price Lock promotion fixed the price of up to 2,000 items for a minimum of at least eight weeks. Customers can be assured that prices will not rise on those products, helping them to plan and budget. Through Price Lock we are holding down the prices of more products than our competitors.\n\nWe have also increased the number of entry price point products on offer for customers, including Greengrocer fruit & vegetables, J. James meat and poultry and Stamford Street ready meals offer customers a wide choice of products.\n\n## Innovation\n\nWe have delivered our plan to triple the number of new lines we sell, launching over 1,900 products across all our food brands. We developed our 'Inspired to Cook' range in response to the shift towards eating at home and cooking from scratch, launching a range of over 200 products across Grocery and Fresh Foods which make home cooking simple and tasty for customers. In March we launched 350 new branded World Food products, our biggest investment into this category to date and in the first six weeks sales are up significantly.\n\nOur premium Taste the Difference range continues to perform well, particularly at key seasonal and celebratory moments when people want to trade up, such as Christmas and Easter. We have grown sales by 15 per cent versus two years ago.\n\nIn March we began our food hall transformation programme. We have rolled out our successful Beauty Hall format in more stores, improved the layout of our fresh ranges to make it easier for customers to shop, increased our popular World Foods ranges and improved our in-store bakeries. We have also simplified some of our ranges and provided a greater breadth of products across others, delivering more choice for customers on the products they really want.\n\n## Service\n\nWe are committed to rewarding our colleagues and all Sainsbury's and Argos retail colleagues now receive a base rate of pay of \u00a310 per hour, above both the National Living Wage and the Living Wage. In March we increased inner London pay from \u00a310.10 to \u00a311.05 in line with the London Living Wage. We have announced that from 1 May 2022 the outer London rate will also be moving to \u00a311.05, from \u00a310.50. This means that all Sainsbury's and Argos retail colleagues earn the Living Wage wherever they are in the UK. We were the first supermarket among the big four to make this happen.\n\nAlongside competitive pay we also offer a comprehensive benefits package, including year-round colleague discount of 10 per cent, increased to 15 per cent for five days around every pay day, pension contributions and an improved family leave policy.\n\nWe improved customer service scores in supermarkets 3 and are adapting our Sainsbury's store estate to offer more new and innovative products. This year we opened four new supermarkets and as part of our drive to offer a broader range of distinctive food to customers in-store, on the move and at home, we announced bold new plans to transform our eat-in, takeaway and home delivery offer. Through a partnership with Boparan Restaurant Group we have developed 'The Restaurant Hub' format, a food hall style offer with different brands which we will roll out across 30 stores in the next year, with more to come in the future. We will also open 30 Starbucks caf\u00e9s in Sainsbury's stores in the next year, bringing the total number to 60. We took the decision to close 200 underperforming caf\u00e9s in the Spring.\n\nOur Convenience business grew 9 per cent driven by more people returning to the workplace, with sales now broadly back at prepandemic levels. We opened 19 convenience stores and closed 23. We are making progress with our plan to open more Neighbourhood Hub stores which give customers a larger, more convenient local store with a wider produce range, more choice and better services.\n\n39 per cent of our overall business now comes through digital channels, versus 23 per cent in FY 2019/20. We are seeing a normalisation of pre-COVID-19 shopping patterns as customers are returning to shopping in stores and demand for Groceries Online, non-food home delivery and Click & Collect has stabilised, although it remains more than double pre-pandemic levels.",

Sales were down three per cent over two years and were impacted by availability issues caused by supply chain disruptions and the strategic decisions we made to reduce promotions and exit less profitable categories. Reflecting this focus, household and home and furniture sales grew while sales of toys, consumer electronics and technology categories declined. We have grown our furniture market share over the past two years, driven by Habitat, Sainsbury's and Argos's main home and furniture brand. Following a relaunch in September, Habitat products are now available in 600 Sainsbury's stores and online via the Argos and Habitat websites. We are growing our digital presence to ensure that we are well placed to serve customers who increasingly want to buy online. 80 per cent of Argos sales are now online, up from 63 per cent two years ago.\n\nNectar supports our ambitions in food by giving customers personalised rewards for their loyalty. 9.3 million digital Nectar users can benefit from personalised offers with us and with our Nectar partners. This year we launched My Nectar Prices - an innovative data-led tool which gives customers discounted prices that are personal to them, delivering even more value for loyal customers. Over one million customers are benefitting from lower prices and we will develop the proposition further. Nectar360, our marketing services business, is making good progress and we are on track to hit our 2026 plan on profit.",

Our property rationalisation programme is on track and this year we closed four underperforming supermarkets and 23 convenience stores. We are also working to improve the efficiency of Groceries Online, moving stores to a new, more efficient routing system and improving pick rates, which will save the business around \u00a350 million overall. In addition, we are investing to improve the checkout experience for customers and colleagues which will drive around \u00a350 million of cost efficiencies. This includes trialling improvements to the layout of self-service areas, making it easier for colleagues to help customers, reducing queuing times and creating additional space for shoppers with trolleys, increasing participation.\n\nWe are making good progress in Argos's end-to-end transformation programme, which will save \u00a3105 million over three years. We have opened five Local Fulfilment Centres (LFCs) and as a result, our customers are benefitting from improved availability, faster delivery and more collection options; we plan to open nine more LFCs this year. In line with improving availability and convenience for customers whilst reducing costs, this year we opened 64 Argos stores inside\n\nSainsbury's supermarkets plus 62 in-store collection points. We have closed 73 standalone Argos stores this year. As of 5 March 2022, Argos has 728 stores, of which 400 are inside Sainsbury's supermarkets.\n\nWe partner with third parties and outsource where necessary to deliver for our customers, whilst supporting our own cost saving programme and our focus on food.

As a UK retailer with a food, general merchandise and clothing business, we source from countries all over the world, therefore the production, sourcing, packaging and disposal of these products can have major consequences. Our commitment to Helping everyone eat better means we are playing a leading role in offering delicious, affordable food that supports healthy and sustainable diets, helping customers reduce their impact on the planet, one plate at a time.\n\nIn June 2021 we launched our Plan for Better, a key pillar of our business strategy. Our Plan for Better covers our environmental and social commitments and sets out our sustainability goals across our whole business, outlining our priority areas of focus, our key commitments and our progress. The plan consists of three interlocking pillars; Better for you, Better for the planet and Better for everyone, and we have committed to reporting twice a year to transparently share our progress. Our standalone Plan for Better reports can be found at www.about.sainsburys.co.uk .\n\n## 2.5 million\n\nmeals donated via our partnership with Neighbourly\n\nThe development of our Plan for Better was informed by identifying the areas that are most material to our stakeholders and ensuring alignment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This year we have undertaken another materiality exercise across our stakeholders to understand the priority areas of focus across the different groups. Using this insight we continue to evolve our strategy to ensure it's fit for purpose and addressing the areas where we can have a significant impact.\n\nThe past year has seen us host our first ESG investor event and our sponsorship of COP26. We have worked on improving transparency and increasing disclosures in our reporting with our first SASB disclosure and implementation of TCFD recommendations (see page 17 for our TCFD disclosure). We have also rolled out our food redistribution partnership with Neighbourly to all our supermarkets. In the year ahead we are looking forward to launching refreshed commitments and plans across our social agenda, including human rights and community and partnerships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have over 171,000 colleagues who are critical to the long-term success of our business. We are committed to being an inclusive employer where everybody is treated fairly and with respect and is encouraged to develop their skills and fulfil their potential. We are passionate about playing an active role in our communities, and are committed to championing human rights.\n\n## An inclusive place to work and shop\n\nWe want our colleagues to feel connected and engaged, and measure this through our annual colleague engagement survey and our regular 'temperature check' surveys. An essential part of the survey process is sharing the results and making real and tangible actions that make a difference to our colleagues' experience. This year we introduced new metrics into the survey; overall as a company a score of 68 was achieved for colleagues stating how happy they are at work, whilst 78 per cent of colleagues told us they are able to be themselves at work. After each colleague engagement survey, line managers explore their local survey results with their teams and work together to plan and implement actions that will help make Sainsbury's a truly great place to work.\n\n## 78%\n\nof colleagues told us they are able to be themselves at work\n\nWe continue to work on representation and transparency across the business and have published our second integrated Gender and Ethnicity Pay Report this year. We have reduced our mean gender pay gap by 1.2 per cent to 8.5 per cent, while our median gender pay gap has decreased by 0.3 per cent to 4.7 per cent. Our mean ethnicity pay gap is negative at minus 0.9 per cent; this is a result of our hourly paid store colleagues receiving the same hourly rate and just under 40 per cent of our ethnically diverse colleagues work in stores that attract a location premium (i.e. inner and outer London), compared to just under 6 per cent of our white colleagues.\n\nTo ensure sustained improvement, we continue to look at focused initiatives, culture and accountability through targets. We have set stretching targets to take us to 2024 which covers more of our colleague population and also forms part of our long-term incentives for management. Progress on diverse representation at senior leadership and senior management positions can be seen in the table on page 14. Across the entire business, female representation is 52.7 per cent.",

        "page_content": "## Health and safety\n\nThe health and safety of our colleagues and customers is a key part of our strategy. We have seen a long-term decline in both colleague and customer reportable injuries over the past five years; our colleague reportable accidents have decreased by 2.8 per cent, whilst our customer reportable accidents have decreased by 39.7 per cent. An independent safety team supports our retail and logistics operations. They provide a combination of coaching, expertise and challenge to our line managers using our innovative risk mapping tool, utilising data from a wide range of sources to identify the key areas requiring support in any of our stores across the business. This helps us to ensure that we have the right level of compliance in place around key areas such as training, fire safety and adherence to procedures, as well as reviewing culture in individual stores through the lens of colleagues, regional management and safety teams.\n\nOur governance processes ensures colleagues can feedback on issues, regular engagement with our unions and Board oversight. This includes our Great Place to Work groups, divisional level safety steering groups, our Group Safety Committee which reports into the Operating Board, as well as quarterly updates to the plc Board. We have strong and well-established Primary Authority relationships in place that cover all our risk areas across health and safety, food safety, fire safety and petroleum safety. These relationships are built on a foundation of trust and we openly share information with our Primary Authority .\n\n## Community and partnerships\n\nWe play an active role in the communities we serve and this year we have raised a total of \u00a338.4 million for good causes. This year we have developed our new community and partnerships strategy, with a focus on food poverty. Our strategy is underpinned by two key pillars - access to food and prevention, which will be delivered through three key programmes to support Helping everyone eat better: food donation, local activation and prevention.\n\n## \u00a338.4 million\n\n## raised for good causes this year\n\nA key priority for the last year has been around access to food and to increase the redistribution of surplus food for human consumption. In August 2021 we began our partnership with Neighbourly, which has since been rolled out to all supermarkets. From August to March we donated a total of 2,567,803 meals, which is equivalent to a \u00a34,878,826 million saving to charities and community groups (based on \u00a31.90 per meal).\n\nTo support our local communities impacted by food poverty, we ran our Help Brighten a Million Christmases campaign again this year from 1-24 December, generating \u00a32.6 million for our partners. This year we also launched our Helping everyone eat better Community Grants for stores to nominate partner organisations tackling food insecurity to apply for grants of \u00a3500. Through our partnership with FareShare, with our customers, \u00a31.7 million was donated allowing them to support charities across the UK at the heart of our communities, supporting those individuals impacted by food poverty.\n\nWe have continued our longstanding partnership with Comic Relief and this year raised \u00a36.2 million for the Red Nose Day campaign. In March, we also worked with Comic Relief to support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine by launching a Ukrainian Crisis Appeal, donating \u00a32 million and an additional \u00a3600,000 donated by our customers via Nectar Donate and donations at checkout.\n\nAlongside our community investment, we make positive economic contributions through our responsible approach to tax. We contributed \u00a32.3 billion in taxes borne and collected this year. For more information on how we serve our communities visit www.about.sainsburys.co.uk for our Plan for Better report.\n\n## Championing human rights\n\nWe want to treat people fairly throughout our business and supply chains and we remain committed to respecting human rights. We understand how intertwined environmental and social sustainability are, and how the challenges in both areas are interconnected, therefore as part of a just transition to Net Zero, we want to place the people in our supply chains at the heart of our move to a low-carbon world. This year we have undertaken an extensive review of the most salient human rights risks facing the people in our supply chain and are using this to inform the development of our new social sustainability strategy, which we will be reporting progress on later this year.\n\nWe recognise the importance of supply chain transparency. Having previously published our Tier 1 clothing sites, this year we also published our Tier 1 food sites with information such as addresses, number of workers, gender split and union membership. We also acknowledge the need for further transparency, therefore we will be publishing lists of our General Merchandise and Goods Not for Resale sites in the year ahead, as well as working to achieve greater visibility of the challenges faced further down the supply chain.\n\nIn 2017, we launched our Modern Slavery Risk Tool, giving us unique insights into slavery risks across a complex global supply chain, and we continue to embed the tool into the business by using its results for internal risk assessments. In 2020 we increased the scope of this risk to cover all human rights risks and this year have continued the tools development by updating risk data to ensure we have the most up-to-date data on the risks in our supply chain. We identify vulnerable workers and do not tolerate any form of slavery or servitude in our own operations. For more information on our approach to social sustainability and to read our Human Rights Policy and Modern Slavery Statement, please visit\n\nwww.about.sainsburys.co.uk .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Healthy and sustainable diets for all\n\nWe know that food that is better for us is also better for the planet. This is why we have committed to develop and deliver healthy, sustainable diets for all. This year we built on our mass colleague and customer campaign, Helping everyone eat better, to raise awareness and drive behaviour change. We want to encourage people to eat more in line with the principles of the government's Eatwell Guide and to help make healthy eating choices more affordable, easy and tasty. To support customers to incrementally improve their diets, we have developed recipes which change up well-loved recipes such as curries, lasagnes and casseroles, and offer hints such as encouraging customers to mix half pulses with half meat.\n\nThis year we reported against our target to measure healthy and sustainable diets. We aim to achieve at least 83.1 per cent of 'healthy' and 'better for you' sales by 2025, currently sitting at 80 per cent, remaining flat year-on-year.",

        "page_content": "We undertook an extensive piece of work to review the nutrition criteria used to define 'healthy' and 'better for you sales'. This approach will help us identify better choices within categories for both branded and own-brand products, along a spectrum from less healthy to most healthy. We also disclosed our protein sales, with 72 per cent of protein sales tonnage being plant based and meat-free products, of which 12 per cent is entirely plant based 1 .\n\nWe continue to utilise 'test and learns' to help nudge customer behaviour by incentivising customers with value pricing or additional Nectar points with initiatives such as our discounted 60p fruit and vegetable campaign and The Great Big Fruit & Veg Challenge. We also continued to support customers by topping up the Healthy Start vouchers, provided by the government to low-income pregnant women and families with children under the age of four. The vouchers consisted of a \u00a32 fruit and vegetable coupon, more than any other retailer, to help families in need have access to nutritious produce through the half-term and summer holidays. In the six months the programme ran, we supported over 17,000 customers to take home an additional 1.2 million portions of fruit and vegetables.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principal Supermarket Partner of COP26\n\nThis year we were Principal Supermarket Partner of COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference, which took place in Glasgow in November 2021. Our aim was to demonstrate strong industry leadership and inspire our colleagues, customers and other businesses to rally together to protect and restore our planet for the future. During the event we hosted multiple events, bringing in experts from across our business to discuss industry challenges as well as hosting an exhibition space to engage the public on how we can all eat better by making small changes to our plates.\n\nWe also announced our commitment, alongside other retailers, to work with the WWF to halve the environmental impact of UK baskets by 2030. We recognise that solutions to the grand challenges that we are facing cannot be solved in isolation, therefore we are committed to working as an industry to identify the key issues that we face and collaborate so that we can accelerate progress together.\n\n## Reducing carbon emissions\n\nThis year we announced the acceleration of our carbon emissions target to become Net Zero in our own operations by 2035, five years earlier than our original ambition. Overall, we have reduced our absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within our operations to 762,119 tCO2e, a reduction of 7 per cent year-on-year and 20 per cent from our 2018/19 baseline, keeping us on course for our new 2035 target. In 2021 we hit some key milestones with the rollout of LED lighting to 100 per cent of our supermarket estate, reducing lighting energy consumption by an average of 70 per cent, with a plan to install 100 per cent LED across our entire estate by the end of 2022/23. We also transitioned to 100 per cent renewable electricity across the entire estate and have committed to the long-term purchasing of renewable energy from new wind farms and solar projects, significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nWe are proud to be recognised by CDP, an environmental impact disclosure system, for our environmental transparency. We were awarded an A rating for climate change for the eighth consecutive year, the only UK retailer to have achieved this. We were also recognised by CDP as a Supplier Engagement Leader for our work engaging with our suppliers to tackle climate change.\n\nAs part of our commitment to reduce our value chain emissions, this year we've written to 400 of our key suppliers, who constitute a high proportion of our value chain emissions, requesting that they disclose their carbon emissions through the CDP or Higg platform. We currently have 87 per cent of our key food suppliers disclosing via CDP. We have also set an expectation that our suppliers should commit to their own Net Zero science-based targets, aligned to the highest ambition of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. This builds on our existing science-based target, defined with the Carbon Trust, to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, whereby our baseline is 26,663,081 tCO2e (2018/19). This includes reducing emissions from purchased goods, upstream transport and distribution, services sold and our customers' use and consumption of the products we sell.\n\n## 20%\n\n## reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions within our own operations, against our 2018/19 baseline\n\n## Reducing food waste\n\nWe are committed to reducing food waste by 50 per cent across the whole value chain by 2030; driven by the multi-faceted environmental and social challenges created by food loss and waste.\n\nThis year we have reduced our operational food waste tonnage by 2.4 per cent year-on-year, a reduction of 13 per cent from our 2019/20 baseline. Where we can't donate surplus food to charity, we send surplus food to UK farms, via our partners, to be used in animal feed. We've been sending surplus bread for use in animal feed since 2013 and this year we trialled diverting unsold fruit, vegetables and salad as well.  We've also been working with suppliers on specifications this year in order to utilise more of the crop.\n\nWe increased our food redistribution to people by 119 per cent year-on-year, to 4,072 tonnes, an increase of 161 per cent from our 2019/20 baseline. A key driver of this increase has been our partnership with Neighbourly which we rolled out to all supermarkets this year with convenience store rollout planned for the year ahead. Neighbourly helps us manage our back of store food donation programme, connecting our stores to a network of over 17,000 charities, schools and community groups. This partnership ensures both the social and environmental investments already made in food production are not wasted and that any surplus food gets redirected to people who need it most. Please see the Community and partnerships section on page 15 for more information.\n\nWe continue to collaborate with industry on reducing food waste and support the delivery of Courtauld 2025/Champions 12.3. We've been members of UK Food Waste Reduction Roadmap since 2018 and are pleased many of our Fresh suppliers are also signed up, covering 43 per cent of our total sales. We also continue to work with WRAP to implement their guidance on upstream and downstream food waste, including increasing behavioural tips on product labelling. This year we also engaged suppliers on aligning with WRAP's best practice on redistributing own-label products within the supply chain, evolving our guidelines so that suppliers can redistribute any Sainsbury's own-label products to our chosen food donation partners.\n\n1",

        "page_content": "## Reducing use of plastic packaging\n\nWe have seen an absolute reduction in plastic packaging of 2.2 per cent from our 2018 baseline and relative reduction (tonnes per million units sold) of 4.7 per cent from our 2018 baseline. Year-onyear the tonnage has decreased by 626 tonnes to 117,333 tonnes, which puts us behind our target trajectory. We recognise that we have a lot more to do to reduce our plastic packaging tonnage and meet our target to reduce this by 50 per cent by 2025. We continue to implement a number of strategies aiming to remove, reduce, replace and recycle the amount of plastic packaging, including:\n\n- -Removing plastic and replacing with paper straws in our ownbrand range of lunchbox juice cartons, this equates to the removal of 18.5 million plastic straws from circulation each year to reduce plastic by 6.6 tonnes\n- -Removing film overwrap from own-brand tea boxes to reduce plastic by over 15 tonnes\n- -Reducing by light-weighting our own-brand water bottles and caps to reduce by over 300 tonnes\n- -Reducing by light-weighting our own-brand bleach bottle caps to reduce plastic by 24 tonnes\n- -Replacing plastic with card trays for own-brand sausage rolls and snacks to reduce plastic by over 65 tonnes\n- -Replacing plastic with pulp fibre trays for own-brand eggs, to reduce plastic by over 230 tonnes\n- -Recycling opportunities for customers by rolling out front of store collection points at all our large supermarket stores for customers to bring back any flexible plastic packaging such as salad bags, crisp packets and food pouches for recycling\n\n## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Introduction\n\nWith the impacts of climate change being felt around the world, we understand the important leadership role we can play to help reduce the impact of the food system on the climate. We are proud to have been chosen as the Principal Supermarket Partner of COP26.\n\nWe have committed to reduce GHG emissions within our own operations to Net Zero by 2035. This is five years earlier than our original ambition and aligns with the UN's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the highest ambition of the Paris Climate Change Agreement. We have a strong heritage in reducing our own emissions and are collaborating closely with our suppliers to ensure we are driving positive change across our supply chain too.\n\nTackling the climate emergency requires collaborative and transformational thinking across industry and government, and a willingness to work together and share learnings globally, so that we can all take meaningful, immediate action. In November we signed the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) retailers' commitment to halve the impact of UK baskets by 2030.\n\nWhilst we are delivering on our commitments to reduce the impact of our business on the climate, we are aware that climate change is going to have an impact on our business, presenting risks and opportunities over the short, medium and long term. We have been a signatory of the TCFD since January 2020 and have complied with the requirements of LR 9.8.6R by including climate-related financial disclosures consistent with the TCFD recommendations to strengthen our climate resilience, which we discuss below.\n\n## Governance\n\nGovernance a) Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities\n\n## The Board\n\nThe Board is accountable for risk management, strategy and target setting, including climate-related matters. The Board monitors how we are responding to climate-related risks and opportunities, identified through the risk management process and scenario analysis. The Board also oversees our Plan for Better strategy, which includes climate-related matters, and is one of our core strategic business priorities. Finally, the Board sets and monitors progress against our climate-related metrics, and this year approved accelerating our Scope 1 and 2 Net Zero target by five years to 2035.\n\nThe Board continues to ensure that there is appropriate climaterelated expertise within the business and has undertaken training by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership. See page 54 for biographies of our Board members.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nThe Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CR&S) Committee reviews the sustainability strategy and monitors the business engagement with our key stakeholders, including climate-related matters. For example, we have asked our suppliers to set their own targets to reduce GHG emissions and understand our customers are looking for more sustainable products as they seek to minimise their personal carbon footprints.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee reviews remuneration for Executive Directors against our Plan for Better strategy, including long-term targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions (see page 78 for more details).\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews risks and confidence on the climaterelated metrics that we disclose.\n\nGovernance b) Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities\n\n## Operating Board\n\nThe Operating Board defines and monitors the business-wide strategy, including climate-related matters, adapting to new regulatory requirements and trends, and approving major investments such as our commitment to spend \u00a31 billion to become Net Zero. The Operating Board is chaired by our CEO, who also sits on the Board and CR&S Committee.\n\n## Plan for Better Steering Committee\n\nThe Plan for Better Steering Committee supports the Operating Board and leads the operational execution of our Plan for Better, by overseeing working group activity, and monitoring performance against our climate-related metrics. The Plan for Better Steering Committee is chaired by our Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and has cross-divisional representation at Director level.\n\n## Plan for Better working groups\n\nThe Plan for Better Steering Committee oversees three working groups: Plan for Better; Environment; and Social. Our key climate-related targets (Scope 1, 2 and 3, water and biodiversity) are managed by the Environment working group.\n\nSee page 71 for our CR&S Committee Report, providing information on our governance structure, Committee responsibilities, meeting frequency and principal activities in the year.",

Physical risks may impact our operations and supply chain through extreme weather events, such as flooding or droughts. Transitional risks as a result of moving to a low-carbon future may impact us through changing consumer preferences or climate-related regulation. Climate change also presents opportunities, such as higher sales of lower GHG emission products.\n\nThe table below captures the key climate risks and opportunities impacting our business, identified through our risk management and qualitative scenario analysis, as well as potential mitigations.\n\n## Financial impact ranges\n\nWe have used the below financial impact ranges, which are the same as we use for our corporate risk management process (described further in the risk management section on page 38).\n\n| Impact   | Financial range (revenue)   |\n|----------|-----------------------------|\n| High     | Greater than \u00a3125 million   |\n| Medium   | \u00a325 million to \u00a3125 million |\n| Low      | Less than \u00a325 million       |\n\n## Time horizons\n\nWe have used the below time horizons:\n\n| Time period   | Years                                                                   | Reason                                  |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Short         | 0 to 5 years                                                            | Aligned to our financial planning cycle |\n| Medium        | 5 to 15 years and opportunities                                         | Nearer term to capture transition risks |\n| Long          | 15 to 50 years Longer term to capture physical risks  and opportunities |                                         |\n\n| Time horizon       | Risk type    | Classification   | Risk/opportunity description 1                                                                                      | Financial impact  (assuming actions are  taken to mitigate risks)   | Potential mitigations that are  being considered as part of our  strategic planning                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Short/Medium       | Transitional | Reputation       | Climate conscious  consumers favouring lower  GHG emission products                                                 | Revenue opportunity                                                 | Development & promotion  of lower GHG emission  products (see Meat, Fish &  Poultry example below on  page 20)                                                                                                                                               |\n| Short/Medium       | Transitional | Policy & Legal   | Introduction of a carbon  price leading to an increase  in the cost of higher GHG  emission products                | Low revenue loss                                                    | Majority of cost assumed  to be passed on to  customers to encourage  purchase of lower GHG  emission products.

This year we completed rollout of our LED lighting to 100 per cent  of our supermarket estate, reducing lighting energy consumption by an average of 70 per cent. We also transitioned to 100 per cent  renewable electricity across the entire estate (sourced directly from UK wind farms as well as certificate-backed renewable  electricity from the UK) and have committed to long-term purchasing of renewable energy from new wind farms and solar  projects, significantly reducing reliance on fossil fuels. We are working to remove hydrofluorocarbon in our refrigeration, replacing  these with natural alternatives. Our Scope 3 emissions make up 97 per cent of our overall GHG emissions, and we have committed  to a reduction of 30 per cent by 2030. We are working in collaboration with our suppliers, industry and the non-governmental  organisation (NGO) community to achieve this. See page 16 for more details on how we are reducing carbon emissions within our  own operations and supply chain. |\n| Reduction in  water use        | Climate change is expected to increase water stress in the UK. We have already reduced water usage in our own operations by  13 per cent against our 2018/19 baseline and are making significant progress in both reduction and recycling of water, having  achieved 'A' rating in the CDP water security disclosure for the last two years. We are signatories of the WRAP Water Roadmap  2030, working to improve water stewardship in our key sourcing locations. We are currently mapping our total water footprint  across the entirety of our operations and will be setting out our total organisation water stewardship approach in the coming year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Healthy &  sustainable diets   | The type of food in our diet has a big impact on GHG emissions. We are encouraging customers to eat more in line with the  principles of the government's Eatwell Guide, through marketing campaigns, pricing and Nectar points, such as our Great Big Fruit  & Veg challenge. The Eatwell Guide is a healthy and balanced diet, and when compared against a standard UK diet, is lower in GHG  emissions, water usage and land use. See page 15 for more details on how we are encouraging healthy and sustainable diets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Reduction in  food waste       | Food waste contributes over eight per cent of total man-made GHG emissions, so actions we are taking to reduce food waste are also  reducing GHG emissions. This year we rolled out our back of store food donation partnership with Neighbourly to all supermarkets,  helping to connect to a network of over 17,000 charities, schools and community groups. We are following best practice disclosure  on our food waste and encouraging our suppliers to sign up to the WRAP Waste Reduction Roadmap to help drive industry action  on food waste prevention as well as redistribution. See page 16 for more details on how we are reducing food waste.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Biodiversity                   | The environmental changes driven by climate change are putting pressure on species and have the potential to alter ecosystems  over time. We recognise our high dependency on nature and ecosystem services, and have committed to ensuring the impact of  our operations are net positive for biodiversity. We are currently assessing our nature-related risks and opportunities across our  business and supply chain. We have been working to build supply chain resilience for over 20 years, including working directly  with farmers and growers on areas such as soil health and integrated pest management, whilst increasing certification of high  climate risk materials such as palm oil, soy, timber and cotton. For more details on how we are protecting and enhancing  biodiversity, visit  www.about.sainsburys.co.uk .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\nClimate-related matters are also considered within financial planning. We have committed to spend \u00a31 billion to become Net Zero by 2035 and this is built into our financial plan, approved by the Board. We have also considered what impact the revenue losses identified in our scenario analysis (on page 20) could have on the carrying value of the Group's store assets, by modelling the impact on cash flows (the results do not have a material impact on the Group's impairment considerations, see page 139 for more details). Finally, Sainsbury's Bank considers climate-related risks as part of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment process (ICAAP).\n\nStrategy c) Resilience of strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario\n\nTo help shape our understanding of the potential implications of both the physical and transition risks associated with climate change, we have conducted both qualitative and quantitative scenario analysis, with the support of an external specialist. Scenario analysis can act as a 'stress test' for our current business operations and supply chain and help to explore a range of different outcomes. This has allowed us to evaluate the potential effects on our strategic and financial position under each of the defined scenarios. We have then been able to use the results to inform strategic thinking on how to manage the identified risks and opportunities.\n\n## Our own operations - Qualitative scenario analysis\n\nWe have been actively managing flood risk across our property estate for many years through our flood warning system, flood emergency plans for at-risk stores and investments in flood defences. Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of flood events in the future, impacting directly through water damage\n\nto our property estate and indirectly by hindering access for our customers and suppliers. In 2020, we carried out some qualitative scenario analysis using the World Resources Institute Aqueduct tool to understand the impact of flood risk and water stress on our locations in a 4.3\u00b0C scenario (high emission). Improving our understanding of future water-related risks helps us assess the need for future building adaptations, for example flood defences. It is also informing our commitment to be water neutral by 2040, by identifying where water conservation will have the biggest impact.\n\n## Our products and supply chain - Qualitative scenario analysis\n\nDuring 2021, we undertook qualitative scenario analysis that evaluated the impacts of a wide range of different climate change risks on the product categories we sell, to identify the product categories most exposed to climate-related risks and the most material risks for each product category.\n\nThis analysis was conducted by considering the potential impact of both physical and transitional risks. For physical risks, we considered the geographical sourcing for each of our product categories and assessed different physical risks under a high emissions scenario. To evaluate transitional risks, we considered the GHG emissions of our different product categories, as well as how changing market dynamics and increased regulations could impact both production costs and revenue.\n\nOf the 27 climate-related risks considered through this process, the four most material climate-related risks were drought, flooding, carbon taxes and changes in consumer preferences. We identified Produce, Clothing, Meat, Fish and Poultry (MFP), Dairy and Fuel as the product categories most exposed to the climate-related risks.",

We then selected MFP and Produce to undergo further analysis through a quantitative scenario analysis approach, which we will expand to additional categories next year. This approach was approved by the Plan for Better Steering Committee with oversight from the CR&S Committee.\n\n## Our products and supply chains - Quantitative scenario analysis\n\nTo further build on these qualitative results, we adopted a quantitative approach to determine the potential financial impacts associated with the identified material climate risks for each exposed product category. The scenarios are built using data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) over two time horizons (2030 and 2050) and include a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario per the recommendations of the TCFD. These time horizons align with our definition of medium and long term. Greater detail is provided below:\n\n- -1.5\u00b0C - A pathway that limits global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C (low physical risk, high transition risk)\n- -2.4\u00b0C - Described by the IPCC as an intermediate scenario (medium physical and transition risk)\n- -4.3\u00b0C - A high emissions worst case scenario pathway (high physical risk, low transition risk)\n\nThrough our analysis we identified transition risks to be more material leading up to 2030 as the global community strives to limit global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C, whereas physical risks are expected to manifest by 2050 if transition goals are not met. Furthermore, extending transition risk analysis beyond 2030 also introduces a significant amount of uncertainty to our analysis. Our analysis of MFP extends to 2030 as the product category is most vulnerable to transition risks, namely carbon taxes and changes in consumer preferences. Our quantitative analysis for Produce extends to 2050 to capture the potential financial impacts associated with drought, flooding and heat events.\n\n## Quantitative scenario analysis - Potential financial impact of climate-related transition risks on MFP products in a low emissions scenario in 2030\n\nTo assess the costs associated with carbon taxes and changes in consumer preferences, we evaluated the production of MFP products in the UK and the production of animal feed globally. Our analysis considered the impacts of a carbon price on the cost of MFP products by factoring in the emissions associated with production and in our supply chain. The carbon prices applied in our scenario analysis align with IPCC data. We considered how prices of MFP products could subsequently increase and assumed that additional costs would be passed on directly to the consumer, further reducing demand. The analysis assumed that products associated with the highest emissions would be most avoided by consumers.\n\nThe results illustrate a potential revenue loss when looking at the MFP category in isolation in a 1.5\u00b0C (low emissions) world in which physical risks associated with climate change are limited but high transition risks are experienced as the world attempts to meet the Paris Agreement. However, this looks at the MFP product category in isolation and assumes no actions are taken to mitigate risks, so does not capture the overall opportunity at Group level of developing and promoting lower GHG animal protein and nutritionally positive meat alternatives to capture switching calories from existing and new customers.\n\n| Most material climate risks  impacting MFP 1                                    | Annual revenue loss to MFP category in  isolation in 2030 in 1.5\u00b0C scenario, assuming  no actions are taken to mitigate risks   | Annual revenue loss/opportunity at Group  level in 2030 in 1.5\u00b0C scenario, assuming  actions are taken to mitigate risks   | Potential mitigations that are being considered as part  of our strategic planning                                                                                                                                                              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Changes in consumer  preferences away from  higher GHG emission  animal protein | \u00a3300m to \u00a3350m revenue loss to  MFP category in isolation                                                                       | Overall opportunity for business                                                                                           | - Differentiate:  develop lower GHG emission  animal protein within existing product  (see integrated beef case study below) - Shift customer behaviour:  towards lower  GHG emission meat proteins and products                                |\n| Implementation of  carbon taxes                                                 | \u00a350m to \u00a3100m revenue loss to MFP  category in isolation                                                                        | Overall opportunity for business                                                                                           | - Reduce:  work with suppliers to reduce GHG  emissions in our supply chains e.g. supplier  targets, animal health & welfare and feed  efficiency - Offset:  work with suppliers to sequester  carbon in our supply chains e.g. planting trees, |",

The scheme has been running since August 2019 and we are working to fulfil our entire Taste the Difference tier. The genetics used to improve the sustainability of our beef, is estimated to deliver a 20 per cent reduction in overall GHG emissions and a 40 per cent reduction in methane.\n\n## Quantitative scenario analysis - Potential financial impact of climate-related physical risks on selected produce crops in high and low emissions scenarios in 2050\n\nTo assess the costs associated with the increased likelihood of flooding, drought and heat events, we evaluated the production of citrus fruits, lettuce, berries and potatoes in Spain and the UK. These food items are particularly vulnerable to climate change and likely to result in crop failure. We considered two scenarios, one where global warming reaches 4.3\u00b0C (high emission) as a result of no global action taken to reduce emissions, leading to extreme physical risks manifesting in the long term, and a 1.5\u00b0C (low emission) scenario where the Paris Agreement is met but physical risks are still experienced, albeit more mildly. Our physical risk modelling focused on Spain and the UK where a significant proportion of our produce is grown. Our scenario analysis considered the impacts of these acute physical risks and the resulting diminished or lost crop yields that would result in increased costs in our supply chain. We also assumed that these additional costs are passed on directly to the consumer, reducing demand and impacting our revenue. Revenue loss is based on 2021 produce sale figures and assumes no actions are taken to mitigate risks.\n\n| Most material climate  risks impacting citrus  fruit, lettuce, berries &  potatoes in UK & Spain 1   | Annual revenue loss to  crops in isolation in 2050  in 4.3\u00b0C scenario, assuming  no actions are taken to  mitigate risks   | Annual revenue loss to   crops in isolation in 2050   in 1.5\u00b0C scenario, assuming  no actions are taken to  mitigate risks   | Annual revenue loss/opportunity at  Group level in 2050 in 4.3\u00b0C & 1.5\u00b0C,  assuming actions are taken to  mitigate risks                            | Potential mitigations that are being considered  as part of our strategic planning   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u00a30m to \u00a35m revenue  loss to crops                                                                    | \u00a30m to \u00a35m revenue  loss to crops                                                                                          | Further work required to  understand revenue impact  at Group level after actions                                            | - Engage:  continue to work closely  with our suppliers to understand                                                                               | Flooding                                                                             |\n| \u00a325m to \u00a330m revenue  loss to crops                                                                  | \u00a310m to \u00a315m revenue  loss to crops                                                                                        | Further work required to  understand revenue impact  at Group level after actions                                            | their adaption plans - Explore supply chain adaption  options:  higher altitude locations,                                                          | are taken to mitigate risks Drought                                                  |\n| \u00a335m to \u00a340m revenue  loss to crops                                                                  | \u00a310m to \u00a315m revenue  loss to crops                                                                                        | Further work required to  understand revenue impact  at Group level after actions                                            | lower flood risk areas, vertical  farming, glass growing structures,  reservoirs, drainage channels,  drought & temperature resistant  crop strains | Heat events                                                                          |\n\n- 1 Risks should be considered in isolation as the complex interrelationship between multiple risks has not been considered.\n\n## Case study - UK grown Brassicas\n\nOne of the ways we mitigate flood risk is to have multiple growing locations for a crop. For example, for UK grown Brassicas we use three distinct areas - Cornwall, East Anglia and Scotland. These areas have similar growing conditions but are far enough apart to reduce the risk of all areas suffering from a severe weather event.\n\n## Plans to expand scenario analysis in 2022/23\n\nWe understand that we must continue to expand our knowledge of our climate-related risk and opportunities. Next financial year we are going to expand our quantitative scenario analysis to look at our Clothing category. Clothing is particularly exposed to physical risks due to our sourcing and manufacturing locations in India, China, Bangladesh and Turkey.\n\n## Risk management\n\nRisk management a) Processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks\n\nClimate-related risks (short, medium and long term) are identified through quarterly bottom-up divisional and governance forum risk assessments and then reviewed annually top-down in a dedicated climate risk workshop to assess completeness. This considers our ability to deliver our Plan for Better strategy, including our Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets, as well as physical and transition climate risks impacting our operations and supply chain, including existing and emerging regulatory requirements.\n\nClimate risks are mapped against financial and reputational impact (from insignificant <\u00a310 million to severe >\u00a3125 million) and likelihood of occurring (from remote to almost certain). To assess the effectiveness of existing climate controls, each risk has three positions: gross risk (before existing controls); net risk (after existing controls); and target risk (management's target position). Climate risks where the impact is not yet well understood are captured separately on an emerging risk map (plotted against likelihood of occurring and timeframe).\n\nRisk management b) Processes for managing climate-related risks\n\nEach climate risk is assigned a Director-level business owner who is responsible for monitoring and mitigating the risk. Climate risks are agreed once per year at the Plan for Better Steering Committee with Board level oversight from the CR&S Committee. Climate risks and mitigations are monitored throughout the year by the Plan for Better working groups and Steering Committee. To increase ownership of climate risks across the business, the Steering Committee has cross-divisional representation at Director level.\n\nRisk management c) Processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation's overall risk management\n\nThe output from this climate risk process, in aggregate, is elevated to the corporate risk map owned by the plc Board with support from the Audit Committee, and informs the Environment and Social Sustainability principal risk, shown on page 50.

We have a strong track record of delivering GHG emissions reductions and a robust plan to Net Zero, however there is some risk as our transition plan requires industry innovation, such as a commercially viable alternative fuel solution for heavy goods vehicles.\n\nMetrics and targets c) Targets used to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets\n\nWe understand the importance of setting GHG emission reduction targets, and last year, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) approved our science-based targets for Scopes 1, 2 and 3. For Scope 1 and 2, these include the reduction of GHG emissions from our own operations to Net Zero by 2035 in a bid to limit temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. Our Scope 3 target, defined in collaboration with the Carbon Trust, requires the reduction of GHG emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, to align to a well below 2\u00b0C scenario. We have long-term remuneration targets for Executive Directors on Scopes 1, 2 and 3 (see page 87 for more details).\n\nWe also have targets and measure performance against other climate-related metrics. See page 19 for more details on how these metrics are supporting climate-related matters.\n\nWe have worked with the Carbon Trust to define our Scope 3 baseline, which uses industry average carbon factors to calculate total GHG emissions as there is currently no agreed methodology for companies to calculate their own Scope 3 emissions. There is also no consistent industry approach for requesting GHG emission data from suppliers, although we do measure the number of our suppliers disclosing through CDP and HIGG (environmental impact disclosure systems). Whilst we cannot solve these challenges ourselves, we are committed to work at industry level to find a solution, such as our commitment, alongside other retailers, to work with the WWF to halve the environmental impact of UK baskets by 2030.\n\n|                                |                                                                                       |                             | Results          | Results                               |                             |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Plan for Better  commitment    | Metric                                                                                | Baseline                    | 2020/21          | 2021/22                               | Target                      |\n| Reduction in carbon  emissions | Absolute GHG emissions within  our own operations (tCO2e)                             | 949,744 tCO2e 2018/19 FY    | 817,420 tCO2e    | 762,119 tCO2e                         | Net Zero 2035/36 FY         |\n|                                | Electricity which comes from  renewable sources (%)                                   | 17% 2019/20 FY              | 20%              | 41% (100% from  January 2022)         | N/A                         |\n|                                | Absolute Scope 3 GHG  emissions (tCO2e)                                               | 26,663,081 tCO2e 2018/19 FY | N/A              | N/A                                   | 18,664,157 tCO2e 2030/31 FY |\n|                                | Key Sainsbury's food suppliers  disclosing through CDP  (number)                      | N/A                         | N/A              | 183 (87% of key food suppliers)       | N/A                         |\n|                                | GM&C own-brand suppliers  disclosing through HIGG  (number)                           | N/A                         | N/A              | 195 (49% of own-brand GM&C suppliers) | N/A                         |\n| Reduction in water use         | Absolute water usage within  our own operations (m 3 )                                | 3,224,000 (m 3 ) 2018/19 FY | 2,776,288 (m 3 ) | 2,797,699 (m 3 )                      | Water neutral 2040/41 FY    |\n| Healthy & sustainable  diets   | Healthy and better for you  sales tonnage as a proportion  of total sales tonnage (%) | 80.3% 2019/20 FY            | 79.7%            | 79.6%                                 | 83.1% 2025/26 FY            |\n| Reduction in food waste        | Food waste to anaerobic  digestion (tonnes)                                           | 31,615 tonnes 2019/20 FY    | 26,545 tonnes    | 25,483 tonnes                         | 15,808 tonnes 2030/31 FY    |\n| Biodiversity                   | Soy sourced to an independent  sustainability standard (%)                            | 6% 2019 CY                  | 42%              | N/A 1                                 | 100%                        |\n|                                | Palm sourced to an  independent sustainability  standard (%)                          | 99.1% 2019 CY               | 99.3%            | 99.7%                                 | 100%                        |\n|                                | Timber sourced to an  independent sustainability  standard (%)                        | 60% 2019 CY                 | 65%              | 77%                                   | 100%                        |\n|                                | Cotton sourced to an  independent sustainability  standard (%)                        | 76% 2019 CY                 | 89%              | 94%                                   | 100%                        |\n|                                | Number of woodland trees  planted (number)                                            | 493,750 trees 2019/20 FY    | 325,000          | 398,333                               | N/A                         |\n\n- 1 Result unavailable at date of publication.

Each Director has acted in the way they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole and, in doing so, have regard to the interests of other stakeholders, whilst maintaining high standards of business conduct.\n\nThe Board considers the potential consequences of its decisions on stakeholders, recognising that decisions made will not necessarily result in a positive outcome for every stakeholder group. Processes are in place to ensure effective decision making, which balances the needs of our stakeholders with the business's strategic priorities, purpose, culture and values.\n\n## Customers\n\nTwo-thirds of the UK population have shopped with Sainsbury's over the last year 1 and over one million digital Nectar users regularly benefit from personalised offers with us and with our Nectar partners. Within Argos, we have 18.8 million active customers and the website is the third most visited online retailer in the UK. In Financial Services, we have 1.8 million active Sainsbury's Bank customers and 2.1 million Argos Financial Services customers. Understanding the needs of our customers allows us to provide relevant products and services. Satisfied customers are key to our long-term success.\n\n## Key customer priorities\n\n- -Competitiveness and value\n- -Availability and range of products\n- -Convenience and location\n- -Speed of Groceries Online delivery\n- -Quality of products\n- -Sustainability\n\n## Engaging with our customers\n\nWe heard what mattered to our customers through:\n\n- -2.7 million responses per year across our Sainsbury's and Argos customer feedback programmes (CSAT)\n- -Social media listening\n- -Market research\n- -Qualitative customer focus groups and quantitative surveys\n- -Nectar data, which helps us understand how customers are shopping\n- -Brand tracking, which assesses the performance and perception of our different brands\n- 1 Nielsen IQ panel, Total FMCG (excl. Kiosk & Tobacco), 52 weeks ending P3 21/22.\n\nAn overview of our key stakeholders and stakeholder considerations that influenced discussions and the outcomes of these discussions is outlined below. Further examples of how the stakeholder voice has been brought into the boardroom can be found in our Governance section on page 62.\n\n- ' Engagement with our stakeholders remains a key priority and we are committed to building positive relationships with all of our stakeholders.'\n\n## Simon Roberts\n\nCustomer feedback and overall metrics on consumer sentiment and trends were shared regularly with the Board and Operating Board, steering our responses to the key issues impacting customers, such as COVID-19, inflation and availability of products. The Board receives regular updates from the Chief Marketing Officer, which include feedback from our customer listening sessions.\n\nThe Board's understanding of our customers continued to shape our strategy and the Board has focused on delivering for customers in line with our strategic priorities:\n\n- -Food First: putting food back at the heart of Sainsbury's by offering high quality, great value food to our customers\n- -Brands that Deliver: Argos, Habitat, Tu , Nectar and Sainsbury's Bank contributing positively to the customer experience\n- -Save to Invest: internal transformation enabling us to reinvest in our customer offer\n- -Connected to Customers: knowing and understanding our customers to enhance our thinking and decision making\n- -Plan for Better: supporting our customers to eat healthily and sustainably, whilst delivering on our commitment to become Net Zero by 2035\n\nThe Board also considered and supported the investment in our contactless sales channels to improve access for customers.\n\nWe know that price remains an important consideration for our customers; our Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match and Price Lock campaigns are two ways in which we have supported our customers to shop more affordably.\n\nThe evolution of our Net Zero by 2040 plan to our Plan for Better and our partnership with COP26 reflected our customers' interest in reducing their environmental impact through their everyday activities. Decision makers, including our Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CR&S) Committee, referred to customer insight analysis to understand how customers view our progress around sustainability and inform how related projects develop.",

        "page_content": "## Colleagues\n\nOur colleagues include everyone who is employed by the business. Colleagues are at the heart of everything we do and their commitment to our purpose and values is critical to the business's long-term success. Connected, engaged colleagues, working in safe stores and depots with better technology, lead to greater efficiency, increased availability of products and improved customer service.\n\n## Key colleague priorities\n\n- -Reward\n- -Inclusion\n- -Career progression\n- -Colleague engagement\n- -Training and development\n- -Wellbeing\n- -Health and safety\n\n## Engaging with our colleagues\n\nThe Board engaged directly with colleagues through the National Great Place to Work Group, our Workforce Advisory Panel. It received presentations on culture, colleague engagement, talent retention and progression from our Group HR Director, and regular summaries from the Chief Executive Officer on key initiatives. Colleagues were updated on decisions made following their feedback through regular internal communications from the Chief Executive Officer and Operating Board members.\n\nOur colleague engagement activities included:\n\n- -Non-Executive Director meetings with National Great Place to Work Group members to directly understand the views of colleagues from across the business via their elected peers\n- -Continual feedback through internal channels, including live presentations, question and answer sessions and internal social media discussions with the Operating Board\n- -Honest, confidential colleague feedback on what it is like to work for the business through our annual colleague engagement survey, 'We're Listening', to inform improvements over the year\n- -Colleague feedback through topic-specific 'temperature check' surveys throughout the year, helping us to understand colleagues' views and sentiments, enabling the Board and Operating Board to act swiftly\n- -Regular updates provided to the Board, Remuneration and CR&S Committees on culture, engagement, diversity and inclusion, and colleague pay\n\nColleague feedback has provided the Board with insight and challenge. Through our colleague engagement activities, decision makers received timely feedback, allowing colleague interests to remain a priority when considering key concerns. Our response to COVID-19 exemplifies this. Colleague feedback on internal social networks and via 'temperature check' surveys enabled senior management to better understand the colleague experience of new safety guidance and returning to our offices.\n\nThe business has made a significant investment in colleague pay and benefits. All our Sainsbury's and Argos store colleagues now receive a base rate of least \u00a310 per hour, above the government's National Living Wage and the Living Wage Foundation's Living Wage. We have also increased London pay to \u00a311.05, in line with the London Living Wage. In response to feedback from colleagues, we have implemented policy and guidance changes in relation to family leave, menopause, wellbeing and carers.\n\nIt is vital that we have a diverse workforce, thriving in an inclusive culture and reflecting the communities we serve. The Board supported the additional commitments made by the Operating Board in support of our Black colleagues, including joining the Black British Network, to improve representation across the business and agreeing stretching diversity targets. It also supported the introduction of Inclusion Training for all line managers and improving transparency by publishing our Gender and Ethnicity Pay Report for a second year.\n\nMore information on our colleague engagement activities can be found on pages 13 to 14 and our colleague engagement KPI can be found on page 30.",

We ensure that we provide fair, balanced and understandable information to shareholders and equity analysts and work to ensure they have a strong understanding of our purpose, strategy, performance and culture.\n\n## Key shareholder priorities\n\nDuring the course of the year, we heard from shareholders that their main areas of focus included:\n\n- -Macro factors, such as inflation, cost pressures and availability challenges\n- -Progress towards our cost base improvement targets\n- -Grocery market share performance in a competitive environment\n- -The impact of normalisation of demand post-pandemic, including expectations for Groceries Online penetration\n- -Improving our price position versus competitors\n- -Improving our product innovation\n- -General Merchandise sales trends and the impact from disposable income pressures and supply chain challenges\n- -Progress of the Argos transformation programme and associated profit improvements\n- -Driving returns in the Financial Services business\n- -Providing confidence in profit, cash flow and dividend prospects\n- -How we will address capital allocation once our leverage targets are achieved\n- -Progress against our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) targets\n\n## Engaging with our shareholders\n\nThe Board regularly received reports and updates on shareholder relations, summarising key feedback from our principal shareholders derived from a programme that consisted of:\n\n- -One-on-one investor meetings with the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director of Investor Relations\n- -Investor events, including our ESG event and Nectar Deep Dive\n- -Real-time feedback from investors after meetings and presentations\n- -The Annual General Meeting\n- -Attendance at key investor conferences and tours\n- -Regular email and telephone contact with investors and analysts\n- -A shareholder event for retail investors, resulting in positive feedback in relation to investing in the Company from attendee retail investors\n- -Dialogue with shareholder groups\n- -Regular engagement with investors on ESG\n\nThe Board continually takes shareholders' feedback into account when reviewing levels of disclosure. To help shareholders understand the on-going impacts of COVID-19 on the business and the normalisation trends post-pandemic, the Board has consistently disclosed key customer behaviour trends and provided greater visibility of trading patterns.\n\nThe Board hosted our first ESG event in June 2021, launching our Plan for Better strategy and enabling shareholders to gain a stronger understanding of our ESG priorities. It also participated in a University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership event on ESG, providing it with additional investor insights to help shape our on-going engagement with investors in this area. The Board supported our compliance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures for this financial year, enabling greater clarity for shareholders on this key topic.\n\nShareholders were keen to understand our remuneration decisions and, through voting at the Annual General Meeting, were given an opportunity to indicate their opinion on the 2021 Remuneration Report. The Board and Remuneration Committee continued to consult with shareholders, to understand their views on key decisions, and we will continue this dialogue in future years.

Our suppliers range from large multi-national companies to small independently-run businesses.\n\nOur GFR suppliers are fundamental to the quality and variety of products we sell and enable us to meet the high standards that we set ourselves.\n\nOur GNFR suppliers provide operational excellence and access to the new technology and innovation that ensures we keep pace with the evolving and changing needs of our customers.\n\n## Key supplier priorities\n\n- -Long-term relationships\n- -Cost-efficiency\n- -Responsible procurement, trust and ethics\n- -Technological advances\n- -Payment practices\n\n## Engaging with our suppliers\n\nThe Board is cognisant of the impact its decisions have on suppliers and receives regular updates on supplier relationships. Working collaboratively with our suppliers helps us deliver innovation in food and we continue to build stronger relationships with exclusive brands.\n\nIn order to maintain consistent communication with our suppliers, they have access to online supplier portals, enabling the sharing of news and development of new ways to work together.\n\nManagement actively engage with both the GFR and GNFR supply chains to manage key risks, including the impacts of COVID-19, global supply chain issues and inflation on stock levels and logistics. This enabled us to manage our supply chain and continuity of supply to customers. Additionally, key supplier meetings with the Board are held to further enhance communication with these stakeholders.\n\nWe take part in annual, independent surveys which benchmark us against other retailers and highlight areas for improvement; these include the Supplier Advantage survey and Groceries Supply Code of Practice supplier survey. The CR&S Committee received updates during the year on the outcomes of these surveys, which helped shape supplier-related initiatives.\n\nOur suppliers have been, and continue to be, a key element of achieving our sustainability targets under Plan for Better. Through our engagement with our suppliers, we have encouraged them to disclose their Net Zero ambitions to us and to set their own targets. We have also encouraged our GFR suppliers to report carbon emissions through the CDP or Higg platform. Working with these stakeholders has contributed to our accelerated Net Zero by 2035 target.\n\nSuppliers are key to protecting human rights throughout our business activities and the CR&S Committee regularly discussed relevant matters. We have clear modern slavery policies for both GFR and GNFR suppliers, actively engaged with our suppliers to prevent modern slavery and human trafficking in our business operations and supply chains, and have reported this through our Modern Slavery Statement.

        "page_content": "## Financial Review\n\n2021/22 was the first full year of delivering our Food First strategy, as we put Food back at the heart of Sainsbury's, increasing product innovation and using the benefits of our Save to Invest programme to become more price competitive for customers and drive a strong volume share performance. It was a year in which our brands delivered, with the Argos transformation continuing at pace, Nectar 360 launching a new Sainsbury's Insight Platform and the Bank returning to profit and declaring its first dividend. Given the significant COVID-19 impacts in 2020/21, comparisons and commentary compared to 2019/20 have been used where this helps highlight trends.\n\nCOVID-19 costs were much lower than the previous year. However, sales remained strong with a sustained shift of food consumption in home, helping to support strong profit and cash flow delivery. We've declared our highest dividend since 2015, up 24 per cent on last year, and have committed to increasing the proportion of profits distributed to shareholders through the ordinary dividend.\n\n## Strong sales performance\n\nGroup sales (including VAT) were up 3.3 per cent year on year. Grocery sales were down slightly but strong compared to pre-pandemic levels, supported by continued elevated in-home consumption and our investments in value such as Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match. General Merchandise sales fell by 11.9 per cent, reflecting availability constraints and tough comparators. However, Clothing recovered well from suppressed demand over the pandemic with growth led by full price sales. Fuel sales grew strongly but remained below 2019/20. As expected, Groceries Online sales decreased 4.7 per cent as demand moderated after 119.6 per cent growth in the previous year. This was partially offset by a recovery in convenience sales of 8.8 per cent as the nation returned more to workplaces and other urban locations.\n\n## Delivering profit growth\n\nThis year we returned to profit, generating a statutory profit before tax of \u00a3854 million (2020/21: loss before tax of \u00a3164 million) with non-underlying profits of \u00a3124 million supported by significant legal settlements. Our underlying profit before tax of \u00a3730 million was a strong improvement from the \u00a3586 million in 2019/20.\n\nBoth the Retail and Financial Services businesses contributed to the improvement, with Retail underlying operating profit up 37 per cent and Financial Services returning to profit, with a \u00a338 million underlying operating profit. The Retail performance was driven by our Save to Invest programme which generated an 83 basis points reduction in operating costs as a percentage of sales compared to 2019/20, led by the continuing Argos transformation programme as we closed 73 standalone Argos stores and opened 64 Argos stores within Sainsbury's, reducing operational and occupancy costs. Savings from our Logistics Transformation programme helped us to mitigate the impact of significant cost pressures through the year. Changes to our food service, counters and bakeries will save \u00a3125-150 million annually and enable us to improve our eat-in and takeaway customer offer.\n\nFinancial Services benefitted from a reduced bad debt charge after posting COVID-19 provisions in the prior year, and an improved unemployment outlook. Net interest margin improved as a result of management action to reduce interest payable through savings rates. In line with our Brands that Deliver strategy and enabled by a strong capital position, the Bank has paid a \u00a350 million dividend.\n\nNon-underlying items benefitted from \u00a3167 million of income in relation to two legal settlements made regarding overcharging of payment card processing fees. We continued with our restructuring programme announced in November 2020, incurring \u00a392 million (2020/21: \u00a3548 million) of costs. We expect to incur \u00a3900 million to \u00a31 billion of one off costs, with most in the period to March 2024. Of this, \u00a3640 million has been charged to date. Group statutory profit after tax was \u00a3677 million (2020/21: loss after tax of \u00a3201 million).\n\nBasic earnings per share was 29.8 pence compared to a loss per share of 9.4 pence in 2020/21. Underlying basic earnings per share increased to 25.4 pence (2020/21: 11.7 pence) due to the strong profit delivery and a lower tax rate.\n\n## Strong free cash flow; capital allocation framework\n\n2021/22 was another year of strong cash generation and net debt reduction. We reduced non-lease net debt by \u00a3499 million, taking our cumulative reduction to \u00a31,381 million since 2018/19. This includes \u00a3240 million of net debt reduction resulting from the conversion of our perpetual convertible bond in July 2021. This exceeds our four-year target to reduce non-lease net debt by \u00a3950 million one year early, and contributes to our falling interest cost expense. Lease net debt increased by \u00a3789 million, primarily reflecting the impact of serving notice to purchase 21 stores from two investment vehicles in which we hold a 49 per cent interest.\n\nAs guided, working capital grew this year following a significant working capital reduction in the prior year due to COVID-19. This resulted in strong retail free cash flow of \u00a3503 million (2020/21: \u00a3784 million). This is significantly ahead of expectations, supported by the strong profit result, legal settlements income and lower than expected capital expenditure at \u00a3645 million (2020/21: \u00a3568 million). Dividends of \u00a3238 million were paid in the year, which were covered 2.1 times by free cash flow (2020/21: 3.3 times). We have laid out an updated capital allocation framework, signalling that we will prioritise the right level of investment to support our strategy and an investment grade balance sheet but that we expect to pay a higher proportion of underlying net earnings to shareholders, in the first instance through an increase in the dividend pay-out ratio to around 60 per cent from around 53 per cent.\n\nOur balance sheet remains strong, and we delivered a pre-tax return on capital employed of 8.4 per cent, up from 5.6 per cent in 2020/21. The business had non lease net debt of \u00a3141 million and \u00a31.4 billion of undrawn facilities at the end of the year.\n\nAs at 5 March 2022 the net defined benefit pension surplus under IAS 19 for the Group was \u00a32,283 million (excluding deferred tax). The \u00a31,539 million increase from 6 March 2021 was driven by both changes in financial and demographic assumptions which lowered liabilities, as well as gains on plan assets.\n\n## Delivering through times of change\n\nThis was a year of strong delivery, making considerable progress on our strategy, and we enter the year with good operating momentum and a strong financial position. The year ahead presents considerable external pressures and uncertainties with higher operating cost inflation and cost of living pressures on customers. However, we will continue to focus on delivering consistent improvements in grocery value, innovation and customer service, funded by our Save to Invest programme. With the ongoing drive of our colleagues to deliver for our customers and our track record of successfully responding to the changes of recent years, we are well placed to maintain a strong competitive position.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKevin O'Byrne\n\nChief Financial Officer",

Refer to note 2 of the accounts for further information.\n\nUnderlying profit before tax is up \u00a3373 million, and up \u00a3144 million compared to 2019/20, driven by continued elevated sales despite much lower COVID-19 costs, falling finance costs, and the delivery of the Argos Transformation programme, offset by increased variable pay. We have made strong progress on our Save to Invest plans, with an 83 basis points reduction in operating costs allowing for considerable investments to improve value for customers.\n\n## Group sales\n\nGroup sales (including VAT, including fuel) increased by 3.3 per cent year-on-year. Retail sales (including VAT, excluding fuel) decreased by 2.6 per cent, as General Merchandise sales moderated, but remained ahead of 2019/20. Fuel sales increased by 60.0 per cent and Financial Services sales increased by 0.2 per cent.\n\n| Total sales performance by category   |   52 weeks to 5 March 2022 \u00a3bn |   52 weeks to 6 March 2021 \u00a3bn |   52 weeks to 7 March 2020 \u00a3bn | YoY Change %   | Yo2Y Change %   |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n| Grocery                               |                           21   |                           21.1 |                           19.5 | (0.2)%         | 7.6%            |\n| General Merchandise                   |                            6.1 |                            6.9 |                            6.4 | (11.9)%        | (4.6)%          |\n| Clothing                              |                            1   |                            0.9 |                            1   | 12.7%          | 3.1%            |\n| Retail (exc. fuel)                    |                           28.1 |                           28.8 |                           26.9 | (2.6)%         | 4.6%            |\n| Fuel sales                            |                            4.8 |                            3   |                            4.9 | 60.0%          | (2.6)%          |\n| Retail (inc. fuel)                    |                           32.9 |                           31.9 |                           31.8 | 3.4%           | 3.5%            |\n\nGrocery sales remained significantly above pre-pandemic levels reflecting a sustained shift of consumption in-home. In line with the reduction of government restrictions during the period, sales were stronger in the first half, and moderated in the second half, albeit at a level still higher than 2019/20. We delivered a strong volume market share performance, supported by our value investments for customers. We inflated prices behind the market and key competitors on high volume lines supported by our Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match programme and other value initiatives.\n\nGeneral Merchandise sales declined, reflecting tough comparators and availability challenges driven by both product supply and freight availability. Clothing recovered strongly from a year of suppressed demand with growth driven by full price sales and increased in-store sales.",

Groceries Online sales decreased by 4.7 per cent, as COVID-19 restrictions ended and demand moderated through the year after rapid growth of almost 120 per cent in the previous year.

The impact of stores temporarily closed due to COVID-19 have been included within LFL sales, with only permanently closed sites treated as not LFL.\n\n## Space\n\nIn 2021/22, Sainsbury's opened four new supermarkets and closed four (2020/21: opened one new supermarket and closed 11). There were 19 new Convenience stores opened in the year and 23 were closed (2020/21: 15 opened and nine stores closed).\n\nDuring the period 64 new Argos stores in Sainsbury's were opened and 73 standalone Argos stores were closed, in line with our Argos Transformation plan.

Our Save to Invest programme delivered an 83 basis points reduction in operating costs as a percentage of sales versus 2019/20. We have invested much of this benefit, as well as benefits from fuel and more profitable clothing and general merchandise sales into lower grocery prices, targeted at key products for customers, driving strong volume growth.",

Savings from our Logistics Transformation programme helped to mitigate the significant cost pressures felt.\n\nIn 2022/23, Sainsbury's expects a retail underlying depreciation and amortisation charge of around \u00a31.2 billion, including around \u00a3500 million right of use asset depreciation.\n\n## Financial Services\n\n| Financial Services results  12 months to 28 February 2022   | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Underlying revenue (\u00a3m)                                     | 432    | 431    | 0%       |\n| Interest and fees payable (\u00a3m)                              | (57)   | (90)   | (37)%    |\n| Total income (\u00a3m)                                           | 375    | 341    | 10%      |\n| Underlying operating profit/(loss) (\u00a3m)                     | 38     | (21)   | N/A      |\n| Net interest margin (%) 1                                   | 4.5    | 3.5    | 100bps   |\n| Cost:income ratio (%)                                       | 74     | 74     | -        |\n| Bad debt as a percentage of lending (%) 2                   | 1.2    | 1.8    | 60bps    |\n| Active customers (m) - Bank                                 | 1.8    | 1.8    | -        |\n| Active customers (m) - AFS                                  | 2.1    | 2.2    | (4)%     |\n| Tier 1 capital ratio (%) 3                                  | 15.6   | 1 7.6  | (200)bps |\n| Total capital ratio (%) 4                                   | 18.1   | 20.2   | (210)bps |\n| Unsecured lending (\u00a3bn)                                     | 4.3    | 4.1    | 5%       |\n| Secured lending (\u00a3bn)                                       | 0.8    | 1.3    | (38)%    |\n| Customer deposits (\u00a3bn)                                     | (4.2)  | (5.1)  | (18)%    |\n\n- 1 Net interest receivable divided by average interest-bearing assets.\n- 2 Bad debt expense divided by average net lending.\n- 3 Common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.

This reflects both a reduction in credit provisioning as the unemployment outlook improved, a release of some COVID-19 related bad debt provisions made in 2020/21 and improvements in net interest margin. Unsecured lending balances were lower on average through the year, but recovered well in the second half and ended the year up 5 per cent.\n\nFinancial Services total income of \u00a3375 million increased by 10 per cent year-on-year (FY 2020/21: \u00a3341 million). Net interest margin recovery is reflective of management action to reduce interest payable through savings rates alongside improvements in unsecured asset margins and a lower mix of secured lending (following our decision to cease new mortgage lending in 2019). Fee income has risen as activity post lockdown increased, with ATMs and Card fees both recovering, whilst Travel Money remains subdued but is higher than last year.\n\nThe Financial Services cost:income ratio is flat at 74.0 per cent (FY 2020/21: 74.0 per cent). Of the \u00a327 million increase in costs, \u00a317 million reflects higher royalty payments to Argos, therefore the ratio is down on a group contribution basis.\n\nBad debt expense as a percentage of lending decreased 60 basis points year-on-year to 1.2 per cent (FY 2020/21: 1.8 per cent), driven by stable arrears and the improving economic outlook. We released \u00a312 million of our COVID provision, reflecting the more positive economic outlook, particularly in relation to forecast unemployment.\n\nIn line with the group strategic priority Brands that Deliver, and reflecting the Bank's strong capital position, a \u00a350 million dividend has been paid. This is a key milestone as we start to deliver on our commitment that Financial Services will be cash generative for the Group. The Bank remains well capitalised with a CET1 ratio of 15.6 per cent, a decrease from 17.6 per cent last year driven by this dividend payment.\n\nWe expect a further improvement in Financial Services underlying operating profit in the year ahead.\n\n## Underlying net finance costs\n\nUnderlying net finance costs reduced by 12 per cent to \u00a3309 million (2020/21: \u00a3353 million). These costs include \u00a340 million of net non-lease interest (2020/21: \u00a360 million). The reduction of net non-lease interest is driven by the repayment of the \u00a3200 million Green loan in August 2021 and redemption of the perpetual convertible bonds in July 2021. The net interest costs on lease liabilities have reduced to \u00a3269 million (202/21: \u00a3293 million), mainly due to lower interest rates on new leases.\n\nSainsbury's expects underlying net finance costs in 2022/23 of between \u00a3315-325 million, including around \u00a3270-280 million lease interest.\n\n## Items excluded from underlying results\n\nIn order to provide shareholders with insight into the underlying performance of the business, items recognised in reported profit or loss before tax which, by virtue of their size and or nature, do not reflect the Group's underlying performance are excluded from the Group's underlying results and shown in the table below.\n\n| Items excluded from underlying results          | 52 weeks to 5 March 2022 \u00a3m   | 52 weeks to 6 March 2021 1 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Restructuring and integration programmes        | (103)                         | (345)                           |\n| Impairment charges                              | -                             | (220)                           |\n| Restructuring, impairment and                   | (103)                         | (565)                           |\n| integration                                     |                               |                                 |\n| Income recognised in relation to legal disputes | 182                           | 42                              |\n| Software as a service accounting adjustment     | (21)                          | -                               |\n| IAS 19 pension income                           | 11                            | 6                               |\n| Property, finance and acquisition adjustments   | 55                            | (4)                             |\n| Items excluded from underlying results          | 124                           | (521)                           |\n\n- 1 The prior year results have been restated to reflect the removal of business rates from onerous property contract provisions. Refer to note 2 of the accounts for further information.\n\n- Restructuring, impairment and integration costs of \u00a3103 million (2020/21: \u00a3565 million) include \u00a392 million (2020/21: \u00a3548 million) relating to the programme announced in November 2020 for the structural integration of Sainsbury's and Argos. We expect that we will incur one off costs from these infrastructure, operating model and structure changes of \u00a3900 million to \u00a31 billion, with cash costs of around \u00a3300 million, with the majority in the period to March 2024. In line with IFRIC 21 'Levies', business rates are now recognised as a periodic cost as incurred and as such we expect approximately \u00a340 million of business rates associated with leased properties in the restructuring programme to be recognised after the year ended March 2024. Refer to note 2 for further details. Cash costs in the year were \u00a3114 million (2020/21: \u00a339 million). To date we have incurred costs of \u00a3640 million and cash costs of \u00a3153 million. In 2022/23 we expect to incur cash costs of around \u00a3100 million in relation to this programme.",

        "page_content": "- - Income recognised in relation to legal disputes of \u00a3182 million (2020/21: \u00a342 million) primarily relates to two settlements for overcharges from payment card processing fees. \u00a375 million of cash was received in prior financial years and held as deferred income, with \u00a393 million of cash received in the year net of legal fees. The prior year relates to ATM business rates reimbursement, and \u00a314 million of cash was received in the year in relation to these.\n- - Software as a service accounting policy change resulted in a non-cash cost of \u00a321 million (2020/21: Nil) following the IFRS interpretations committee clarification of how these costs should be treated. These costs represent the prior year impacts of this change.\n- - IAS 19 Pension income of \u00a311 million (2020/21: \u00a36 million) comprises pension finance income of \u00a315 million and scheme expenses of \u00a34 million.\n- - Other movements of \u00a355 million income (2020/21: cost of \u00a34 million) relate to property profits, acquisition adjustments and non-underlying financing costs. The positive movement year on year is driven by a gain on energy derivatives of \u00a376 million driven by higher energy prices. The energy derivatives relate to long-term, fixed price power purchase arrangements (PPAs) with independent producers. These are accounted for as derivative financial instruments, however are not designated in hedging relationships, therefore gains and losses are recognised in the income statement. Increases in electricity forward prices in the year have led to gains on the related derivative financial instruments. During the year, the Group entered into an additional PPA, however have designated this in a formal hedging relationship, with gains and losses being recognised within other comprehensive income.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe tax charge was \u00a3177 million (2020/21: \u00a337 million). The underlying tax rate (UTR) was 21.1 per cent (2020/21: 29.4 per cent) and the effective tax rate (ETR) was 20.7 per cent (2020/21: (22.6) per cent).\n\nThe UTR is lower than the prior year, with the higher underlying profit resulting in a smaller percentage impact from non-qualifying deprecation and the impact of accounting for the rate change on the recognition of deferred tax. Unlike previous periods, there is a positive impact on the UTR of prior year adjustments for corporation tax, reflecting the release of historic provisions held in respect of now agreed tax returns.\n\nThe ETR is significantly higher than the prior year, primarily due to the accounting loss in FY21. The major impact on the ETR in the current year relates to the non-deductibility of non-underlying costs and the impact of prior year adjustments to non-underlying items.\n\nSainsbury's expects an underlying tax rate in 2022/23 of around 25 per cent.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nUnderlying basic earnings per share increased to 25.4 pence (2020/21: 11.7 pence) driven by the increase in underlying earnings, partially offset by a higher share count. Basic earnings per share was 29.8 pence (2020/21: (9.4) pence loss per share).\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board has recommended a final dividend of 9.9 pence per share (2020/21: 7.4 pence). This will be paid on 15th July 2022 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 10th June 2022. In line with the Group's policy to keep the dividend covered 1.9 times by underlying earnings, this will result in an increased full-year dividend of 13.1 pence (2020/21: 10.6 pence), an increase of 24 per cent.\n\nSainsbury's has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP), which allows shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends in our shares. The last date that shareholders can elect for the DRIP is 24th June 2022.\n\nWe have laid out a capital allocation framework, signalling that we will prioritise the right level of investment to support our strategy and an investment grade balance sheet but that we expect to pay a higher proportion of underlying net earnings to shareholders, in the first instance through an increase in the dividend pay-out ratio to around 60 per cent from around 53 per cent.\n\n## Net debt and retail cash flows\n\nAs at 5 March 2022, net debt was \u00a36,759 million (6 March 2021: \u00a36,469 million), an increase of \u00a3290 million (2020/21: \u00a3478 million reduction). Excluding the impact of lease liabilities on net debt, Sainsbury's reduced net debt by \u00a3499 million in the year of which \u00a3240 million results from the conversion of the perpetual convertible bond in July 2021. Non lease net debt is now \u00a31,381 million lower than at 2018/19 year end, exceeding the four-year \u00a3950 million non lease net debt reduction target we had communicated with a year to spare, even excluding the impact of the perpetual convertible bond. Sainsbury's expects to generate retail free cashflow of at least \u00a3500 million per annum on average for the next three years.\n\nGroup net debt includes the impact of capital injections into Sainsbury's Bank, less dividends received, but excludes Financial Services' own net debt balances. Financial Services balances are excluded because they are part of the daily operating cycle of the Bank rather than for financing purposes.\n\nNet debt includes lease liabilities under IFRS 16 of \u00a36,618 million (2020/21: \u00a35,829 million). Lease liabilities increased by \u00a3789 million, primarily reflecting the impact of exercising purchase options on 21 leased supermarkets held by property investment pools in which the Group holds an interest. Following the exercise of the options, the lease liabilities have been remeasured based on the estimated purchase price of the stores.\n\n| Summary cash flow statement 1                                            | Retail 52 weeks to 5 March 2022 \u00a3m   | Retail 52 weeks to 6 March 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Retail underlying operating profit                                       | 1,001                                | 731                                  |\n| Adjustments for:                                                         |                                      |                                      |\n| Retail underlying depreciation and amortisation                          | 1,144                                | 1,179                                |\n| Share based payments and other                                           | 54                                   | 26                                   |\n| Retail non underlying operating cash flows  (excluding pensions)         | (3)                                  | (12)                                 |\n| Adjusted retail operating cash flow before  changes in working capital 2 | 2,196                                | 1,924                                |\n| (Increase)/decrease in working capital 3                                 | (185)                                | 452                                  |\n| Net interest paid 3                                                      | (323)                                | (372)                                |\n| Pension cash contributions                                               | (71)                                 | (101)                                |\n| Corporation tax paid                                                     | (23)                                 | (94)                                 |\n| Net cash generated from operating  activities 3                          | 1,594                                | 1,809                                |\n| Cash capital expenditure 3                                               | (645)                                | (568)                                |\n| Repayments of obligations under leases 3                                 | (491)                                | (499)                                |\n| Initial direct costs on right-of-use assets                              | (3)                                  | (7)                                  |\n| Proceeds from disposal of property, plant and                            | 46                                   | 27                                   |\n| equipment Dividends and distributions received 3                         | 2                                    | 22                                   |\n| Retail free cash flow 3                                                  | 503                                  | 784                                  |\n| Dividends paid on ordinary shares                                        | (238)                                | (232)                                |\n| Repayment of borrowings 3                                                | (256)                                | (539)                                |\n| Other 3                                                                  | (27)                                 | (13)                                 |\n| Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash  equivalents                    | (18)                                 | 0                                    |\n| Decrease in Debt                                                         | 747                                  | 1,038                                |\n| Conversion of perpetual convertible bond 4                               | 240                                  | -

        "page_content": "Adjusted retail operating cash flow before changes in working capital increased by \u00a3272 million year-on-year to \u00a32,196 million (2020/21: \u00a31,924 million). Retail non-underlying operating cashflows of \u00a33 million cost (2020/21: \u00a312 million cost) reflected legal disputes income offsetting restructuring costs. Working capital increased by \u00a3185 million (2020/21: \u00a3452 million decrease), in line with expectations as our working capital position normalised compared to a prior year where both our stock and payables positions were heavily impacted by COVID-19 trading patterns.\n\nCorporation tax paid decreased to \u00a323 million (2020/21: \u00a394 million) reflecting payments made in the prior year before the decision to forego business rates relief which subsequently impacted taxable profits. Proceeds from disposals of \u00a346 million (2020/21: \u00a327 million) resulted from disposals of non-trading sites.\n\nRetail free cash flow decreased by \u00a3281 million year-on-year to \u00a3503 million (2020/21: \u00a3784 million), driven by the working capital reduction in the prior year with some of this reversing in the current year. Retail free cash flow was used to fund dividends and reduce borrowings.\n\nDividends of \u00a3238 million were paid in the year, which were covered 2.1 times by free cash flow (2020/21: 3.3 times).\n\nThe Group held undrawn committed credit facilities of \u00a31,394 million and undrawn uncommitted facilities of \u00a3245 million as at 5 March 2022.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCore retail cash capital expenditure was \u00a3645 million (2020/21: \u00a3568 million). This was lower than expected due to a number of projects being delayed due to COVID-19.\n\nSainsbury's expects core retail cash capital expenditure (excluding Financial Services) to be around \u00a3700-\u00a3750 million per annum over the next three years, reflecting investment in high-returning supply chain, logistics and infrastructure projects including the Argos transformation.\n\n## Financial Ratios\n\n| Key financial ratios             | 52 weeks to 5 March 2022   | 52 weeks to 6 March 2021 1   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Return on capital employed (%) 2 | 8.4                        | 5.6                          |\n| Net debt to EBITDA 3             | 3.1 times                  | 3.4 times                    |\n| Fixed charge cover 4             | 2.8 times                  | 2.2 times                    |\n\n- 1 The prior year results have been restated to reflect the removal of business rates from onerous property contract provisions. Refer to note 2 of the accounts for further information.\n- 2 ROCE: Return is defined as a 52 week rolling underlying profit before interest and tax. Capital employed is defined as group net assets excluding the pension deficit/surplus less net debt (excluding perpetual securities). This is calculated using the average of 14 datapoints - the prior year closing capital employed, the current year closing capital employed and 12 intra-year periods as this more closely aligns to the recognition of profit / loss.\n- 3 Net debt of \u00a36,759 million includes lease obligations under IFRS 16 and perpetual securities treated as debt, divided by Group underlying EBITDA of \u00a32,206 million.\n- 4 Group underlying EBITDA divided by rent (both capital and interest) and net underlying finance costs, where interest on perpetual securities is treated as an underlying finance cost.\n\nAll three metrics saw significant improvements due to the recovery of profit and EBITDA following a prior year heavily impacted by COVID-19. Our net debt to EBITDA metric showed a smaller improvement as net debt increased, with the increase in lease liabilities more than offsetting significant non lease net debt reduction.\n\n## Property value\n\nAs at 5 March 2022, Sainsbury's estimated market value of properties, with values based on a 25 year lease with RPI increases, including our share of properties held within property joint ventures or investment vehicles, was \u00a310.9 billion (6 March 2021: \u00a310.1 billion), with the increase primarily driven by a reduction in property yields.\n\n## Defined benefit pensions\n\nThe Pension Scheme is valued on different bases for different purposes. For the corporate annual accounts, the value of the retirement benefit is calculated under IAS19 while the funding of the Scheme is determined by the Trustee's triennial valuation. The last triennial valuation, as at 30 September 2018, showed a deficit of \u00a3538 million. The Trustee is currently carrying out the latest triennial valuation as at 30 September 2021.\n\nAt 5 March 2022, the net defined benefit surplus under IAS19 for the Group was \u00a32,283 million (excluding deferred tax). The \u00a31,539 million increase from 6 March 2021 was driven by both changes in financial assumptions which resulted in a net gain, an adjustment to mortality assumptions and updated experience which lowered liabilities, in addition to gains on plan assets.\n\nDuring the year, the Sainsbury's section of the Scheme reached full funding on the stronger, secondary funding target agreed as part of the 2018 triennial valuation. This has resulted in one of the three streams of contributions payable to the Scheme under the Asset Backed Contributions funding framework switching off and another stream switching to the Argos section, until that section is also fully funded. Total contributions to the Scheme will therefore reduce by \u00a315 million a year.\n\nFor 2022/23, total pension scheme cash contributions are expected to be \u00a362 million.\n\n| Retirement benefit   obligations       | Sainsbury's as at 5 March  2022 \u00a3m   | Argos as at 5 March 2022 \u00a3m   | Group as at 5 March 2022 \u00a3m   | Group as at 6 March 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Present value of funded  obligations   | (8,060)                              | (1,313)                       | (9,373)                       | (10,218)                      |\n| Fair value of plan assets              | 10,158                               | 1,535                         | 11,693                        | 11,000                        |\n| Pension surplus                        | 2,098                                | 222                           | 2,320                         | 782                           |\n| Present value of unfunded  obligations | (20)                                 | (17)                          | (37)                          | (38)                          |\n| Retirement benefit surplus             | 2,078                                | 205                           | 2,283                         | 744                           |\n| Deferred income tax liability          | (562)                                | (78)                          | (640)                         | (192)                         |\n| Net retirement benefit  surplus        | 1,516                                | 127                           | 1,643                         | 552                           |\n\nKevin O'Byrne Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Principal Risks and Uncertainties\n\nRisk management is an inherent part of doing business; it balances risk and reward, determined through a careful assessment of both the potential outcomes and impact, as well as risk appetite.\n\nBelow and on the following pages, we set out an overview of our risk management framework, the principal risks at year end, ongoing mitigations and how these align to our strategy. The Operating Board monitors these principal risks on an ongoing basis and flexes mitigations where appropriate.\n\n## Our approach to risk management\n\nOur risk management framework is designed to:\n\n- -identify key risks that are aligned to our strategy but that could prevent us from achieving our strategic objectives\n- -assess the likelihood of these risks occurring, in combination with both the reputational and financial impact they may introduce\n- -manage the risks through implementing appropriate mitigation plans and controls, in line with our risk appetite\n- -monitor and report on our risks, associated mitigation plans and changes to the internal/external environment to the relevant governance fora\n\nThe following diagram provides an overview of the key risk management activities undertaken by leadership that support this risk framework and allow the Board to fulfil its obligations under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018. Please refer to page 61 for the role and remit of these governance bodies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Divisional risk maps reviewed and challenged\n- - Divisional emerging risk map reviewed\n- - Monitor risk mitigation plans\n- - Divisional risks relevant to fora area of scope reviewed\n- - Governance forum risk maps reviewed\n- - Corporate risk map updated and actions monitored\n- - Risk deep dives received\n- - Emerging risk map reviewed\n- - Corporate and emerging risk maps reviewed\n- - Risk deep dives received\n- - Risk policy and framework approved\n- - Internal audit reporting\n- - Annual internal controls certification by management\n- - Principal Risk and Uncertainty disclosures\n\nThe plc Board has overall responsibility for risk management, the system of internal control, and for reviewing the effectiveness of these at least annually. As such, they have approved our principal risks disclosure, as set out on pages 40 to 50. Certain responsibilities have been delegated to the Audit Committee, as outlined on page 73.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that active risk and issue management is an inherent part of doing business. Disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19 were actively managed either through day-to-day ways of working or if needed, through the Incident Response Team. Reflecting this, we do not have a specific principal risk related to COVID-19, although its impact on our principal risks continues to be assessed by the Board and is set out where relevant, in individual risk disclosures.\n\n## Our risk management process\n\nThe Risk and Internal Audit team facilitate 'bottom up' risk workshops with divisional leadership teams to identify the key risks which may prevent the achievement of their objectives. A risk map is maintained for each division, setting out key risks and their gross, net and target positions. A consolidated view of relevant risks and the effectiveness of mitigating activities - are also discussed at relevant governance fora, covering safety, data governance and operational resilience.\n\nThe Operating Board maintains the overall corporate risk map, which captures the key risks to achieving our strategic objectives.\n\nThe Operating Board formally reviews the corporate risk map from a 'top down' perspective twice a year, to discuss and agree the level of risk that the business is prepared to accept for each key risk. They also review and challenge the output of the bottom up risk process, considering new risks, movements in the position of risks and key themes.\n\nThe target risk position for the corporate risks is also captured to reflect management's risk appetite, where this differs to the current net position. This enables the Operating Board to agree and monitor appropriate actions as required. A risk dashboard is maintained for each corporate risk, setting out the risk, causes of the risk, key mitigations and any actions to reach the target risk position.\n\nOperating Board members also confirm annually that the corporate risk map accurately reflects their view of key risk across the organisation, that they are responsible for managing risks relevant to their division and that internal controls exist to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the risks in their areas of responsibility are appropriately identified, evaluated and managed; this is also reported to the Board.\n\nThe Risk and Internal Audit team provide the Audit Committee with a risk management update at each meeting, which includes an overview of changes to the corporate risk map and risk disclosures agreed by the Operating Board for their review and comment.",

This allows emerging risks to be considered and discussed by each division and then collated to perform a business-wide assessment of how emerging risks and opportunities may impact our business, considering their potential timeframe and degree of certainty. The outcomes are reported to the Operating Board and Audit Committee and relevant actions are agreed.\n\n## Independent review of our risk management framework\n\nDuring the year, an independent review of our risk management framework was carried out by a Big 4 firm; this review confirmed that we are compliant with the Risk Management requirements of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Actions to further enhance risk management activities were agreed in line with management's appetite. In particular, work continues to define the risk appetite for each corporate risk.\n\n## Changes to principal risk disclosures\n\nAs described above, the principal and emerging risks are discussed and monitored throughout the year to identify and respond to changes in the risk landscape.\n\nThe key change to the risks during the year relates to our previous 'Environment and sustainability' principal risk. The risk has been expanded and broadened in line with the launch of our Plan for Better strategic priority (see page 13), which includes our previous Net Zero commitments, but has been broadened to include our responsibilities towards putting our planet and people at the core of our business. There are two key changes.\n\nFirstly, the principal risk now also considers our social objectives, for example, to leave a measurable positive impact on the communities we serve and source from and to make Sainsbury's an inclusive place to work and shop.\n\nSecondly, we consolidated all climate resilience risks - the impact of changes to the environment on our business model - under this principal risk, where previously climate resilience risks were assessed within each of the relevant principal risks. This change also reflects the related governance and oversight processes.\n\nAs a result, we are reporting this as a new risk, have renamed it 'Environment and social sustainability' and given its increased scope, have reset the associated gross, net and target risk positions. Further information on our ongoing implementation of the TCFD recommendations can also be found on page 17.\n\nThe net position of all other corporate risks remain unchanged from last year.\n\n## Our Principal Risks\n\nThe most significant principal risks identified by the Board and the associated mitigations are set out below. This year, we have ordered them to first show those that have been included in the risk modelling undertaken as part of the preparation of the viability statement (see page 51). This reflects that these have the potential to have the largest impact on the business and is indicated with the following symbol:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe other principal risks are then set out in no priority order.\n\nWe have also more clearly drawn out the link between each principal risk and the group's key performance indicators (see page 30) and continue to highlight the link with the strategy of the business, as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFood First\n\nBrands that Deliver\n\nSave to Invest\n\nConnected to Customers\n\nPlan for Better\n\nThe net risk movement from the prior year for each principal risk and uncertainty has been assessed and is presented as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncreased net risk exposure\n\nReduced net risk exposure\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNew\n\nrisk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMitigations in place, supporting the management of the risk to a net risk position, are also described for each principal risk.\n\n## Ukraine\n\nWe continue to monitor the situation in Ukraine and the associated impacts this may cause across our principal risks, with regard to our customers, our colleagues and our supply chain.",

        "page_content": "## Statement of Viability\n\n## 1 How Sainsbury's assesses its prospects\n\nThe Group's business activities and strategy are central to assessing its future prospects. These, together with factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 53. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity are highlighted in the Financial Review on pages 32 to 37.\n\nThe Group manages its financing by diversifying funding sources, structuring core borrowings with long-term maturities and maintaining sufficient levels of committed funding via the Revolving Credit Facility. Maintaining a suitable level of undrawn additional funding capacity minimises liquidity risk.\n\nThe Group's prospects are assessed primarily through its corporate planning process. This includes an annual review which considers profitability, the Group's cash flows, committed funding and forecasted future funding requirements over three years, with a further two years of indicative movements. As part of the strategic planning process, the Directors make a number of assumptions about business performance and the availability and effectiveness of mitigating actions available to the Group. In particular, cashflow forecasting gives visibility of the Group's headroom, comparing net debt to the level of committed facilities over the planning period.\n\nThe most recent corporate plan was signed off in October 2021, and refreshed in March 2022, as part of the normal budgeting process. This is reviewed by the Operating Board and ultimately by the PLC Board with involvement throughout from both the CFO and CEO. Part of the Board's role is to consider the appropriateness of any key assumptions, taking into account the external environment, business strategy and model.\n\nIn its assessment of the Group's prospects, the Board has taken into account:\n\n- -The Group's Food First strategy. This strategy is putting food back at the heart of Sainsbury's and offering customers great value and high quality products. The strategy aims to deliver profitable volume growth while reshaping our business.\n- -Inflationary pressures. As we emerge out of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Group is now seeing high levels of inflation with external forecasts indicating this could continue and limit discretionary spend.\n- -Climate change considerations. The Group's most recent corporate planning and budgeting processes includes assumed cashflows to address climate change risks, including costs associated with initiatives in place as part of the Plan for Better commitment which include reducing environmental impacts and meeting customer expectations in this area, notably through reducing packaging and reducing energy usage across the estate.\n- -The Group's financial position . The Group has materially reduced net debt and improved its net asset position over the past year. Furthermore, the Revolving Credit Facility, which enables the Group to maintain sufficient levels of contingent funding, has two Facilities; a \u00a3300 million Facility (A) and a \u00a31,094 million Facility (B). Facility A has a final maturity of April 2025 and Facility B has a final maturity of October 2024. As at 5 March 2022, the Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn.\n\n## 2  The assessment period\n\nThe Directors have determined that the three years to March 2025 is an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement. This was considered the appropriate timeframe by the Directors because:\n\n- -This period is consistent to that used for the Group's corporate planning process as detailed above, and reflects the Directors' best estimate of the future prospects of the business.\n- -The Group does not earn revenue through long-term contracts. Therefore, changes to the Group's Corporate Plan are predominantly impacted by sales and cost assumptions. These are more difficult to predict beyond a three-year time-horizon. Both have been stress-tested as part of the viability assessment.\n\n## 3  Assessment of viability\n\nTo make the assessment of viability the following has been performed:\n\n- -Scenarios have been modelled over and above those in the corporate plan, based upon a number of the Group's principal risks and uncertainties (as documented on pages 38 - 50). The scenarios were overlaid into the corporate plan to assess the potential impact on net debt of one or more of these crystallising over the assessment period, and have been tested in isolation and in combination with one another. The impact of the movements in net debt on the Group's funding headroom were then assessed. Where required, available mitigating actions to maintain funding headroom were considered as part of the assessment. These include reducing any non-essential capital expenditure and operating expenditure on projects, bonuses and dividend payments.\n- -Reverse stress-testing was performed to determine the extent to which cash flows would need to deteriorate before fully-utilising the Group's funding headroom, and after taking into account any mitigating actions as detailed above.\n\nWhilst each of the risks on pages 38 - 50 has a potential impact and have been considered as part of the assessment, only those that represent severe but plausible scenarios were selected for modelling through the corporate plan.",

The required reduction was considered extreme and implausible.\n\nIn performing the above analysis, the Directors have made certain assumptions around the availability and effectiveness of the mitigating actions available to the Group.\n\nThe scenarios above are hypothetical and severe for the purpose of creating outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group; however, multiple control measures are in place to prevent and mitigate any such occurrences from taking place.\n\nIn year one, the modelling has shown that the business is able to withstand a combination of all of the scenarios and still maintain funding headroom. For years two and three, none of the scenarios modelled individually fully utilised the funding headroom. However, all of the scenarios modelled together would fully utilise the funding headroom at three individual and isolated periods. Management does, however, have controllable mitigating actions available as detailed above with which to respond that ensure the Group remains viable.\n\nTaking into account the Group's current prospects and principal risks and uncertainties, the Directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the three years to March 2025.\n\nConsideration was also given to the conflict in Ukraine which has continued to develop subsequent to the Group's balance sheet date. Inflationary pressures which may be caused by the conflict have already been embedded in Scenarios 1 and 2 documented above. Thus it was concluded that the impact of the conflict in Ukraine does not impact the conclusions reached over going concern and viability.\n\n## 4  Going concern\n\nAs a consequence of the work performed to support the viability statement above, the Directors also considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements which are shown on pages 99 to 199.",

We want to help everyone eat better and, through our sustainability agenda, we are helping to drive lasting, positive change in the UK and internationally. We are committed to playing a leading role in offering affordable food that supports healthy and sustainable diets and helps customers reduce their impact on the planet, one plate at a time. This year we launched Plan for Better, our new sustainability plan covering our environmental and social commitments, which is integrated into our business strategy. Our Plan for Better sets out our sustainability goals across the whole business, priority areas of focus, key commitments and our progress. We have identified areas which matter most to our stakeholders and are aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, so that we can make the biggest difference.\n\nWe announced the acceleration of our carbon emissions target to become Net Zero in our own operations by 2035, five years earlier than our original ambition. You can read more on our Net Zero plan on page 16. We also announced our commitment, alongside other retailers, to work with the WWF to halve the environmental impact of UK supermarket baskets by 2030.\n\nThis year we were the Principal Supermarket Partner of COP26, the UN Climate Change Conference, which took place in Glasgow in November 2021. You can read more about our Plan for Better, which includes our participation at COP26, on pages 13 to 17, in our Non-financial KPIs on page 30, in our Principal risks and uncertainties on page 50 and in our CR&S Committee Report on pages 71 to 72.\n\nOur policies support our approach to the environment and help our suppliers meet our sustainability goals. They include our Sustainable Sourcing Policy Goods for Resale, which helps support suppliers to effectively carry out their ethical trading responsibilities and meet Sainsbury's ethical commitments. It also outlines how suppliers should implement our Code of Conduct for Ethical Trade, including protection of the environment. The policy can be found on our website https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/sustainability .\n\n## Colleagues\n\nWe want to be a place where people love to work and shop. This means being an inclusive employer where colleagues are treated fairly and with respect, where they are encouraged to develop their skills and fulfil their potential. Rewarding our colleagues has been a real focus for the business over the last two years. Read more on our colleagues in our Plan for Better section on pages 13 to 14, Engaging with our stakeholders and our Section 172 statement on page 25, our Non-financial KPIs on page 30, and in the Board diversity policy in our Nomination Committee Report on page 69.\n\n## Social matters\n\nWe have a long history of building partnerships and delivering great impact in our communities, locally and internationally. We are committed to supporting social cohesion, economic prosperity and inclusive growth and we aim to positively impact those in need through fundraising, volunteering, donations and by raising awareness.\n\nRead more about our communities in our Plan for Better section on pages 13 to 17, and the CR&S Committee Report on pages 71 to 72.\n\n## Human rights\n\nOur customers want to be confident that the people who make, grow or sell our products are not being exploited or exposed to infringements on their human rights. Although the primary duty to protect human rights sits with national governments, we fully recognise our responsibility as a company to respect human rights throughout all our operations. Our commitment covers all aspects of our business, our colleagues, customers and suppliers and is supported by our Human Rights Policy. We do not tolerate any form of human rights abuse within our business or supply chains.\n\nThrough our due diligence processes, we seek to identify, prevent and mitigate adverse human rights risks that are linked to our operations, products or services and deal with any adverse impacts caused.\n\nYou can read more about human rights in our Plan for Better section on pages 13 to 17. Our Modern Slavery Statement can be found at www.about.sainsburys.co.uk .\n\n## Anti-corruption and anti-bribery\n\nOur values form the framework which guides the behaviours of all colleagues across the business. We expect all our colleagues and contractors to act with honesty and integrity and never to engage in any activity which could be considered as accepting a bribe or giving a bribe. Our Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy provides guidance and expectations on our colleagues' responsibilities and behaviour, and our expectations to prevent bribery and fraud. We have a Disciplinary and Appeals Policy to help encourage everyone to achieve and maintain our rules and standard of conduct, attendance, capability and performance. Our Whistleblowing Policy covers how to report wrongdoing when honesty and integrity are compromised. More information on whistleblowing can be found on page 75.\n\n## Other information\n\nOther information to support this statement can be found as follows:\n\n- -Description of our business model on page 7\n- -Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) on pages 17 to 23\n- -Non-financial KPIs on page 30\n- -Principal risks and uncertainties on pages 38 to 50\n- -Statement of Viability on page 51\n- -Audit Committee Report on pages 73 to 77\n- -All of our public policies, reports, codes and standards are available at www.about.sainsburys.co.uk\n\nThe Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors and signed on its behalf by:\n\n## Kevin O'Byrne",

        "page_content": "## Governance Report\n\n## Dear Shareholder\n\nIn what has been another exceptional year for retail, the Board has maintained its focus on the implementation of the strategy we outlined in November 2020 and we are pleased with the progress made in the first year of our three-year plan. Our strong performance has enabled us to balance returns to all stakeholders with an improved value proposition for customers, enhanced reward for our outstanding colleagues and increased dividends for shareholders.\n\nThe Board has ensured that our strategy remains aligned with our purpose, culture and values. We receive regular reports on key performance measures across each of our five strategic pillars at Board meetings. The engagement between the Board and Operating Board is strong.\n\nColleague wellbeing and engagement remains a key item on the Board's agenda, with particular focus on colleague pay and benefits. We have invested over \u00a3100 million investment in retail colleague pay, which increased the base rate of pay to at least \u00a310 per hour, and the other aspects of our improved colleague offer, is a recognition of the extraordinary work they do for our customers.\n\nOur sustainability strategy is a key priority for the Board and the CR&S Committee, whose report is set out on pages 71 to 72. The evolution of our Net Zero by 2040 plan, to our Plan for Better, underpins our progress in this area, including the acceleration of our Net Zero target to no later than 2035. Plan for Better is a central part of our strategy and Board agenda and we recognise that, whilst we have made good progress over the last year, we have more ambitious targets in the year ahead as we embed the key initiatives into business as usual. We increased our focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and the Board participated in a University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership event and we hosted our first ESG event in June 2021, launching our Plan for Better strategy and enabling shareholders to gain a stronger understanding of our ESG priorities. Our sponsorship of COP26, an event attended by several members of the Board, underlines our commitment in this area and we look forward to working with the WWF to develop industry-wide practice in relation to Scope 3 emissions.\n\nThe business has continued to make progress against its diversity and inclusion strategy and I am pleased to report that Sainsbury's has featured for the first time in the FTSE 100 Top Ten Best Performers list for Women in Leadership, demonstrating our commitment to be the most inclusive retailer. Actions to support the progression and representation of our ethnically diverse colleagues are an important part of our strategy and we supported the additional commitments made, including joining the Black British Network. We have published our integrated Gender and Ethnicity Pay Report for a second year and are pleased to have seen the pay differentials reduce during that time.\n\nThe Board was deeply saddened by the news that Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover passed away earlier this year and fully supports the tribute made on page 2. We will continue to build on his unique legacy and challenge ourselves to demonstrate the pioneering leadership that he showed in building the business. Our clear vision and strategy for the business builds on this ambition.\n\nWe are proud of the leadership shown by Simon during the year and the outstanding contribution of the management team. Our most recent evaluation of the Board's effectiveness showed significant progress against previous actions as well as areas of future focus.\n\nI would like to thank all of my Board colleagues for their commitment, support and flexibility over the past year. Whilst we welcome a return to face-to-face meetings, a number of our Board meetings were conducted in a virtual environment by necessity. This new hybrid way of working has enabled us to maintain strong governance and robust decision-making, delivering against our strategy. I will again express my thanks to Susan Rice for her many years of service and her significant contribution to the Board, particularly as Senior Independent Director and Chair of our Remuneration Committee. Following a robust recruitment process, we welcome Jo Bertram to the Board and look forward to the part that she will play in Sainsbury's future. Following Susan's retirement from the Board, I am delighted to announce that Brian Cassin will be appointed as Senior Independent Director, Jo Harlow will become Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Keith Weed will be appointed as Chair of the CR&S Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Martin Scicluna\n\nChairman\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code\n\nThe Board considers that the Company has complied in full with the Principles and Provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code) with the exception of the provision below. Further details on how we comply with the Code are available in the Strategic and Governance Reports, as outlined below.\n\nProvision 38 of the Code requires that pension contribution rates, or payments in lieu, for executive directors are aligned with those available to the workforce. As disclosed in our 2020 Annual Report and Accounts, Kevin O'Byrne's contractual cash pension supplement is not yet aligned with the pension contribution rates available to the workforce, but a clear incremental reduction plan to address this has been in place since 2019/20. The original plan, resulting in alignment in 2024, was approved by 98.87 per cent when put to shareholders as part of the Directors' Remuneration Report within the 2020 Annual Report. Subsequently, the alignment has been accelerated and full compliance will be achieved by the end of the 2022 calendar year. Further detail can be found in the 2021 Annual Report/2022 Directors' Remuneration Report on page 71.\n\n## Compliance with the Code\n\n## Board leadership and Company purpose\n\nMore information can be found on pages 61 to 63.\n\n## Division of responsibilities\n\nMore information can be found on page 64.\n\n## Composition, succession and evaluation\n\nMore information can be found on pages 65 to 67.\n\n## Audit, risk and internal control\n\nMore information can be found on pages 73 to 77.\n\n## Remuneration\n\n- More information can be found on pages 78 to 95.",

The Chairman holds regular and informal calls between Board meetings with the Non-Executive Directors, to consider their views and to enable thorough preparation for Board discussions. In addition, the Senior Independent Director held discussions with the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors or the Chairman being present.\n\nDirectors were kept informed of the key discussions and decisions made at each of the four principal Committees - Audit, Nomination, Remuneration, and Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability. The Chair of each Committee provided a detailed summary at the Board meeting following the relevant Committee meeting.\n\nIn the rare event that a Director is unable to attend a Board meeting, the Chairman will meet with the relevant Director in advance, so that their comments and inputs can be considered. Following the meeting, the Chairman will provide an update to them on the outcomes of the discussions.\n\nThe following table shows the attendance of Directors at scheduled Board meetings. The Board held eight scheduled meetings during the year, together with several unscheduled meetings which were well attended by all Directors.\n\n| Martin Scicluna    | 8(8)   | David Keens 2   | 3(3)   |\n|--------------------|--------|-----------------|--------|\n| Brian Cassin       | 8(8)   | Kevin O'Byrne   | 8(8)   |\n| Jo Harlow          | 8(8)   | Susan Rice      | 8(8)   |\n| Adrian Hennah 1    | 8(8)   | Simon Roberts   | 8(8)   |\n| Tanuj Kapilashrami | 8(8)   | Keith Weed      | 8(8)   |\n\nThe maximum number of scheduled meetings held during the year that each Director could attend is shown in brackets.\n\n- 1. Adrian Hennah joined the Board on 1 April 2021.\n- 2.   David Keens stepped down from the Board on 9 July 2021.\n\n## Time commitment and conflicts of interest\n\nPrior to appointment, each prospective Non-Executive Director confirms that they will have sufficient time available to be able to discharge their responsibilities effectively and that they have no conflicts of interest. This is discussed by the Board before any appointment is made. In addition, the Board reviews and approves in advance requests by Directors wishing to undertake new external responsibilities or directorships and considers both the time commitments involved and any potential conflicts. The conflicts of interest register is reviewed annually to ensure it is up to date and that there are no new conflicts to consider. No changes were recorded during the year that would impact the independence of any of the Directors.\n\nThe Board supports Executive Directors having a non-executive directorship role as part of their continuing development, provided that they have sufficient time to balance their commitments to the business with any external role. Subject to Board approval, each Executive Director may hold one non-executive director position. Whilst recognising the benefits of Non-Executive Directors having varied and broad experiences, the Board keeps in mind investor guidance and reviews the commitments of each Director annually.\n\nThroughout the year, all Directors have demonstrated high levels of availability and responsiveness for additional meetings and discussions where these have been required. The Board remains confident that individual members continue to devote sufficient time to undertake their responsibilities effectively.",

The Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director briefs them on policies, Board and Committee procedures, and core governance practice, which includes Directors' duties and Market Abuse Regulations. They also receive induction materials including recent Board and Committee papers and minutes, strategy papers, investor presentations, Matters Reserved for the Board and the Board Committees' Terms of Reference. They visit stores, depots and other business locations and meet key advisers. Director inductions are ongoing processes over a number of years during which they will cover the areas in the table below.\n\nAdrian Hennah joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 April 2021 and succeeded David Keens as Audit Committee Chair following David's retirement from the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 9 July 2021.\n\n## The Directors' induction process\n\n## Understanding the business\n\n## Understanding the sector and environment\n\n## Meet the Sainsbury's internal team and advisers\n\n## Visit Group operations\n\n- - Business strategy, purpose and vision\n- - Overview of each business area and its opportunities\n- - Operating plans, current KPIs and targets\n- - Key business relationships\n- - Board and governance procedures\n- - Board effectiveness reviews and actions\n- - Matters relevant to the Board Committees they join\n- - Recent Board and Committee papers and minutes\n- - Key people and succession plans\n- - Remuneration and reward across the business\n- - Finance, treasury and tax overviews\n- - Risk profile and approach\n- - Internal audit, risk and internal controls\n- - The market and competitors\n- - Customer trends\n- - Consumer and regulatory environment\n- - Brand perception and reputation\n- - Analyst and investor perspectives\n- - Key stakeholders' views\n- - Directors\n- - Committee Chairs\n- - Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director\n- - Members of the Operating Board\n- - Senior management across the business\n- - Members of the external audit team\n- - Remuneration consultants\n- - Brokers\n- - Store visits\n- - Distribution centres\n\n- Store support centres\n\nAdrian received a tailored induction on joining the Audit Committee. This followed the usual programme for Directors' induction as outlined below but was specifically designed to support his transition to Audit Committee Chair. This included attending the April Audit Committee meeting as an observer and working closely with David Keens to ensure an orderly transfer of responsibilities.\n\nAdrian also met a number of colleagues and stakeholders pertinent to his role on the Audit Committee. This included introductory meetings with EY, the external auditors and Mark White, the Groceries Supplier Code Adjudicator. He also met individually with each of the Chief Financial Officer's direct reports and their respective teams which included Internal Audit, Treasury, Property, Pensions, IT and various finance teams. In addition to this, Adrian visited Sainsbury's Bank's offices in Edinburgh and met with the Sainsbury's Bank's Chair, the Chief Financial Officer and the Chairs of the Bank's Risk and Audit Committees.\n\nAdrian also visited the Sainsbury's Newbury store with Simon Roberts and the Waltham Point depot with the Director of Logistics and Supply Chain. This gave Adrian the opportunity to see first-hand the operations of a store and depot, and to meet colleagues working within these locations. He has also participated in Board sessions with employee representatives to hear their views and experiences.",

        "page_content": "## Continuing development\n\nNon-Executive Directors continue to learn about the business by meeting with management, colleagues, suppliers and other stakeholders as described on the previous page. All of the Non-Executive Directors continue to engage with different aspects of the business to support their ongoing development. Further information on the continuing development of two of our NonExecutive Directors, Jo Harlow and Tanuj Kapilashrami, is described below.\n\nDuring the year, Jo Harlow, in her capacity as Chair of the Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee, hosted regular Climate Dialogues for Sustainability Chairs with support from Chapter Zero. These covered areas such as external resources, employment engagement, biodiversity issues, COP26, and linking sustainability goals and remuneration. She also became a Board member of Chapter Zero, a network of company Chairs, Committee Chairs and Non-Executive Directors who are committed to developing their knowledge of the implications of climate change for UK businesses. Jo met with several Sainsbury's store managers and had discussions with the Chairman, Audit Committee Chair and Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director on sustainability governance. Jo participated in COP26 and attended a number of Sainsbury's events including the inaugural Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) day, the Farming Conference and a leadership event. In addition to this, Jo has regularly attended and spoken at professional webinars, such as those hosted by Legal & General Investment Management, Willis Towers Watson, Deloitte, Fidelio and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum. Jo's engagement with colleagues and regular development activities have enabled her to make an effective contribution as a Non-Executive Director, particularly in relation to sustainability and climate change issues.\n\nIn addition to regular discussions with members of the Operating Board, Tanuj Kapilashrami regularly attends Sainsbury's Great Place to Work colleague listening sessions with the Group HR Director, the Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors. Tanuj's participation in these sessions provided her with the opportunity to engage directly with colleagues and hear their views on various topics during the year including our strategy, values and culture, product availability, colleague pay and the decision to close our stores on Boxing Day. These sessions enabled Tanuj to develop a greater understanding of the business and bring employee insights into Board discussions. As part of her external executive role, Tanuj is engaged with professional bodies, industry forums and global peers and her external perspective is valuable particularly in discussions involving colleagues and culture at Sainsbury's.\n\n## Professional development and training\n\nTo ensure the Board updates and refreshes its skills and knowledge, we have a programme to support Directors' training and development requirements in relation to governance, investor expectations and regulatory impacts. This includes regular presentations from management on relevant governance matters.\n\nThe Board was upskilled on social, environment and climate change issues and developments in a sustainability event led by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership in June 2021. The Board also received external strategic updates from leading industry analysts in the food retail sector at a Board dinner in September and at the Strategy Conference in October. Suppliers also attended a Board dinner in March to enable the Board to hear feedback directly from suppliers.\n\nBoth the Audit and Remuneration Committees received updates on relevant accounting and remuneration developments, trends and changing disclosure requirements from external advisers and management. The CR&S Committee received stakeholder and regulatory updates on ESG matters from management. More information can be found on pages 71, 73 and 78.\n\nThe Board and Committees were updated on compliance with the Modern Slavery Act, Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and Directors' responsibilities under Section 172 of the Companies Act. The Board was also provided with MAR training from the Company Secretariat this year. The Directors have access to advice from the Company Secretary and independent professional advice is available at the Company's expense, if necessary, in fulfilling their duties and responsibilities.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn line with best practice, we review the Board's effectiveness on an annual basis through a formal performance evaluation, including an assessment of the Board and its Committees. An external evaluator conducts the review every third year, and in the two intervening years this is carried out by the Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director, to ensure continuity over the three-year cycle. The last external evaluation was carried out by Clare Chalmers, an experienced independent provider of board effectiveness reviews, from November 2019 to February 2020.\n\nThis year's internal evaluation was conducted from December 2021 to March 2022 and led by the Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director. The review explored the key areas of focus set out below and themes that arose for action in the 2020/21 internal evaluation. Board members completed an online questionnaire, based on previous years to maintain continuity, which also incorporated last year's key feedback topics and recent developments in the business, its strategy and governance.\n\nThe key areas of focus included: the effectiveness, role and priorities of the Board and its Committees; the Board's composition, skills, succession and culture; the alignment of purpose, strategy and values; leadership of the Board and the business; ways of working and broader risk management; and engagement with stakeholders. Each Director was given the opportunity to raise their own additional points. The results of the internal questionnaire were discussed with each of the Directors in individual discussions with the Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director.\n\nFollowing the individual discussions, the Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director discussed the conclusions (including any feedback with individual Directors) with the Chairman and then presented a written report to the Board. A separate meeting with the Board was held to discuss the findings and the Board agreed the key actions. The Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director also met with the Senior Independent Director to discuss feedback for the Chairman, which was subsequently shared with him as part of his review meeting. Each of the Committee Chairs received specific feedback on the effectiveness of the relevant Committee for their consideration.\n\n## Findings of the 2021/22 review\n\nThe report identified a number of strengths of the Board including:\n\n- - The Board continues to operate effectively, with enhanced focus on performance and the key strategic issues facing the business this year\n- - The Board has open discussions before major decisions are taken, and the pace and progress of decision-making has been appropriate with robust iteration between meetings to maintain momentum\n- - The Board has responded well to issues in an uncertain trading environment\n- - The external strategic input received at the sustainability event, Board dinners and the Strategy Conference during the year were well received by the Board\n- - The Chairman is a highly effective leader and has developed strong relationships and trust with the NEDs\n- - The Executive Directors keep the Board well informed of key issues arising, provide strong leadership and management's handling of the pandemic was outstanding\n- - The recent NED appointees are making strong contributions to the Board\n- - The NEDs are highly engaged and provide a good level of challenge and support to management\n\nThe report also identified development areas for the Board in the year ahead which are detailed on page 67.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nAs described above, the evaluation process also assessed the effectiveness of the Board Committees. A theme identified from the process was a desire for further cross functionality between the Committees where there was an overlap of discussions, which is being implemented. The findings ultimately concluded that each of the Committees continued to operate effectively, was well led and was efficient in dealing with current issues.\n\nAny specific findings and action points are overseen by each Committee Chair, with consideration of the overall Board findings which are deemed relevant to the Committee's work.",

This includes an assessment of whether the balance of skills, experience, knowledge and independence is appropriate to enable it to operate in a highly effective manner and to promote the long-term success of the Company. The Committee also assists the Board in its consideration of conflicts of interest and independence issues throughout the year. No conflicts of interest or independence issues were identified as a result of this activity.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the Board's short, medium and long-term succession planning at the executive and non-executive level and is satisfied that the Company is well positioned to move forward with continuity and is led by a strong leadership team.\n\nThe Board supports the recommendations of the Hampton-Alexander Review on gender diversity and the Parker Review on ethnic diversity. The Board has made good progress against its diversity and inclusion strategy, and the Company will feature for the first time in the FTSE 100 Top Ten Best Performers list for women in leadership. Three of the Board of Directors are women (33 per cent) and 47.8 per cent of our Operating Board members and their direct reports are women. One member of the Board of Directors identifies as ethnically diverse.\n\nInclusivity throughout the business is highly important to us and we continue to focus on this and the development of our diverse talent pipeline. We are highly supportive of the diversity and inclusion initiatives in place which are detailed on pages 69 to 70.\n\nFollowing a robust recruitment process, Jo Bertram will join the Board on 7 July 2022 and I look forward to the part that she will play in Sainsbury's future. After nine years of outstanding contribution and commitment, Susan Rice will step down from the Board after the AGM in July 2022. Following Susan's retirement from the Board, I am delighted to announce that Brian Cassin will be appointed as Senior Independent Director, Jo Harlow will become Chair of the Remuneration Committee and Keith Weed will be appointed as Chair of the CR&S Committee. During the year, David Keens stepped down from the Board in July 2021, and Adrian Hennah joined the Board in April 2021, succeeding David as Audit Committee Chair in July 2021. The Committee recommended the appointment of Adrian Hennah and Jo Bertram to the Board following rigorous search processes. The search processes incorporated the extensive work completed last year to identify the skills and experience required to deliver our strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMartin Scicluna\n\nChairman\n\n## Principal role and responsibilities\n\nThe Nomination Committee is responsible for reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees; taking into account skills, knowledge, experience and diversity, and making recommendations to the Board for any changes. It is responsible for formulating plans for succession at Board and senior management levels, taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing the business, and the skills and expertise needed to ensure the long-term success of the Company.\n\nThe Committee's Terms of Reference are available on the Company's website www.about.sainsburys.co.uk .\n\nThe Committee held three scheduled meetings in the year, together with several unscheduled meetings relating to recruitment and succession planning.\n\nAttendance at the scheduled Nomination Committee meetings:\n\n| Martin Scicluna   | 3(3)   | Tanuj Kapilashrami   | 3(3)   |\n|-------------------|--------|----------------------|--------|\n| Brian Cassin      | 3(3)   | David Keens 1        | 1(1)   |\n| Jo Harlow         | 3(3)   | Susan Rice           | 3(3)   |\n| Adrian Hennah     | 2(2)   | Keith Weed           | 3(3)   |\n\nThe number of meetings held during the year is shown in brackets.\n\n- 1 David Keens stepped down from the Board on 9 July 2021.\n\n## Committee membership\n\nThe Committee consists of the Chairman of the Board and six Non-Executive Directors, all of whom are independent. The Chairman of the Board is also the Chair of the Committee, and the Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director or his nominee acts as the Secretary of the Committee. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer attend meetings by invitation.\n\n## Succession planning\n\n## Talent development\n\nWe recognise the importance of developing our people and, as such, the talent pipeline within our business remains a key focus for the Committee. Our senior leadership population is a source of future Operating Board talent, with five members of our Operating Board, Rhian Bartlett, Graham Biggart, Tim Fallowfield, Mark Given and Clodagh Moriarty, progressing through this route. Our Leading Together and Leading Steps Up programmes are key investments we are making into developing senior leadership over the next two to three years.\n\n## Appointments to the Board\n\nThe Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure for the appointment of new Directors to the Board. When the need to appoint a Director is identified, for instance when a Director is approaching the end of their ninth year on the Board, the Committee reviews the experience, skills and knowledge required, taking into account the Board's skills matrix, existing composition and the relevant experience and understanding of our stakeholder groups. We engage executive search consultants and consider the gender, nationality, educational and professional background of candidates, as well as individual characteristics to see if they will be a good fit against the desired specification. Suitable candidates are then interviewed by Committee members. The process is led by the Chairman who receives support from the Company Secretary and Corporate Services Director as appropriate.\n\nCareful consideration is given to ensure that proposed appointees have enough time available to devote to the role and that the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board with regard to experience and understanding of our stakeholder groups is maintained.\n\nWhen the Nomination Committee has identified a suitable candidate, it then makes a recommendation to the Board with the Board making the final decision. During the year, the Committee followed the above procedure during the search for the new Non-Executive Directors, Adrian Hennah and Jo Bertram. MWM Consulting were engaged by the Committee as external executive search consultants. MWM Consulting are one of the small number of firms accredited by the Hampton-Alexander Committee for their leading",

We are committed to being a truly inclusive retailer where every single one of our colleagues can fulfil their potential and where all our customers feel welcome when they shop with us. We embrace and actively promote diversity, inclusion and equity and aim to reflect the diverse communities we serve. Simon Roberts and the Operating Board provide clear and committed leadership and accountability of our inclusion agenda, with members of the Operating Board acting as sponsors across wellbeing, diversity and inclusion, and our Colleague Networks. To ensure continued progress in this space, the governance of diversity and inclusion is a regular part of the Operating Board agenda.\n\nTo ensure sustained improvement, we continue to look at focused initiatives, culture and accountability through aspirational targets. In 2021, we set new, stretching targets to take us to 2024 which covers more of our talent pipeline and covers Black representation specifically. We have set a target of 50 per cent female, 12 per cent ethnically diverse and 3 per cent Black representation at senior management level 1 . Importantly, these targets will form part of our long-term incentives for management. We are publicly reporting on our progress against these targets twice a year with further information available on our website https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/ sustainability/better-for-everyone/diversity-and-inclusion .\n\nActions to support the progression and representation of our ethnically diverse colleagues are an important part of our strategy. We continue to build on our commitments in support of our Black colleagues, all of whom are part of our focus on changing the conversation around race. Further information on the strategies we have in place to support our drive for inclusivity and the progression of our diverse talent can be found on page 14.\n\nThe Board receives regular updates on our inclusion initiatives and the Board, CR&S Committee and Nomination Committee receive detailed presentations throughout the year on our inclusion priorities and the progress we are making. The Remuneration Committee also reviewed and approved the Ethnicity and Gender Pay Report which can be found on our website\n\nhttps://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/making-a-difference/ gender-pay-gap .\n\n## Board diversity policy\n\nWe promote diversity on our Board and we believe there is good balance amongst our Non-Executive Directors, with extensive and wide-ranging experience of retail and other consumer-facing businesses and varying length of service. Our Non-Executive Directors have other highly relevant skills derived from serving in a range of major executive and non-executive positions throughout their careers and a blend of cognitive, personal strengths and backgrounds.\n\nWe are keen to ensure that Board membership reflects diversity in its broadest sense, our colleague base and the communities in which we serve. The Board's approach to its own diversity is as follows:\n\n## Aim to maintain a level of at least 33 per cent female Directors and at least one Director who identifies as ethnically diverse on the Board.\n\nThree of our nine Board Directors are women (33 per cent) and one identifies as ethnically diverse. In making its recommendations to the Board, the Committee has due regard to the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 and other best practice and will consider the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Board, its diversity in the broadest sense, including gender and ethnicity, how the Board works together as a team and other factors relevant to its effectiveness.\n\nThe Board continues to review the development of the pipeline of both ethnically diverse and female senior management within the business. Of the ten members of our Operating Board during the year, four were women (40 per cent). More information on diversity and inclusion can be found on pages 13 to 14.\n\n## Consider candidates for appointment as Non-Executive Directors from a wide pool.\n\nDuring the year, the Nomination Committee discussed Non-Executive Director appointments and succession. It worked closely with MWM Consulting in compiling long and short lists of diverse candidates from various backgrounds and sectors. Candidates were identified, interviewed and measured against a detailed job specification, skill sets and preferred attributes.\n\n## Assist the development of a pipeline of high-potential colleagues by encouraging key members of senior management within the business to take on additional roles to gain valuable Board experience.\n\nThe Board supports and encourages initiatives that strengthen the pipeline of talent in the Company including:\n\n- - A comprehensive talent management review is presented and discussed by the Board\n- - Highly personalised plans and initiatives for high-potential colleagues to broaden their skill sets and experience to prepare them for future senior roles; for example, through boardroom exposure, and non-executive and trustee roles outside the business\n- - Senior management mentoring schemes sponsored by Board and Operating Board members\n- 1 The definition of 'senior management' in the UK Corporate Governance Code should be the Executive Committee or the first layer of management below Board level, including the Company Secretary. However, with such a large workforce, we believe including our top 230 senior management in the scope of our targets ensures that we are focused on improving diversity in all of our most significant leadership positions and developing our pipeline of talent. Our top 230 lead large teams and are critical role models in the organisation, playing a vital role in shaping the inclusive culture that we are working hard to create. We want all of our colleagues to see visible and diverse leaders in every part of the business.",

We continue to focus on stakeholder engagement including our customers, colleagues, suppliers and the community. We continue to listen and to engage with our stakeholders and more information about this can be found on page 24.\n\nIn my fourth year as Chair of the Committee, we continue to see great developments in our sustainability agenda, particularly with the evolution of our Net Zero by 2040 plan to our Plan for Better, a key pillar in our broader business strategy. Launching in June 2021, our Plan for Better encompasses a range of sustainability commitments across our environmental and social agenda. We were also hugely proud to be chosen as the Principal Supermarket Partner of COP26, the United Nations Climate Change Conference, giving us the opportunity to demonstrate strong industry leadership and inspire our colleagues, customers and other businesses to rally together to protect and restore our planet for the future.\n\nCOP26 took place in Glasgow for two weeks in November 2021, and as part of our involvement we hosted multiple events. These included chairing panels on a consistent approach to data and labelling and how we are helping everyone eat better in order to protect our planet and our health. We also engaged the public with our exhibition stand which focused on how we can all make small changes to our plates to reduce the impact on the planet. During COP26, we announced a number of new commitments, including accelerating our target to become Net Zero in our own operations by 2035 and becoming signatories to WWF's Retailers' Commitment for Nature, working with other retailers to halve the impact of UK shopping baskets by 2030. As part of our commitment to reduce our value chain emissions, we wrote to 400 of our key suppliers, who constitute a high proportion of our value chain emissions, requesting that they disclose their carbon emissions through the CDP or Higg platform, as well as setting their own Net Zero science-based targets. We're pleased that 87 per cent of our key food suppliers are reporting via CDP.\n\nThis year we were pleased to arrange an upskilling session for the whole Board, delivered by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and in June 2021 we held an Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) event with investors. We talked with investors about our new sustainability strategy, how we're progressing against our commitments and how our plan aligns with our brand commitment: Helping everyone eat better. We have been a signatory of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) since 2020 and this year have implemented its recommendations in full to strengthen our climate resilience; more information on this can be found on page 17.\n\nThe Committee is very pleased with many of the Plan for Better outcomes achieved this year - rolling out LED lighting to 100 per cent of our supermarket estate and transitioning to 100 per cent renewable electricity across the entire estate. We also implemented our partnership with Neighbourly on our food donation programme across all supermarkets, which has supported a 119 per cent increase in food redistribution for human consumption year-on-year. For more information on progress on our Plan for Better, see page 13 and visit www.about.sainsburys.co.uk for our standalone bi-annual Plan for Better Reports.\n\nCOVID-19 has continued to impact the business over the past year, with ongoing periods of change for our colleagues. We continue to focus on engagement with colleagues and clear communication and this year have introduced a new metric on colleague happiness, currently at 68 this year. The Committee was also highly supportive of the initiatives put in place to support the communities we serve, including our campaign to Help Brighten a Million Christmases and the launch of our Helping everyone eat better Community Grants to help tackle food insecurity. In total \u00a338.4 million was raised for good causes this year; more information can be found on page 15.\n\nThe launch and progress of Plan for Better during the last year has occurred during a time of unprecedented challenges for the industry. Sainsbury's ambitions as reflected in its Plan for Better commitments are strategic and stretching and the Committee and I look forward to reporting on further progress in the future!\n\nJo Harlow Chair, Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Committee\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Principal role and responsibilities\n\nThe Committee's principal role is to review the sustainability strategy, ensuring it is aligned with the Company's purpose, strategy, culture, vision and values.

I would like to thank David for his significant contribution and leadership of the Committee over the last six years, and for the helpful support and advice he gave to me in our handover period. Brian Cassin and Keith Weed have both provided important contributions over the year. The different and complementary skills we each bring to the Committee have helped ensure robust and productive discussions with management and the external auditor. We are also well supported by our Director of Internal Audit, Risk and Resilience and the Internal Audit team; they play an important role and their work is respected throughout the business.\n\nKey areas of focus for the Committee during the year included:\n\n- - Reviewing financial reporting, including the processes in place to ensure the Annual Report and Financial Statements are fair, balanced and understandable\n- - Considering the impact of COVID-19 on key accounting judgements\n- - Reviewing the effectiveness of external and internal audit processes and the effectiveness and appropriateness of our systems of internal controls\n- - Reviewing of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) metrics and assurance\n- - Reviewing the Group's data governance and information security strategy\n- - Reviewing audit and non-audit fees\n\nThe UK's regulatory landscape continues to evolve and, during the year, the government consulted on proposals for the extensive reform of audit and corporate reporting. While, at the time of writing, it is not yet clear what changes in regulation will materialise, the Committee and management are challenging ourselves and our external auditor on areas for potential development, as well as how we might respond to changes in regulation.\n\nThrough the annual Board evaluation process (pages 66 to 67), the Board has again confirmed the effectiveness of this Committee in its role of supporting the J Sainsbury plc Board in compliance with its duties.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdrian Hennah\n\nChair, Audit Committee\n\n## Principal role and responsibilities\n\nThe primary role of the Committee is to ensure the integrity of the financial reporting and auditing processes and monitor the effectiveness of the Group's internal control and risk management systems.

More information can be found in Significant financial and reporting matters on pages 76 to 77.\n\n## Treasury funding and liquidity\n\nThe Committee assessed the business's secured and unsecured borrowing facilities and their appropriateness in tenor and amount to Group requirements.\n\n## Assumptions and qualifications in support of the viability and going concern statements\n\nThe Committee assessed the financial projections over three years, which continues to be an appropriate timeframe for the Statement of Viability as approved by the Board. The key factors underpinning the projections beyond three years were reviewed. More information can be found in the Statement of Viability on page 51 and the Significant financial and reporting matters on page 76.\n\n## Assessment of whether the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable\n\nOne of the Committee's key roles is to advise the Board that it is satisfied that the Annual Report and Financial Statements are fair, balanced and understandable (see page 100) and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy. In doing so, the Committee ensures that management disclosures reflect the supporting detail, and/or challenges management to explain and justify their interpretation and, if necessary, re-present their position. The external auditor supports this process, in the course of its statutory audit, by auditing the accounting records of the Company against agreed accounting practices, relevant laws and regulations. In addition, the Committee:\n\n- - Reviewed the processes and controls that underpin the Annual Report preparation including confirmation that the reporting team and senior management were fully aware of the requirements and their responsibilities\n- - Received a draft of the Report and provided feedback on it, highlighting any areas that required further clarity. The draft Report was amended to incorporate any feedback ahead of final approval\n- - Was provided with a list of the key matters included in the Annual Report, highlighting both positive and negative influences\n- - Reviewed and discussed the key factors considered in determining whether the Report is fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee advised the Board that the Annual Report and Financial Statements are fair, balanced and understandable, and that the Directors have provided the necessary information for our shareholders to assess the Company's prospects, business model and strategy.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls, and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nRisk management reviews of principal risks and uncertainties, and emerging risks and opportunities, compared to corporate plans See pages 38 to 50.\n\n## Reports from the Audit and Risk Committees of Sainsbury's Bank, including risk and compliance reporting processes\n\nSainsbury's Bank plc is a subsidiary of the Company, with an independent Board responsible for setting the Bank's strategy, risk appetite and annual business plan. It has an independent Chairman and five Non-Executive Directors, four of which are independent. The Bank's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer also sit on the Bank's Board. The Bank's Chief Executive Officer, supported by the Executive Committee, is responsible for day-to-day management of the business.\n\nThe Chairs of the Bank's Audit and Risk Committees, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer attended meetings of the Committee and provided updates on critical accounting judgements and estimates, important operating and regulatory matters, the impact of COVID-19, the control framework and environment, and key risks. There is communication between Sainsbury's Internal Audit function and its equivalent within the Bank. See Significant financial and reporting matters on page 76.\n\n## External audit\n\n## Scope of the external audit plan and fee proposal\n\nThe Committee reviewed EY's overall work plan and, through regular communication, advised EY of any specific matters which the Committee was considering from previous audits and current operations. The Committee approved EY's remuneration and terms of engagement.\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nThe independence and objectivity of the external audit function is a fundamental safeguard to the interests of the Company's shareholders. In line with regulation, the previous EY audit partner rotated off the audit at the end of the 2020/21 audit. The Committee approved the appointment of Colin Brown as the new EY partner for 2021/22 in April 2021.\n\n## Non-audit services and fees\n\nThe Committee has overseen the Company's policy which restricts the engagement of EY in relation to non-audit services. The intention is to ensure that the provision of such services does not impact on the external auditor's independence and objectivity. It identifies certain types of engagement that the external auditor shall not undertake, including internal audit and actuarial services relating to the preparation of accounting estimates for the financial statements. It requires that individual engagements above a certain fee level may only be undertaken with pre-approval from the Committee or, if urgent, from the Chair of the Committee and ratified at the subsequent meeting of the Committee. It recognises that there are some types of work where a detailed knowledge of the Company's business is advantageous. The policy is designed to ensure that the auditor is only appointed to provide a non-audit service where it is considered to be the most suitable supplier of that service.\n\nThe Committee received a report on the non-audit services provided. The annual aggregate of non-audit fees is capped at 70 per cent of the annual average of the audit fees for the business for the preceding three-year period.\n\nThe majority of the non-audit work undertaken by EY during 2021/22 related to services provided by EY in the capacity of reporting accountant. The total non-audit fees were \u00a31.0 million. The audit fees for the year in respect of the Group and subsidiaries were \u00a33.5 million. A breakdown of the fees is provided in note 9 of the consolidated financial statements on page 127.\n\n## Effectiveness of external audit\n\nThe Committee considers the effectiveness of the external auditor on an ongoing basis during the year, including its independence, objectivity, appropriate mindset and professional scepticism. The Committee has regards to the:\n\n- - Experience and expertise of the external auditor\n- - Quality of their direct communication with, and support to, the Committee\n- - Content, insights and value of their reports\n- - Fulfilment of the agreed external audit plan\n- - Robustness and perceptiveness of the external auditor in their handling of key accounting and audit judgements\n- - Interaction between management and the external auditor, including ensuring that management dedicates sufficient time to the audit process\n- - Provision of non-audit services\n- - Evaluation of the effectiveness of the external auditor\n- - Other relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements\n\nThe Committee conducted an audit effectiveness review. The review included the distribution of questionnaires to those Directors and managers in the business directly involved in the audit. The questionnaires sought feedback on their experience with the external auditor, considering areas such as the knowledge and experience of the audit team, audit strategy and planning, and the quality of communication. Management collated the responses and reported back to the Board.",

        "page_content": "As a result of the review, it was determined that EY maintained good working relationships and had demonstrated strong technical understanding, including within the Tax and Bank component teams. Opportunities for improvements in the planning process were positively discussed between EY and Sainsbury's management during the audit debrief, with steps being taken on both sides to drive further improvements to the process going forward. EY were robust in their questioning and provided good support whilst challenging management effectively.

A resolution to this effect will be tabled at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Tender of external auditor\n\nEY was appointed as the Company's external auditor in July 2015, following a tender process.

Improvement and actions required are highlighted and used to assist in reviewing the effectiveness of Internal Audit. The Committee concluded that Internal Audit continued to be effective.\n\n## Other\n\n## Audit Committee's effectiveness\n\nThe review of the Committee's effectiveness formed part of the Board evaluation. See pages 66 and 67.\n\n## Significant issues raised through the whistleblowing process\n\nThe Committee received updates at each meeting on any significant whistleblowing matters. The Committee Chair receives earlier notification of matters that may develop into a significant incident. No issues arose that required the Committee to be updated ahead of a scheduled meeting.\n\nAll issues were escalated to the relevant manager for investigation. The availability of the Rightline whistleblowing facility was communicated across the business during the year.\n\n## Data governance and information security\n\nUpdates on the data governance and information security programme were provided during the year, including updates on strategic risks, third-party assurance, cyber security, the plan for legacy assets, access controls and security.\n\n## Ongoing material litigation\n\nThe Committee is appraised on all material litigation and potential impacts on financial reporting disclosures. These are also provided to the Board.\n\n## Compliance with the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP)\n\nGSCOP sets out how large retailers should manage certain aspects of their relationship with grocery suppliers. Each retailer to which it applies has to appoint a Code Compliance Officer (CCO) whose duties include hearing disputes between suppliers and the retailer. Sainsbury's has appointed the Director of Internal Audit, Risk and Resilience as its CCO.\n\nGSCOP requires that the business delivers an annual compliance report to the Groceries Code Adjudicator (GCA), as approved by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and a summary must be included in the Annual Report and Financial Statements. This is set out below.\n\n## Summary Annual Compliance Report\n\nSainsbury's GSCOP compliance framework is based on a collaborative relationship with the GCA, clear policies and procedures, mandatory training and regular monitoring and reporting of compliance. Sainsbury's also has specific internal resource who provide all relevant colleagues with day-today advice and guidance.\n\nWe continue to engage positively with the GCA on GSCOP matters and work collaboratively to address any concerns and improve our processes through our regular catch ups. We also proactively contact the GCA for clarification and guidance. We were pleased to be recognised by suppliers, through the GCA's 2021 annual survey, as the retailer with the highest overall compliance with GSCOP.\n\nThis year, as part of our Food First strategy, we conducted structured planning with some of our branded suppliers. To support these discussions, additional training and guidance was developed in conjunction with the Legal team to help ensure compliance with GSCOP throughout the process. Feedback from suppliers on the programme was provided by the GCA and changes were implemented to strengthen processes, communication and oversight mechanisms.\n\nIn March 2021, Sainsbury's agreed to adhere to the GCA's voluntary code on forensic auditing from 6 March 2021, alongside all other in-scope retailers. This limits the auditing of suppliers' trading accounts for monies owed to no more than the current and previous two financial years. Suppliers were notified of this change during the financial year; the commitment is reciprocal, and suppliers must agree to limit their own audit activity in return.\n\nThe challenges on global supply chains, including those for Groceries, have been widely reported during the year. Sainsbury's Buying and Supply Chain teams worked closely with suppliers to maintain supply and to minimise the impact on customers. Senior legal representatives continue to be involved in providing support and advice to the business, as well as regular communications to suppliers reminding them of their obligations and our ways of working.\n\nRelevant policies are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis and are made available to colleagues. This is supported by Sainsbury's GSCOP training, which is compulsory for colleagues who are part of the Buying team and for colleagues who are directly or indirectly involved in decisions that impact GSCOP. As a result, over 1,800 colleagues completed appropriate training during the year. GSCOP training is reviewed and refreshed annually. We also established clear consequences for training non-compliance.\n\nRegular meetings are held between the CCO, Legal, Internal Audit and the Commercial Planning team to identify and assess emerging risk areas and an established compliance monitoring programme is embedded within the business. The Operating Board and Audit Committee are updated four times a year on GSCOP matters.\n\n31 potential breaches were reported in 2021/22 (eight in 2020/21). Of the 31 potential breaches of GSCOP, three were deemed to be outside the Code and three were still in progress at the end of the financial year, although two were subsequently resolved. The increase in potential breaches was primarily driven by the supplier planning process, referenced earlier.\n\nOf the 27 complaints that were in scope of the Code the majority were resolved within our Trading Division using standard escalation procedures with the remainder being resolved through discussions between the CCO and the supplier. None were pursued as formal disputes with the CCO or referred to the GCA for arbitration. Causes of potential breaches are reviewed to identify areas for improvement.",

Throughout, we remained focused on delivering enhanced value for all our stakeholders: our customers, our colleagues, the communities in which we operate, and our shareholders.\n\nYou will read in this Annual Report about the issues we faced due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the fresh challenges that arose during the year as a result of the changing marketplace. I would like to thank our colleagues for their hard work and commitment that enabled us to deliver for our customers day in, day out, which has significantly contributed to our strong performance over the year.\n\nWe are one year into our three-year plan to put food back at the heart of Sainsbury's and as the economic climate changes and the cost of living keeps on rising, we are committed to supporting our customers and colleagues every way we can. It's against this backdrop that we made reward decisions during the year. As always, the Remuneration Committee seeks to take a measured and responsible approach to executive pay, considering decisions from the perspective of all our stakeholders as well as the external environment. And as a business, we are particularly focused on ensuring that colleagues throughout the organisation are recognised and fairly rewarded for the important roles that they play in our success.\n\n## Remuneration highlights\n\n## Executive pay\n\n- - Executive pay is directly linked to the Company strategy and 2021/22 outcomes are aligned to the performance delivered\n- - The proposed full-year dividend of 13.1 pence is the highest dividend the business has paid for five years\n- - The Remuneration Committee has applied downward discretion to remove \u00a3100 million of net COVID-19 benefit from both the annual bonus and the LTIP outturn\n- - Executive pay changes - 2022 salary increase of 3.5 per cent for both Executive Directors is below that of the broader workforce. On appointment, Simon Roberts' salary was over 10 per cent lower than the previous Chief Executive's salary, and total fixed pay 25 per cent lower. Simon waived his 2020/21 annual bonus. Kevin O'Byrne's pension will be aligned to the wider workforce by the end of this year\n\n## Colleague pay\n\n- - We are the first major supermarket to pay colleagues the Living Wage, wherever they work in the UK\n- - Our base rate is now \u00a310 per hour nationally - ahead of the Living Wage of \u00a39.90 - and our London base rate is \u00a311.05, in line with the London Living Wage\n- - Sainsbury's hourly-paid retail colleague pay has increased by 25 per cent and Argos by 31 per cent over the past five years - with over \u00a3200 million invested over the last two years\n- - Continued enhancement of benefits including changes to colleague discount and pay while on Family Leave\n\n## Strong year of delivery for our stakeholders Customers and community\n\nAs COVID-19 continued to impact our daily lives, we remained focused on keeping our customers and colleagues safe. We have continued to invest in price, supporting customers as the cost of living has accelerated. Last year we launched Sainsbury's Quality, Aldi Price Match which matches Aldi on popular products and we continue to run regular Price Lock campaigns to give customers certainty on the price of a broad range of everyday and essential items for at least eight weeks.\n\nIt is also important to us that we continue to support our charitable partnerships and the communities in which we operate. Over the 2021/22 financial year, we\n\nraised over \u00a338 million for good causes across all our programmes. This year we have also worked with Comic Relief to support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, donating \u00a32 million.\n\n## Colleagues\n\nI'm really proud to be able to say that all Sainsbury's and Argos retail store colleagues can earn at least the Living Wage, regardless of where they work in the UK. As a retail business with over 171,000 colleagues, our wage bill of \u00a33.6 billion is our largest operating cost and is 11.9 per cent of our sales, so any change to the base rate is a material investment decision, but we know that paying our colleagues fairly is not only the right thing to do but also drives business performance.\n\nIn recent years, we have invested significantly in retail colleague pay Sainsbury's base rates have increased by 25 per cent over the last five years and Argos by 31 per cent and we have removed age-related pay. Last year we invested over \u00a3100 million improving the base rate and making three Thank You payments to recognise the efforts of our colleagues during the pandemic. And this year we will make another over \u00a3100 million investment in hourly-paid retail colleagues. Our base rate is now \u00a310 per hour nationally - ahead of the Living Wage of \u00a39.90 - and our London base rate is \u00a311.05, in line with the London Living Wage.\n\nOver the year we made some other changes to further support our colleagues, including improving pay under our Family Leave policy and enhancing our colleague discount benefit - the year-round discount of 10 per cent now increases to 15 per cent for five days around every pay day. This certainty regarding periods of higher discount enables colleagues to plan and budget and has been warmly welcomed by colleagues. These are just part of the comprehensive benefits package offered to all colleagues.\n\n## Shareholders\n\nThe Remuneration Committee, as always, has made its remuneration decisions with reference to the experience of shareholders.\n\nWe delivered a strong set of results for the year, with underlying profit before tax rising by 24.6 per cent to \u00a3730 million against 2019/20 and retail free cash flow rising to \u00a3503 million. The proposed full-year dividend of 13.1 pence adds to the robust total dividends delivered to shareholders over the course of the pandemic and is the highest dividend the business has paid for five years. However, for the reasons outlined below, the Committee decided to make a downward adjustment to financial metrics for remuneration purposes.\n\n## Continued focus on sustainability\n\n2021/22 was another important year in our long-term objective to be Net Zero by 2035. Our Plan for Better sets out our sustainability goals across our whole business, outlining our priority areas of focus, our key commitments and our progress.\n\nIn recognition of the importance of these objectives, last year we included a number of Plan for Better measures in the senior executive long-term incentive plan, and similar measures are included this year. As a Committee, we recognise that this is an area of evolving practice and we will continue to monitor how these metrics influence behaviours and outcomes to ensure that they are operating as intended and delivering results in line with our strategy.\n\n## Executive remuneration in 2021/22\n\nAs in prior years the Remuneration Committee has sought to take a measured and rounded approach to performance assessment when determining incentive outcomes to ensure that they are fair and proportionate.\n\nFor the bonus in respect of 2020/21, the Committee exercised discretion to adjust the outcome under the profit element of the bonus to partially exclude certain exceptional, non revenue-generating COVID-19 costs. This adjustment was made to better reflect the underlying performance of the business and the shareholder experience.\n\nFor the 2021/22 bonus the Committee once again reviewed both actual performance and the context for delivery. The underlying profit reflects an extremely strong result, especially when considered alongside the strategic progress made in the year. However, there was also a recognition that, in contrast to last year, the pandemic had resulted in an unbudgeted",

        "page_content": "net-positive impact on performance, primarily due to sustained higher food consumption in the home. This net benefit was estimated to be \u00a3100 million after adjusting for COVID-19 costs.\n\nAfter a detailed review, the Committee determined that it would use its discretion to adjust both the short and long-term incentive outcomes to reflect this \u00a3100 million benefit. This approach has been adopted notwithstanding the fact that the proposed shareholder dividend is based on the full, non-adjusted profit outcome of \u00a3730 million.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the total remuneration received by Executive Directors in respect of 2021/22 is a reasonable reflection of performance over the period, taking into account both the current unusual market conditions and the positive progress that has already been made against our strategic plan.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nProfit accounts for 50 per cent of the overall bonus, with 20 per cent based on retail free cash flow and 30 per cent based on a strategic scorecard. On a formulaic basis, the profit element and the retail free cash flow element would both have paid out at 100 per cent. As a result of the \u00a3100 million adjustment noted above, the outcome under the profit element is reduced to 80 per cent whilst the retail free cash flow element remains at 100 per cent, reflecting the strong cash generation over the period.\n\nThe 30 per cent of the bonus based on a strategic scorecard is made up of customer metrics, colleague metrics and individual strategic objectives. The Committee considered a number of data points when reviewing performance, including the growth in customer satisfaction scores in Sainsbury's and Argos, our colleague engagement score and improvements in gender and ethnicity representation. The Committee has determined that both the customer element and the colleague element should pay out at 9 per cent each (out of a possible 10 per cent).\n\nUnder Simon Roberts' leadership, the Company has made sound progress against the Win in Food strategy and, one year into our three-year plan, we are on track to meet all eight of our financial and operational targets. The Committee reviewed Simon's and Kevin's performance against their individual strategic objectives and determined they had both delivered their objectives and exceeded expectations. Therefore, the Committee agreed a pay out of 9 per cent (out of a possible 10 per cent) for both Executive Directors.\n\nThis results in an overall bonus of 87 per cent of the maximum for both Simon and Kevin. As Simon waived his entitlement to a bonus for 2020/21, it is difficult to make year-on-year comparisons.\n\n## 2019 Future Builder\n\nAs with the 2018 Future Builder scheme, the impact of COVID-19 could not be anticipated at the point that the 2019 Future Builder targets were set. On a formulaic basis, the vesting multiplier would have been 3.3 (out of a maximum of 4.0) or 82.5 per cent of maximum, reflecting strong EPS, retail free cash flow and ROCE and outperformance of cost savings targets. Consistent with the approach taken for the bonus, the results under the EPS, ROCE and retail free cash flow elements were adjusted downwards by \u00a3100 million, to reflect the pandemic-related benefit described above.\n\nThis resulted in a significant reduction in the EPS element as well as a reduced ROCE outturn. Maximum vesting was achieved on retail free cash flow and cost savings. Overall the result is a reduced performance multiplier of 2.8 (out of a maximum of 4.0), meaning this award vests at 70 per cent of the maximum.\n\n## 2022/23 Remuneration\n\nBoth Executive Directors will receive a 3.5 per cent salary increase in 2022. This is below the increase of at least 5.3 per cent that hourly-paid retail colleagues received and in line with the increase for other senior management roles. Kevin O'Byrne's pension will reduce again this year and it will be fully aligned to the colleague rate of 7.5 per cent of salary by the end of the 2022 calendar year. Simon Roberts' pension was set at 7.5 per cent on his appointment. As previously disclosed, on appointment Simon Roberts' salary was over 10 per cent lower than previous Chief Executive's salary, and total fixed pay 25 per cent lower. He also waived his 2020/21 annual bonus.\n\nLast year, we introduced the 2021 Win in Food incentive plan which linked longterm remuneration to the eight metrics used to track the successful execution of the strategy communicated in November 2020. For Executive Directors, 80 per cent is based on the four key financial measures (retail free cash flow, ROCE, EPS and cost savings) and the remaining 20 per cent is subject to key strategic indicators (market share, customer, colleague and Plan for Better).\n\nThese metrics will once again be utilised for long-term share awards in 2022. The Committee reviewed the performance targets and made some changes to ensure the targets remain appropriately stretching.\n\nFor 2022/23, the Chief Executive Officer will be granted a long-term share award of 250 per cent of salary and the Chief Financial Officer 225 per cent, in line with the current shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Pay across Sainsbury's\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers wider colleague reward when determining pay arrangements for the Executive Directors and this remains a fundamental part of our approach to pay.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee reviewed the Group's Ethnicity and Gender Pay Gap Report and were pleased to see an improvement in the gaps. To ensure sustained improvement, the Company has set stretching representation targets and these form part of our long-term incentives for senior executives. Further details can be found on page 83 of this report and also on our website.\n\n## AGM and Remuneration Policy\n\nWhile the resolution on the Directors' Remuneration Report received the support of the significant majority of our shareholders at the 2021 AGM, the Remuneration Committee noted that a minority were unsupportive. Investor concerns primarily related to the bonus outcomes for 2020/21. The Committee did consult with major investors last year prior to determining the 2020/21 incentive outcomes, and the decisions were only taken once there was sufficient comfort that the majority of those consulted were supportive of the approach.\n\nShareholder views were again carefully considered when the Committee determined the incentive outcomes for the 2021/22 financial year, in particular the adjustment made for the net COVID-19 benefit. Over many years, the Committee has been keen to understand and take on board the views of our shareholders before making significant decisions on pay. The Committee intends to continue its dialogue with shareholders now and in the future years.\n\nOur Remuneration Policy was approved at the 2020 AGM and will be due for renewal at the 2023 AGM. We will be reviewing our policy during the coming year and appropriately consulting with shareholders on any changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Dame Susan Rice\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Committee held four scheduled meetings within the year, together with a number of unscheduled meetings.

        "page_content": "## Remuneration in context\n\n## Our reward objectives\n\nOur objective is to have a fair, equitable and competitive total reward package that encourages colleagues to serve and help every customer, drives profitable sales and provides opportunities for colleagues to share in Sainsbury's success.\n\n## Executive remuneration principles\n\nThe above reward objective applies to our senior executive population as well. In addition, the Committee believes it is important that a significant portion of the Executive Directors' package is performance-related, delivered in shares and that the performance conditions applying to incentive arrangements support the delivery of the Company's strategy and long-term shareholder value.\n\nThe Remuneration Policy for our senior executives is therefore based on the following principles:\n\nLinked to our business strategy\n\nEncourages the right behaviours to deliver long-term growth\n\nAligned to our values and culture\n\nSecures high calibre leaders\n\nEnables share ownership\n\n## Linking executive pay to our business strategy\n\nThe Committee carefully considers the performance metrics incorporated into the annual bonus and long-term incentive plan to ensure they support our strategic priorities. The annual bonus is linked to key financial and individual strategic objectives, while the long-term incentive plan rewards for delivery against our key strategic objectives and therefore includes all eight of the key performance metrics that we use to track our success. The achievement of these metrics supports long-term sustainable performance and value creation for our shareholders.\n\n## Key considerations\n\nWhen reviewing the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors and determining the approach to pay, in line with the Code, the Committee gives consideration to the following:\n\n- -Simplicity and transparency: The Remuneration Policy has been designed to incentivise senior executives to achieve clearly defined financial, operational and strategic objectives. The Committee reviews performance metrics and targets each year to ensure that they continue to be clear and aligned to the delivery of the strategy. The changes we introduced for the 2021 Win in Food incentive plan demonstrate this\n- -Alignment to our purpose, values and culture: Sainsbury's has a clear purpose and strong value set resulting in a unique culture which plays an essential role in achieving our strategy. Our culture is underpinned by our Purpose (our core reason for being); our Valued Behaviours (what we want from our people); and being a Great Place to Work (encouraging colleagues to want to be their best). The Committee ensures our pay practices drive the right behaviours in line with our values and culture\n- -Risk mitigation: The Committee reviews and sets performance targets each year to ensure that they drive the right behaviours and are appropriately stretching without encouraging unnecessary risks. Under the annual bonus and LTIP the Committee has the ability to adjust incentive outcomes to ensure that they are reflective of the underlying financial and non-financial performance of the participants and the Company. The Committee believes that this discretion is an important feature and mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes. In addition, in the event that certain risk events come to light the Committee may operate recovery provisions on all incentive awards. This has been demonstrated by the Committee over the last two years\n- -Potential outcomes: When setting, and subsequently implementing, the policy for senior executives, the Committee considers our business goals, the retail market and competitors, the potential and actual outcome and cost to the Company, stakeholder views and best practice. The Committee believes it is important to exercise sound judgement at all stages during the process to ensure that executive pay levels appropriately reflect performance and are aligned with the interests of shareholders\n\n## Fair pay for colleagues\n\nWhen considering remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, the Committee reviews the pay and conditions of colleagues at all levels throughout the Company and takes these into account. The Committee receives regular updates regarding any major changes to the pay and benefits of colleagues and has been kept informed of all pay decisions relating to treatment of colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the incentives that were introduced for drivers in both supermarkets and distribution centres. The Committee also reviews information on internal measures, including details of our ethnicity and gender pay gap and the ratio of Chief Executive Officer remuneration to the remuneration of our colleagues, and considers how these compare externally.\n\nSainsbury's employs over 171,000 colleagues who work hard to deliver for our customers. The Committee recognises that our colleagues are the cornerstone of our business and essential to the overall success of our plans. The remuneration objectives for our colleagues follow the same principles as the policy for the Executive Directors. Pay and benefits reflect the nature and contribution of the role and take into account levels of pay in comparable roles in the market.",

During 2021/22 we issued over 342,000 instant rewards and 11,000 exceptional performance awards to colleagues, along with appreciation gifts. This equates to a cash value of over \u00a36 million\n- - The Company provides support for mental and physical wellbeing through a variety of mechanisms and we have an Employee Assistance Programme. During the year we also launched guidance on dealing with the menopause for both line managers and colleagues\n- - We want to support colleagues in their career goals and operate a number of development programmes including one designed to support retail colleagues looking to move into front line management and leadership roles\n\n## Pensions and life assurance\n\n- - Participation in a pension plan is offered to all colleagues on a contributory basis, with the Company contribution varying by grade\n- - Hourly-paid store colleagues are offered a matching scheme up to 7.5 per cent of salary\n- - We have c. 115,000 colleagues in our pension plans\n- - Colleagues in our pension plan also receive six times life assurance (one times if not in a pension or in an auto-enrolled scheme)\n\n## Share ownership\n\n- - All colleagues have the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company through our all-employee share plans\n- - Around 26,000 colleagues participate in our Sharesave plans, representing an uptake rate of 17 per cent\n- - Colleagues can also participate in Sainsbury's Share Purchase Plan (SSPP), which is our name for the partnership element of the Share Incentive Plan\n\n## Ethnicity and gender pay\n\n- - Our colleagues are paid according to their role not their gender or ethnicity\n- - The ethnicity pay gap shows the difference in the average hourly rate of pay of ethnically diverse colleagues compared to that of white colleagues. Our 2021 mean ethnicity pay gap is -0.9 per cent (down from 0.4 per cent) and our median ethnicity pay gap is -2.8 per cent (up from -3.1 per cent). Location plays a key part in explaining the gap, as nearly 40 per cent of our ethnically diverse colleagues work in our London stores earning a location premium\n- - Our 2021 mean gender pay gap continued to improve year-on-year to 8.5 per cent (down from 9.7 per cent), as female representation at higher grades has improved. Our median gender pay gap has also reduced to 4.7 per cent (down from 5 per cent). Like a lot of companies our gap is caused by the fact that we have more men than women in our most senior roles, more women than men in our hourly-paid roles, and more men in hourly-paid specialist roles that attract premiums, such as online delivery drivers\n- - The Board is committed to improving gender and ethnically diverse representation. Our aim is to have 50 per cent of our Operating Board and 50 per cent of our Directors and Senior Managers to be women. At the year-end, these figures were both 40 per cent. Ethnically diverse colleagues make up only 8.2 per cent of our senior leadership population and we have much more work to do to reach our target of 12 per cent by 2024\n\n## CEO pay ratios\n\n- - Our CEO pay ratio of 183:1 reflects the size and make up of our colleague base. The ratio has increased compared to the 2020/21 ratio, primarily due to the fact that our CEO, Simon Roberts, waived his entitlement to an annual bonus for 2020/21 and the 2019 Future Builder has vested at a higher level than the previous year\n- - The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles ranked by total remuneration are all store-based hourly-paid colleagues\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\n- - The Board recognises the important role our colleagues play in the success of Sainsbury's. It takes colleague engagement and the views of colleagues seriously. We communicate regularly with colleagues to provide information about our strategy, our performance and on operational matters as well as asking for feedback on how colleagues are feeling. Further details are set out on pages 13 and 25 of the Annual Report\n- - Our Great Place to Work groups operate at store level rolling up to a national group (which is our Workforce Advisory Panel), which meets with Board members on a regular basis to discuss current issues. Whilst we do not formally consult with colleagues on the setting of the Executive Director Remuneration Policy, we have used these discussion groups for Non-Executive Directors to engage with colleagues directly on executive remuneration to give them the opportunity to share their views and opinions. The last listening session covering executive pay was held in May 2021 and the next one is in July 2022\n- - Colleagues are able to become shareholders in the Company and can comment on the policy in the same way as other shareholders",

On a more consistent like-for-like basis his 2020/21 remuneration would have been \u00a32,898k (assuming full-year salary, benefits, pension and full-year 2020/21 bonus; we have still included his actual LTIP vesting even though the grant value relates to being an Operating Board Director and not Chief Executive Officer).\n\nThe 2021/22 total pay figure includes share price appreciation within the LTIP value. Over the relevant period the share price has increased by 27 per cent, aligning remuneration with the shareholder experience.\n\nThe table below shows a single remuneration figure for all qualifying services for the 52 weeks to 5 March 2022, together with comparative figures for the 52 weeks to 6 March 2021.\n\n|                     | Simon Roberts 4 \u00a3000   | Simon Roberts 4 \u00a3000   | Simon Roberts 4 \u00a3000   | Kevin O'Byrne  \u00a3000   | Kevin O'Byrne  \u00a3000   |\n|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                     | Notes                  | 2021/22                | 2020/21                | 2021/22               | 2020/21               |\n| Base salary         |                        | 875                    | 673                    | 657                   | 657                   |\n| Benefits            | 1                      | 24                     | 13                     | 23                    | 17                    |\n| Pension             |                        | 66                     | 50                     | 131                   | 148                   |\n| Total fixed pay     |                        | 965                    | 736                    | 811                   | 822                   |\n| Annual bonus        | 2                      | 1,675                  | 0                      | 1,029                 | 828                   |\n| LTIP/Future Builder | 3                      | 1,147                  | 589                    | 1,327                 | 682                   |\n| Total variable pay  |                        | 2,822                  | 589                    | 2,356                 | 1,510                 |\n| Total               |                        | 3,787                  | 1,325                  | 3,167                 | 2,332                 |\n\n- 1 Benefits include a combination of cash and non-cash benefits, valued at the taxable value. For all Executive Directors, this includes a cash car allowance (\u00a315,250) and private medical cover. In 2021/22, on a one-off basis in line with the approach taken for all colleagues in that year, both Simon Roberts and Kevin O'Byrne received a payment for two days of holiday which could not be taken in the previous year due to the demands of COVID-19.\n- 2 Annual bonus relates to performance during the financial year, paid in June following the relevant year-end. Normally 50% is paid in cash and 50% in bonus shares which vest after two years. Kevin O'Byrne volunteered to take the whole of his 2020/21 annual bonus in bonus shares which vest after two years to further align his interests with those of shareholders.\n- 3 The Long-Term Incentive Plan value relates to the Future Builder award vesting in April/May following the end of the relevant financial year, which is the third year of the performance period. The awards are then subject to an additional two-year retention period for Executive Directors. This two-year retention period will not apply to Simon Roberts' 2018 or 2019 award as he was an Operating Board Director at the time of grant. The figures include accrued dividend equivalent shares over the performance period. The 2020/21 LTIP figure has also been updated from the fourth quarter average share price to the actual share price on the vesting date of 29 April 2021 (\u00a32.354). The 2021/22 values are based on the average share price over the fourth quarter for 2021/22 of \u00a32.790. The values shown above reflect the share price growth since grant of: +\u00a3214k for Simon Roberts and +\u00a3247k for Kevin O'Byrne.\n- 4 Simon Roberts' total remuneration for 2020/21 was based on the period since his appointment as Chief Executive Officer on 1 June 2020. Simon waived his full-year bonus for 2020/21. The 2020/21 Future Builder value shown relates to an award granted in May 2018 in respect of Simon's previous role when he was an Operating Board Director. For transparency the full value of the award is shown. The 2021/22 Future Builder value shown relates to an award granted in May 2019 in respect of his previous role when he was an Operating Board Director.\n\n## Base salary (audited information)\n\n|               | Salary  effective from  7 March 2021   |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Simon Roberts | \u00a3875,000                               |\n| Kevin O'Byrne | \u00a3657,403                               |\n\n## Pension\n\nSince his appointment as Chief Executive Officer, in lieu of pension plan participation, Simon Roberts has received 7.5 per cent of salary, which is in line with the majority of the wider workforce. For 2021/22, Kevin O'Byrne received 20 per cent of salary in lieu of pension plan participation. As detailed elsewhere in this report, his pension will reduce during 2022/23 to align with the workforce.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFor 2021/22, benefits for Executive Directors included the provision of company car benefits, private medical cover, long-term disability insurance, life assurance and colleague discount.\n\n## Annual bonus for 2021/22 (audited information)\n\nFor 2021/22 the maximum annual bonus award opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer was 220 per cent of base salary and for the Chief Financial Officer the maximum opportunity was 180 per cent of base salary. Normally 50 per cent of any bonus is paid in cash and 50 per cent is paid in shares which are deferred for two years.\n\nThe performance measures for 2021/22 were profit (50 per cent), retail free cash flow (20 per cent) strategic scorecard (30 per cent comprising colleague, customer and individual each being 10 per cent).\n\nAfter the end of the financial year the Remuneration Committee undertook a review of performance to determine annual bonus outcomes for Simon Roberts and Kevin O'Byrne. As detailed below, the Committee identified that a bonus was payable to the Executive Directors. As in prior years the Remuneration Committee has sought to take a measured and rounded approach to performance assessment when determining incentive outcomes to ensure that they are fair and proportionate.\n\nFor 2021/22 the Committee identified that the COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in an unbudgeted net-positive impact on performance, primarily due to sustained higher food consumption in the home. The net benefit was estimated to be \u00a3100 million. After a detailed review the Committee determined to reduce the financial results to remove the positive impact. The following table summarises the final outcomes for the Executive Directors after this application of discretion.\n\n|                       | Outcome   (% of overall max)   | Simon Roberts \u00a3000   | Kevin O'Byrne \u00a3000   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Profit                | 40%                            | 770                  | 473                  |\n| Retail free cash flow | 20%                            | 385                  | 237                  |\n| Strategic scorecard   | 27%                            | 520                  | 319                  |\n| Total                 | 87%                            | 1,675                | 1,029                |\n\n## Profit performance\n\nThe table below sets out the threshold and stretch profit targets and the actual profit outcome after the adjustment explained in the Remuneration Committee Chair's letter.\n\n|          |   Threshold \u00a3m |   Stretch \u00a3m |   Adjusted  Outcome \u00a3m |\n|----------|----------------|--------------|------------------------|\n| Profit 1 |            550 |          650 |                    630 |",

Around 230 senior managers across the business participated in this arrangement. Awards are granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan approved by shareholders in 2016. A core award of shares is granted, calculated as a percentage of salary and scaled according to level of seniority. Vesting of the core award is dependent on performance against specific targets tested at the end of a three-year performance period. The core awards can grow up to four times at stretch levels of performance. For Executive Directors, any vested award is subject to a two-year retention period.\n\nThe 2019 Future Builder award was subject to ROCE, EPS, retail free cash flow and cost savings targets. In addition, a performance gateway had to be achieved before any element could vest. Consistent with the approach adopted for the 2018 Future Builder and as disclosed in last year's Directors' Remuneration Report, the ROCE and EPS targets have been re-stated on a like-for-like basis to reflect the adoption of the new accounting standard, IFRS 16. The Committee is comfortable that the re-stated target ranges are comparable to the original target ranges set on the basis of the previous accounting rules.\n\nAs outlined in the Remuneration Committee Chair's letter, a number of factors were considered when determining the vesting outturn. The Committee determined that it was appropriate to adjust the outturns downwards to reflect the estimated \u00a3100 million net-positive impact of COVID-19, in line with the approach taken for bonus. Without this downward adjustment, the vesting outturn would have been a multiplier of 3.3 out of 4.0 (82.5 per cent of maximum). As a result of this negative adjustment the ROCE and EPS outturns decrease, while the retail free cash flow and cost savings targets are met in full resulting in a performance multiplier of 2.8 out of 4.0 (70 per cent of the maximum). The Committee reviewed the outcome of the awards in the context of the Company's performance this year and determined that this was an appropriate outcome.\n\nThe table below sets out the extent to which each performance measure was achieved.\n\n|                                    | Weighting                                                                                    | Threshold  target (1.0x core  award)                                                         | Maximum  target (4.0x core  award)                                                           | Formulaic  outcome                                                                           | Adjusted  outcome   | Multiplier  achieved (out of a  maximum  4.0x)   |\n|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| ROCE 1                             | 25%                                                                                          | 6.75%                                                                                        | 9.75%                                                                                        | 8.4%                                                                                         | 7.6%                | 0.5x                                             |\n| Underlying basic EPS 1             | 25%                                                                                          | 21.5p                                                                                        | 28.5p                                                                                        | 25.4p                                                                                        | 21.9p               | 0.3x                                             |\n| Cumulative retail free cash flow 1 | 25%                                                                                          | \u00a3900m                                                                                        | \u00a31,400m                                                                                      | \u00a31,759m                                                                                      | \u00a31,659m             | 1.0x                                             |\n| Cumulative strategic cost savings  | 25%                                                                                          | \u00a3600m                                                                                        | \u00a3750m                                                                                        | \u00a31,188m                                                                                      | \u00a31,188m             | 1.0x                                             |\n| Performance gateway                | The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied  that the Company's underlying performance over | The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied  that the Company's underlying performance over | The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied  that the Company's underlying performance over | The Remuneration Committee must be satisfied  that the Company's underlying performance over | Achieved            | Achieved                                         |\n\nTotal\n\n2.8x out of a maximum of 4.0x\n\n- 1 These measures are defined in the Alternative Performance Measures section of the Annual Report on pages 203 to 207.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholding guidelines (audited information)\n\nThe Executive Directors are required to build up a specified level of shareholding in the Company. This is to create greater alignment of the Directors' interests with those of shareholders, in line with the objectives of the Remuneration Policy.\n\nThe guidelines in the 2020 Directors' Remuneration Policy require the Chief Executive Officer to have a holding of three times salary and other Executive Directors to hold shares with a value of two times salary.\n\nExecutive Directors are required to hold all vested share awards (net of tax) until the guideline has been met. In addition to shares held, Bonus Share Awards (and previously granted Deferred Share Award) and LTIP awards where the performance period has ended count towards the guideline (on a net of tax basis).\n\nSimon Roberts currently holds 1.4x salary following his appointment as Chief Executive Officer in 2020. Kevin O'Byrne was appointed to the Board in January 2017 and has now met the shareholding requirement.\n\nPost-departure, Executive Directors will be expected to maintain a shareholding equal to their guideline (or actual shareholding if lower) for two years post-employment irrespective of the reason for leaving. This requirement will apply to shares acquired from Company incentive plans.\n\n## Remuneration in 2022/23\n\n## Base salary\n\nWhen considering salaries the Committee takes account of a number of factors, with particular focus on the general level of salary increases awarded throughout the Company. Where relevant, the Committee also considers external market data on salary and total remuneration but the Committee applies judgement when considering such data.\n\nFor 2022/23 Simon Roberts and Kevin O'Byrne will receive a 3.5 per cent salary increase. This is below the at least 5.3 per cent award to retail hourly-paid colleagues and in line with senior management. The pay review date for all management colleagues, including Executive Directors, has changed from the start of the financial year to 29 May 2022 to align pay review and bonus timings.\n\n|               | Salary  effective from  29 May 2022   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Simon Roberts | \u00a3905,625                              |\n| Kevin O'Byrne | \u00a3680,412                              |\n\n## Pension\n\nUnder the 2020 Remuneration Policy, the pension supplement for any future appointments is capped at 7.5 per cent of salary, in line with the opportunity offered to the majority of the workforce. This is the rate that Simon Roberts receives as Chief Executive Officer.\n\nAs disclosed previously, on appointment Kevin O'Byrne received a contractual cash supplement of 25 per cent of salary, in line with the policy in place at the time. In recognition of the new policy, Kevin has agreed to a reduction in his pension supplement over a period of time to the rate offered to the majority of the workforce (7.5 per cent of salary). From March 2022 Kevin's supplement reduced to 17.5 per cent until the end of the calendar year, when it will reduce further to 7.5 per cent.\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits for Executive Directors in 2022/23 are unchanged and will include the provision of company car benefits, private medical cover, long-term disability insurance, life assurance and colleague discount.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe annual bonus for 2022/23 will operate on the same basis as 2021/22. It will be based 50 per cent on profit, 20 per cent on retail free cash flow and 30 per cent on strategic objectives (equally weighted between customer, colleague and individual objectives).\n\nThe maximum annual bonus award opportunity for the Chief Executive Officer is 220 per cent of base salary and for the Chief Financial Officer is 180 per cent of base salary. 50 per cent will be paid in cash and 50 per cent in shares deferred for two years.\n\nThe profit and retail free cash flow targets are set against the Company's expected performance and are subject to a rigorous process of challenge before the proposals are considered by the Board. The targets are set such that considerably stretching performance in excess of internal and external forecasts is required for maximum payout. The strategic objectives ensure that management continues to focus on operational priorities which contribute to the achievement of Group performance over the short and long term.\n\nThe Board is of the opinion that any performance targets for the current year annual bonus are commercially sensitive as the Company operates in a highly competitive, consumer-facing sector. The disclosure of targets would provide competitors with insights into the Company's strategic aims, budgeting and growth projections. However, in line with previous years, the Company will retrospectively disclose the targets in next year's Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## 2022 Leaders' Share Award\n\nLast year's Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was known as the 2021 Win in Food incentive plan which was aligned to our new strategy and it included all eight key metrics that we use as a measure of our success in delivering against our updated strategy. As a one-off, we enhanced core award levels and increased participation in the plan, extending eligibility to a further 1,200 senior leaders.\n\nFor 2022, we will retain the same plan structure and metrics and going forward it will be known as the Leaders' Share Award. In 2022, circa 230 colleagues will participate in the plan. For Executive Directors 80 per cent of the plan will be based on the four key financial measures (retail free cash flow, ROCE, EPS and cost savings). The remaining 20 per cent of the plan will be subject to key strategic indicators (market share, customer, colleague and Plan for Better).\n\nThe award level for the Chief Executive Officer will be unchanged for 2022. Simon Roberts will receive a core award of 62.5 per cent of salary (maximum 250 per cent of salary). As disclosed last year, Kevin O'Byrne's core award level was increased in 2021 to 62.5 per cent of salary and for 2022 will change to 56.25 per cent of salary (maximum 225 per cent of salary).\n\nThe Leaders' Share Award is subject to a two-year retention period following the end of the three-year performance period. This will result in awards to Executive Directors being released after a five-year period.\n\nThe Committee has set stretching targets against these measures for the 2022 awards as shown below. The cumulative retail free cash flow target for 2022 has been increased compared to 2021.\n\n|                                    | Weighting           | Threshold  25% of element vests                                                                                                                                                            | Maximum 100% of element vests                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cumulative retail free cash flow 1 | 20%                 | \u00a31,250m                                                                                                                                                                                    | \u00a31,650m                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ROCE 1                             | 20%                 | 6.75%                                                                                                                                                                                      | 9.75%                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Underlying basic EPS 1             | 20%                 | 19.8p                                                                                                                                                                                      | 26.5p                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Cost reduction 2                   | 20%                 | 80bps improvement                                                                                                                                                                          | 280bps improvement                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Strategic indicators               | 20%                 | - Market share  - targets are commercially sensitive but we intend to provide full disclosure  of targets at the end of the performance period                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                                    | (equally  weighted) | - Customer satisfaction  - improvement of 0 to 200 bps in Sainsbury's score and 300 to 500  bps in Argos score                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|                                    |                     | - Colleague  - progress against our existing 2024 representation targets (see below)  and assessment of further representation improvements in 2025.

When making this judgement the Committee has scope to consider such factors as it\n\ndeems relevant. The Committee believes that this discretion is an important feature of the Long-Term Incentive Plan arrangement and mitigates the risk of unwarranted vesting outcomes. This performance gateway assessment applies to all outstanding LTIP awards.\n\n| Colleague representation targets                                                         | Target - senior leadership positions   (top 230 leaders)   |            | Target - senior management positions   (1,200 leaders beneath senior leadership)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Female                                                                                   | 50%                                                        |            | 43%                                                                                |\n| Ethnically diverse                                                                       | 12%                                                        |            | 12%                                                                                |\n| Black                                                                                    | 3%                                                         |            | 3%                                                                                 |\n| Plan for Better                                                                          | Baseline                                                   | Threshold  | Stretch                                                                            |\n| Scope 1 - GHG emissions                                                                  | 554,936 (tC02e) 18/19 FY                                   | 382,403    | 345,258                                                                            |\n| Scope 3 - GHG emissions                                                                  | 26,663,081 (tC02e) 18/19 FY                                | 23,783,081 | 23,108,004                                                                         |\n| Plastic - Own Brand Food & General Merchandise & Clothing  - tonnes of plastic packaging | 69,839 Own Brand Food 2018 CY/ GM&C 2020 CY                | 55,871     | 41,903                                                                             |",

It includes payments of lease obligations, cash flows from joint ventures and associates and Sainsbury's Bank capital injections. It is measured on a cumulative basis over the three-year performance period\n\n## Return on capital employed (ROCE)\n\n- - ROCE reflects the returns generated for shareholders and measures the efficiency of capital use\n- - It is defined as return divided by average capital employed where:\n- - Return is defined as 52-week underlying profit before interest and tax\n- - Capital employed is defined as Group net assets excluding the pension deficit/surplus, less net debt (excluding the perpetual securities). The average is calculated on a 14-point basis\n- - More information can be found in the Alternative Performance Measures section of the Annual Report on pages 203 to 207\n\n## EPS\n\n- - EPS directly reflects returns generated for shareholders\n- - Underlying basic EPS is underlying profit after tax attributable to the equity holders of the parent, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year\n\n## Cost reduction\n\n- - Cost reduction will be measured as an improvement in Retail selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs as a percentage of retail sales (including VAT, excluding fuel). Costs also exclude fuel, bonus and share-based payments expenses, non-underlying items and Group support functions. Given the abnormal nature of 2020/21 and 2021/22, improvement will be assessed against 2019/20 results\n\n## Market share\n\n- - Sainsbury's market share (volume) based on Nielsen panel data\n\n## Customer\n\n- - Based on an annual weighted average of Sainsbury's CSAT and Argos CSAT (excluding Bank and Tu )\n\n## Colleague\n\n- - Internally we measure representation at senior and middle management grades for gender, ethnically diverse and Black colleagues.

All three of these colleagues are store-based hourly-paid colleagues, with the 50th percentile and the 75th percentile colleague earning additional premiums such as unsociable hours premium and driver premium.\n\nThe year-on-year increase in the ratio for 2021/22 reflects that the Chief Executive Officer's single figure for 2020/21 was suppressed following his decision to waive his annual bonus. In addition, the figures include exceptional payments made during the year, including in 2020/21 hourly-paid colleagues received three Thank You payments relating to COVID-19.\n\n| Financial year   | Method   | 25th percentile pay ratio  (lower quartile)   | 50th percentile pay ratio (median)   | 75th percentile pay ratio (upper quartile)   |\n|------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| 2019/20          | Option B | 173:1                                         | 173:1                                | 153:1                                        |\n| 2020/21 2        | Option B | 122:1                                         | 122:1                                | 107:1                                        |\n| 2021/22          | Option B | 202:1                                         | 183:1                                | 178:1                                        |\n\n- 1 Option B as defined in the regulations.\n\nThe colleagues used to calculate the pay ratios were identified using our 2021 gender pay gap data. In line with the regulations, our 2021 gender pay gap data identifies employees using a snapshot date of 5 April 2021. This method has been chosen as it makes use of our gender pay data which provided a readily available and robust dataset.\n\nA full-time equivalent total pay figure was calculated for each of these colleagues using the single figure methodology. The approach includes base\n\nsalaries, pension contributions and any relevant pay premiums. To ensure these three colleagues were a suitable representative of their quartile, the total pay figures calculated were compared against a sample of colleagues either side of the three identified colleagues.\n\nThe following table provides base salary and total remuneration information in respect of the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile colleagues, on a full-time equivalent basis.\n\n| Financial year   | Remuneration       | Chief Executive 1   | 25th percentile pay ratio  (lower quartile)   | 50th percentile pay ratio (median)   | 75th percentile pay ratio (upper quartile)   |\n|------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| 2021/22          | Base salary        | \u00a3875,000            | \u00a318,155                                       | \u00a319,588                              | \u00a320,703                                      |\n|                  | Total remuneration | \u00a33,787,000          | \u00a318,780                                       | \u00a320,680                              | \u00a321,306                                      |\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers pay ratios as one of many reference points when reviewing executive remuneration and considers that the median pay ratio for 2021/22 is consistent with the pay, reward and progression policies for the Company. Due to the nature of the role of the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee believes that it is important for a significant portion of the Chief Executive Officer's remuneration package\n\nto be performance-related and aligned to the long-term, sustainable success of the Company. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer's single figure fluctuates each year depending on the Company's performance and the outturns of the incentive plans and this will impact the pay ratio reported in any single year.\n\n## Percentage change in Executive and Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nThe table below shows the percentage change in the salary, benefits and bonus of Executive and Non-Executive Directors between (i) 2019/20 and 2020/21 and (ii) 2020/21 and 2021/22 compared with the percentage change in the average of each of those components of pay for all our colleagues.\n\n|                      | Percentage change in remuneration  from 2019/20 -

These comparisons will be materially impacted by the grade mix of colleagues. While the 2020/21 to 2021/22 salary change shows a decrease, hourly paid colleagues received an increase of 2.2 per cent in March 2021 and there was no annual pay review for management. In both comparison years, the benefits change figure shows a decrease but there was no change to the benefits offered. Note, any one-off payments made have been excluded from these figures.\n- 4 Non-Executive Directors receive no benefits other than a colleague discount card and reasonable business travel expenses. The percentage change figures are in respect of the Non-Executive Directors' taxable business travel expenses only. The significant reductions reported for 2020/21 reflect the reduction in business travel during the year.",

All members of the Committee are independent Non-Executive Directors.\n\nTim Fallowfield, Company Secretary, acts as secretary to the Committee. Martin Scicluna, Simon Roberts, Angie Risley (Group HR Director), the Director of Reward and the Director of Group Finance are invited to attend Committee meetings either fully or partially. The Committee considers their views when reviewing the remuneration of the Executive Directors and Operating Board Directors. Individuals who attend Remuneration Committee meetings are not present when their own remuneration is being determined.\n\nThe Committee typically meets four times each year, or more often as required. The Committee has a calendar of standard items within its remit and in addition it held in-depth discussions on specific topics during the year. In 2021/22 there were a number of unscheduled meetings regarding changes to the Operating Board as well as discussions on performance outturns for annual bonus and the Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Committee complies with relevant regulations and considers the Code and best practice when determining pay and policy.\n\n## Advisers to the Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers if it considers this beneficial. Over the course of the year, the Committee was supported by its appointed advisers, Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). Deloitte were reappointed by the Committee as advisers in 2013 following a competitive tender.\n\nDeloitte are members of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operate under the Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. During the year, the Committee reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte and has confirmed that it has been objective and independent. The Committee has also determined that the Deloitte partner who provides remuneration advice to the Committee does not have any connections with the Company that may impact their independence. The Committee has reviewed the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.\n\nDuring the year they provided advice to the Committee on a range of topics including remuneration trends, corporate governance, incentive plan design and incentive plan rules. Their consultants attended all of the Committee meetings. In relation to their advice, Deloitte received fees of circa \u00a365,000 (fees are based on hours spent). During the year, Deloitte provided the Company with unrelated advice and consultancy in respect of information technology, operating models, data analytics and taxation.\n\n## Statement of voting at general meeting\n\nThe table below sets out the votes on the Annual Report on Remuneration at the 2021 AGM and on the Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2020 AGM. The Committee is keen to hear the views of all shareholders and continually reviews the Remuneration Policy and its implementation.\n\n|                                 | Votes for            | Votes against       | Votes abstained   |\n|---------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Remuneration Report (2021 vote) | 80.61% 1,452 million | 19.39%  349 million | - 0.7 million     |\n| Remuneration Policy (2020 vote) | 97.00% 1,636 million | 3.00% 51 million    | - 6.0 million     |\n\n## Directors' contracts\n\nExecutive Directors have rolling contracts which are terminable on 12 months' notice by either party. Non-Executive Directors are appointed for an initial three-year period, which may be extended for a further term by mutual consent. The initial appointments and any subsequent reappointments are subject to annual election or re-election by shareholders. Non-Executive Directors' appointments may be terminated at any time by giving three months' written notice by either party; six months' in the case of the Non-Executive Chairman.",

We have measured our emissions since 2005 and set challenging targets throughout the years. In 2021, we announced our new 'Plan for Better' strategy. As part of this, we accelerated our target to become Net Zero across our own operations by 2035, aligning the business with the goal to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, the highest ambition of the Paris Agreement. For Scope 3, our target is the reduction of absolute GHG emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, to align to a well below 2\u00b0C scenario. We're also working with suppliers to set their own ambitious Net Zero commitments.\n\n## Methodology\n\nIn line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition), we will be reflecting the performance of Sainsbury's, and Argos and Habitat emissions separately, as well as the combined Group performance. We have reported on all of the emission sources required under the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors' Reports) Regulations 2013. We have calculated and reported our emissions in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition) and emission factors from UK Government's GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 2021, and IEA 2020 for those overseas. The reporting period is the financial year 2021/22, the same as that covered by the Annual Report and Financial Statements. The boundaries of the GHG inventory are defined using the operational control approach. In general, the emissions reported are the same as those which would be reported based on a financial control boundary. Emissions for previous years are retrospectively adjusted as and when more accurate data is provided.\n\nThe following report compares Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions for 2021/22 and 2020/21.\n\n## UK and global annual energy and carbon\n\nSainsbury's Group total carbon figures and intensities\n\n| GHG emissions (tCO2e) - location-based Emission source   | 2020/21    | 2021/22    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Scope 1                                                  | 527,311.76 | 516,239.46 |\n| Scope 2                                                  | 327,876.81 | 274,637.32 |\n| Total (tCO2e)                                            | 855,188.57 | 790,876.78 |\n| Intensity measurement (tCO2e/'000 sq ft)                 | 35.06      | 32.45      |\n| GHG emissions (tCO2e) - market-based Emission source     | 2020/21    | 2021/22    |\n| Scope 1                                                  | 527,311.76 | 516,239.46 |\n| Scope 2                                                  | 290,108.15 | 245,879.55 |\n| Total (tCO2e)                                            | 817,419.91 | 762,119.02 |\n| Intensity measurement (tCO2e/'000 sq ft)                 | 33.51      | 31.27      |",

The remaining electricity has been reported at supplier-specific emissions rate, and non-UK electricity has been reported at local grid average, unless supplied by a certified green tariff. From 1 January 2022, Sainsbury's will source 100 per cent renewable electricity.\n\n## Energy efficiency actions\n\nTo grow our business sustainably, we are continuously working to cut greenhouse gas emissions, ensuring that we maximise energy efficiency. A few of the projects we have implemented this year include:\n\n- - LED lighting upgrades at 226 stores equating to approximately 23,626,922 kWh annual savings. This has fulfilled the commitment to be fully LED across 100% of our supermarkets by the end of 2021, with the remainder of the estate complete by the end of 2022\n- - Ensuring the existing solar estate is monitored in detail and the operation of this is optimised through timely replacement of components\n- - The replacement of refrigeration systems with more efficient technology, whilst also removing HFC refrigerant gases\n- - The use of an innovative single system to provide store refrigeration, cooling, and heating requirements. This reduces energy consumption in a store by up to 30 per cent whilst maintaining a high-quality environment, which is warm in winter and cool in summer, by reusing any 'heating' or 'cooling' throughout the year. We call it 'RIHC', Refrigeration Integrated Heating and Cooling\n- - Delivering Net Zero new stores through the installation of highly efficient Zero Carbon technology\n- - Exploring how uncontrolled air infiltration in stores can be reduced to improve thermal comfort and reduce heating and refrigeration energy consumption\n- - Testing out the latest water saving technology in toilets and ensuring water saving taps are fully rolled out to all stores\n- - Optimising the existing biomass boiler fleet, introducing thermal stores, reducing boiler down-time, and increasing fuel consumption efficiency\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n## Tim Fallowfield OBE\n\nCompany Secretary and Corporate Services Director 27 April 2022",

        "page_content": "## Statement of Directors' responsibilities\n\nThe Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company as at the end of the financial year, and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. The Directors have elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (UK Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- - select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\n- - make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- - state whether UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group and Company financial statements respectively; and\n- - prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Company will continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group's and the Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors' Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. Having taken all the matters considered by the Board and brought to the attention of the Board during the year into account, we are satisfied that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\nThe Board believes that the disclosures set out in this Annual Report provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company's website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nEach of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 54 to 57, confirms that, to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- - the financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the Group and Company; and\n- - the Strategic Report and Directors' Report contained in the Annual Report and Financial Statements include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group, together with a description of the emerging and principal risks and uncertainties that it faces; and\n- - the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n## Tim Fallowfield OBE\n\nCompany Secretary and Corporate Services Director 27 April 2022",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the Group or the parent company and we remain independent of the Group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- - Confirming our understanding of the directors' going concern assessment process.\n- - Assessing the adequacy of the going concern assessment to 27 April 2023 and considering the existence of any significant events or conditions beyond this period.\n- - Verifying inputs against board-approved forecasts and debt facility terms.\n- - Reviewing borrowing facility documentation to confirm availability to the Group through the going concern period, noting no associated financial covenants.\n- - Assessing management's forecasting process and the consistency of the assessment with information obtained from other areas of the audit, such as accounting estimates.\n- - Testing the assessment, including forecast liquidity under base and downside scenarios, for clerical accuracy.\n- - Assessing whether assumptions made (such as future costs including the impact of inflation and forecast margin) were reasonable with reference to information obtained elsewhere in the audit and, in the case of downside scenarios, appropriately severe in light of the Group's relevant principal risks and uncertainties.\n- - Challenging the amount and timing of identified mitigating actions available to respond to a 'severe but plausible' downside scenario, and whether those actions are feasible and within the Group's control.\n- - Performing independent sensitivity analyses on assumptions to assess the impact on headroom.\n- - Performing reverse stress testing in order to identify and understand which factors and how severe the downside scenarios would have to be to result in the Group utilising all liquidity during the going concern period.\n- - Assessing the appropriateness of going concern disclosures.\n\n## Our key observations\n\nIn management's base case and downside scenarios, there is significant headroom without taking the benefit of any identified mitigations.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for the period to 27 April 2023.\n\nIn relation to the Group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.",

        "page_content": "## Overview of our audit approach\n\n## Audit scope\n\n- - We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 14 components. We performed audit procedures on specific balances for 55 components.\n- - The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 100% of Profit before tax, 100% of Revenue and 100% of Total assets.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\n- - Supplier arrangements\n- - Aspects of revenue recognition\n- - Measurement of provision for impairment of loans and advances to financial services customers\n- - Valuation of defined benefit pension scheme\n- - Aspects of property provisions\n- - IT environment\n\n## Materiality\n\n- - Group materiality of \u00a338 million which represents 4.6% of Profit before tax, adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\n## An overview of the scope of the parent company and group audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each component within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 116 reporting components of the Group, we selected 69 components covering entities within the UK and the Isle of Man, which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nOf the 69 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 14 components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 55 components ('specific scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.\n\nThe table below shows the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams. Scoping changes from the prior year are not significant.\n\n|                                   |        | % Group Profit   before tax   | % Group Profit   before tax   | % Group   Revenue   | % Group   Revenue   | % Total   assets              | % Total   assets   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                   | Number | 2021/22                       | 2020/21                       | 2021/22             | 2020/21             | 2021/22                       | 2020/21            |\n| Full scope                        | 14     | 62%                           | 52%                           | 99%                 | 99%                 | 77%                           | 84%                |\n| Specific scope                    | 55     | 38%                           | 48%                           | 1%                  | 1%                  | 23%                           | 16%                |\n| Full and specific  scope coverage | 69     |                               |                               |                     |                     | 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% |                    |\n| Remaining  components             | 47     | 0%                            | 0%                            | 0%                  | 0%                  | 0%                            | 0%                 |\n| Total reporting  components       | 116    |                               |                               |                     |                     | 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% 100% |                    |\n\nFor components not in scope for full or specified audit procedures, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, testing of consolidation journals and intercompany eliminations to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, or by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction. Of the 14 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 12 of these directly by the primary audit team and on 2 by EY component audit teams in Edinburgh and Luton. For the 55 specific scope components, work was performed by the primary audit team on 43 components and on 12 by EY component audit teams in Edinburgh, Luton and Isle of Man. For the full and specific scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nDuring the current year's audit cycle, the Senior Statutory Auditor performed virtual visits to Edinburgh and Luton to hold discussions with the component teams. The virtual visits used video technology and our global audit software to meet with component teams to discuss and direct their audit approach, meeting with members of local management, attending planning and closing meetings, reviewing relevant working papers including in response to the risk areas for which component teams perform procedures, including supplier arrangements, aspects of revenue recognition and the measurement of the provision for impairment of loans and advances to customers. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed relevant working papers, retaining those that were considered key, and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact J Sainsbury plc. The Group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from extreme weather events, such as flooding or droughts and from the move towards a low-carbon future which may impact the business, as a result of changing consumer preferences and climate-related regulations. These are explained on pages 17 to 23 in the required Task Force for Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and on page 50 in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nAs explained in the consolidated financial statements, policy, technology and market changes in response to climate change are still developing, and these are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted International accounting standards. In Notes 14, 17, 25 and 37 to the financial statements, narrative explanations of the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions have been provided and significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change have been described in Note 4.\n\nOur audit effort in considering the impact of climate-related risks on the financial statements was focused on assessing the Company's conclusion that the current known impacts of the Group's climate related plans and pledges have been reflected in the valuation of assets and liabilities, the useful economic lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and the cashflow forecast used in the assessment of impairment of non-financial assets, assessment of the going concern basis and viability statement.\n\nThe Group has stated its commitment to the aspirations of the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by 2035. Within the 'Other information', the Group discloses its 'Plan for Better'; the strategy which sets out how they are working to transition to a lower carbon future and become a net-zero business by 2035. The Group has disclosed that this is an evolving area and the work undertaken by the Group will inform their response to the risks and opportunities identified. This currently reflects the known impacts of climate change and will continue to be reflected in their financial models and plans to reflect the future economic impact on their business model, operational",

        "page_content": "plans and customers. Therefore, as set out above, the potential impacts of future plans are not fully incorporated in these financial statements.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Supplier arrangements\n\nRefer to the Accounting policy and Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 126)\n\nThe Group, through its Retail divisions, receives material discounts and incentives, fixed amounts (including promotions and utilisation of specific space), volume-based rebates and marketing and advertising income from suppliers, collectively referred to as supplier arrangements. The terms of agreements with suppliers can be complex and varied. In addition, there can be performance conditions or promotional periods that span the Group's reporting date.\n\nAmounts recognised as deductions to Cost of sales for the period ended 5 March 2022 were \u00a3381 million (2020/2021: \u00a3360 million), with related balance sheet entries recognised in inventory, current trade receivables and current trade payables.\n\nAccounting for rebate arrangements with suppliers requires judgement and estimation in determining the extent to which deal terms have been met, especially those spanning the Group's reporting date, impacting cut-off. High deal volumes are recorded just prior to the Group's reporting date which raises the risk that fixed amounts may be misstated. High levels of manual intervention within the marketing and advertising and discounts and incentives categories raise the risk of an error occurring in the calculation of income, either accidentally or purposefully through management override of controls.\n\nThe risk has remained the same in the current year as the complexity around the arrangements is similar year on year.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nWe performed procedures over supplier arrangements at both the Sainsbury's Supermarkets Limited and Argos Limited components.\n\n- - We walked through and assessed the design effectiveness of the controls in place within the supplier arrangements process.\n- - We selected a sample of suppliers across the categories of supplier arrangements, to whom we sent confirmations across certain 'deal' types to confirm key deal input terms. Where we did not receive a response from the supplier, we performed alternative procedures, including obtaining evidence of initiation (such as supplier invoices) and if settled, settlement of the arrangement.\n- - We tested the existence and valuation of balance sheet amounts recognised in accounts receivable or as a contra-asset in accounts payable by reviewing post-period end settlement. We also performed a 'look-back' analysis of prior period balance sheet amounts to check that these amounts were appropriately recovered.\n- - We tested the settlement of a sample of supplier arrangements recognised in the income statement, which included settlement in cash or by off-set to accounts payable.\n- - Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the appropriateness of journal entries and other adjustments, meeting a pre-defined criteria, to corroborating evidence such as third party invoices.\n- - We tested cut-off for deals recorded pre and post period end by obtaining the supplier agreement to validate that the deal was recorded in the correct period.\n- - We assessed the adequacy of the financial statements disclosures in respect of supplier arrangements and their compliance with accounting standards including the completeness and accuracy of amounts disclosed.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nSupplier arrangement amounts are appropriately recognised in the income statement and balance sheet and the disclosures in the financial statements are appropriate.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Aspects of revenue recognition\n\nRefer to the Accounting policy and Note 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 121)\n\nThere are a number of areas within revenue which require management to exercise accounting judgement in recording manual adjustments where the recognition of revenue does not directly correspond to cash receipts. Such adjustments primarily include commission-based arrangements, deferral of revenue relating to Nectar points and accounting for coupons and vouchers.\n\nThere is a risk that these adjustments are not complete and accurate for the period ended 5 March 2022 and that accounting judgements taken are inappropriate, particularly in respect of deferral of revenue. The opportunity exists through management override of controls, such as the posting of manual journals, to misstate revenue in the period.\n\nRevenue recognised, including the effects of manual adjustments, for the period ended 5 March 2022 totalled \u00a329,895 million (2020/2021: \u00a329,048 million).\n\nThe risk has remained the same in the current year as there continues to be a focus on business performance.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nWe performed procedures over adjustments to revenue at the Sainsbury's Supermarkets Limited, Nectar 360 Limited and Argos Limited components.\n\n- - We gained an understanding of and documented the key processes used to record revenue transactions by performing walkthroughs and assessing the design effectiveness of key controls.\n- - We tested the appropriateness of the Group's revenue recognition policy by comparing to the criteria set out in IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers .\n- - We performed journal analysis to identify manual sales journals that did not result in cash receipts (including coupons and vouchers), obtaining supporting evidence of collection and settlement to verify revenue was recognised correctly.\n- - In relation to the calculation of deferred revenue for Nectar points, we examined and critically assessed input data which included:\n- - Obtaining details of points balances earned and redeemed for the period ended 5 March 2022 and agreeing a sample of points in issue to Nectar partner confirmations;\n- - Challenging and analysing management's accounting judgements in respect of breakage (the proportion of points which are unlikely to ever be redeemed); and\n- - Recalculating the fair value per point, applied to the number of points in circulation to determine the amount of deferred revenue to recognise at 5 March 2022.\n- - Using data extracted from the accounting system, we tested the appropriateness of manual journal entries, meeting pre-defined criteria and impacting revenue, as well as other adjustments (consolidation journals) made in the preparation of the financial statements. We considered the validity of unusual journals such as those posted outside of expected hours, or by unexpected individuals and for large or unusual amounts.\n- - We completed detailed analytical reviews to understand if there had been significant or unusual activity in the period, including assessing changes in the number of and nature of manual adjustments to verify completeness.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nRevenue has been correctly recognised in accordance with IFRS 15. The manual adjustments to revenue in the current year primarily related to commission and deferred revenue for Nectar. We did not identify any exceptions in our testing of these manual entries.",

The key judgements and estimates in respect of the timing and measurement of ECL include:\n\n- a)  Completeness and accuracy of data;\n- b)   The accounting interpretations and modelling assumptions used to build the models that calculate ECL;\n- c) Inputs and assumptions used to estimate the impact of multiple economic scenarios;\n- d)   Allocation of assets to stage 1, 2 or 3 using criteria in accordance with the accounting standard;\n- e)  Completeness and valuation of post model adjustments; and\n- f) Accuracy and adequacy of the financial statement disclosures.\n\nWe consider the risk related to the ECL provisions continues to be heightened as a result of ongoing economic uncertainty from COVID-19 and the uncertain effects of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nWe performed procedures over ECL for Sainsbury's Bank plc and Argos Financial Services entities.\n\n- - We assessed the design effectiveness of key controls and tested these across the processes relevant to the impairment provision calculation, involving EY specialists to assist us in performing our procedures where appropriate.\n- - We reviewed the minutes of the Model and Risk Committees where inputs, assumptions and adjustments to the ECL were discussed and approved.\n- - We verified the data used in the ECL calculation on a sample basis and considered the assumptions, inputs and formulas used across the entire population of ECL models. We assessed the model design and considered alternative modelling techniques, recalculating the Probability of Default, Loss Given Default and Exposure at Default for a sample of the models.\n- - We tested the assumptions and inputs as stated above with the assistance of EY modelling and economic specialists. We assessed management's base and alternative economic scenarios, including challenging probability weights and comparing to other scenarios from a variety of external sources, as well as EY internally developed forecasts.\n- - Benchmarking analysis was performed against the Bank's peers for forecasted macroeconomic variables used within the models, such as GDP and unemployment.\n- - We assessed the criteria used to allocate an asset to stage 1, 2 and 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial instruments to verify they were allocated to the appropriate stage and reperformed this allocation in full.\n- - We challenged post model adjustments for appropriateness using our knowledge and experience across the industry, performing testing over material adjustments together with EY credit modelling specialists. We assessed the appropriateness of the scenarios and calculations used in determining the adjustment to be applied in response to the economic uncertainty due to COVID-19 and the invasion of Ukraine.\n- - We assessed the adequacy and appropriateness of disclosures for compliance with accounting standards.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe are satisfied that provisions for the impairment of loans and advances to customers were reasonable and recognised in accordance with the applicable reporting framework based on our procedures performed.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (page 76); Accounting policies (page 178); and Note 37 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 178)\n\nRetirement benefit surplus (2021/2022: \u00a32,283 million; 2020/2021: \u00a3744 million\n\nPresent value of funded obligations (2021/2022: \u00a39,410 million; 2020/2021: \u00a310,256 million)\n\nFair value of plan assets (2021/2022: \u00a311,693 million; 2020/2021: \u00a311,000 million)\n\nThe valuation of the liabilities of the pension scheme is subject to the following significant assumptions which are determined by an external firm of pension actuaries:\n\n- a)  Discount rate;\n- b)  Inflation;\n- c) Future pension increases; and\n- d)  Mortality.\n\nGiven the quantum of the defined benefit pension obligation, a movement in the actuarial assumptions could result in a material difference in its value.\n\nIn addition, the unquoted asset pools (2021/2022: \u00a33,900 million; 2020/2021: \u00a33,126 million) of the defined benefit pension scheme contain an element of Level 3 illiquid investments. Certain of these assets are harder to value, which increases the risk of incorrect valuation.\n\nThe risks associated with the pension scheme remain elevated as a result of the economic environment, which has led to greater volatility in the liability assumptions and additional uncertainty over the valuation of pension assets, which drives the surplus calculation.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nOur audit procedures covered the Sainsbury's Pension Scheme which has two sections: the Sainsbury's Section and the Argos Section.\n\n- - We gained an understanding of and documented the process used to record pension balances by performing a walkthrough and assessing the design effectiveness of key controls.\n- - With the support of EY pension actuaries we considered the appropriateness of the key assumptions supporting the valuation of the scheme liabilities, being the discount rate, inflation, future pension increases and mortality. We developed an independent range of reasonable assumptions upon which to assess those used by the Group and its external actuarial experts.\n- - We assessed the impact on pension liabilities of changes in financial, demographic and mortality assumptions and whether these were in line with our expectations. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of member data on which these assumptions are based.\n- - With respect to certain unquoted pension assets we obtained independent confirmations of all assets held. In conjunction with EY valuation specialists we independently valued a sample of assets and compared these to management's valuations, critically assessing management's valuation methodology.\n- - Where valuation adjustments had been made by management for changes in relevant market indices and to reflect cash received or paid between the dates of the net asset value statements fund managers' original valuations and the end of the Group's accounting period, we, in conjunction with EY valuation specialists, tested that the relevant assumptions used were appropriate.\n- - We evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity of management's external actuaries involved in the determination of the actuarial assumptions.\n- - We assessed the adequacy of the financial statements disclosures in respect of the defined benefit pension schemes and their compliance with accounting standards including the appropriateness of the key assumptions and sensitivities disclosed.",

        "page_content": "## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nThe assumptions used to value the defined benefit obligation are within an acceptable range. Our testing of the valuation of the pension assets, including certain harder to value assets, has not identified any misstatements.\n\n## Risk\n\n## Aspects of property provisions - treatment of business rates within an onerous contract\n\nRefer to the Audit Committee Report (page 76); Accounting policy and Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements (page 113)\n\nProperty provisions of \u00a3140 million (2021/2022: \u00a3164 million restated) include provisions for onerous contracts which are recognised where expected cash outflows exceed the anticipated future benefits. The amounts provided are based on the Group's best estimates of the likely committed outflows and site closure dates. These provisions do not include rent in accordance with IFRS 16, however do include unavoidable costs related to the lease such as service charges and also include provisions for dilapidations which are recognised where the Group has the obligation to make-good its leased properties. These provisions historically included business rates. There is apparent mixed practice across companies concerning the treatment of business rates in onerous contract provisions. However, following additional guidance published this year by accounting firms including EY, the Group has reassessed its policy in this area, and concluded that business rates relating to vacant property are a statutory obligation rather than a contractual one, and should be recognised as a periodic cost in line with IFRIC 21 'Levies'. Prior period comparatives have therefore been restated to remove business rates from previously recognised property provisions (property provisions at 6 March 2021 reduced by \u00a3121 million).\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nWe performed procedures over the treatment of business rates within onerous contracts at both the Argos Limited and Sainsbury's Supermarkets Limited components.\n\n- - We obtained a copy of and critically analysed management's technical accounting paper and legal advice which initially proposed no change to the historic accounting treatment.\n- - We compared the Group's historic accounting policy to sector peers, and identified apparent mixed accounting practice.\n- - Given apparent mixed accounting practice, and following recent additional guidance published this year by accounting firms, the audit engagement team discussed the issue with EY's global IFRS subject matter experts in IFRIC 21 Levies and IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent assets . The discussion primarily focused on the Group's property lease arrangements which stipulate that Argos and Sainsbury's are required to pay business rates when they are due and whether this changes the nature of business rates as a statutory obligation for the Group.\n- - Following the change in accounting policy, we assessed the appropriateness of classification of business rates relating to vacant properties as a non-underlying item.\n- - We assessed the adequacy of the financial statement disclosures in respect of the restatement of prior period comparatives for compliance with accounting standards.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe concluded that business rates for the period when the premises are vacant fall outside the scope of the onerous contract provisions under IAS 37 and it is appropriate that no provision is recognised for the business rates. The change in accounting treatment and disclosure of the impact of the restatement of prior year comparatives is appropriate, along with the classification as a non-underlying item.\n\n## Risk\n\n## The IT environment\n\nThe IT systems across the Group are complex and there are varying levels of integration between them. The systems are vital to the ongoing operations of the business and to the integrity of the financial reporting process.\n\nDuring the current year we continued to report deficiencies in certain IT controls. These deficiencies related to IT systems that are part of the Group's control framework over financial reporting and required us to perform incremental procedures.\n\nThis risk remains unchanged from the prior year.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\n- - We held discussions with management to understand the IT environment and walked through the key financial processes to understand where IT systems were integral to the Group's controls over financial reporting. From this we identified which IT systems to include in the scope for our detailed IT testing.\n- - We assessed the IT general controls environment for the key systems impacting the accurate recording of transactions and the presentation of the financial statements.\n- - We designed our IT audit procedures to assess the IT environment, including an assessment of controls over changes made to the system and controls over appropriate access to the systems.\n- - Where we found that adequate IT general controls were not in place, we performed incremental substantive audit procedures in response to the deficiencies identified for the systems within the scope of our audit.\n\n## Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\nWe completed additional substantive testing in order to mitigate the risk of material misstatement and we reported a number of control observations and opportunities for improvement.\n\nIn the prior year, our auditor's report included key audit matters in relation to restructuring programmes and the assessment of the carrying value of non-current assets. Restructuring activity has been much reduced in the current year due to closure provisions being recognised in the prior year. Impairment charges in relation to changes in customer behaviour have not recurred during the current year.\n\n## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u00a338 million (2020/2021: \u00a327 million), which is 4.6% (2020/2021: 5%) of Profit before tax, adjusted for non-recurring items. We believe that Profit before tax, adjusted for non-recurring items, provides us with the most relevant performance measure as it adjusts for the effect of items which do not relate to the ongoing trading of the Group. The materiality basis in the prior year used a normalised measure of adjusted profit before tax, which reflected the volatility in the Group's trading results arising from the impact of COVID-19.\n\n| Starting basis   | Profit before tax                                                                | \u00a3894 million   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Adjustments      | Adjust for non-recurring  items                                                  | \u00a377 million    |\n|                  | These items are not  one-off in nature)                                          |                |\n| Materiality      | Total materiality basis Materiality of \u00a338 million  (4.7% of materiality  basis) | \u00a3817 million   |\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed materiality as the actual adjusted Profit before tax was higher than the Group's initial estimate we used at planning. However, due to the status of our procedures we did not change our materiality from \u00a338 million to reflect this.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a3128 million (2020/2021: \u00a3136 million), which is 2% (2020/2021: 2%) of net assets. The materiality of the parent company is greater than the Group because the parent company is a holding company with significant net assets. For any parent company balances that are consolidated into the Group financial statements, an allocation of Group performance materiality was used.",

        "page_content": "## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 50% (2020/2021: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a319 million (2020/2021: \u00a313.5 million). We have set performance materiality at this percentage to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u00a33.8 million to \u00a315.0 million (2020/2021: \u00a32.7 million to \u00a312.7 million).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a31.9 million (2020/2021: \u00a31.3 million), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 98, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- - the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- - the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- - the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- - certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- - we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nWe have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Group and company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- - Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 116;\n- - Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 51;\n- - Director's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meets its liabilities set out on page 52;\n- - Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 100;\n- - Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 38;\n- - The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 38; and;\n- - The section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 73.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 100, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.",

        "page_content": "## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- - We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are:\n- - Those that relate to the form and content of the financial statements, such as UK adopted International Accounting Standards, the UK Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate Governance Code;\n- - Those that relate to the Bank, such as the regulations, license conditions and supervisory requirements of the Prudential Regulation Authority ('PRA') and the Financial Conduct Authority ('FCA'); and\n- - Industry-related such as compliance with the requirements of the Grocery Supply Code of Practice.\n- - We understood how J Sainsbury plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit and those responsible for legal and compliance procedures. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee and attendance at all meetings of the Audit Committee, as well as consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the Group.\n- - We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by making an assessment of the key fraud risks to the Group and the manner in which such risks may manifest themselves in practice, based on our previous knowledge of the Group as well as an assessment of the current business environment.\n- - Based on the results of our risk assessment we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified risk of material misstatement. These procedures included those referred to in the 'Supplier arrangements' and 'Aspects of revenue recognition' key audit matters section above. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of material fraud or error. We evaluated the design and operational effectiveness of controls put in place to address the risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud. We also considered performance targets and their influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings.\n- - If any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations were identified, these were communicated to the relevant local EY teams who performed sufficient and appropriate audit procedures, supplemented by audit procedures at the Group level.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- - Following the recommendation from the audit committee we were appointed by the company on 8 July 2015 to audit the financial statements for the period ended 12 March 2016 and subsequent financial periods.\n- - The period of total uninterrupted engagement including previous renewals and reappointments is 7 years, covering the periods ending 12 March 2016 to 5 March 2022.\n- - The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## Colin Brown\n\n(Senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London 27 April 2022",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1 General information\n\nJ Sainsbury plc is a public limited company (the 'Company') incorporated in the United Kingdom, whose shares are publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange. The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom and its registered address is 33 Holborn, London EC1N 2HT, United Kingdom.\n\nThe financial year represents the 52 weeks to 5 March 2022 (prior financial year: 52 weeks to 6 March 2021). The consolidated financial statements for the 52 weeks to 5 March 2022 comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') and the Group's share of the post-tax results of its joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe Group's principal activities are Food, General Merchandise and Clothing retailing and Financial Services.\n\n## 2 Significant accounting policies\n\n## 2.1 Basis of preparation\n\nThe Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest million ('\u00a3m') unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments, defined benefit pension scheme assets and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that have been measured at fair value.\n\nSainsbury's Bank plc and its subsidiaries have been consolidated for the twelve months to 28 February 2022 being the Bank's year-end date (prior financial year: 28 February 2021). There have been no significant transactions or events that occurred between this date and the Group's balance sheet date, and therefore no adjustments have been made to reflect the difference in year-end dates.\n\nSignificant accounting policies have been included in the relevant notes to which the policies relate, and those relating to the financial statements as a whole can be read further below. Unless otherwise stated, significant accounting policies have been applied consistently to all periods presented in the financial statements.\n\n## Prior period restatements\n\n## Business rates within property provisions\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include a prior year restatement in relation to the treatment of business rates within property provisions. Where the Group no longer operates from a leased property, onerous property contract provisions are recognised for the least net cost of exiting from the contract. Unless a separate exit agreement with a landlord has already been agreed, the Group's policy is that this onerous contract provision includes all unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations of the contract - these include service charges and insurance, and have also historically included business rates.\n\nThere is apparent mixed practice across companies concerning the treatment of business rates in onerous contract provisions. However following additional guidance published this year by accounting advisory firms, the Group has reassessed its policy in this area, and concluded that business rates are a statutory obligation rather than a contractual one, and should be recognised as a periodic cost in line with IFRIC 21 'Levies'. Prior period comparatives have therefore been restated to remove business rates from previously recognised property provisions.\n\n## Notional cash pooling\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include a prior year restatement in relation to notional cash pooling arrangements where the intention to net settle cannot be clearly demonstrated, and therefore do not meet the requirements for offsetting in accordance with IAS 32: 'Financial Instruments: Presentation'. Prior period comparatives have been restated by grossing up cash and overdrafts (reported within current borrowings).

This is in response to the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) agenda decision clarifying its interpretation of how current accounting standards apply to these types of arrangements during the current financial year. The new accounting policy is presented within note 16. Adjustments in relation to costs capitalised in prior years have therefore been recognised as follows:\n\n|                         | \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------|------|\n| Intangible assets       | (30) |\n| Prepayments             | 9    |\n| Total assets/net assets | (21) |\n| Administrative expenses | (21) |\n| Profit before tax       | (21) |\n\nThe impact is not considered to have a material impact on the prior year balance sheet nor income statement, therefore the prior year results have not been restated. Given this is an out of period cost and could distort comparability between reporting periods, this has been included within non-underlying profit before tax. Intangible asset write-offs have been included within disposals.\n\nIn addition to the above, \u00a314 million of current year spend that would have been capitalised to intangible assets under the Group's previous accounting policy has now been recognised within prepayments (\u00a36 million) and underlying profit (\u00a38 million).\n\nThere is no impact on cash flows.\n\n## Climate change considerations\n\nIn preparing the Group's financial statements, consideration has been given to the impact of both physical and transition climate change risks, as described within the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) section on page 17, and how these impact the financial statements. While it is not believed that these climate change risks have a material impact on the Group's financial statements, further narrative disclosure has been provided in the following disclosure notes:\n\n- - Going Concern - note 2.2\n- - Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions - note 4\n- - Property, plant and equipment - note 14\n- - Impairment of non-financial assets - note 17\n- - Provisions - note 25\n- - Retirement benefit obligations - note 37\n\nThe policy, technology and market changes in response to climate change are still developing, and these are interdependent upon each other, and consequently the financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## 2.2 Going concern\n\nThe Directors are satisfied that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operation for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The assessment period for the purposes of considering going concern is the 12 months to 27 April 2023.\n\nIn assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, the Directors have considered the Group's most recent corporate planning and budgeting processes. This includes an annual review which considers profitability, the Group's cash flows, committed funding and liquidity positions and forecasted future funding requirements over three years, with a further two years of indicative movements.\n\nThe Group manages its financing by diversifying funding sources, structuring core borrowings with long-term maturities and maintaining sufficient levels of standby liquidity via the Revolving Credit Facility. This seeks to minimise liquidity risk by maintaining a suitable level of undrawn additional funding capacity.\n\nThe Revolving Credit Facility is split into two Facilities, a \u00a3300 million Facility (A) and a \u00a31,094 million Facility (B). Facility A has a final maturity of April 2025 and Facility B has a final maturity of October 2024. As at 5 March 2022, both Facility (A) and Facility (B) were undrawn.\n\nIn assessing going concern, scenarios in relation to the Group's principal risks have been considered in line with those disclosed in the viability statement on page 51 by overlaying them into the corporate plan and assessing the impact on cash flows, net debt and funding headroom. These severe but plausible scenarios included modelling inflationary pressures on both food margins and general recession-related risks, the impact of any regulatory fines, and the failure to deliver planned cost savings.\n\nIn performing the above analysis, the Directors have made certain assumptions around the availability and effectiveness of the mitigating actions available to the Group. These include reducing any non-essential capital expenditure and operating expenditure on projects, bonuses and dividend payments.\n\nThe Group's most recent corporate planning and budgeting processes incorporates assumed cashflows to address climate change risks, including those associated with the Group's Plan for Better commitment which include reducing environmental impacts and meeting customer expectations in this area, notably through reducing packaging and energy usage across the estate. Climate-related risks do not result in any material uncertainties affecting the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nConsideration was also given to the conflict in Ukraine which has continued to develop subsequent to the Group's balance sheet date. Inflationary pressures which may be caused by the conflict are already incorporated into the overall going concern assessment, as such the impact of the conflict in Ukraine does not impact the conclusions reached over going concern.\n\nAs a consequence of the work performed, the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements with no material uncertainties to disclose.\n\n## 2.3 Basis of consolidation a) Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities, including structured entities (see below) over which the Group has control. This is when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The results of subsidiaries are included in the income statement from the date of acquisition or, in the case of disposals, up to the effective date of disposal. Intercompany transactions and balances between Group companies are eliminated upon consolidation.\n\nSainsbury's Property Scottish Partnership, Sainsbury's Property Scottish Limited Partnership, Sainsbury's Thistle Scottish Limited Partnership and Nectar 360 Services LLP, are partnerships which are fully consolidated into these Group accounts. The Group has taken advantage of the exemption conferred by Regulation 7 of the Partnerships ('Accounts') Regulations 2008 and has therefore not appended the accounts of these qualifying partnerships to these accounts.\n\n## Significant judgement - Consolidation of structured entities\n\nSainsbury's Thistle Scottish Limited Partnership ('the Partnership') is a structured entity which the Group fully consolidates.\n\nA structured entity is one in which the Group does not hold the majority interest but for which management has concluded that voting rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity. The Partnership, in which both the Group and Pension Scheme Trustee hold an interest, was established following the 2018 triennial valuation of the Group's defined benefit scheme.\n\nThe Group has determined that the relevant activities of the Partnership are the funding of the Scheme and whether the funding targets have been met. Furthermore, a general partner wholly owned by the Group has exclusive responsibility for the management and control of the Partnership and sole authority to exercise the Partnership's rights. This includes the ability to make additional contributions to the Scheme such that the funding targets are met. As the Group can direct the Partnership's relevant activities and affect its returns (through reaching the Scheme's funding targets), it has been concluded that the Group controls the Partnership, despite not having a majority interest. It is therefore consolidated in the Group accounts. Further information is included in note 37.\n\n## b) Joint ventures and associates\n\nThe Group applies IFRS 11 to all joint arrangements. Under IFRS 11, investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the contractual rights and obligations of each investor. The Group has assessed the nature of its joint arrangements and determined them to be joint ventures. Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control.\n\nInvestments in joint ventures and associates are carried in the Group balance sheet at historical cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of net assets of the entity, less any provision for impairment. Where the Group transacts with a joint venture or associate, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the joint venture or associate.\n\nA full list of the Group's joint ventures is included in note 43. Joint ventures with a different year-end date to the Group are reported to include the results up to 28 February 2022, the nearest month-end to the Group's year-end. Adjustments are made for the effects of significant transactions or events that occurred between 28 February and the Group's balance sheet date. No joint venture arrangements are considered significant to the Group.\n\n## c) Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the ultimate parent company's functional currency.\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nThe Group has operations in Asia that source and purchase certain general merchandise and clothing inventory. In addition the Group has a trading entity in Ireland. On consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates. The results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the year. Exchange differences arising are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income/(loss) and are included in the Group's translation reserve.\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## 2.4 Amendments to published standards\n\nEffective for the Group and Company in these financial statements:\n\nThe Group has considered the following amendments to published standards that are effective for the Group for the financial year beginning 7 March 2021 and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Group or that they do not have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements other than disclosures.\n\n- - Amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2\n- - Amendment to IFRS 16 'Leases' with regards to the exemption granted in the 'COVID-19-related rent concessions'\n\nThe Group early adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amendments in the financial year ended 6 March 2021. The Group has elected not to apply the exemption granted in the 'COVID-19-related rent concessions' as the Group has not received material COVID-19-related rent concessions as a lessee.\n\n## Standards and revisions effective for future periods:\n\nThe following standards and revisions will be effective for future periods:\n\n- - Amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' with reference to the Conceptual Framework\n- - Amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets' on Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\n- - Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment' on Proceeds before Intended Use\n- - Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' on the classification of liabilities as current or non-current\n- - Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' and IFRS Practice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgements' on the disclosure of accounting policies\n- - Amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' on the definition of accounting estimates\n- - Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' on Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction\n- - IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nThe Group has considered the impact of the remaining above standards and revisions and has concluded that they will not have a significant impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## 3 Alternative performance measures (APMs)\n\nIn the reporting of financial information, the Directors use various APMs. These APMs should be considered in addition to, and are not intended to be a substitute for, IFRS measurements. As they are not defined by International Financial Reporting Standards, they may not be directly comparable with other companies' APMs.\n\nThe Directors believe that these APMs provide additional useful information for understanding the financial performance and health of the Group. They are also used to enhance the comparability of information between reporting periods (such as like-for-like sales and underlying profit) by adjusting for non-recurring or uncontrollable factors which affect IFRS measures, to aid users in understanding the Group's performance.\n\nConsequently, APMs are used by the Directors and management for performance analysis, planning, reporting and incentive setting purposes.\n\nThe APMs that the Group has focused on in the period are defined and reconciled on page 203. All of the APMs relate to the current period's results and comparative periods.\n\n## 4 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Those which are significant to the Group are discussed separately below:\n\n## Judgements\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- - Consolidation of structured entities - refer to note 2.3\n- - Non-underlying items - refer to note 5\n- - Aggregation of operating segments - refer to note 7\n- - Lease term - refer to note 15\n\n## Sources of estimation uncertainty\n\nThe areas where estimates and assumptions are significant to the financial statements are as listed below. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n- - Nectar accounting (breakage estimates) - refer to note 6\n- - Lease liabilities (derivation of discount rates) - refer to note 15\n- - Impairment of non-financial assets - refer to note 17\n- - Provisions - refer to note 25\n- - Impairment of Financial Services loans and advances - refer to note 30\n- - Post-employment benefits (assets and liabilities) - refer to note 37\n\nIn assessing the Group's judgements and sources of estimation uncertainty, consideration has been given to the impact of climate change risk on these. Aside from impairment of non-financial assets (refer to note 17) and post-employment benefits (refer to note 37), climate change risks do not have any impacts on the Group's judgements or sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\nEffective interest rates on Financial Services loans and receivables, which was disclosed as a key estimate in the prior year financial statements, is no longer deemed to be a key estimate. In calculating the effective interest rate of a financial instrument the Group takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield of a financial instrument as well as incremental transaction costs. In the case of loans and advances to customers, any significant changes in the assumptions used to estimate the effect on future cash flows would not have a material impact on the value of loans and receivables held on the balance sheet, and therefore the Group no longer deems this to be a source of significant estimation uncertainty.",

        "page_content": "## 5 Profit before non-underlying items\n\nIn order to provide shareholders with additional insight into the year-on-year performance of the business, an adjusted measure of profit (underlying profit before tax) is provided to supplement the reported IFRS numbers, and reflects how the business measures performance internally. This adjusted measure excludes items recognised in reported profit or loss before tax which, if included, could distort comparability between periods.\n\nDetermining which items are to be adjusted requires judgement, in which the Group considers items which are significant either by virtue of their size and/or nature, or that are non-recurring. The same assessment is applied consistently to any reversals of prior non-underlying items.\n\nUnderlying profit is not an IFRS measure and therefore not directly comparable to other companies.\n\nThe most significant non-underlying items in the current year relate to income received in relation to the settlement of legal disputes over interchange fees, and costs associated with restructuring programmes. More details on each are included further below.\n\nThe Group has not included any additional costs incurred or credits received directly in relation to the impacts of COVID-19 within non-underlying items. Whilst some items (such as additional expenses incurred protecting colleagues and customers) are discrete and can be separately quantified, others, such as incremental food sales, cannot be reliably disaggregated from the Group's underlying performance. The Group has therefore concluded that presenting some movements as underlying and others as non-underlying would give an imbalanced view that is not easily comparable to past and subsequent periods.\n\n|                                                                | Cost of   sales  \u00a3m   | Administrative  expenses  \u00a3m   | Other   income  \u00a3m   | Net finance  income/ (costs)  \u00a3m   | Total  adjustments  before tax  \u00a3m   | Tax  \u00a3m   | Total  adjustments  \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------------|\n| Income recognised in relation to legal disputes                | -

The Group has one ongoing legal case remaining - refer to note 40.\n\nOf the \u00a3167 million, cash of \u00a375 million was received in a prior year and held as deferred income. Net cash of \u00a393 million was received during the current financial year and \u00a31 million of legal fees remains outstanding.\n\nIn addition, a provision for a legal claim totalling \u00a313 million has been released as it was assessed during the financial period that a pay-out is no longer considered probable.",

The programme also considered the Group's Store Support Centre ways of working.\n\nThe programme is a multi-year activity which began in the prior year and has continued into the current year. Total cumulative costs to 5 March 2022 are \u00a3(640) million split between \u00a3(548) million in the prior year and \u00a3(92) million in the current period as detailed in the table below. Total expected costs are still in the range of \u00a3900 million to \u00a31 billion to March 2024, with the majority in the period to March 2024. In line with IFRIC 21 'Levies', business rates are now recognised as a periodic cost and as such approximately \u00a340 million of business rates associated with leased properties in the restructuring programme will be recognised after the year ended March 2024. Refer to note 2 for further details.\n\n(Costs)/gains recognised in the current year are as follows:\n\n|                                                  | 52 weeks to  5 March  2022 \u00a3m   | 52 weeks to  6 March  2021 (restated) \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Write downs of property, plant and equipment (a) | (6)                             | (26)                                       |\n| Write downs of leased assets (a)                 | (3)                             | (72)                                       |\n| Write downs of intangible assets                 | -                               | (3)                                        |\n| Closure provisions (b)                           | (24)                            | (145)                                      |\n| Accelerated depreciation of assets (c)           | (33)                            | (27)                                       |\n| Redundancy provisions (d)                        | (40)                            | (61)                                       |\n| Consultancy costs                                | (18)                            | (10)                                       |\n| Gain on lease terminations (e)                   | 9                               | 16                                         |\n| Property profits (f)                             | 12                              | -                                          |\n| Recognition of sub-lease debtor (g)              | 11                              | -                                          |\n| Restructuring programmes                         | (92)                            | (328)                                      |\n| Impairment of non-financial assets               | -                               | (220)                                      |\n| Total restructuring and impairment costs         | (92)                            | (548)                                      |\n\n- a) During the financial year, the Group announced the closure of 200 of its in-store cafes. Related assets have been written down as a result.\n- b)  Closure provisions relate to onerous contract costs, dilapidations and strip out costs on leased sites that have been identified for closure. Upon initial recognition of closure provisions, management uses its best estimates of the relevant costs to be incurred as well as expected closure dates. Business rates on leased property where the Group no longer operates from are recognised in the period they are incurred.\n- c) The remaining useful economic lives of corresponding sites have been reassessed to align with closure dates, resulting in an acceleration in depreciation of these assets. The existing depreciation of these assets (depreciation that would have been recognised absent of a closure decision) is recognised within underlying expenses, whereas accelerated depreciation above this is recognised within non-underlying expenses.\n- d)  Redundancy costs are recognised as the plan is announced and a valid expectation raised with the affected colleagues. The current year charge relates to redundancies announced as part of Argos store closures, depot closures, and caf\u00e9 and food counter closures.\n- e) Gains on lease terminations relate to sites impaired in the prior year for which it has been negotiated to exit the leases before the contractual end date. This includes the release of any lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, as well as any closure provisions previously recognised.\n- f) Profit on disposal of properties relates to profits recognised in the period as sites previously impaired as part of the restructuring programmes have been disposed of.\n- g)  During the year, the Group was able to negotiate a sub-lease on a previously impaired site for the duration of the remaining headlease. This resulted in the creation of a sub-lease debtor (refer to accounting policies for Group as lessor on page 137), with any difference between the lease receivable and right-of-use asset being recognised in the income statement.\n\nAs the costs incurred facilitate future underlying cost savings, it was considered whether it was appropriate to report these costs within underlying profit. Whilst they arise from changes in the Group's underlying operations, they can be separately identified, are material in size and do not relate to ordinary in-year trading activity. In addition, the areas being closed or restructured no longer relate to the Group's remaining underlying operations and their exclusion provides meaningful comparison between financial years.\n\n## Software as a service accounting adjustment\n\nDuring the year, the Group revised its accounting policy in relation to upfront configuration and customisation costs incurred in implementing software as a service (SaaS) arrangements; refer to note 2.1 for further details. Costs capitalised in prior years totalling \u00a321 million have been written off this year. Given this is an out of period cost and could distort comparability between reporting periods, this has been included within non-underlying profit before tax.\n\n## Financial Services transition and other\n\nThese comprise Financial Services transition costs of \u00a3(11) million and were incurred in transitioning to new banking platforms as part of the previously announced New Bank Programme. These principally comprise contractor and service provider costs relating to the migration of data and other services to the Bank's new infrastructure and operating model. These costs of integration do not reflect the business's trading performance and so are adjusted to ensure consistency between periods. The programme ended this financial year.",

These are excluded from underlying profit as such profit is not related to the ongoing operating activities of the Group.\n- - Non-underlying finance and fair value movements for the financial period comprised \u00a368 million for the Group. These include fair value remeasurements on derivatives not in a hedging relationship and lease interest on impaired non-trading sites, including site closures. The fair value movements are driven by external market factors and can significantly fluctuate year-on-year. They are therefore excluded to ensure consistency between periods. Lease interest on impaired, non-trading sites is excluded as they do not contribute to the operating activities of the Group. Included within cost of sales is \u00a376 million of income in relation to favourable movements on long-term, fixed price power purchase arrangements (PPAs) with independent producers. These are accounted for as derivative financial instruments, however are not designated in hedging relationships, therefore gains and losses are recognised in the income statement. Increases in electricity forward prices in the year have led to gains on the related derivative financial instruments. During the year, the Group entered into an additional PPA, however have designated this in a formal hedging relationship, with gains and losses being recognised within other comprehensive income. Further information is included within note 31. The remaining movements of \u00a3(8) million within finance income and costs are analysed further in note 10.\n- - Defined benefit pension interest and expenses comprises pension finance income of \u00a315 million and scheme expenses of \u00a3(4) million (see note 37). Although a recurring item, the Group has chosen to exclude net retirement benefit income and costs from underlying profit as, following closure of the defined benefit scheme to future accrual, it is not part of the ongoing operating activities of the Group and its exclusion is consistent with how the Directors assess the performance of the business.\n- - Acquisition adjustments of \u00a3(20) million reflect the unwind of non-cash fair value adjustments arising from Home Retail Group and Nectar UK acquisitions. The Group would not normally recognise these as assets outside of a business combination. Therefore the unwinds are classified as non-underlying and are recognised as follows:\n\n|              | 52 weeks to 5 March 2022   | 52 weeks to 5 March 2022   | 52 weeks to 5 March 2022   | 52 weeks to 6 March 2021   | 52 weeks to 6 March 2021   | 52 weeks to 6 March 2021   |\n|--------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|              | Argos  \u00a3m                  | Nectar  \u00a3m                 | Total Group  \u00a3m            | Argos  \u00a3m                  | Nectar  \u00a3m                 | Total Group  \u00a3m            |\n| Depreciation | 3                          | -

Revenue is recognised when the Group has a contract with a customer and a performance obligation has been satisfied, at the transaction price allocated to that performance obligation.\n\n## Retail sales\n\n## a)  Retail - sale of goods\n\nFor sales through retail outlets and online, the transaction price is the value of the goods, net of returns, colleague discounts, and vouchers. Revenue is recognised when the customer obtains control of the goods, which is when the transaction is completed in-store or, for online orders, when goods have been delivered or collected by customers (for click and collect).\n\n## b)  Other revenue items\n\nOther revenue items include wholesale sales made directly to third-party customers, and income from concessions and commissions, net of returns and discounts. Wholesale revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the customer. Revenue collected on behalf of others is not recognised as revenue, other than the related commission which is based on the terms of the contract. Sales are recorded net of VAT.\n\nAn element of judgement is required for commission-based arrangements to determine whether the Group should recognise revenue as principal (recognising gross revenue and associated costs) or as agent (recognising net income as revenue only). The assessment considers whether the Group controls the relevant goods prior to sale to the end customer. The Group's relevant contracts are not complex and therefore the level of judgement involved is not considered significant to the Group.\n\n## c)  Nectar points\n\nThe issuance of Nectar points within the Group creates a separate performance obligation and therefore a portion of the transaction price is allocated to the loyalty programme using the standalone selling price of points issued, and the corresponding revenue deferred. The deferral is treated as a deduction from revenue and recognised as a contract liability within deferred income (see note 23). The fair value of the points awarded is determined with reference to the value per point to a customer and considers expected redemption rates (breakage) and the money off that each point entitles a customer to. The revenue deferred is subsequently recognised when the Nectar points are redeemed by the customer.\n\n## Significant estimate - Fair value of Nectar points\n\nThe Group estimates the fair value of points awarded under the Nectar programme by reference to the value per point to a customer, multiplied by expected breakage assumptions. Breakage represents management's estimate of points issued that will never be redeemed and is therefore subject to uncertainty. Breakage is estimated by management based on the terms and conditions of membership and historical accumulation and redemption patterns.\n\nAs at the year-end, if the breakage estimate used in determining the deferred revenue for the Group had been 1.0 per cent lower, the deferred points liability would have been \u00a348 million higher. If the breakage estimate had been 1.0 per cent higher, the deferred points liability would have been \u00a348 million lower.",

        "page_content": "## 6 Revenue continued\n\n## Financial Services\n\n## a) Interest income\n\nInterest income is recognised in the income statement for all instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nThe effective interest rate of a financial asset is calculated on initial recognition and is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset. For financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset net of impairment. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis. In calculating the effective interest rate of a financial instrument the Group takes into account all amounts that are integral to the yield of a financial instrument as well as incremental transaction costs.\n\n## b) Fees and commission income\n\nFees and commissions that are not integral to the effective interest rate calculation relate primarily to certain credit card and storecard fees, ATM interchange fees, insurance introduction commission and warranty commission receivable. These are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis as performance obligations are satisfied. Where in the case of insurance commissions the income comprises an initial commission and profit share, both are recognised on completion of the service to the extent reliably measurable. Where there is a risk of potential clawback, an appropriate element of the commission receivable is deferred and amortised over the clawback period.\n\nMargin from the sale of travel money, representing the difference between the cost price and the selling price, is recognised when the sale to the customer takes place.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income generally consists of profits and losses on disposal of assets.\n\n## Revenue recognised\n\n|                                                   | 5 March  2022  \u00a3m   | 6 March   2021  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Grocery and General Merchandise & Clothing (GM&C) | 25,440              | 26,103               |\n| Fuel                                              | 4,023               | 2,514                |\n| Total retail sales                                | 29,463              | 28,617               |\n| Financial Services interest receivable            | 322                 | 344                  |\n| Financial Services fees and commission            | 110                 | 87                   |\n| Total Financial Services income                   | 432                 | 431                  |\n| Total revenue                                     | 29,895              | 29,048               |\n\n## 7 Segment reporting\n\n## Background\n\nManagement has determined the operating segments based on the information provided to the Operating Board (the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group) to make operational decisions on the management of the Group. Three operating segments were identified as follows:\n\n- - Retail - Food\n- - Retail - General Merchandise and Clothing\n- - Financial Services\n\n## Significant judgement - aggregation of operating segments\n\nManagement has considered the economic characteristics, in particular average gross margin, similarity of products, production processes, customers, sales methods and regulatory environment of its two Retail segments. In doing so it has been concluded that they should be aggregated into one 'Retail' segment in the financial statements. This aggregated information provides users with the financial information needed to evaluate the business and the environment in which it operates.\n\nThe Operating Board assesses the performance of all segments on the basis of underlying profit before tax. Underlying profit before tax is an APM as described in note 3. All material operations and assets are in the UK.\n\nSegment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.\n\nSegment revenue presents a disaggregation of revenue from customers consistent with the Group's primary revenue streams.",

Any supplier arrangements which are linked to inventory purchases are included within the cost of the related inventory, and therefore recognised within cost of sales once the inventory is sold. Unpaid amounts relating to supplier arrangements are recognised within trade and other receivables, unless there is a legal right of offset, in which case it is recognised within trade and other payables.\n\nThe types of supplier arrangements applicable to the Group are as follows:\n\n- -Discounts and supplier incentives - these represent the majority of all supplier arrangements and are linked to individual unit sales. The incentive is typically based on an agreed sum per item sold on promotion for a period and therefore is considered part of the purchase price of that product.\n- -Fixed amounts - these are agreed with suppliers primarily to support in-store activity including promotions, such as utilising specific space.\n- -Supplier rebates - these are typically agreed on an annual basis, aligned with the Group's financial year. The rebate amount is linked to pre-agreed targets such as sales volumes.\n- -Marketing and advertising income - advertising income from suppliers through the Group's subsidiary Nectar 360 Services LLP and online marketing and advertising campaigns within Argos.\n\nAmounts recognised in the income statement during the year for fixed amounts, volume-based rebates and marketing and advertising income are shown below. Discounts and supplier incentives are not shown as they are deemed to be part of the cost price of inventory.\n\n|                                    |   52 weeks to   5 March   2022 \u00a3m |   52 weeks to   6 March   2021 \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Fixed amounts                      |                               208 |                               236 |\n| Supplier rebates                   |                                94 |                                55 |\n| Marketing and advertising income 1 |                                79 |                                69 |\n| Total supplier arrangements        |                               381 |                               360 |\n\n- 1 The prior year has been restated.

For Financial Services, finance income and finance costs are recognised in revenue and cost of sales.\n\nThe coupons on the perpetual capital securities and perpetual convertible bonds are accounted for as dividends in accordance with IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation' and hence are not a finance cost. These are included as a finance cost in the presentation of underlying results, but do not qualify as a finance cost for IFRS statutory purposes.\n\nFair value remeasurements relate to net fair value movements on derivative financial instruments not designated in a hedging relationship.\n\n|                                                      | 2022          | 2022               | 2022     | 2021 (restated)   | 2021 (restated)   | 2021 (restated)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                      | Underlying \u00a3m | Non- underlying \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m | Underlying \u00a3m     | Non-underlying \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m          |\n| Interest on bank deposits and other financial assets | 1             | -                  | 1        | 1                 | -                 | 1                 |\n| Fair value measurements                              | -             | 2                  | 2        | -                 | 10                | 10                |\n| IAS 19 pension financing income                      | -             | 15                 | 15       | -                 | 19                | 19                |\n| Finance income on net investment in leases           | 2             | -                  | 2        | 2                 | -                 | 2                 |\n| Finance income                                       | 3             | 17                 | 20       | 3                 | 29                | 32                |\n| Secured borrowings                                   | (40)          | -                  | (40)     | (49)              | -                 | (49)              |\n| Unsecured borrowings                                 | (2)           | -                  | (2)      | (1)               | -                 | (1)               |\n| Lease liabilities                                    | (271)         | (10)               | (281)    | (295)             | (10)              | (305)             |\n| Provisions - amortisation of discount                | (1)           | -                  | (1)      | (1)               | -                 | (1)               |\n| Interest capitalised - qualifying assets             | 2             | -                  | 2        | 4                 | -                 | 4                 |\n| Perpetual securities coupon                          | -             | -                  | -        | (14)              | 14                | -                 |\n| Finance costs                                        | (312)         | (10)               | (322)    | (356)             | 4                 | (352)             |\n\nRefer to note 2 for details of prior year restatements.",

Current tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged to equity or other comprehensive income.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is accounted for on the basis of temporary differences arising from differences between the tax base and accounting base of assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for all temporary differences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit. It is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n|                                                   | 52 weeks to   5 March   2022 \u00a3m   | 52 weeks to   6 March   2021 (restated) \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Current year UK tax                               | 131                               | 34                                           |\n| Current year overseas tax                         | 6                                 | 6                                            |\n| Under/(over) - provision in prior years           | 5                                 | (12)                                         |\n| Total current tax expense                         | 142                               | 28                                           |\n| Origination and reversal of temporary differences | 52                                | (46)                                         |\n| (Over)/under-provision in prior years             | (35)                              | 27                                           |\n| Adjustment from changes in tax rates              | 23                                | -                                            |\n| (Recognition)/derecognition of capital losses     | (5)                               | 28                                           |\n| Total deferred tax expense                        | 35                                | 9                                            |\n| Total income tax expense in income statement      | 177                               | 37                                           |\n| Analysed as:                                      |                                   |                                              |\n| Underlying tax                                    | 154                               | 105                                          |\n| Non-underlying tax                                | 23                                | (68)                                         |\n| Total income tax expense in income statement      | 177                               | 37                                           |\n| Underlying tax rate                               | 21.1%                             | 29.4%                                        |\n| Effective tax rate                                | 20.7%                             | (22.6)%                                      |",

This results in a total final proposed dividend of \u00a3230 million (2021: \u00a3164 million).\n\nSubject to shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend will be paid on 15 July 2022 to the shareholders on the register at 10 June 2022. The proposed final dividend has not been included as a liability at 5 March 2022.\n\n## 14 Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## a) Land and buildings\n\nLand and buildings are held at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Capital work in progress is held at cost less any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for intended use. This includes capitalised borrowing costs.\n\n## b) Fixtures and equipment\n\nFixtures, equipment and vehicles are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised provision for impairment. Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition and its intended use.\n\n## c) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is calculated to write down the cost of the assets to their residual values, on a straight-line basis, using the following rates:\n\n- - Freehold buildings and leasehold improvements - 50 years, or the lease term if shorter\n- - Fixtures, equipment and vehicles - three to 15 years\n- - Freehold land is not depreciated\n\nCapital work in progress is not depreciated prior to being brought to its working condition and its intended use. Capital work in progress does not include land.\n\nGains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds less any associated costs of disposal with the asset's carrying amount and are recognised within operating profit.\n\nThe assets' residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. This includes consideration over climate change related risks which may impact the useful lives of the Group's assets, such as the impact of flood risks on store and non-store assets, and any anticipated replacement of existing assets with new technologies. During the year, no changes were made to the remaining useful lives of the Group's assets as a result of climate change risks.\n\n## Capitalisation of interest\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised to the cost of the asset, gross of tax relief.",

The leases have varying terms and often include break clauses or options to renew beyond the non-cancellable periods.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Right-of-use assets\n\nRight-of-use assets are recognised at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any subsequent remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.\n\nThe recognised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease term. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment.\n\n## Lease liabilities\n\nLease liabilities are recognised at the commencement date of the lease and are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The majority of the Group's leases are discounted using the IBR.\n\nThe IBRs depend on the start date and term of the lease, and are determined based on a reference (risk free) rate and adjustments to reflect the Group's credit risk. The reference rates are based on UK overnight swap rates and the credit risk adjustments are based on the prices of instruments issued by the group and quoted credit default swaps ('CDS'). IBRs are determined quarterly.\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease (a break clause), if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised.\n\nThe lease payments include fixed payments and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (using the relevant rate at the commencement date of the lease), less any lease incentives receivable. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. For agreements which contain both lease and non-lease components, such as cleaning and maintenance services, the non-lease component is excluded from the lease payments used to measure the lease liabilities.\n\nAfter the commencement date of the lease, the lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured when there is a change in the future lease payments due to a change in the lease term such as a recognition of an extension or break option, a change in the fixed lease payments or a change in the assessment to purchase the underlying asset.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group applies the short-term lease recognition exemption to those leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date and do not contain a purchase option. It also applies the low-value asset recognition exemption to groups of underlying leases that are considered uniformly low value (i.e. below \u00a35,000). Lease payments on short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are expensed to the income statement.",

In doing so, additions to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities above include the net impact of new leases, terminations, modifications, and reassessments. This year includes the impact of exercising purchase options on 21 leased supermarkets held by a property investment pool in which the Group holds an interest. The purchase options were not included within the lease liabilities at inception of the lease as the Group was not reasonably certain to exercise them. Following the exercise of the options, the respective lease liabilities have been remeasured to include the assumed purchase price, leading to an increase in lease liabilities with a corresponding increase to the right-of-use asset. The purchases will be completed in the financial year ended 2 March 2024 when the existing leases end.\n\nThe purchase price is subject to negotiation and at the year-end had not yet been agreed. Therefore to remeasure the lease liability, the purchase price has been estimated based on up-to-date property valuations carried out by independent valuers not connected with the Group. The lease liabilities (and right-of-use assets) may be subsequently adjusted as the property valuations change, and when purchase prices are agreed. This is not considered a significant estimate in line with IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements'.\n\n## Guarantee in relation to property pool\n\nWhen the properties are sold by the property investment pool in the financial year ended 2 March 2024, the proceeds will be used to settle bonds issued by the structure. The Group has previously issued a financial guarantee in relation to this, which is triggered if there is a shortfall in the property proceeds and the bonds cannot be fully repaid. The guarantee is up to \u00a3300 million.\n\nThe current property valuations indicate that there is significant headroom and therefore no shortfall.\n\nIn the event of a delay in the property negotiations, meaning the bond repayment is due before the properties have been sold, the guarantee will be called upon in full. In such an event, once the properties are sold, Sainsbury's will recover the guarantee payment in full from the property proceeds.\n\n## Significant judgement - lease terms\n\nThe inclusion of a lease extension period or lease break period in the lease term is a key judgement for the Group and considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise them. For leased properties, this includes the current and expected profitability of the respective site, as well as the length of time until the option can be exercised. Any changes to the Group's judgement over lease terms will impact both the right of use asset and lease liability.\n\nSet out below are the undiscounted future rental payments not currently included within the reported lease liability where lease extensions have not been included, or where lease breaks have been assumed:\n\n|                                                | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Extension options expected to not be exercised | 4,681     | 4,590     |\n| Lease breaks expected to be exercised          | 458       | 463       |",

Such properties include mall units, stores and units within stores. Where the Group subleases assets, the sublease classification is assessed with reference to the head lease right-of-use asset. This assessment considers, among other factors, whether the sublease represents the majority of the remaining life of the head lease. The ratio of rental income to head lease rental payments is used to determine how much of the right-of-use asset should be derecognised, or analysis of square foot leased in the headlease and sublease where appropriate. This assessment takes into consideration whether the sublease/headlease are above or below market rate.\n\nAmounts due from lessees under finance leases are recorded as a receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. This is initially calculated and recognised using the IBR prevalent in the underlying headlease at the recognition date. Any difference between the derecognised right-of-use asset and the newly recognised amounts due for leases under finance leases is recognised in the income statement. The Group recognises finance income over the lease term, reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the Group's net investment in the lease. Operating lease income is recognised as earned on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe below table sets out the maturity analysis of lease receivables classified as operating leases:\n\n|                                              |   2022 \u00a3m |   2021 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Less than one year                           |        18 |        17 |\n| One to two years                             |        16 |        15 |\n| Two to three years                           |        13 |        13 |\n| Three to four years                          |        11 |        11 |\n| Four to five years                           |        10 |         9 |\n| Five to ten years                            |        30 |        28 |\n| Ten to fifteen years                         |         9 |         8 |\n| More than fifteen years                      |        10 |        13 |\n| Total undiscounted lease payments receivable |       117 |       114 |\n\nThe net book value of property, plant and equipment subject to operating leases at year-end is not material to the accounts.\n\nThe below table sets out the maturity analysis of lease receivables classified as finance leases:\n\n|                                                                   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Contractual undiscounted cash flows                               |           |           |\n| Less than one year                                                | 7         | 7         |\n| One to five years                                                 | 36        | 26        |\n| More than five years                                              | 5         | 15        |\n| Total undiscounted net investment in lease receivable             | 48        | 48        |\n| Lease receivables included in the statement of financial position | 41        | 34        |\n| Current                                                           | 5         | 5         |\n| Non-current                                                       | 36        | 29        |\n\n## 16 Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## a) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group's share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and again whenever indicators of impairment are detected and is carried at cost less any provision for impairment.\n\n## b) Computer software\n\nComputer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment. Externally acquired computer software and software licences are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to fifteen years. Costs relating to development of computer software for internal use are capitalised once the recognition criteria of IAS 38, 'Intangible Assets' are met. Other development expenditures that do not meet these criteria are expensed as incurred. When the software is available for its intended use, these costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives of five to fifteen years within administrative expenses.",

Typically such arrangements involve ongoing licence fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, as well as upfront costs incurred to configure or customise the SaaS solution.\n\nConfiguration and customisation costs are capitalised in the following instances as intangible assets:\n\n- - The Group has both a contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without significant penalty, and the ability to run the software independently of the host vendor.\n- - The costs incurred meet the definition of and recognition criteria for an intangible asset. This includes for example the development of software code that enhances or modifies, or creates additional capability to, existing systems controlled by Sainsbury's.\n\nWhere these conditions are not met, costs incurred to configure or customise, and the ongoing fees to obtain access to the cloud provider's application software, are recognised as operating expenses when the services are received.\n\nWhere the configuration or customisation of a SaaS solution is performed by the SaaS vendor, consideration is given to whether this activity is distinct from the provision of the solution itself. This assessment considers the nature of the activities, and whether Sainsbury's can benefit from any of the services in isolation. Where the activity is not considered distinct, the costs are capitalised as a prepayment and amortised over the expected useful life of the solution.\n\n## d)  Acquired intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Intangible assets with finite useful economic lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, ranging from five to ten years, within administrative expenses.\n\nRefer to note 17 for details of impairment policies.\n\n|                                         | Goodwill \u00a3m   | Computer  software \u00a3m   | Acquired  brands \u00a3m   | Customer  relationships \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| Cost                                    |               |                         |                       |                              |            |\n| At 7 March 2021                         | 394           | 899                     | 229                   | 32                           | 1,554      |\n| Additions                               | -             | 278                     | -                     | -                            | 278        |\n| Disposals 1                             | (2)           | (100)                   | -                     | -                            | (102)      |\n| At 5 March 2022                         | 392           | 1,077                   | 229                   | 32                           | 1,730      |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment |               |                         |                       |                              |            |\n| At 7 March 2021                         | 28            | 457                     | 127                   | 28                           | 640        |\n| Amortisation expense for the year       | -             | 129                     | 20                    | 2                            | 151        |\n| Disposals                               | (2)           | (65)                    | -                     | -                            | (67)       |\n| At 5 March 2022                         | 26            | 521                     | 147                   | 30                           | 724        |\n| Net book value at 5 March 2022          | 366           | 556                     | 82                    | 2                            | 1,006      |\n| Cost                                    |               |                         |                       |                              |            |\n| At 8 March 2020                         | 400           | 749                     | 231                   | 32                           | 1,412      |\n| Additions                               | -             | 172                     | -                     | -                            | 172        |\n| Disposals                               | (6)           | (22)                    | (2)                   | -                            | (30)       |\n| At 6 March 2021                         | 394           | 899                     | 229                   | 32                           | 1,554      |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairment |               |                         |                       |                              |            |\n| At 8 March 2020                         | 22            | 281                     | 109                   | 26                           | 438        |\n| Amortisation expense for the year       | -             | 114                     | 20                    | 2                            | 136        |\n| Impairment loss for the year            | 12            | 84                      | -                     | -                            | 96         |\n| Disposals                               | (6)           | (22)                    | (2)                   | -                            | (30)       |\n| At 6 March 2021                         | 28            | 457                     | 127                   | 28                           | 640        |\n| Net book value at 6 March 2021          | 366           | 442                     | 102                   | 4                            | 914        |\n\n- 1 Disposals include write offs of software-as-a-service balances as disclosed in note 2.\n\nGoodwill balances are detailed in note 17.",

The carrying value of the CGU containing the goodwill is compared to the recoverable amount, which is the higher of value in use and the fair value less costs to dispose. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not subsequently reversed.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets, and finite-lived intangible assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment (PPE), right-of-use assets, and finite-lived intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset, being the higher of its fair value less costs to dispose and its value in use, is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cashgenerating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount and an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhere there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount and an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, not to exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years. An impairment loss reversal is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Identification of cash-generating units\n\n## Retail\n\nCash generating units are deemed to be each trading store, store pipeline development site or in certain cases for Argos, a cluster of stores.\n\nPPE, intangible assets and right-of-use assets are allocated to the store CGU they are associated with. For leased assets, the CGU also includes corresponding lease liabilities as management has concluded that lease liabilities need to be considered when determining the recoverable amount of the CGU. For non-store assets, including depots and IT assets, these are allocated to a group of CGUs (i.e. the Sainsbury's or Argos store CGUs that they support).\n\nGoodwill recognised on acquisition of retail chains of stores (Bells and Jacksons) is allocated to its respective store CGUs. Goodwill arising on the purchase of Home Retail Group is allocated to the Argos group of store and non-store CGUs. Nectar is a separate CGU.\n\n## Financial Services\n\nCash generating units are deemed to be each respective product or product group that is capable of generating cash flows independent of other products. Non-product assets are reviewed separately as collective CGUs with the products that they support.\n\nGoodwill arising on the purchase of Sainsbury's Bank plc is allocated to the Financial Services collective CGUs.\n\n## Review for indicators of impairment\n\nAt the year-end reporting date, the Group assessed whether indicators of impairment existed within its Retail and Financial Services CGUs. It was concluded that no indicators of impairment existed within either segment.\n\nEqually, consideration was given as to whether there had been any changes in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of assets (excluding goodwill) which had previously been impaired. No changes were identified and therefore no impairment loss reversals have been recognised.\n\n## Impairments recognised as part of restructuring programme\n\nWhilst no indicators of impairment have been identified, impairments of \u00a39 million have been recognised in relation to restructuring activities as disclosed in note 5.\n\n## Climate change considerations\n\nThe Group's scenario analysis performed as part of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report (refer to page 17) identified that the four most material climate-related risks were drought, flooding, carbon taxes and changes in consumer preferences. Produce, Clothing, Meat, Fish and Poultry (MFP), Dairy and Fuel were the product categories most exposed to the climate-related risks.\n\nChanges in consumer preferences in MFP was identified as the risk most vulnerable to transitional risks and modelling this risk in isolation to 2030 in a 1.5\u00b0C scenario, assuming no actions are taken to mitigate risks, calculated a \u00a3300 million to \u00a3350 million loss in revenue. The potential financial impact of climate-related physical risks on selected Produce in isolation to 2050 in a 4.3\u00b0C scenario calculated a \u00a360 million to \u00a375 million loss in revenue. The Group assessed the effect such losses would have on the recoverable amount of the Retail segment's store CGUs, and no material impairments were noted. As such, climate-related risks did not have a material impact on the Group's impairment considerations at the reporting date.",

They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Equity investments have been irrevocably designated as fair value through other comprehensive income. Subsequent to initial recognition at fair value plus transaction costs, these assets are recorded at fair value at each period end with the movements recognised in other comprehensive income until derecognition or impaired. On derecognition, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income reserves is recognised in the income statement for debt instruments. Gains and losses on equity instruments are never recycled to the income statement. Dividends on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement when the entity's right to receive payment is established.\n\nInterest on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income debt instruments is recognised using the effective interest method.\n\n|                                                  | 52 weeks to   5 March   2022 \u00a3m   | 52 weeks to   6 March   2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Non-current                                      |                                   |                                   |\n| Equity                                           |                                   |                                   |\n| Other financial assets                           | 382                               | 306                               |\n| Debt                                             |                                   |                                   |\n| Interest bearing financial assets                | -                                 | 1                                 |\n| Financial Services related investment securities | 222                               | 447                               |\n|                                                  | 604                               | 754                               |\n| Current                                          |                                   |                                   |\n| Debt                                             |                                   |                                   |\n| Financial Services related investment securities | 196                               | 90                                |\n|                                                  | 800                               | 844                               |\n\nThe other financial asset predominantly represents the Group's beneficial interest in a commercial property investment pool.

The programmes act as an alternative source of financing for suppliers who have the option to trade their invoices with funding providers in order to receive cash earlier than the invoice due dates. The payment terms offered to suppliers who are party to the supply chain finance programmes are within standard supplier payment terms and agreed directly between the Group and the supplier.\n\nBalances outstanding under the supplier financing arrangements are classified as trade payables, and cash flows are included in operating cash flows, since the financing arrangements are agreed between the supplier, the funding providers and the third-party platform providers. The Group does not provide additional credit enhancement nor obtain any working capital benefit from the arrangements.\n\nIncluded in trade payables at 5 March 2022 are amounts of \u00a3355 million (6 March 2021: \u00a3349 million) drawn by suppliers who are party to the supply chain finance programmes.",

Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due to passage of time is recognised as interest expense.\n\n## Property provisions\n\nWhere the Group no longer operates from a leased property, onerous property contract provisions are recognised for the least net cost of exiting from the contract. Unless a separate exit agreement with a landlord has already been agreed, the Group's policy is that this onerous contract provision includes all unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations of the contract. The amounts provided are based on the Group's best estimates of the likely committed outflows and site closure dates. These provisions do not include rent in accordance with IFRS 16, however do include unavoidable costs related to the lease such as service charges and insurance. These provisions historically included business rates, however business rates are considered a statutory obligation rather than a contractual one, and are therefore now recognised as a periodic cost in line with IFRIC 21 'Levies'. Prior period comparatives have been restated to remove business rates from previously recognised property provisions. Refer to note 2 for further details.\n\nProperty provisions also include provisions for dilapidations which are recognised where the Group has the obligation to make-good its leased properties. These provisions are recognised based on historically settled dilapidations which form the basis of the estimated future cash outflows. Any difference between amounts expected to be settled and the actual cash outflow will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.\n\nWhere the Group is able to exit lease contracts before the expiry date or agree sublets, this results in the release of any associated property provisions. Such events are subject to the agreement of landlords, therefore the Group makes no assumptions on the ability to either exit or sublet a property until a position is agreed.\n\n## Insurance provisions\n\nThe provision relates to the Group's outstanding insurance claims liabilities in relation to public and employer's liability claims, and third-party motor claims. Claims provisions are based on assumptions regarding past claims experience and on assessments by an independent actuary and are intended to provide a best estimate of the most likely or expected outcome.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nA restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring.\n\nThe charge for the year mostly comprises redundancy payments as part of Argos store closures, depot closures, and caf\u00e9 and food counter closures announced during the year as detailed in note 5.",

The provision represents management's best estimate of future costs.

Thus there is inherently an element of estimation uncertainty within the provisions recognised by the Group. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.\n\nThe provisions are most sensitive to estimates of the future cash outflows. The following table summarises the impact that a reasonable possible change in the cash outflow assumptions when estimating provisions would have had on the amounts recognised during the year.\n\n|                                 | Increase/(decrease) in provisions recognised   | Increase/(decrease) in provisions recognised   | Increase/(decrease) in provisions recognised   | Increase/(decrease) in provisions recognised   | Increase/(decrease) in provisions recognised   |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | Property  provisions                           | Insurance  provisions                          | Restructuring                                  | Other  provisions                              | Total                                          |\n| Increase in cash outflows of 5% | 7                                              | 3                                              | 1                                              | 1                                              | 12                                             |\n| Decrease in cash outflows of 5% | (7)                                            | (3)                                            | (1)                                            | (1)                                            | (12)                                           |\n\nSensitivities on Financial Services ECL provisions are included in note 30, therefore not included in the above.",

Accordingly any periodic returns are accounted for as dividends and recognised directly in equity at the time it becomes obligated to pay the periodic return. Any associated tax impacts are recognised in the income statement as this is where the distributable profits were generated in line with IAS 12 'Income Taxes'.\n\nOn 30 July 2015 the Group issued \u00a3250 million of perpetual subordinated capital securities and \u00a3250 million of perpetual subordinated convertible bonds, collectively known as perpetual securities. Costs directly associated with the issue of \u00a36 million were offset against the value of the proceeds. The perpetual securities have no fixed redemption date. Holders of the perpetual securities do not benefit from any put option rights.\n\nIn the prior year, the Group redeemed the \u00a3250 million perpetual subordinated capital securities, at the first call date on 30 July 2020.\n\nIn the current year, the Group redeemed the \u00a3250 million perpetual convertible bonds. Of these, \u00a3240 million were converted to shares on 23 July 2021, resulting in the creation of 91 million new shares. The remaining were redeemed.\n\n|                                                                     | Perpetual  capital  securities \u00a3m   | Perpetual  convertible  bonds \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| At 7 March 2021                                                     | -                                   | 248                                |\n| Redemption of perpetual convertible bonds                           | -                                   | (240)                              |\n| Repayment of perpetual convertible bonds                            | -                                   | (8)                                |\n| At 5 March 2022                                                     | -                                   | -                                  |\n| At 8 March 2020                                                     | 248                                 | 248                                |\n| Distributions to holders of perpetual securities                    | -                                   | (7)                                |\n| Redemption of perpetual capital securities                          | (248)                               | -                                  |\n| Profit for the year attributable to holders of perpetual securities | -                                   | 7                                  |\n| At 6 March 2021                                                     | -                                   | 248                                |",

The risk management policies are designed to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance by identifying financial exposures and setting appropriate risk limits and controls. The risk management policies also ensure sufficient liquidity is available to the Group to meet foreseeable financial obligations and that cash assets are invested safely.\n\nFinancial risk management with respect to Financial Services is separately managed within the Financial Services' governance structure.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group may be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.\n\nThe principal operational cash flow of the Group is largely stable and predictable reflecting the low business risk profile of the food retail sector and the cyclical profile of the non-food retail sector. Cash flow forecasts are produced to assist management in identifying future liquidity requirements. The Group's liquidity policy sets a minimum funding headroom of \u00a3400 million in excess of forecast funding requirements over a rolling 12 month time horizon. The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining a core of long-dated borrowings, pre-funding future cash flow commitments and holding contingent committed credit facilities.\n\nThe Group's committed \u00a31,394 million Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn at 5 March 2022. The facility is provided by a syndicate of 16 banking partners. The Group has no financial covenants. The facility is split into two Facilities, a \u00a3300 million Facility (A) and a \u00a31,094 million Facility (B). Facility A has a final maturity of April 2025 and Facility B has a final maturity of October 2024.",

Where balances are contractually repayable on demand, behavioural assumptions are applied to estimate the interest payable on those balances. These are shown as due within one year.\n- 3 The swap rate that matches the remaining term of the interest rate swaps as at 5 March 2022 has been used to calculate the floating rate cash flows over the life of the interest rate swaps shown above (2021: 6 March 2021).\n- 4 Cash flows in foreign currencies have been translated using spot rates as at 5 March 2022 and 6 March 2021.\n- 5 Cash flows relating to debt bearing a floating interest rate have been calculated using prevailing interest rates as at 6 March 2021.\n\n## Financial Services\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that Sainsbury's Bank and its subsidiaries (the Bank) cannot meet its payment obligations as they fall due, or can only do so at excessive cost. The Bank seeks to ensure that financial obligations can be met at all times, even under liquidity stress conditions.\n\nThe annual Internal Liquidity Adequacy Assessment Process (ILAAP) enables the Bank to:\n\n- (1)  Identify and assess its most relevant liquidity risk drivers;\n- (2)  Quantify its liquidity needs under various stress scenarios; and\n- (3)  Put in place appropriate limits and controls to mitigate liquidity risks.",

Long-term and short-term forecasts are prepared to assess liquidity requirements, taking into account factors such as ATM cash management, contractual maturities and customer deposit patterns (stable or less stable deposits) as well as outflows regarding undrawn commitments. These reports support daily liquidity management, with early warning indicators reviewed on a daily basis and appropriate triggers for escalation and action in line with risk appetite, Liquidity and Funding Policy and Liquidity Contingency Plan. Asset encumbrance ratios and risk indicators for wholesale funding concentrations by type (total/secured/unsecured), maturity, sector, geography and counterparty are also regularly monitored and reported to the Asset-Liability Committee (ALCO).\n\n## Asset encumbrance\n\n|                                      | 2022                                         | 2022                                                                    | 2021                                        | 2021                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      | Carrying   value of  encumbered   assets  \u00a3m | Matching  liabilities,  contingent  liabilities or  securities lent  \u00a3m | Carrying   value of  encumbered  assets  \u00a3m | Matching  liabilities,  contingent  liabilities or  securities lent  \u00a3m |\n| Loans and advances to customers      | 1,365                                        | 885                                                                     | 1,596                                       | 1,110                                                                   |\n| Debt securities                      | 157                                          | 75                                                                      | 27                                          | -                                                                       |\n| Other assets                         | 40                                           | 27                                                                      | 76                                          | 27                                                                      |\n| Cash and balances with central banks | 15                                           | -                                                                       | 17                                          | -                                                                       |\n\nThe primary sources of encumbrance in the Bank relate to margin requirements for derivative transactions and collateral relating to secured funding transactions. Cash collateral is advanced and received as variation margin on derivative transactions, whilst eligible treasury assets (primarily Gilts and Treasury bills) are pledged as collateral for initial margin requirements on derivatives which are centrally cleared. Eligible personal loans and mortgages, with applicable haircuts, are used as collateral for Bank of England funding facilities, including the Term Funding Scheme (TFS), the Term Funding Scheme with additional incentives for SMEs (TFSME) and Indexed Long-Term Repo (ILTR) facilities.\n\n## Credit risk\n\n## a. Retail credit risk management\n\nCounterparty credit risk is the risk of a financial loss arising from counterparty default or non-performance in respect of the Group's holdings of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial assets, deposits with banks, investments in marketable securities, trade and other receivables and loans and advances to customers.\n\nSpecifically within Financial Services, retail credit risk is the possibility of losses arising from a retail customer failing to meet their agreed repayment terms as they fall due under mortgage, unsecured personal loan, credit card or store card arrangements. The Financial Services division utilises automated scorecards to assess the credit worthiness and affordability criteria of new applicants and ongoing behavioural characteristics of existing customers. The outcome from all scorecard models are monitored utilising a set of credit quality metrics to ensure actual performance is in line with agreed expectations. Additional expert underwriting of credit applications is undertaken by a specialist operational team where further consideration is appropriate.\n\nThe Retail Credit Risk Committee of Sainsbury's Bank provides portfolio oversight control over credit strategy to maintain lending in line with the Board approved risk appetite, with additional oversight and control provided by the Executive Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee. Internal Audit provide additional assurance by undertaking regular reviews on the adequacy of credit risk policies and procedures.\n\n## b. Wholesale and derivative credit risk management\n\nThe Group (excluding Financial Services) sets counterparty limits for each of its banking and investment counterparties based on their credit ratings. The minimum long-term credit rating accepted by the Group is BBB- (Standard & Poor's and Fitch) or Baa3 (Moody's) or, in the case of sterling liquidity funds, AAA or Aaa/MR1+ from Moody's. In the event of a split credit rating, the lower rating applies.\n\nThe table below analyses the Group's cash and cash equivalents by credit exposure excluding bank balances, store cash, cash in transit and cash at ATMs.\n\n| Counterparty                                   | Long-term rating   | Group  2022  \u00a3m   |   Group  2021  \u00a3m |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Financial institutions - Money market deposits | AAAm/Aaa           | -                 |               198 |\n| Financial institutions - Money market deposits | AA+/Aa1 to A/A2    | 25                |               200 |\n| Deposits at central banks                      | AA+/Aa1            | 234               |               852 |\n\nThe table below analyses the fair value of the Group's derivative financial assets by credit exposure, excluding any collateral held.\n\n| Counterparty                | Long-term rating   |   Group  2022  \u00a3m | Group  2021  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps         | AA+/Aa1 to A/A2    |                35 | 1                 |\n| Inflation rate swaps        | AA+/Aa1 to A/A2    |                 5 | -                 |\n| FX forward contracts        | AA+/Aa1 to A/A2    |                46 | 2                 |\n| Commodity forward contracts | AA+/Aa1 to A/A2    |                25 | 4                 |",

        "page_content": "## 30 Financial risk management continued\n\nThe Bank's treasury portfolio is held primarily for liquidity management purposes and in the case of derivatives, for the purpose of managing market risk. The liquidity portfolio is invested in eligible investment securities that qualify for the regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and internal Operational Liquidity Pool (OLP). These investments include the Bank of England's (BoE) reserve account, UK Government securities (gilts or Treasury bills), multilateral development bank securities, government guaranteed agency securities, UK regulated covered bond programmes and asset backed securities.\n\nLimits are established for all counterparty and asset class exposures based on their respective credit quality and market liquidity. Consideration is also given to geographical region and the strength of relevant sovereign credit ratings. Derivatives are subject to the same credit risk control procedures as are applied to other wholesale market instruments and the credit risk arising from mark to market derivative valuations is mitigated by daily margin calls, posting cash collateral to cover exposures. Daily monitoring is undertaken by the Bank's Treasury department, including early warning indicators with appropriate triggers for escalation.\n\n## c.

These are not considered contractual commitments but, because in practice Financial Services does not expect to withdraw these credit limits from customers, they are within the scope of impairment provisioning.\n\n## d. Impairment of financial assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nImpairments on financial assets are accounted for using a 3-stage forward-looking expected credit loss (ECL) approach in line with IFRS 9. The Group is required to record an allowance for ECL for all loans and other debt financial assets not held at FVTPL, together with loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts.\n\nECLs are based on the difference between the cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. The expected cash flows will include cash flows from the sale of collateral held or other credit enhancements that are integral to the contractual terms.\n\nFor Financial Services portfolios of loans, such as credit card lending, scorecard lending and personal loans, impairment provisions are calculated for groups of assets, otherwise impairment is identified at a counterparty specific level. The allowance is calculated by reference to the estimated probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD).\n\n- - The probability of default represents the likelihood of a borrower defaulting within 12 months from the balance sheet date or within the expected lifetime of the borrower.\n- - Exposure at default represents the expected amount due from the borrower at the point of default by reference to exposure at the balance sheet date adjusted for expected future changes including repayments and utilisation of undrawn facilities.\n- - Loss given default represents the expected percentage loss at the point of default relative to the EAD. The estimate takes into account utilisation of any expected collections and recoveries strategies, debt sale arrangements and collateral.\n\n## ECL 3-stage model\n\n- - Stage 1 - Impairment allowance on financial assets that have not significantly increased in credit risk since origination, nor are credit impaired, is calculated using the probability that a borrower will default within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Interest income is recognised on the gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n- - Stage 2 - Where a financial asset exhibits a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) but is not yet considered to be credit impaired, the probability of default considered in the impairment allowance is based upon the lifetime probability of the borrower defaulting. Interest income continues to be recognised on the gross carrying value of the financial asset.\n- - Stage 3 - Assets considered to be credit impaired resulting from one or more events that have occurred that has resulted in a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. Stage 3 assets will continue to recognise lifetime expected impairment losses (with a 100 per cent probability of default) and interest income will be recognised on the net carrying amount (i.e. gross amount less impairment allowance).",

        "page_content": "## 30 Financial risk management continued\n\n## Significant increases in credit risk\n\nThe Group determines whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk by reference to quantitative thresholds, qualitative indicators and the backstop presumption that credit risk has significantly increased if contractual payments are more than 30 days past due.\n\nQuantitative thresholds have been determined that when the lifetime PD of an instrument as at the reporting date has increased to greater than a specified multiple of the origination lifetime PD, a significant increase in credit risk is deemed to have occurred.\n\nQualitative tests are based around the Group's credit origination policy rules for Financial Services customers. These rules are in place at account origination in order to decline accounts that may demonstrate risk factors outside of risk appetite that are not yet reflected in PD measures. At the reporting date, if an account satisfies any policy decline rules that it had not at the point of origination, it will be considered to have significantly increased in credit risk.\n\nThere is no probationary period applied in respect of accounts that cure from stage 2 to stage 1. Transfer criteria have been subject to extensive analysis to ensure that they appropriately reflect the flow of accounts from origination to default so as to maximise the number of accounts that flow through the stages and minimise accounts that jump from stage 1 to stage 3, or that fail to enter stage 3 from stage 2.\n\nThe Group has applied the low credit risk exemption in respect of its high quality treasury portfolio held for liquidity purposes. This exemption permits low credit risk debt securities (i.e. those considered investment grade) to remain in stage 1 without an assessment of significant increase in credit risk.\n\n## Definition of default\n\nThe Group's definition of default is used in determining those accounts classified as stage 3 (i.e. credit impaired). The Group has chosen not to rebut the backstop presumption prescribed by IFRS 9 that where an account is 90 days or more past its due date then default has occurred.\n\nThe Group has also defined a number of unlikeliness-to-pay criteria that result in an account being deemed to have defaulted. These include:\n\n- - Where operational collections activities have been exhausted on accounts that are less than 90 days past due and the account is subject to recoveries processes\n- - If any forbearance has been granted on the account (see forbearance definition in section h below)\n- - Where the customer is subject to insolvency proceedings\n- - Where the customer is deceased\n\nWhere an account no longer meets any of the default criteria, such as by bringing payments back up to date, the Group will continue to consider the account as being in default for a period of 24 months from the date when it last met the definition of default.\n\n## Write-off\n\nLoans and advances to customers are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when the Group determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to write-off.\n\nSubsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off result in impairment gains recorded in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\n## Expected lifetime\n\nFor the purposes of considering the lifetime probability of default, the expected lifetime of a financial asset is the contractual term where this is fixed within the contract, or in the case of revolving products such as credit cards a behavioural life is determined by reference to historic trends.\n\n## Modified financial assets\n\nWhen the contractual cash flows of a financial asset have been renegotiated or modified and the financial asset was not derecognised, its gross carrying amount is recalculated as the present value of the modified contractual cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate with a gain or loss recognised in the income statement.",

These commitments do not include undrawn limits on credit cards and store cards of \u00a38,777 million (2021: \u00a39,165 million). These are not considered contractual commitments but, because in practice Financial Services does not expect to withdraw these credit limits from customers, they are within the scope of impairment provisioning.\n\nAt the year-end, \u00a319 million of expected credit loss provisions are recognised in respect of off-balance sheet loan commitments and undrawn limits in line with IFRS 9 (2021: \u00a315 million).\n\n## Credit quality per class of loans and advances\n\nThe Group defines the following classifications for all loans and advances to customers: High, Satisfactory, Low and Credit impaired. These are segmented by 12 month probability of default (PD) under IFRS 9.",

Significant estimate - macro-economic scenarios\n\nIFRS 9 requires that the measurement of ECL should reflect an unbiased and probability weighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of forward-looking economic assumptions. The Group has engaged an external supplier to provide economic forecasts which are subject to review, challenge and approval through the Bank's governance processes.\n\nFor the year ended 5 March 2022 the economic scenarios have been updated to include a reduction in unemployment rates as a result of improved economic conditions albeit this is offset by increased inflation/CPI rates which is having a notable impact on the cost of living.\n\nThe ECL models utilise 4 scenarios (2021: 4 scenarios) including a 'base case' scenario considered to be the most likely outcome together with an upside, downside scenario and severe downside. The base case has been assigned a probability weighting of 45% with the upside, downside and severe downside scenarios weighted 35%, 15%, 5% respectively (2021: base scenario 40%; upside, downside and severe downside scenarios weighted 30%, 25%, 5% respectively).",

Management overlays\n\nIn the context of IFRS 9, management overlays are short-term increases or decreases to the ECL at either a customer or portfolio level to account for items that have not been fully reflected in the existing models.\n\nInternal governance is in place to regularly monitor management overlays and to reduce the reliance on management overlays through model recalibration or redevelopment, as appropriate.\n\nManagement overlays applied in estimating the reported ECL at 5 March 2022 are set out in the following table. The table includes adjustments in relation to data and model limitations resulting from economic uncertainty related to the ongoing recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. It shows the adjustments applicable to the scenario weighted ECL numbers.\n\n| Movement in ECL      | At 5 March   2022 \u00a3m   |   At 6 March   2021 \u00a3m |\n|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Economic adjustment  | 10                     |                     21 |\n| PD adjustment        | -                      |                     10 |\n| LGD adjustment       | -                      |                      9 |\n| Operational overlays | 5                      |                      2 |\n| Total                | 15                     |                     42 |\n\nThe proportion of management overlay is 9 per cent of the total ECL provision as at 5 March 2022 (2021: 16 per cent).\n\nThe Economic adjustment is included where management judge the underlying models do not respond adequately to the economic scenarios. As a result of COVID-19 there remains uncertainty over the levels of defaults that may arise following the cessation of government assistance schemes, and inflation is an emerging concern as markets re-open.\n\nThe majority of the Operational overlays relate to model or data limitations that are manually corrected, whilst a permanent fix is being developed.\n\n## g. Collateral relating to loans and advances to customers\n\nMortgages held over residential properties represent the only collateral held by the Group for retail exposures. The market value of collateral held for impaired loans and loans past due but not impaired was \u00a323 million (2021: \u00a326 million). The fair value of collateral held against possession cases was \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil).\n\nAn analysis by loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of the Group's residential mortgage lending is presented below. The value of collateral used in determining the LTV ratios has been estimated based upon the last actual valuation, adjusted to take into account subsequent movements in house prices.\n\n| At 5 March 2022   | Stage 1 \u00a3m   | Stage 2 \u00a3m   | Stage 3 \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Less than 70%     | 607          | 57           | 8            | 672         |\n| 70% to 80%        | 102          | 2            | 1            | 105         |\n| 80% to 90%        | 4            | 1            | -            | 5           |\n| 90% to 100%       | -            | -            | -            | -           |\n| Greater than 100% | -            | -            | -            | -           |\n| Total mortgages   | 713          | 60           | 9            | 782         |\n\n| At 6 March 2021   | Stage 1 \u00a3m   | Stage 2 \u00a3m   | Stage 3 \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|\n| Less than 70%     | 795          | 37           | 8            | 840         |\n| 70% to 80%        | 265          | 7            | 2            | 274         |\n| 80% to 90%        | 128          | 3            | 1            | 132         |\n| 90% to 100%       | 1            | -            | -            | 1           |\n| Greater than 100% | -            | -            | -            | -           |\n| Total mortgages   | 1,189        | 47           | 11           | 1,247       |",

Forbearance is defined as relief granted by a lender to assist customers in financial difficulty, through arrangements which temporarily allow the customer to pay an amount other than the contractual amounts due. These temporary arrangements may be initiated by the customer or the Group where financial difficulty would prevent repayment within the original terms and conditions of the contract.\n\nThe main aim of forbearance is to support customers in returning to a position where they are able to meet their contractual obligations.\n\nThe Group has well defined forbearance policies and processes. A number of forbearance options are made available to customers. These include arrangements to repay arrears over a period of time by making payments above the contractual amount, that ensure the loan is repaid within the original repayment term and short-term concessions, where the borrower is allowed to make reduced repayments (or in exceptional circumstances, no repayments) on a temporary basis to assist with short-term financial hardship.\n\nThe table below details the values of secured and unsecured advances that are subject to the Group's forbearance programmes:\n\n|           | 2022                                                 | 2022                                              | 2022                                           | 2021                                                 | 2021                                             | 2021                                           |\n|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|           | Gross loans  and advances subject to  forbearance \u00a3m | Forbearance  as a total of  loans and  advances % | Forbearance covered by impairment  provision % | Gross loans and  advances subject to  forbearance \u00a3m | Forbearance  as a total of loans and  advances % | Forbearance covered by impairment  provision % |\n| Unsecured | 52                                                   | 1.2                                               | 72.0                                           | 130                                                  | 3.0                                              | 43.8                                           |\n| Secured   | 2                                                    | 0.3                                               | 25.7                                           | 4                                                    | 0.3                                              | 24.6                                           |\n| Total     | 54                                                   | 1.0                                               | 70.1                                           | 134                                                  | 2.4                                              | 43.3                                           |\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange and commodity exposures, and interest rate swap contracts to hedge interest rate exposures. The use of financial derivatives is governed by Board approved policies which prohibit the use of derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\n## a. Foreign currency risk\n\nCurrency risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in exchange rates impacting the Group's foreign currency denominated supply contracts.\n\nThe Group's currency risk policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on the Group's income statement by requiring highly probable foreign currency cash flows to be hedged. Highly probable foreign currency cash flows, which may be either contracted or un-contracted, are hedged on a layered basis using foreign currency forward contracts.\n\nThe Group has exposure to currency risk on balances held in foreign currency denominated bank accounts, which may arise due to short-term timing differences on maturing hedges and underlying supplier payments.\n\nThe Group considers that a 10 per cent movement in exchange rates against sterling is a reasonable measure of volatility. The impact of a 10 per cent movement in the exchange rate of US dollar and euro versus sterling as at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant, is summarised in the table below:\n\n| Group   | 2022  Change in  exchange rate  impact on  post-tax   profit   +/-10%  \u00a3m   | 2022   Change in  exchange rate  impact on cash  flow hedge  reserve  +/-10%  \u00a3m   | 2021 Change in  exchange rate  impact on  post-tax   profit   +/-10%  \u00a3m   | 2021  Change in  exchange rate  impact on cash  flow hedge  reserve  +/-10%  \u00a3m   |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| USD/GBP | 3/(3)                                                                       | (115)/141                                                                          | 3/(4)                                                                      | (112)/137                                                                         |\n| EUR/GBP | 3/(3)                                                                       | (29)/36                                                                            | 3/(3)                                                                      | (27)/33                                                                           |\n\n## Financial Services\n\nThe Bank is exposed to FX risk through its holding of cash denominated in foreign currencies, primarily Euro and US Dollar, within its travel money bureaux in J Sainsbury's stores. The FX positions are hedged on a regular basis. Furthermore a US dollar deposit is held with MasterCard. This exposure is also hedged.\n\n## b. Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of increased costs or lower income arising from unexpected movements in interest rates and inflation rates impacting the Group's borrowing and investment portfolios. The Group's interest rate policy seeks to limit the impact of fluctuating interest and inflation rates by maintaining a diversified mix of fixed rate, floating rate and variable capped rate liabilities.\n\nInterest on financial instruments is classified as fixed rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings are less frequent than once every 12 months. Interest on financial instruments is classified as floating rate if interest re-sets on the borrowings occur every 12 months or more frequently. Floating rate instruments are considered variable capped rate if the nominal interest rate is subject to a cap.",

Hedging strategies are implemented and reviewed to ensure the Bank remains within its limits.\n\nIn order to measure the exposure to interest rate risk the Bank adopts a Capital at Risk ('CaR') approach to assess the value sensitivity of the Bank's capital to movements in interest rates under various interest rates shock scenarios, as well as via an annual earnings at risk metric which measures the sensitivity of the Bank's earnings to movements in interest rates over a 12 month period. The CaR measure is an aggregate measure of five separate risk components, each being a distinct form of interest rate risk including repricing risk, basis risk, prepayment risk, MTM risk and credit spread risk.\n\n## c. Commodity risk\n\nCommodity risk is the risk of increased costs arising from unexpected movements in commodity prices impacting the Group's own use consumption of electricity, gas and diesel. The Group hedges own use consumption of electricity and gas with forward purchases under flexible purchasing arrangements with its suppliers as well as power purchase agreements for electricity. The Group uses a combination of purchasing agreements and financial derivatives to hedge fuel exposures on a layered basis using contracts for difference. See note 32 for derivative disclosures.\n\n## Capital risk management\n\nThe Group defines capital as net assets (excluding the pension deficit/surplus) less net debt.\n\nThe Board's capital objective is to maintain a strong and efficient capital base to support the Group's strategic objectives, provide optimal returns for shareholders and safeguard the Group's status as a going concern. There has been no change to capital risk management policies during the year.\n\nThe Board monitors a broad range of financial metrics including return on capital employed, balance sheet gearing and fixed charge cover.\n\nThe Board can manage the Group's capital structure by diversifying the debt portfolio, adjusting the size and timing of dividends paid to shareholders, recycling capital through sale and leaseback transactions, issuing new shares or repurchasing shares in the open market and flexing capital expenditure.\n\nFrom time-to-time the Company purchases its own shares in the market for the purpose of issuing shares under the Group's share option programmes however the Group does not operate a defined share buy-back plan.\n\nWhilst there are no repeating financial covenants, part of the Group's capital risk management is to ensure compliance with the general covenants included in the Group's borrowing facilities. Examples of general covenants include restrictions on the permitted value of asset disposals and incremental secured indebtedness. In addition to there being no breaches of general covenants in the financial year ended 5 March 2022, there is healthy headroom within all general covenants as at 5 March 2022.\n\nInformation relating to Financial Services capital risk management is detailed below.\n\n## Financial Services capital resources (unaudited)\n\nThe following table analyses the regulatory capital resources under CRD IV. From a prudential perspective, Sainsbury's Bank is monitored and supervised on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary, Home Retail Group Card Services Limited, from the point of acquisition of Argos Financial Services in September 2016. The Bank has obtained an individual consolidation waiver from the PRA, which allows the Bank to monitor its capital position on a consolidated basis only. Therefore, the capital position shown below is on a regulatory consolidated basis.\n\nThe Bank implemented IFRS 9, effective 1 March 2018. The following table analyses the regulatory capital resources under CRD IV and aligns to the phase-in approach of IFRS 9 impacts on capital, over a 5-year period. The current year transitional data also includes adjustments introduced to mitigate against the impact of COVID-19, reflecting an additional benefit received for ECL increases.\n\n|                                       | Transitional  2022 IFRS 9  \u00a3m   | Full impact  2022 IFRS 9  \u00a3m   | Transitional  2021 IFRS 9  \u00a3m   | Full impact  2021 IFRS 9  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital: |                                 |                                |                                 |                                |\n| Ordinary share capital                | 701                             | 701                            | 901                             | 901                            |\n| Allowable reserves                    | 126                             | 126                            | (44)                            | (44)                           |\n| Regulatory adjustments                | (142)                           | (180)                          | (66)                            | (131)                          |\n| Tier 1 capital                        | 685                             | 647                            | 791                             | 726                            |\n| Tier 2 capital (loan notes - listed)  | 109                             | 109                            | 120                             | 119                            |\n| Total capital                         | 794                             | 756                            | 911                             | 845                            |\n\nRegulatory capital is calculated under the Capital Requirements Regulations and Capital Requirements Directive (collectively known as CRD IV) incorporating CRR2 changes that are effective from 1 January 2022 and aligns to the phase-in approach of IFRS 9 impacts on capital, over a 5-year period from 1 March 2018, as enacted in the UK.

This assessment is referred to as the SPPI test and is performed at an instrument level.\n\nThe business model assessment reflects how the Group manages the risks relating to the underlying financial assets, including whether the Group's principal objective is to collect the contractual cash flows arising from the instruments (amortised cost), to sell the financial instruments (FVTPL) or a combination thereof (FVOCI).",

For the Group this includes cash, receivables and amounts due from financial services customers and other banks. The Group has no intention of trading these assets. With the exception of trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component, the Group initially measures these financial assets at fair value plus transaction costs. Subsequently these assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment using the effective interest rate method. Income from these financial assets is calculated on an effective interest rate basis and is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nAccounting policies are detailed in note 18.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss\n\nThe Group's derivatives are classified as fair value through profit or loss. They are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value with net changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the contractual cash flows from the asset have expired or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.\n\n## b) Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group recognises all of its financial liabilities at amortised cost and all derivative financial liabilities are classified as FVTPL. Financial liabilities costs, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.\n\nInterest-bearing bank loans, overdrafts, other deposits and amounts due to Sainsbury's Bank customers are recorded initially at fair value, which is generally the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled, or expires.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities by category\n\nSet out below are the accounting classification of each class of financial assets and liabilities as at 5 March 2022 and 6 March 2021.\n\n|                                                               | Amortised   cost  \u00a3m   | Fair value  through OCI  \u00a3m   | Fair value  through profit or loss  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                     | 825                    | -                             | -                                        | 825         |\n| Trade and other receivables                                   | 552                    | -                             | -                                        | 552         |\n| Amounts due from Financial Services customers and other banks | 5,189                  | -                             | -                                        | 5,189       |\n| Financial assets at FVOCI                                     | -                      | 800                           | -                                        | 800         |\n| Trade and other payables                                      | (4,218)                | -                             | -                                        | (4,218)     |\n| Borrowings                                                    | (761)                  | -                             | -                                        | (761)       |\n| Amounts due to Financial Services customers and banks         | (5,259)                | -                             | -                                        | (5,259)     |\n| Derivative financial instruments                              | -                      | -                             | 259                                      | 259         |\n| Lease liabilities                                             | (6,621)                | -                             | -                                        | (6,621)     |\n| At 5 March 2022                                               | (10,293)               | 800                           | 259                                      | (9,234)     |\n\n| Restated                                              | Amortised   cost  \u00a3m   | Fair value  through OCI  \u00a3m   | Fair value  through profit or loss  \u00a3m   | Total  \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| Cash and cash equivalents                             | 1,575                  | -                             | -                                        | 1,575       |\n| Trade and other receivables                           | 609                    | -                             | -                                        | 609         |\n| Amounts due from Financial Services customers         | 5,407                  | -                             | -                                        | 5,407       |\n| Financial assets at FVOCI                             | -                      | 844                           | -                                        | 844         |\n| Trade and other payables                              | (4,102)                | -                             | -                                        | (4,102)     |\n| Borrowings                                            | (1,104)                | -                             | -                                        | (1,104)     |\n| Amounts due to Financial Services customers and banks | (6,289)                | -                             | -                                        | (6,289)     |\n| Derivative financial instruments                      | -                      | -                             | (124)                                    | (124)       |\n| Lease liabilities                                     | (5,834)                | -                             | -                                        | (5,834)     |\n| At 6 March 2021                                       | (9,738)                | 844                           | (124)                                    | (9,018)     |",

The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are based on prices available from the market on which the instruments are traded. Where market values are not available, the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates. The fair values of short-term deposits, trade receivables, other receivables, overdrafts and payables and lease liabilities are assumed to approximate to their book values.\n\n| At 5 March 2022                                             | Carrying  amount \u00a3m   | Group fair   value \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n| Financial assets                                            |                       |                         |\n| Amounts due from Financial Services customers 1             | 5,189                 | 5,216                   |\n| Financial liabilities                                       |                       |                         |\n| Loans due 2031                                              | (575)                 | (717)                   |\n| Tier 2 capital due 2023                                     | (179)                 | (180)                   |\n| Amounts due to Financial Services customers and other banks | (5,259)               | (5,260)                 |\n\n| At 6 March 2021                                             | Carrying  amount \u00a3m   | Group fair  value \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| Financial assets                                            |                       |                        |\n| Amounts due from Financial Services customers 1             | 5,407                 | 5,418                  |\n| Financial liabilities                                       |                       |                        |\n| Loans due 2031                                              | (627)                 | (761)                  |\n| Bank loans due 2021                                         | (199)                 | (199)                  |\n| Tier 2 capital due 2023                                     | (179)                 | (183)                  |\n| Amounts due to Financial Services customers and other banks | (6,289)               | (6,298)                |\n\n- 1 Included within a portfolio fair value hedging relationship with \u00a33,235 million (2021: \u00a33,984 million) of interest rate swaps.\n\nThe fair value of the financial assets has been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and is within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy (see below for fair value hierarchy description). The fair value of financial liabilities have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and are within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are recognised at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable:\n\n- - Level 1 fair value measurements are derived from quoted market prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instrument on public exchanges;\n- - Level 2 fair value measurements are derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). The fair value of financial instruments is determined by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates; and\n- - Level 3 fair value measurements are derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).",

The net present value of the Group's interest in the various freehold reversions owned by the property investment pool has been derived by assuming a property growth rate of zero per cent per annum (2021: zero per cent) and a discount rate of seven per cent (2021: seven per cent) - see note 18. The sensitivity of this balance to changes of one per cent in the assumed rate of property rental growth and one per cent in the discount rate holding other assumptions constant is shown below:\n\n|                                                 | 2022  Change in  growth rate  +/-1.0%  \u00a3m   | 2022  Change in  discount rate  +/-1.0% \u00a3m   | 2021  Change in  growth rate  +/-1.0%  \u00a3m   | 2021  Change in  discount rate  +/-1.0% \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Financial instruments at fair value through OCI | 6/(6)                                       | (5)/5                                        | 9/(9)                                       | (6)/6                                        |\n\nThe Group has entered into several long-term fixed price Power Purchase agreements with independent producers. Included within derivative financial assets is \u00a3180 million (2021: \u00a36 million) relating to these agreements. The Group has entered into a new Power Purchase Agreement during the year, and this has been designated as a cash flow hedge.\n\nThe Group values its Power Purchase agreements as the net present value of the estimated future usage at the contracted fixed price less the market implied forward energy price discounted at the prevailing swap rate. The Group also makes an assumption regarding expected energy output based on the historical performance and the producer's estimate of expected electricity output. The sensitivity of this balance to changes of 20 per cent in the assumed rate of energy output and 20 per cent in the implied forward energy prices holding other assumptions constant is shown below:",

        "page_content": "## 32 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity risks. All derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are also measured at fair value at subsequent reporting dates. Where derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instrument are recognised in the income statement as they arise.\n\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents, at the inception of the hedge, the hedging risk management strategy, the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risks being hedged and an assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship to ensure it is highly effective on an ongoing basis.\n\nWhere a derivative does qualify for hedge accounting, any changes in fair value are recognised depending on the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged as follows:\n\n## i) Cash flow hedges\n\nHedge relationships are classified as cash flow hedges where the derivative financial instruments hedge the Group's exposure to variability in cash flows resulting from a highly probable forecasted transaction. These include the exchange rate risk of inventory purchases denominated in foreign currency, interest rate risk and commodity risk on purchases of power and fuel. Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nIf a cash flow hedge is hedging a firm commitment or forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. This applies to the Group's foreign currency hedges in relation to inventory purchases.\n\n## ii) Fair value hedges\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives as fair value hedges where the derivative financial instrument hedges the change in fair value of the particular risks inherent in recognised assets or liabilities (fair value hedges).\n\nThe Group has adopted IFRS 9 hedge accounting requirements for its fair value hedges of investment securities and its one-for-one hedge on Tier 2 Debt issuance within Sainsbury's Bank. The Group continues to adopt IAS 39 for its macro portfolio fair value hedges of fixed rate personal loans and residential mortgages, as it is permitted to do so under IFRS 9 and until the point that the new macro hedge accounting standard is finalised and adopted.\n\nFair value hedging matches the change in fair value of designated hedged items against the corresponding change in value of the hedging derivative. The designated hedged item can be a recognised asset or liability, a firm commitment, or an identified portion of an asset.\n\nThe effective part of any gain or loss on the hedged item adjusts the balance of the hedged item and is recognised in the income statement, offsetting the gain or loss on the hedging derivative. Should circumstances arise where the hedge relationship subsequently proves ineffective, is early settled, or is terminated the adjustment to the balance of the hedged item is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item and to the income statement.\n\n## Micro fair value hedging - IFRS 9\n\nThe Group has purchased a number of fixed rate debt investment securities and has issued fixed rate subordinated debt within Sainsbury's Bank. These instruments are hedged via plain vanilla interest rate swaps, with the critical economic terms of both the hedging instrument and hedged item matching. The notional amount, fixed interest legs and maturity dates are economically matched.\n\n## Portfolio fair value hedging - IAS 39\n\nThe Group uses portfolio fair value hedging as a risk management tool for hedging interest rate risk on the Personal Loans and Mortgage portfolios. Portfolio fair value hedging allows the designation of the whole or part of a portfolio of assets or liabilities with similar risk exposures. The hedged item can be designated based on expected maturities to match the hedging derivative maturity. Hedge effectiveness is considered to have been met where the change in fair value of the hedged item offsets the change in fair value of hedging instruments, within the 80 to 125 per cent ratio corridor.\n\n## The effects of hedge accounting on the Group's financial position and performance\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments has been disclosed in the balance sheet as follows:\n\n|             |   2022 Asset   \u00a3m | 2022 Liability   \u00a3m   |   2021 Asset   \u00a3m | 2021 Liability   \u00a3m   |\n|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Non-current |               213 | (3)                   |                 8 | (44)                  |\n| Current     |                78 | (29)                  |                 5 | (93)                  |\n| Total       |               291 | (32)                  |                13 | (137)                 |",

The Group has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the foreign exchange and commodity forward contracts are identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- - Differences in the timing of the cash flows of the hedged items and the hedging instruments\n- - Different indexes (and accordingly different curves) linked to the hedged risk of the hedged items and hedging instruments\n- - The counterparties' credit risk differently impacting the fair value movements of the hedging instrument compared to the hedged items\n- - Changes to the forecasted cash flows of hedged items\n\nAt 5 March 2022 the maturity profile and average price/rate of the hedging instruments used in the Group's non-dynamic hedging strategies were as follows:\n\n|                                    | Maturity            | Maturity      | Maturity             | Maturity           | Maturity              |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|\n| At 5 March 2022                    | Less than   1 month | 1 to 3 months | 3 months to   1 year | One to five  years | More than five  years |\n| Cash flow hedges                   |                     |               |                      |                    |                       |\n| Interest rate risk                 |                     |               |                      |                    |                       |\n| Notional amount                    | -                   | -             | -                    | 490                | -                     |\n| Average net interest (pay)/receive | -                   | -             | -                    | 1.37%              | -                     |\n\nMaturity\n\nLess than\n\n1 month\n\n1 to 3 months\n\n3 months to\n\n1 year\n\nOne to five\n\nyears\n\nMore than five\n\nyears\n\nAt 6 March 2021\n\nCash flow hedges\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nNotional amount\n\n-\n\n-\n\n200\n\n490\n\n-\n\nAverage net interest (pay)/receive\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(0.51)%\n\n(0.94)%\n\n-",

The changes in fair value of the derivatives offset changes in the fair value of the hedged items through the income statement, with any ineffective portion also being recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe main source of ineffectiveness within the micro hedge relationships relates to the floating leg valuation changes inherent within the hedging instrument that do not exist within the hedged item.\n\nIneffectiveness on portfolio hedges can arise as a result of several factors, including floating leg valuation changes inherent within the hedging instrument that do not exist within the hedged item, mismatch in cash flow maturities between the hedged item and hedging instrument and basis risk between cash flows discounted using different benchmark rates.",

In addition, where gains or losses on a derivative contract economically offset the losses or gains on an underlying transaction, the derivative is not designated as being in a hedging relationship.\n\nThe Group has several long-term fixed price Power Purchase agreements with independent producers as detailed in note 31. Included within derivative financial assets is \u00a3180 million (2021: \u00a36 million) relating to these agreements, of which \u00a382 million is not within a hedging relationship. Fair value gains of \u00a376 million have been recognised in the income statement during the year for these arrangements.\n\nSainsbury's Bank and its subsidiaries had a \u00a39 million portfolio of interest rate swaps hedging mortgage pipeline offers that cannot be entered into a hedge accounting relationship (2021: \u00a39 million) with fair value fluctuations fully accounted for in the P&L, with no effective offset.\n\nAdditionally, the Group had \u00a3nil of compressed and offsetting LIBOR swaps forming part of Sainsbury's Bank's novation project from LIBOR to SONIA derivatives (2021: \u00a3888 million).\n\nThe fair value fluctuations crediting the income statement for interest rate derivatives not in a hedge accounting relationship was a credit of \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a3nil).",

Of the \u00a318 million (2021: \u00a320 million) restricted cash, \u00a315 million (2021: \u00a317 million) is held as a reserve deposit with the Bank of England in accordance with statutory requirements. This deposit is not available for use in day-to-day operations. A further \u00a33 million (2021: \u00a33 million) is restricted for Insurance purposes.\n\nRefer to note 2 for details of restatement.",

Financial Services' net debt balances are excluded because they are required as part of the business as usual operations of a bank, as opposed to specific forms of financing for the Group.\n\nDerivatives exclude those not used to hedge borrowings, and borrowings exclude bank overdrafts as they are disclosed separately.",

This is an inflation linked amortising loan from the finance company Longstone Finance plc with an outstanding principal value of \u00a3566 million (2021: \u00a3614 million) fixed at a real rate of 2.36 per cent where principal and interest rate are uplifted annually by RPI subject to a cap at five per cent and a floor at nil per cent. The carrying value of the loan is \u00a3575 million (2021: \u00a3627 million) with a final repayment date of April 2031.\n\nThe Group has entered into inflation swaps to convert \u00a3490 million (2021: \u00a3490 million) of the \u00a3566 million (2021: \u00a3614 million) loan from RPI linked interest to fixed rate interest until April 2023. These transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges (note 32).\n\nThe principal activity of Longstone Finance plc is the issuing of commercial mortgage-backed securities and applying the proceeds towards the secured loans due 2031 with the Group as summarised above.\n\nIntertrust Corporate Services Limited holds all the issued share capital of Longstone Finance Holdings Limited on trust for charitable purposes. Longstone Finance Holdings Limited beneficially owns all the issued share capital of Longstone Finance plc. As the Group has no interest, power or bears any risk over these entities they are not included in the Group consolidation.\n\n## b) Bank overdrafts\n\nBank overdrafts are repayable on demand and bear interest at a spread above Bank of England base rate.\n\n## c) Bank loan due 2021\n\nOn 6 August 2021 the Group repaid the secured \u00a3200 million Green Loan and subsequently ensured the release of all security interests.\n\n## d) Sainsbury's Bank Tier 2 Capital due 2027\n\nThe Bank issued \u00a3175 million of fixed rate reset callable subordinated Tier 2 notes on 23 November 2017. The notes pay interest on the principal amount at a rate of six per cent per annum, payable in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears, until 23 November 2022 at which time the interest rate will reset. The Bank has the option to redeem these notes on 23 November 2022.\n\n.",

The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.\n\n## Accounting policies - defined benefit pension scheme (Sainsbury's Pension Scheme)\n\nThe surplus or deficit recognised in the balance sheet for defined benefit schemes represents the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date. The defined benefit obligation is actuarially calculated on an annual basis using the projected unit credit method.\n\nActuarial gains and losses are reported in the statement of other comprehensive income as incurred, and comprise both the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments arising because of differences between the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred.\n\nThe income statement charge consists of a financing charge, which is the net of interest cost on pension scheme liabilities and interest income on plan assets and defined benefit pension scheme expenses.\n\nThe financing charge is determined by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the pension scheme liabilities and plan assets at the beginning of the financial year.\n\n## Background\n\nThe retirement benefit obligations relate to the Sainsbury's Pension Scheme plus three unfunded pension liabilities for former senior employees of Sainsbury's and Home Retail Group.\n\nThe Sainsbury's Pension Scheme has two sections, the Sainsbury's Section which holds the assets and liabilities of the original Sainsbury's Pension Scheme, and the Argos Section which holds the assets and liabilities of the Home Retail Group Pension Scheme. Each section's assets are segregated by deed and ring fenced for the benefit of the members of that section. The Scheme is run by a corporate trustee with nine directors.\n\nThe Scheme is also used to pay life assurance benefits to current (including new) colleagues.\n\nThe retirement benefit obligations at the year-end have been calculated by Isio, the actuarial advisers to the Group, using the projected unit credit method and based on adjusting the position at the date of the previous triennial valuation for known events and changes in market conditions as allowed under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits'.",

        "page_content": "## 37 Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Sainsbury's section\n\nThe section was closed to new employees on 31 January 2002 and closed to future accrual on 28 September 2013. There are three benefit categories: final salary, career average and cash balance. Final salary and career average benefits are determined by service and salary. Cash balance benefits are determined by the accrued retirement account credits.\n\n## Argos section\n\nThe section was closed to new employees in 2009 and to future accrual in January 2013. Pension benefits are based on service and final salary when leaving the Scheme.\n\n## Triennial valuation\n\nThe Trustee's triennial valuation is used to determine the contributions required for the Scheme to pay all the benefits due, now and in the future. The Trustee must allow for a level of prudence and so these assumptions therefore place a relatively high value on the Scheme's liabilities. By contrast, IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' requires all companies to value the liabilities on a 'best estimate' basis which places a lower value on the liabilities and therefore a more favourable financial position. As such, the accounting value is different to the result obtained using the Trustee's triennial valuation basis.\n\nThe Trustee completed a triennial valuation, carried out by Willis Towers Watson, as at 30 September 2018 on the projected unit basis and a recovery plan was agreed. The deficit on the basis of the assumptions agreed was \u00a3538 million.\n\nUnder the funding plan, Sainsbury's established a new Scottish Limited partnership - Sainsbury's Thistle Scottish Limited Partnership ('the Partnership') with the Scheme on 17 July 2019.\n\nProperties with a valuation of \u00a31,350 million were transferred into a newly formed property holding company - Sainsbury's Property Holdings Limited ('Propco') from the Sainsbury's Property Scottish Partnership and other Sainsbury's Group Companies. The Propco is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group and leases the transferred properties to other Group companies. Rental receipts facilitate payments of interest and capital on loan notes issued to the Partnership, in which the Scheme holds an interest.\n\nThe Partnership is controlled by Sainsbury's and its results are consolidated by the Group. The Group's balance sheet, IAS 19 deficit and income statement are unchanged by the establishment of the Partnership. The Scheme's investment in the Partnership does not qualify as a plan asset for the purposes of the Group's consolidated financial statements and is therefore not included within the fair value of plan assets.\n\nThe value of the properties transferred to the Propco remains in the Group's property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet, and the Group retains full operational flexibility to extend, develop and substitute them.\n\nThe Scheme's interest in the Partnership entitles it to annual distributions over up to 20 years through three payment streams:\n\n- 1)   Payments to the Sainsbury's section (\u00a315 million per year)\n- 2)   Payments to the Argos section (\u00a320 million per year)\n- 3)   Switching payment stream, paid to either the Sainsbury's section or Argos section (initially approximately \u00a323 million per year, increasing to \u00a333 million by 2038)\n\nIn addition to the above, cash contributions of \u00a310 million were paid during the year (2021: cash contributions of \u00a340 million).\n\nThe payments to the Sainsbury's and Argos sections (streams 1 and 2) stop in 2030, or when the relevant section reaches its funding target, if earlier.\n\nThe switching stream is initially paid to the Sainsbury's section until it reaches the funding target, when it will then switch to the Argos section. Payments continue until 2038 or until both sections have reached their funding targets, if earlier.\n\nThe level of property in the Propco reduces as the Scheme reaches the funding targets.\n\nThe Sainsbury's section reached its funding target on 31 December 2021, and so the first payment stream was switched off. The switching stream will move to the Argos section from March 2022.\n\nThe next triennial funding valuation as at 30 September 2021 is currently being completed by the Trustee. The results of this valuation are not yet available.\n\n## IFRIC 14\n\nUnder IFRIC 14, a company is required to measure any economic benefits available to it in the form of refunds or reductions to future contributions at the maximum amount that is consistent with the terms and conditions of the pension scheme. These are regarded as available to a company if it has an unconditional right to realise them at some point during the life of the pension scheme or when all benefits are finally settled. Such an unconditional right would not exist when the availability of the refund or the reduction in future contribution would be contingent upon factors beyond the company's control.\n\nManagement is of the view that it has an unconditional right to a refund of surplus under IFRIC 14. As such no adjustment has been made for potential additional liabilities.\n\nIn forming this conclusion management has considered whether the Group can control the run-off of the Scheme until there are no liabilities left, consistent with IFRIC 14. For example, if the Trustee has a unilateral power to wind up the Scheme while there are liabilities remaining, then it is viewed that the Group cannot access surplus through this route. For both sections, management have assessed that the Group can control run-off until no liabilities remain by complying with its obligations under the Scheme rules and pensions legislation, and there will therefore be a gradual settlement of the planned liabilities over the life of each section.\n\nThe Scheme rules list certain situations under which the Trustee can wind up the Scheme; however whilst there is gradual settlement of the Scheme's liabilities, these are concluded to be within the control of the Group. As a result, it is concluded that the Trustee does not have a unilateral power to wind up the Scheme nor augment benefits while the Scheme is ongoing.",

        "page_content": "## 37 Retirement benefit obligations continued\n\n## Significant estimate - pension scheme assets\n\nThe Scheme holds some private market assets as they are expected to deliver a more favourable risk/return profile than public market equivalents. These assets are relatively illiquid (likely to be realised over c.5 years) but the Scheme holds sufficient liquid assets (cash, gilts and other liquid securities) to be confident that it can meet its pension and collateral obligations over time.\n\nThe valuation of these assets is based on the audited accounts of the funds, where available, and net asset value statements from the investment managers where recent accounts are not available. For many of the investments, the valuations provided are at 30 September. The Group therefore performs a roll-forward for these valuations, adjusting for cash received or paid and applying the changes seen in relevant liquid indices as follows:\n\n| Asset class                       | Returns from 30-Sep-21 to 5-Mar-22   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Global equity USD return          | (3.22)%                              |\n| Global High Yield Debt USD return | (3.02)%                              |\n| US loans USD return               | 0.51%                                |\n| UK REITS GBP return               | (1.10)%                              |\n\nThe roll-forward has increased the valuation of illiquid assets by \u00a340 million. A 1 per cent increase/decrease in the indices used would have caused a \u00a318 million increase/decrease in the adjustment.\n\nAs at 5 March, the scheme has an immaterial exposure to Russian and Ukrainian assets, with market value totalling \u00a36.0m, which represents only 0.05% of total scheme assets.\n\n## Investment strategy and risks associated with the Group's defined benefit pension scheme\n\nThe Trustee considers that its primary responsibility in respect of investments is to ensure, for the duration of the Scheme, that funds will be available to meet the benefit payment obligations as they fall due. Based on this responsibility and its obligation to manage the investments, its investment objectives are as follows:\n\nIn respect of the Sainsbury's section:\n\n- 1. Target a 50 per cent or better chance of being fully funded on a gilts + 0.5 per cent p.a. funding level basis by March 2022; and\n- 2. To limit the downside risk associated with the investment policy, wherever possible.\n\n## In respect of the Argos section:\n\n- 1. Target a 50 per cent or better chance of being fully funded on a gilts + 0.5 per cent funding level basis by September 2022; and\n- 2. To limit the downside risk associated with the investment policy, wherever possible.",

High quality corporate bonds are those for which at least one of the main ratings agencies considers to be at least AA (or equivalent).\n\n## Inflation\n\nOn 25 November, the Government and UK Statistics Authority's joint consultation response on RPI reform was published. This confirmed their intention to amend the RPI calculation methodology to be aligned to that already in use for the calculation of the CPI (including housing) with effect from 2030. As a result, the Group reduced the post 2030 gap between RPI and CPI to nil in the prior year, effectively assuming RPI will be aligned with CPI post 2030, resulting in a single weighted average RPI-CPI gap of 0.70% p.a. for the 5th March 2022 year-end. This approach has been applied consistently in the current year.\n\n## Mortality\n\nThe base mortality assumptions are based on the SAPS S2 tables, with adjustments to reflect the Scheme's population. Future mortality improvements for the 2022 year-end are CMI 2021 projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent p.a. Future mortality improvements for the 2021 year-end were CMI 2020 projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.25 per cent p.a.\n\nWhile Covid-19 had an impact on mortality in 2020, the impact on future mortality trends is currently unknown. All IAS 19 calculations use the CMI model, which measures potential changes to future mortality trends. The Group's policy is to use the available version as at the year-end (the 2021 results used the CMI 2020 model). The latest CMI model, CMI 2021, was released on 9 March 2022.\n\nThe CMI 2020 model showed a significant reduction of 11.8 per cent in the 2020 rates of longevity for the general population. This is well outside the range of annual mortality changes in the last 40 years.\n\nAs a result of this significant change in mortality, the CMI modified the calibration process for CMI 2020 to allow choice on the weighting placed on an individual year's data. For the Core version of CMI 2020, a weight of zero per cent was applied to 2020 data and weightings of 100 per cent for other years, so the potentially exceptional 2020 experience was ignored when modelling future improvements. This approach has been maintained for CMI 2021, with zero per cent weighting applied to 2020 and 2021 data. In the prior year, the Group determined that putting a high weighting on the impact of 2020 could undervalue the liability so a zero per cent weighting was therefore applied to the 2020 mortality data.",

The choice of weighting to apply to 2020 and 2021 data is judgemental. The UK has continued to see the impact of the pandemic into 2021 with significant excess deaths compared to pre-pandemic levels. Deaths for 2021 are therefore expected to be higher than 2019 but not as high as 2020 given the success, thus far, of the vaccination programme at reducing hospitalisations and deaths. With 2020 and 2021 experiencing negative mortality improvements relative to 2019, it is felt that it would be overly conservative to adopt the Core CMI 2021 model which shows improvements in mortality in 2020, 2021 and beyond.\n\nA 10 per cent weighting has therefore been applied to the 2020 and 2021 mortality data, broadly reflecting that the effects of the pandemic are significantly reduced going forwards with mortality rates for 2022 immediately returning to those in 2019. Thereafter, mortality improvements are in line with the CMI 2021 Core model. The impact of different weightings on the Scheme liabilities is included in the sensitivities section within this note.\n\nThe life expectancy for members aged 65 years at the balance sheet date is as follows:\n\n|                  |   Sainsbury's  section   Main Scheme 2022 Years |   Sainsbury's  section  Executive  Scheme 2022 Years |   Argos   section 2022 Years |   Sainsbury's  section   Main Scheme 2021 Years |   Sainsbury's  section  Executive   Scheme 2021 Years |   Argos   section 2021 Years |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Male pensioner   |                                            19.6 |                                                 23.8 |                         21.3 |                                            20   |                                                  24.1 |                         21.7 |\n| Female pensioner |                                            23.5 |                                                 25   |                         23.9 |                                            23.8 |                                                  25.3 |                         24   |\n\nThe life expectancy at age 65 for members aged 45 years at the balance sheet date is as follows:\n\n|                  |   Sainsbury's  section   Main Scheme 2022 Years |   Sainsbury's  section  Executive  Scheme 2022 Years |   Argos   section 2022 Years |   Sainsbury's  section   Main Scheme 2021 Years |   Sainsbury's  section   Executive   Scheme 2021 Years |   Argos   section 2021 Years |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Male pensioner   |                                            20.8 |                                                 25   |                         22.5 |                                            21.3 |                                                   25.3 |                         23   |\n| Female pensioner |                                            25   |                                                 26.5 |                         25.4 |                                            25.3 |                                                   26.7 |                         25.5 |\n\n## e) Sensitivities\n\nThe present value of the Scheme's liabilities recognised at the balance sheet date and the net financing charge recognised in the income statement are dependent on the discount rate. Other key assumptions within this calculation are based on market conditions or estimates of future events, including mortality rates. The carrying value of the retirement benefit obligations is impacted by changes to any of the assumptions used, however is most sensitive to changes in the discount rate.\n\nThe following sensitivities are based on management's best estimate of a reasonably anticipated change. The sensitivities are calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the retirement benefit obligation, by considering the impact for a given change in assumption. The net retirement benefit obligation is the difference between the retirement benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. Changes in the assumptions may occur at the same time as changes in the fair value of plan assets. There has been no change in the calculation methodology since the prior period.\n\n|                                                                                                                                  | Sainsbury's \u00a3m   | Argos   \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------|------------|\n| Financial sensitivities                                                                                                          |                  |              |            |\n| An increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would decrease the present value of funded obligations by                               | 673              | 120          | 793        |\n| A decrease of 0.5% in the discount rate would increase the present value of funded obligations by                                | 763              | 138          | 901        |\n| An increase of 0.5% in the inflation rate would increase the present value of funded obligations by                              | 399              | 109          | 508        |\n| A decrease of 0.5% in the inflation rate would decrease the present value of funded obligations by                               | 409              | 99           | 508        |\n| An increase of 0.5% in the inflation rate for future pension increases would increase the present value of funded obligations by | 202              | 64           | 266        |\n| A decrease of 0.5% in the inflation rate for future pension increases would reduce the present value of funded obligations by    | 233              | 60           | 293        |\n| Demographic sensitivities                                                                                                        |                  |              |            |\n| An increase of one year to the life expectancy would increase the present value of funded obligations by                         | 347              | 55           | 402        |\n| Changing the 2020 and 2021 weighting parameters in CMI 2021 to 0% would increase the present value of funded obligations by      | 108              | 17           | 125        |\n| Changing the 2020 and 2021 weighting parameters in CMI 2021 to 25% would decrease the present value of funded  obligations by    | 104              | 17           | 121        |",

Expected cash contributions in FY22/23 are approximately \u00a362 million.\n\nThe duration of the plan liabilities is around 19 years for the Sainsbury's section and 21 years for the Argos section.

All share options are valued using an option-pricing model (Black-Scholes). This fair value is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\nFor cash-settled share-based payments, the fair value of the employee services rendered is determined at each balance sheet date and the charge recognised through the income statement over the vesting period of the share-based payment scheme, with a corresponding increase in accruals.\n\nThe value of the charge is adjusted in the income statement over the remainder of the vesting period to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting, with the corresponding adjustments made in equity and accruals.\n\nThe grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.\n\nThe Group recognised \u00a358 million (2021: \u00a329 million) of employee costs (note 36) related to share-based payment transactions made during the financial year. Of these, a credit of \u00a31.5 million (2021: \u00a30.5 million credit) was cash-settled.\n\nThe Group operates several share-based payment schemes as set out below:\n\n## a) Savings-Related Share Option Scheme (Sharesave)\n\nThe Group operates a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which is open to all UK employees with more than three months' continuous service. This is an approved HMRC scheme and was established in 1980. Under Sharesave, participants remaining in the Group's employment at the end of the three-year (and historically also five-year) savings period are entitled to use their savings to purchase shares in the Company at a stated exercise price.\n\nEmployees leaving for certain reasons can use their savings to purchase shares within six months of their leaving.\n\nA reconciliation of Sharesave option movements is shown below:\n\n|                                  | 2022 Number of   options million   | 2022 Weighted  average  exercise price pence   | 2021 Number of  options million   | 2021 Weighted  average  exercise price pence   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Outstanding at beginning of year | 64.1                               | 179                                            | 60.8                              | 190                                            |\n| Granted                          | 13.8                               | 228                                            | 23.7                              | 161                                            |\n| Lapsed/forfeited                 | (10.0)                             | 179                                            | (11.4)                            | 196                                            |\n| Exercised                        | (9.6)                              | 204                                            | (9.0)                             | 186                                            |\n| Outstanding at end of year       | 58.3                               | 186                                            | 64.1                              | 179                                            |\n| Exercisable at end of year       | 4.7                                | 238                                            | 6.2                               | 186                                            |\n| Exercisable range                |                                    | 161 to 260                                     |                                   | 161 to 260                                     |",

The core awards are calculated as a percentage of the participants' salaries and scaled according to grades.\n\nPerformance is measured at the end of the three-year performance period. If the required performance conditions have been met, the awards vest and the participants are able to exercise 100% of the awards received. For 2020 awards and prior, recipients were only able to receive 50% of their awards after 3 years and 50% of their awards after 4 years. Options granted will expire five years from the grant date.\n\nFor Executive Directors, awards will normally be subject to a two-year holding period following the end of the three-year performing period. Options granted to acquire the award of shares will expire six years from the date of grant.\n\nDividends will accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.\n\nThe core award can grow by up to four times, dependent on the level of performance. Straight-line vesting will apply if performance falls between two points. Awards are structured as nil cost options.\n\nA reconciliation of the number of shares conditionally allocated is shown below:\n\n|                                  | 2022 Million   | 2021 Million   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Outstanding at beginning of year | 12.2           | 10.2           |\n| Conditionally allocated          | 12.9           | 7. 8           |\n| Released to participants         | (5.0)          | (4.4)          |\n| Lapsed                           | (1.6)          | (1.4)          |\n| Outstanding at end of year       | 18.5           | 12.2           |\n\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at 5 March 2022 was 1.5 years (2021: 1.4 years).\n\nDetails of shares conditionally allocated at 5 March 2022 are set out below:\n\n| Date of conditional award           | 2022 Million   | 2021 Million   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 12 May 2016 (2016 Future Builder)   | -              | 0.1            |\n| 11 May 2017 (2017 Future Builder)   | 1.1            | 3.3            |\n| 11 May 2018 (2018 Future Builder)   | 2.8            | 2.1            |\n| 09 May 2019 (2019 Future Builder)   | 2.9            | 3.1            |\n| 07 May 2020 (2020 Future Builder)   | 3.3            | 3.6            |\n| 06 Jun 2021 (2021 Win in Food Plan) | 8.4            | -              |\n|                                     | 18.5           | 12.2           |\n\nThe 2021 Win in Food Plan was opened up to a larger population of managers, which has driven through the higher amount of options granted for the year.

The fair value per option granted during the year and the assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:\n\n|                                   |   2022 | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Share price at grant date (pence) |    267 | 199    |\n| Option life (years)               |      3 | 3 or 4 |\n| Fair value per option (pence)     |    267 | 199    |\n\nDuring the year, a total number of 5.0 million shares were exercised (2021: 4.4 million shares). The weighted average share price during the year for options exercised was 248 pence (2021: 194 pence).\n\n## c) Deferred Share Award\n\nThis plan is closed to new participants; the last awards made under this plan were in 2020/21. The Deferred Share Award targets a diverse range of financial and strategic scorecard measures. These are intended to reward the Directors in the Company, including Executive Directors, for driving the short-term objectives that will directly lead to building the sustainable, long-term growth of the Company. Awards are structured as nil cost options.\n\nShare-based awards are made to participants subject to performance against a basket of measures. At least 50 per cent of the awards are based on the delivery of financial performance and returns to shareholders. The balance is based on measures which will assess the Company's performance relative to its competitors as well as key strategic goals.\n\nPerformance against the target is measured over one financial year. Any shares awarded are deferred for a further two years to ensure that management's interests continue to be aligned with those of shareholders. The shares are subject to forfeiture if the participant resigns or is dismissed. Dividends accrue on the shares that vest in the form of additional shares.\n\nA reconciliation of the number of shares granted over the year is shown below:\n\n|                                  | 2022 Million   | 2021 Million   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Outstanding at beginning of year | 3.6            | 3.8            |\n| Granted                          | 0.2 1          | 2.1            |\n| Lapsed                           | (0.1)          | (0.6)          |\n| Exercised                        | (2.0)          | (1.7)          |\n| Outstanding at end of year       | 1.7            | 3.6            |\n\nThe number of shares allocated at the end of the year is set out below:\n\n|             |   2022 Million |   2021 Million |\n|-------------|----------------|----------------|\n| 09 May 2019 |            0.1 |            1.9 |\n| 07 May 2020 |            1.6 |            1.7 |\n|             |            1.7 |            3.6 |\n\nThe weighted average remaining contractual life of share options outstanding at 5 March 2022 was nil years (2021: 0.5 years). The weighted average share price during the year for options exercised was 241 pence (2021: 195 pence).\n\n## d) Bonus Share Award\n\nSenior managers and supermarket managers receive 60 per cent of their bonus in cash and 40 per cent of the award in shares. Director level managers receive 50 per cent of their bonus in cash and 50 per cent of the award in shares. Before 2021 awards had a three year deferral period, however awards granted from 2021 now have a deferral period of two years (except for colleagues who are subject to a deferral period due to certain financial service regulations).\n\nDividends accrue on these shares and are released at the end of the deferral period.",

The weighted average share price during the year for options exercised was 242 pence (2021: 184 pence).\n\n## 39 Capital commitments\n\nAt 5 March 2022, capital commitments contracted, but not provided for by the Group, amounted to \u00a3108 million (6 March 2021: \u00a3113 million) and \u00a3nil for the property joint ventures (6 March 2021: \u00a3nil).\n\nIn addition, the Group is committed to payments totalling \u00a3nil (2021: \u00a332 million) in relation to leases that have been signed but not yet commenced.\n\n## 40 Contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nThe Group has a number of contingent liabilities in respect of historic lease guarantees, particularly in relation to the disposal of assets, which if the current tenant and their ultimate parents become insolvent, may expose the Group to a material liability. This liability decreases over time as the leases expire. The Group has considered a number of factors, including past history of default as well as the profitability and cash generation of the current leaseholders, and has concluded that the likelihood of pay out is remote.\n\nAlong with other retailers, the Group is currently subject to claims from current and ex-employees in the Employment Tribunal for equal pay under the Equality Act 2010 and/or the Equal Pay Act 1970. There are currently circa 8,600 equal pay claims from circa 4,400 claimants, in which the claimants are alleging that their work within Sainsbury's stores is or was, of equal value to that of colleagues working in Sainsbury's distribution centres, and that differences in terms and conditions relating to pay are not objectively justifiable. The claimants are seeking the differential back pay based on the higher wages in distribution centres, and the equalisation of wages and terms and conditions on an ongoing basis. The Group believes further claims will be served.\n\nThere are three stages in the tribunal procedure for equal value claims of this nature and the claimants will need to succeed in all three. The first stage is whether store claimants have the legal right to make the comparison with depot workers. Following European and Supreme Court decisions in other similar litigation, Sainsbury's has conceded this point. The second stage is the lengthy process to determine whether any of the claimants' roles are of equal value to their chosen comparators. This process is likely to continue for several more years. In the event that any of the claimants succeed at the second stage there will be further hearings, in the years following, to consider whether any pay differential is justified.\n\nGiven that the outcome of the second and third stages in the litigation remains highly uncertain at this stage, the Group cannot make any assessment of the likelihood nor quantum of any outcome. No provision has therefore been recognised on the Group's balance sheet. There are substantial factual and legal defences to these claims and the Group intends to defend them vigorously.\n\nAs disclosed in note 5 to the financial statements, the Group had a number of ongoing legal cases in relation to overcharges arising from payment card interchange fees. During the year settlements have been reached in two of these cases, resulting in non-underlying income of \u00a3167 million being recognised. The last of these cases goes to trial for a final determination of quantum in early 2023. A range of possible outcomes is possible, including \u00a3nil. As the outcome and quantum of any award is not virtually certain no income has been recognised in accordance with IAS 37: 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Company financial statements\n\n## 1 Basis of preparation\n\nThe parent company's financial statements are prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law), including Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101) and the Companies Act 2006. FRS 101 sets out a reduced disclosure framework for a 'qualifying entity' as defined in the Standard, which addresses the financial reporting requirements and disclosure exemptions in the individual financial statements of qualifying entities that otherwise apply the recognition measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards.\n\nThe financial year represents the 52 weeks to 5 March 2022 (prior financial year 52 weeks to 6 March 2021).\n\nThe disclosure exemptions adopted by the Company in accordance with FRS 101 are as follows:\n\n- - The requirements of IAS 7 to present a cash flow statement\n- - The requirements of paragraph 17 of IAS 24 'Related Party Transactions', to disclose information related to key management personnel, and the requirements of IAS 24 to disclose related party transactions between two or more members of a group for wholly owned subsidiaries\n- - The requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 to disclose information assessing the possible impact of new standards issued but which are not yet effective\n- - The requirements of IFRS 7 and IFRS 13 for disclosure of financial instruments and fair values\n\nThe financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest \u00a3million unless otherwise stated. They have been prepared on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention, except for derivative financial instruments and financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income that have been measured at fair value.\n\n## Amendments to published standards\n\n## Effective for the Company in these financial statements:\n\nThe Company has considered the following amendments to published standards that are effective for the Company for the financial year beginning 7 March 2021 and concluded that they are either not relevant to the Company or that they do not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements other than disclosures.\n\n- - Amendments to IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments', IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' on the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - Phase 2\n- - Amendment to IFRS 16 'Leases' with regards to the exemption granted in the 'COVID-19-related rent concessions'\n\nThe Company early adopted the Interest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2 amendments in the financial year ended 6 March 2021. The Company has elected not to apply the exemption granted in the 'COVID-19-related rent concessions' as the Company has not received material COVID-19-related rent concessions as a lessee.\n\n## Standards and revisions effective for future periods:\n\nThe following standards and revisions will be effective for future periods:\n\n- - Amendments to IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' with reference to the Conceptual Framework\n- - Amendments to IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets' on Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract\n- - Amendments to IAS 16 'Property, Plant and Equipment' on Proceeds before Intended Use\n- - Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' on the classification of liabilities as current or non-current\n- - Amendments to IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' and IFRS Practice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgements' on the disclosure of accounting policies\n- - Amendments to IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' on the definition of accounting estimates\n- - Amendments to IAS 12 'Income Taxes' on Deferred Tax Related to Assets and Liabilities Arising from a Single Transaction\n- - IFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts'\n\nThe Company has considered the impact of the remaining above standards and revisions and has concluded that they will not have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.\n\nThe Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and not presented an income statement nor a statement of comprehensive income for the Company alone.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are carried at cost less any impairment loss in the financial statements of the Company.\n\nAt each reporting period, the Company assesses the carrying amounts of its investments to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Where such an indication exists, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. If the recoverable amount of the investment is less than its carrying amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount. Any impairment loss is immediately recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Significant estimate - impairment of investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Company considers impairment of its investment in subsidiaries by estimating the recoverable amounts of the investments, which are based on either the net assets of the subsidiary, or value-in-use calculations. Where a value-in-use calculation is used, discounted cash flows have been derived from the latest five-year Board-approved cash flows to perpetuity with no growth rate applied, discounted at a pre-tax rate of 7 per cent to 13 per cent.\n\n|                                             | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Subsidiaries                                |           |           |\n| At the beginning of the year                | 7,609     | 7, 74 9   |\n| Additions                                   | 58        | 29        |\n| Impairments                                 | -         | (169)     |\n| At the end of the year                      | 7,667     | 7,609     |\n| Joint ventures and associates               | 1         | 1         |\n| Subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates | 7,668     | 7, 6 1 0  |\n\nThe directors acknowledged that as at 5 March 2022 the market capitalisation of J Sainsbury plc was less than the net assets of the company, which primarily consists of investments in subsidiaries. This was considered an indicator of impairment and an impairment test over the investment in subsidiaries was performed. No impairments were identified. Where value-in-use calculations have been used to estimate the recoverable amounts of the investments, sensitivity analysis has been performed. The analysis indicates that there is sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would not result in any impairment in any of the Company's investments in subsidiaries.\n\nAn impairment charge of \u00a3169 million was recognised in the prior year in relation to the Company's investment in its subsidiary Sainsbury's Bank plc, reducing the Company's investment to \u00a3856 million based on remaining net assets. No impairment charge was recognised over the Company's other investments in subsidiaries.\n\n## 3 Other receivables\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nReceivables are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.\n\n|                                 | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-current                     |           |           |\n| Amounts owed by Group companies | 149       | 161       |\n| Current                         |           |           |\n| Amounts owed by Group companies | 2,080     | 1,478     |\n| Prepayments and accrued income  | -         | 11        |\n|                                 | 2,080     | 1,489     |\n\nReceivable balances with other Group entities are reviewed for potential impairment based on the ability of the counterparty to meet its obligations. This is assessed by considering the net asset position of the entity and whether the amounts owed to the Company are covered. Where this is not the case, the estimated future cashflows of the counterparty are considered in line with the methodology detailed in note 2. No impairment losses were recognised in the year.\n\n## 4 Trade and other payables\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nPayables are recognised initially at fair value, and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.\n\n|                                | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current                        |           |           |\n| Amounts owed to Group entities | 3,496     | 2,782     |\n| Other payables                 | 3         | 7         |\n|                                | 3,499     | 2,789     |",

It is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income.\n\nDeferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures except where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n|                                            |   Capital losses \u00a3m | Rolled  over capital  gains \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|------------|\n| At 7 March 2021                            |                  12 | (24)                             | (12)       |\n| Rate change adjustment to income statement |                   4 | (8)                              | (4)        |\n| At 5 March 2022                            |                  16 | (32)                             | (16)       |\n| At 6 March 2021 and 8 March 2020           |                  12 | (24)                             | (12)       |",
