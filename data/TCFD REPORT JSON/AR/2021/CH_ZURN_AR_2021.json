When a downpour in 2016 flooded an AUDI AG (Volkswagen Group) production plant in the southwestern German city of Neckarsulm and halted production, the carmaker decided to embark on a journey to improve its flood resilience. It put in place a raft of innovative resilience measures, such as inflatable water barriers that would not only protect its plant from flash floods, but also protect its employees and the surrounding community.\n\n'Climate resilience requires businesses to invest in adaptation now, and not wait for new data or government regulation before you act,' says Amar. 'If they wait, it will be too late to develop and deploy solutions.'\n\nA test came in June 2021, when heavy rain hit the Neckarsulm plant. Damage to the site was minimal and the automaker is now looking to transfer lessons learned and risk insights to other locations across the Volkswagen Group.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Amar Rahman\n\nGlobal Head Climate Change Resilience Services, Zurich Insurance Group\n\n<!-- image -->",

Every day since 1872, we have helped businesses, families and communities to prosper and grow.\n\nTo mark our 150-year anniversary, we are celebrating our past and present, our customers, our communities, and our employees - all those who have helped us to come this far.\n\nFestivities include global town halls, special events, and publication of a commemorative e-book, culminating in an official anniversary celebration in October 2022 (see page 32).\n\nFor more than 150 years, Zurich has been creating positive impact. We have proven our ability to change and respond to challenges and we look to the future with confidence.\n\nJust a few months after announcing our targets for 2020-2022, the pandemic upended our plans and we responded rapidly to chart a new course. Two years later, we're well on track to deliver on our targets and are well prepared to set new targets for the next strategic cycle in November.\n\n## Turning risks into opportunities\n\nThe insurance business has changed dramatically since Zurich first started operating in 1872, in an age of steam, horses and telegraph. The risks we face today are more complex, interdependent and global. We are responding by actively helping customers, partners and communities to build their resilience to adverse events before they happen, adding these risk management services to the traditional risk transfer that covers the costs when things go wrong.\n\nWe have a close relationship with our customers and 150 years of experience. This means we can give customers specialized insights and tools to help them navigate traditional and evolving risks, whether related to climate change, supply chains or cyber security. This is part of insurance's role in society: we help reduce risk and promote sustainable behavior.\n\n## Inspiring action\n\nIn order to deal with risks posed by climate change, digitalization or social inequality, collective action is needed - from governments, companies, and individuals. We want to empower our customers, employees, partners and the communities in which we work to act on what matters most to them.\n\nOur Zurich Forest project, for example, is helping to raise awareness of environmental issues among our employees. In collaboration with non-profit Instituto Terra, we're supporting the creation of a biodiverse rainforest in Brazil's Atlantic Forest region. More than 200,000 seedlings have been planted since September 2020. Employees can claim a tree and follow the process of reforestation, step by step.\n\nIn 2021, Zurich's offices, employees, customers and distributors showed what can be achieved by joining forces when they participated in the biggest Z Zurich Foundation 1 fundraising campaign since the Foundation was established in 1973. The campaign raised enough funds for UNICEF to deliver two doses of COVID-19 vaccine to more than 1.7 million vulnerable people.\n\nWe're also responding to the complexity and rapid change of our age by helping our people become well-equipped to navigate this environment. As part of our focus on work sustainability, we help our colleagues keep their skills sharp, and the best testament to our success is that two-thirds of vacant positions at Zurich are filled with internal candidates.",

For this, I need to focus on our customers, our people and our financial performance. I aspire to continuously expand the support we provide to our customers through our expertise, products and services to protect what matters most and prevent losses from disrupting their business. We have great people in Commercial Insurance and I want to ensure that we offer an environment to help them thrive and grow. To be successful it is critical that we manage our portfolios to maintain profitability to ensure we are a consistent and predictable partner for the long term.\n\n## Why is it an interesting time for commercial insurance?\n\nIt is a time of change on many fronts with evolving risks and new opportunities. We continue to develop our capabilities to deliver greater insights. This helps us better predict and prevent losses for our customers and for Zurich, and through this we see a greater interest from our customers in not only transferring risk but preventing losses as well. There are very few insurers with the same global reach, expertise, and capabilities to support customers in this way, giving them the reassurance in preventing losses today while providing the confidence to realize opportunities for the future.

The strong retention of our existing business and our portfolio growth signals that not only are our customers happy with us but that we also have a strong ability to attract new ones. We've built on our strengths by launching Zurich Resilience Solutions, which supports customers to build resilience today and for the future.\n\n## When you look at the market, do you see opportunities or challenges?\n\nOpportunity - of course! We are building from a very strong foundation of long-term relationships with customers and brokers. Through these relationships we continue to navigate the right outcomes for our customers, broker partners and Zurich. We also have significant opportunity to build our middle market presence as well as grow our prevention and mitigation services. Nonetheless, there are significant challenges in the market such as natural catastrophes, social inflation, cyber and supply chain-related challenges. In the case of natural catastrophes, we increasingly see society unprepared for these events.

'You need an insurer that understands the challenges of the industry, has an interest in the challenges and then is also prepared to help and be part of the solution.'\n\nZurich is committed to working together with its customers to help them transition to net-zero emissions and adapt their business models for a more sustainable future. Like Zurich, BASF has pledged to become a net-zero emissions company by 2050, in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nAt the same time, Zurich is enabling customers to understand the physical risks they are facing from climate change and gives advice on mitigation and prevention through, for example, the Zurich Climate Change Resilience Services unit, created in 2020.\n\n'Due to climate change, we now have higher risk when it comes to flooding, heavy rains and so on,' says Fiedler, who manages all insurable risks of BASF, together with his global team of around 40 colleagues. 'Zurich helps BASF to identify increased risks and help to identify the right responses to mitigate that risk.'\n\nBut business relationships, even between large companies, are at their essence about humans, understanding and trust, according to Fiedler.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## You need an insurer that understands the challenges of the industry.\n\nPatrick Fiedler\n\nSenior Vice President of BASF\n\n'It's about the individual people and how they are willing to understand and how they are willing to help,' he says. 'And that's where I also see Zurich doing a really good job.'\n\nIt's a relationship that has, in a word, sustained.\n\nFiedler appeared on 'Future Planet,' the inaugural episode of the live-event discussion series Z-Talks by Zurich (pictured below).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo watch the episode, visit:\n\nwww.zurich.com/en/z-talks-by-zurich\n\n<!-- image -->",

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitalization and adoption of new technologies, increasing the need for bestin-class practices for cyber security and data stewardship. Zurich is strengthening its digital capabilities to help customers navigate these complex risks, reduce unnecessary complexity and create personalized products today's tech-savvy consumers want and need.\n\n## Conversing with computers\n\nIn 2021, Zurich agreed to acquire Estoniabased company AlphaChat, one of the most advanced startups in conversational artificial intelligence (AI), with a team of seasoned entrepreneurs and machine learning specialists. The acquisition will help Zurich meet increasing demand from customers for personalized products and services that are available around the clock. In particular, it will help to ensure a consistent and efficient approach to developing intelligent virtual assistants across businesses, for both internal and external purposes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The needs of customers are evolving rapidly.\n\nFrank Verkerk Group Chief Platform Officer, Zurich Insurance Group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tech talent\n\nZurich further strengthened its digital transformation with the creation of two new roles in 2021. Peter Kasahara was named as Group Chief Data Officer, a position that oversees all aspects of data management and is taking Zurich one step closer to its goal of becoming a leader in responsible handling of data. In the role of Group Chief Platform Officer, Frank Verkerk focuses on accelerating the development of digital and modular services to meet rapidly evolving needs of customers, in close collaboration with Zurich Global Ventures (see case study on page 25).\n\n## Cyber security\n\nThe increased adoption of digital business models and use of technology in our day-to-day lives has brought benefits - as well as new risks. Cyber risks are growing and can result in cyberattacks, business disruption, loss of revenue and regulatory action on data protection. In 2021, Zurich announced a global collaboration with Toronto-based insurtech, BOXX Insurance, which provides fully-integrated cybersecurity and insurance solutions for small- to mediumsized businesses, consumers and families. The collaboration, together with BOXX's prevention-led approach, will help Zurich deliver on its goal to create confidence in a digital society while also tapping into the rapidly growing demand for cybersecurity solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## We pride ourselves on transparency.\n\nPeter Kasahara\n\nGroup Chief Data Officer, Zurich Insurance Group\n\n## Protection beyond policies\n\nEstablished in 2021, Zurich Resilience Solutions (see case study on page 35) offers services to help commercial customers manage one of the most challenging risks for a modern-day business: cyber risk. Zurich Cyber Security Services goes beyond insurance policies to provide cyber risk engineering and advisory services and, together with cybersecurity company CYE, a continuous cybersecurity assessment solution. With benefits that include closing unknown security blind spots and ensuring proactive protection of critical business assets, Zurich Cyber Security Services can help customers stay one step ahead of cyber threats.\n\n<!-- image -->",

All the fast-advancing technologies and data these days give us even more creative ways to be responsive to customer needs and expectations.\n\n## What were you most proud of in 2021?\n\nExceptional products and services start with exceptional teams. We further strengthened our great team with two new senior hires (see page 30). With our newly established Digital Academy, we also upskilled our workforce through 15,000 hours of learning and certifications to stay current. Plus, we recruited more than 100 new tech specialists and brought in market-leading startups such as AlphaChat for fresh conversational artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\n## How are you kick-starting a startup mindset at Zurich?\n\nWe're already comfortable working with startups, and our third and most popular round of the Zurich Innovation Championship is in full swing. Startups are obsessed with delivering customer-focused products and services, and I want our people to operate with this energy, too.\n\nWe're encouraging colleagues around the world to present their digital solutions - and their benefit to customers - in our internal Digital League. Whatever function you work in, you can showcase innovative, scalable customer solutions that deliver real impact and added value. It's crucial to stay agile and on top of market trends and act with a sense of urgency.\n\n## How important is data and digital for customer experience?\n\nIn the last two years, when boomers became Zoomers, customer behavior and expectations have changed. We need to anticipate customers' needs and provide innovative and hyper-personalized solutions. To do that we embed digital, data and platform (DDP) in everything we do, so our services are seamless through digital automation, are need-based through data insights, and are offered to customers at the right place at the right time through open platforms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What's the next big thing you see in the insurance technology scene?\n\nMoving away from once-a-year exchanges to more meaningful, natural and frequent interaction with customers. With the latest 'ABCD' technology - artificial intelligence, Blockchain, cloud, and big data - we can create a new business model, offering engaging digital services at scale. That means in addition to selling a financial coverage policy, we provide value-added services first, such as Zurich's holistic wellbeing service, LiveWell, and Zurich's Risk Advisor App for our corporate clients.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, we're growing our offering of products and services to help customers transition to a net-zero emissions future, including an expansion of our commitment to underwrite renewable energy. We also announced interim targets for our investment portfolio in 2021.

Supported by the work of our committees and management, we are consistently re-evaluating our role in society and how Zurich can play its part in responding to the challenges of the years to come.\n\nMost importantly, we have a strong focus on ESG integration. We safeguard an ESG strategy that is not only robust and authentic, but also embedded across our businesses. This provides us with the credibility to have trustworthy dialogue on topics that affect society.\n\nOur ESG strategy is increasingly important to our employees, customers and investors. With this in mind, we took steps throughout 2021 to strengthen our commitments and will continue to review our position in 2022.\n\n## Board Changes\n\nAt the AGM on April 7, 2021, we welcomed Sabine Keller-Busse as a new Board member. Prior to the AGM 2021, Jeffrey Hayman had withdrawn his candidacy due to future full-time commitments.\n\nThe Board proposes to shareholders the re-election of all current members at the AGM on April 6, 2022, and the election of Peter Maurer as new Board member, whereby Peter Maurer shall assume the director role as of October 1, 2022 only (please see for further details the AGM invitation 2022).\n\n## Key steps towards a greener future\n\nFor instance, in 2021 we became a founding member of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance and signed up to reduce the carbon intensity of our underwriting portfolios to net-zero by 2050.\n\nWe followed this up with new underwriting guidelines for the oil and gas sector that build on our existing guidelines for thermal coal, oil sands, and oil shales. But exclusions are always a last resort. We believe the best way to progress towards net-zero goals is to engage with customers and investee companies and provide them with guidance and support to help them transition to a greener future.\n\nZurich also became the first insurer to offer a carbon-neutral equity fund for its life insurance customers and introduced new global measures to accelerate cuts in carbon emissions from our operations. In addition, we are expanding our insurance coverage for the renewable energy sector and strengthening our alternative energy underwriting capabilities.\n\n## Diversity remains a key priority\n\nAnother key priority for us is to have a diverse Board and Executive Committee, along with the diverse backgrounds of our employees and customers. During the last year, we continued to have a diverse Board, particularly from a gender perspective, with a female representation of 55 percent. For 2022, we anticipate a balanced gender representation, provided that our shareholders follow our proposal to elect Peter Maurer as a new Board member at the next Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\nFurthermore, two of our four Board committees are currently chaired by female members, and in the Executive Committee four women lead important business units.\n\n## Outlook for the year 2022\n\n2022 will be a special year for Zurich as we will mark our 150-year anniversary. We will spend time looking back through our history. Zurich has always proactively addressed societal concerns through philanthropy, internal policies and ESG risk assessments.\n\nWe will also take the time to consider the future - to consider how we can help create a brighter future together, and for all. It will require confronting climate change, leveraging the opportunities of a green recovery, and tackling societal inequalities.\n\nWe must balance this with the creation of sustainable value for all our stakeholders. This will be one of our focus areas as we set new targets and objectives for a strategy cycle that we will unveil in November.\n\nYou can rely on us to take decisions that support all stakeholders in the years ahead as we continue to be guided by our aspiration to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world.\n\nThank you for your continued trust, support and engagement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMichel M.

Structures, rules and processes are designed to enable proper conduct of business by defining the powers and responsibilities of its corporate bodies and employees. Our structures provide for checks and balances and institutional independence of the Board from the Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO) and the Executive Committee (ExCo) which together are responsible for managing the Group on a day-to-day basis.\n\nZurich's corporate governance principles are described in a number of corporate documents, in particular in the Articles of Association, the Organizational Rules and the Charter of the Committees of the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (Organizational Rules) (www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/corporate-documents). Zurich also complies with the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance (Swiss Code of Best Practice) issued by economiesuisse. The Governance, Nominations and Sustainability Committee (GNSC) regularly reviews the Group's corporate governance against best practice standards.\n\nEffective corporate governance is complemented by a remuneration system that fosters the right behaviors. Information on remuneration, shareholdings and loans to Board and ExCo members is contained in the remuneration report (see pages 84 to 117).\n\n## Supervision\n\nZurich is subject to insurance group supervision by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). The Swiss insurance regulation requires Swiss insurance companies and groups to establish and maintain strong governance and risk management systems, as well as effective internal control systems appropriate to their business activities. It prescribes the calculation of a risk-based solvency margin on a Group-wide basis and at legal entity level pursuant to the Swiss Solvency Test (SST). Amongst others, all material intra-group transactions must be reported to FINMA. In addition to the group supervision exercised by FINMA and its insurance supervision of the legal entities Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, Zurich Life Insurance Company Ltd, Zurich Reinsurance Company Ltd and Orion Legal Expenses Insurance Ltd., the insurance and other financial services subsidiaries of the Group are subject to the respective local financial market regulations.\n\n## Operational Group structure\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd, the Group's listed holding company, is a corporation organized under Swiss law with registered offices at Mythenquai 2, 8002 Zurich. Zurich's business is focused on providing best-in-class property and casualty, and life insurance products and services to individuals, small businesses, mid-sized and large companies.\n\nThe operational structure reflects the businesses operated by the Group and how these are strategically run to offer different products and services to specific customer groups. The Group is managed by regions, and in addition, Commercial Insurance, Zurich Global Ventures and Farmers in the U.S.:\n\n- - Through regions (APAC, EMEA, LATAM and North America), the Group provides a variety of property and casualty and life products to retail and commercial customers as well as reinsurance propositions. Each region is headed by a regional CEO.\n- - Commercial Insurance brings together the corporate and commercial insurance expertise worldwide under a single umbrella. It is organized as a global business and headed by the CEO Commercial Insurance.\n- - Zurich Global Ventures (formerly Global Business Platforms) was created on January 1, 2021 to globally accelerate customer centricity and the development of digital services in furtherance of the insurance business. It also comprises Cover-More and Zurich International (ZINT), which are embedded in the regions. As of January 1, 2022, a new unit Zurich Integrated Benefits Solutions (ZIBS) was established within Zurich Global Ventures, bringing together various existing businesses providing employee benefits (including, amongst others, ZINT's International Markets and Europe business). Zurich Global Ventures is headed by the CEO Zurich Global Ventures.\n- - Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, is not an insurance company. It provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges in the U.S. as its attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services. Zurich Insurance Group has no ownership interest in the Farmers Exchanges. Farmers Group, Inc. is headed by the CEO of Farmers Group, Inc.",

Further information on ZIG's shares can also be found under: www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares.\n\n## Authorized and contingent share capital\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the AGM approved a renewal of the authorized share capital for another two years (from April 2021 to April 7, 2023). Until and including April 7, 2023, the Board is authorized to increase the share capital by an amount not exceeding CHF 4,488,240 by issuing up to 44,882,400 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each (art. 5 bis ).

Share issuances from authorized share capital where the shareholders' subscription rights are restricted or excluded are limited to 14,960,800 shares (i.e., about 10 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2021).\n\nFurthermore, the share capital of ZIG may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 2,992,160 by issuing of up to 29,921,600 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each by the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion and/or option rights, which are granted in connection with the issuance of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'financial instruments') by ZIG or one of its group companies, or by mandatory conversion of financial instruments issued by ZIG or one of its group companies, that allow for contingent mandatory conversion into shares of ZIG, or by exercising option rights which are granted to the shareholders (art. 5 ter para. 1a). This contingent share capital corresponds to about 20 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2021.\n\nUntil and including April 7, 2023, the total number of new shares which could be issued from (i) authorized share capital under art. 5 bis para. 4 where the subscription rights are restricted or excluded, and (ii) contingent share capital in connection with financial instruments under art. 5 ter para. 1 where the advance subscription rights are restricted or excluded is limited to 14,960,800 shares (i.e., about 10 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2021).\n\nMoreover, there is an additional contingent share capital (art. 5 ter para. 2a) of CHF 409,509.20, representing 4,095,092 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, which may be issued to employees of ZIG or one of its group companies. This contingent share capital corresponds to about 2.7 percent of the total registered shares issued as of December 31, 2021.\n\nFor further information, see art. 5 bis and 5 ter of the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/ articles-of-association) and the audited consolidated financial statements, note 19 on pages 293 to 295.\n\n- 1 Under this program, BNYM issues the American Depositary Shares (ADSs). Each ADS represents the right to receive one-tenth of one share of ZIG. ZIG's ADSs are traded over the counter (OTC) and are evidenced by American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). Since July 1, 2010, ZIG's ADRs have been traded on 'OTCQX', an electronic platform operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol ZURVY. ADS holders are not treated as shareholders of ZIG and are not able to directly enforce or exercise shareholder rights. Only BNYM as depositary of the level 1 program may exercise voting rights with respect to instructions received from beneficial owners of ADRs.",

Nominees holding ZIG shares may for the benefit of, or as nominee for another person, be registered for up to 200,000 shares with voting rights, notwithstanding that the nominee does not disclose the identity of the beneficial owner. A nominee, however, is entitled to be registered as a shareholder with voting rights of more than 200,000 shares if the nominee discloses the identity of each beneficial owner and informs the beneficial owners about corporate actions, consults as to the exercise of voting rights and pre-emptive rights, transfers dividends and acts in the interests of and in accordance with the instructions of the beneficial owners.\n\nThere are special provisions relating to the registration and exercise of rights attached to shares held by BNYM in connection with the ADR program.",

Each share further entitles all shareholders to dividend payments (excluding treasury shares). The Board will propose to the shareholders at the AGM on April 6, 2022 a dividend of CHF 22 per share.\n\n## Voting rights restrictions and representation\n\nThere are no voting rights restrictions (other than set out under 'Limitations on transferability and nominee registrations', see page 46).\n\nA shareholder with voting rights can attend shareholders' meetings in person or duly authorize his or her legal representative, another person who need not be a shareholder, or the independent voting rights representative. Shareholders can order their admission card or authorize a representative either in writing or via the online platform of Computershare Switzerland Ltd.\n\nThe AGM elects the independent voting rights representative for a term of office until conclusion of the next AGM. The independent voting rights representative may be re-elected.\n\nZIG generally informs all shareholders at the beginning of the shareholders' meeting of the aggregate number of shares represented by shareholders or their representatives physically attending the meeting and the number of shares represented by the independent voting rights representative. However, in accordance with Swiss legislation passed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ZIG decided that shareholders could not personally attend the AGM on April 7, 2021 but only exercise their voting rights by instructing the independent voting rights representative in writing or electronically. ZIG informed its registered shareholders accordingly.\n\n## Statutory quora\n\nPursuant to art. 15 of the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association), the AGM constitutes a quorum irrespective of the number of shareholders present and shares represented. Resolutions and elections generally require the approval of an absolute majority of the votes represented, unless respective provisions in the Articles of Association (of which there are currently none) or mandatory legal provisions stipulate otherwise. Art. 704 of the Swiss Code of Obligations provides for a two-thirds majority of votes represented and an absolute majority of the nominal value of shares represented for certain important matters, such as a change of the company's purpose or domicile, a dissolution of the company and certain matters relating to capital increases.\n\n## Convening of shareholders' meetings\n\nShareholders' meetings are convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the external auditor and other bodies in accordance with the provisions set out in art. 699 and 700 of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Shareholders with voting rights representing at least 10 percent of the share capital may call a shareholders' meeting, indicating the matters to be discussed and the corresponding proposals. The invitation to shareholders is mailed to registered shareholders at least 20 calendar days before the meeting is held and, in addition, is published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce.\n\n## Agenda\n\nThe Board is responsible for setting the agenda. Shareholders with voting rights who together represent shares with a nominal value of at least CHF 10,000 may request, no later than 45 days before the day of the meeting, that specific items be included in the agenda. Such request must be made in writing, and must specify the proposals.\n\n## Registrations in the share register\n\nTo ensure an orderly process, the Board determines the date on which a shareholder needs to be registered in the share register in order to attend the shareholders' meeting. That date is published, together with the invitation to the shareholders' meeting, in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce.",

Zurich's independence criteria comply with applicable laws and reflect best-practice standards such as the SIX Exchange Regulation Directive on Information relating to Corporate Governance and Swiss Code of Best Practice. The GNSC reviews Board members' independence status annually and reports its findings to the Board for final determination. The GNSC checks the independence criteria before recommending a new Board member for election and, thereafter, for re-election on an annual basis. It confirms in particular that in 2021 and the past three years:\n\n- - no Board member (other than in their capacity as Board or committee member), member of their immediate family, or any other related party, received - either directly or indirectly - any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees;\n- - no Board members or any member of their immediate family, are or were employed by a member of the Group;\n- - no Board member is or was employed or affiliated with the external auditor;\n- - no Board member has had a material direct or indirect relationship with any member of the Group.\n\nUpon recommendation of the GNSC, the Board determined that, as of February 9, 2022, all Board members were non-executive and independent from management. For further information on the independence policy, please see art. 16.6 of the Annex to the Organizational Rules (www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/corporate-documents). Board members are also subject to rules and regulations to avoid conflicts of interest and misuse of insider information.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nIt is a key consideration for the Board to ensure that it continues to act as a strategic asset enabling anticipation of risks and opportunities as well as providing oversight and control particularly by preserving and increasing the Board's diversity.\n\nTo achieve this, the Chairman, supported by the GNSC, on a yearly basis leads a structured succession planning process involving an assessment of the Group's challenges and opportunities and the evaluation of skills, knowledge and expertise needed at present and in the foreseeable future. In 2021, the GNSC held a dedicated meeting sequence to discuss all these factors and the results of these discussions informed a search process that was assisted by an executive search firm and included the following:\n\n- - final definition of required background, skills and knowledge of possible candidates;\n- - identification of suitable candidates;\n- - meetings of shortlisted candidates with the Chairman and GNSC members;\n- - proposal of candidates by the GNSC to the Board to nominate candidates for shareholder election.\n\nAs part of this process, when identifying and proposing candidates as new Board members, the Board particularly puts great emphasis on: skills, expertise, diversity and background, interplay of a candidate's individual personality, expertise and experience with that of incumbent Board members, high values and integrity and ability to commit adequate time (for further information, see Nomination Principles in art. 15 ff. of the Annex to the Organizational Rules under www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/corporate-documents).",

The review focuses on the Board's composition, availability and engagement at the meetings; co-operation and culture; processes, particularly agenda setting and meeting conduct; the Board's interaction with the Group's executive management and the Board's collective or individual training needs. The review seeks to determine whether the Board and the committees function effectively and efficiently.\n\nIn its 2021 self-assessment, the Board focused in particular on the adequacy of its composition, culture, its adaptability during the COVID-19 crisis and the prioritization of topics. Based on a report of the results, the Board has determined appropriate steps to address the matters discussed.\n\n## Meetings\n\nDuring 2021, the Board held 10 meetings (of which 10 were partly attended by tele-/videoconference and seven were held over two days). Two meetings were fully dedicated to the discussion of strategy. Four meetings lasted four or more hours during the course of a day and three meetings lasted less than three hours on average.\n\nIn 2021, average attendance at Board meetings was 97.27 percent. In the fulfillment of their duties, the Board members spent additional time participating in Board committee meetings and preparing for meetings. Committee meetings lasted more than an hour and 30 minutes on average.\n\nDuring 2021, in view of the challenges posed by COVID-19, Board meetings were in part held virtually. In addition, several informal exchanges between Board members, in some instances with management participation, were facilitated.\n\nThe Board approved two circular resolutions.\n\n| as of December 31, 2021          |   Board of   Directors |   Governance,  Nominations and  Sustainability  Committee |   Remuneration  Committee |   Audit  Committee |   Risk and  Investment  Committee |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Minimum no. of meetings required |                   6    |                                                         2 |                         2 |               4    |                              4    |\n| No. of meetings held             |                  10    |                                                         6 |                         6 |               9    |                              8    |\n| No. of members  1                |                  11    |                                                         5 |                         6 |               4    |                              6    |\n| Meeting attendance, in %         |                  97.27 |                                                       100 |                       100 |              97.22 |                             97.92 |\n\n## Meeting attendance individualized\n\n| Joan Amble             | 10/10   | 4/4  4   | -      | -      | 7/8    |\n|------------------------|---------|----------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Catherine Bessant      | 10/10   | -        | 6/6    | 8/9    | -      |\n| Dame Alison Carnwath   | 10/10   | 2/2  5   | -      | 9/9    | 8/8    |\n| Christoph Franz        | 9/10    | 6/6      | 6/6    | -      | -      |\n| Michael Halbherr       | 10/10   | 4/4  4   | -      | -      | 8/8    |\n| Jeffrey Hayman  2      | 2/2     | 2/2  5   | -      | 2/2  5 | 1/1  5 |\n| Sabine Keller-Busse  3 | 7/8     | -        | 4/4  4 | -      | -      |\n| Michel M.

Various governance and control functions help to ensure that risks are identified and appropriately managed, and internal controls are in place and operating effectively. The Board is ultimately responsible for the supervision of these activities. The Board supervises management and monitors its performance through reporting and controlling processes. It receives regular and timely information on developments relevant to the Group as further described in this section.\n\nAlthough each governance and control function maintains its distinct mandate, the functions are closely aligned and cooperate with each other through a regular exchange of information, planning and other activities. This approach supports management in its responsibilities and provides confidence that risks are appropriately addressed.\n\nZurich uses the three-lines-of-defense model in its approach to enterprise risk management. This model runs through Zurich's governance structure, so that risks are clearly identified, assessed, owned, managed and monitored.\n\n## Three lines of defense at Zurich Insurance Group\n\nas of December 31, 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## First Line: Business Management\n\nThe first line of defense consists of business management and all functions except Group Risk Management, Group Compliance and Group Audit. The first line takes risks and is responsible for day-to-day risk management (i.e., risks are identified and monitored, mitigation actions are implemented and internal controls are in place and operating effectively).\n\nThe Group CEO and other executives inform the Board through regular reports, including on key performance indicators and other Group-relevant financial data, existing and emerging risks, important market developments, industry peers and other significant events. The Group CEO attends Board meetings ex officio. ExCo members are regularly invited to Board or Board committee meetings, while other executives attend these meetings from time to time. Most Board and Board committee meetings include private sessions without management participation.\n\nDuring 2021, the Chairman regularly met with the Group CEO. The Chairman meets from time to time with other ExCo members and management outside regular Board meetings. The other Board members do so as well, including meetings with the Group CFO and the Group CRO, in particular.\n\nThe Group has an information and financial reporting system. The annual plan for the Group, which includes a summary of financial and operational metrics, is reviewed by the ExCo in detail and approved by the Board. Full-year forecasts are revised, if necessary, to reflect changes in sensitivities and risks that may affect the results of the Group. Action is taken, where appropriate, when variances arise. This information is reviewed regularly by the ExCo and the Board.",

Group Compliance is responsible for:\n\n- - enabling the business to manage its compliance risks;\n- - being a trusted advisor;\n- - providing independent challenge, monitoring and assurance;\n- - assisting management to promote compliance culture and ethics.\n\nGroup Compliance is vertically integrated to support a global framework and led by the Group Chief Compliance Officer who reports directly into the Group CEO while maintaining functional independence as a second line of defense function. The Group Chief Compliance Officer has direct access to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and appropriate access to the Chairman of the Board.\n\nGroup Compliance provides an independent view on the key compliance risks to the business and performs independent risk-based monitoring and assurance activities, challenging the business. Group Compliance performs its activities according to the Global Annual Compliance Plan. Each Annual Compliance Plan (global, regional, local) is a risk-based plan and must be prepared on the basis of an independent forward-looking compliance risk assessment, considering both internal and external key risk drivers.\n\nGroup Compliance also provides compliance risk insight through relevant and targeted reporting. It provides the ExCo and the Audit Committee with insights into key compliance trends, issues and risks as well as on progress against the Global Annual Compliance Plan through quarterly reporting to enable the members of the respective bodies to take informed business decisions. The equivalent regional and local governance bodies receive insights into relevant compliance topics, including progress against the respective risk-based plans. These reporting flows ensure that the organization at all levels embeds the findings and activities of Group Compliance to safeguard against regulatory and business risk exposure.\n\nThe Group Chief Compliance Officer defines and issues compliance policies relevant to the Group and establishes appropriate processes and guidance. Group Compliance supports a strong compliance culture across the Group via training and awareness initiatives and maintains the global concerns reporting mechanism. Zurich encourages its employees to speak up and report improper conduct that they believe is illegal, unethical, or violates Zurich's Code of Conduct or our Group's policies. Employees are free to report their concerns to management, Human Resources, the Group's Legal department, the Compliance function, or through the Zurich Ethics Line (or similar service provided locally), a phone and web-based service run by an independent external provider. Zurich does not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports concerns in good faith.\n\n## Third Line: Group Audit\n\nThe role of Group Audit is to provide independent and objective assurance on the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's risk management, internal control and governance processes to the Board, the Audit Committee, the Group CEO and management, and to the boards and audit committees of subsidiary companies.\n\nThe Head of Group Audit reports functionally to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and administratively to the Group CEO. Group Audit has no operational responsibilities for the areas it reviews and, to ensure independence, all Group Audit staff report (via audit managers) to the Head of Group Audit. In some instances, country audit managers also have a reporting line to the local CEO to comply with regulatory requirements.\n\nGroup Audit develops a risk-based plan and continuously updates it as the risks faced by the business change. The plan is based on the full spectrum of business risks including issues raised by the Audit Committee, management and other stakeholders. The Audit Committee approves the plan annually and any changes to the plan are reviewed and approved quarterly. The audit plan for 2021 comprised 472 audits, addressing key risks and regulatory requirements, across the Group.",

Group Audit takes into consideration the work of other assurance functions. In particular, Group Audit coordinates its activities with the external auditors, sharing risk assessments, work plans, audit reports and updates on audit actions. Group Audit and the external auditors meet regularly at all levels of the organization to optimize assurance provision and efficiency.\n\nGroup Audit executes its plan in accordance with defined operating standards, which incorporate and comply with the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, issued by the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA). Group Audit ensures that issues identified by Group Audit, that could have an impact on the Group's operations, are brought to the attention of appropriate levels of management and that timely follow-up action occurs. The Head of Group Audit meets monthly with the Group CEO. The Audit Committee and audit committees of subsidiary companies are informed at least quarterly of important audit findings, including adverse opinions and status of mitigation actions by management. This is supported by the Head of Group Audit's attendance at each Audit Committee meeting and monthly meetings between the Head of Group Audit and the Chairman of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Audit Committee assesses the independence of Group Audit and reviews its activities, plans, organization, work quality and its cooperation with the external auditors. As required by IIA Standards, the internal audit function's quality is reviewed at least every five years by an independent qualified assessor. This review was conducted most recently in the second half of 2021 and reported to the Audit Committee in February 2022. The results confirmed that Group Audit's practices are generally conforming to the Institute of Internal Auditors Code of Ethics and International Standards, and Guidance prepared by the European Confederation of Institutes of Internal Auditing.",

This rotation is in accordance with the Group's updated policy on the rotation of the external audit mandate which adopts best practices from the European Union and requires a tender of the mandate every ten years going forward.\n\nEY assumes all auditing functions which are required by law and the Articles of Association (www.zurich.com/ investor-relations/our-shares/articles-of-association). EY is responsible for auditing the Group's financial statements and for auditing Zurich's compliance with specific regulatory requirements.\n\nIsabelle Santenac of EY is the global relationship partner and lead auditor. Thomas Fiepke, audit engagement partner, co-signs the auditors' report for 2021. Christian Fleig is the auditor in charge for the regulatory audit work. All of these partners took up office in 2021. The Group together with EY ensures that they are rotated at least every five years.\n\nThe shareholders elect the external auditor annually. The Board proposes to re-elect EY at the AGM on April 6, 2022 as external auditor for the financial year 2022. EY fulfills all necessary requirements under the Swiss Federal Act on the Admission and Oversight of Auditors and is admitted as a registered auditing company by the Federal Audit Oversight Authority.\n\n## Audit fees\n\nTotal audit fees (including expenses and value added taxes) charged by EY in the year 2021 amounted to USD 39.3 million.\n\nAudit fees are approved annually by the Audit Committee. Prior to the Audit Committee's approval, management reviews and validates EY's proposal, which is mainly based on an analysis of existing reporting units and expected changes to the legal and operational structure during the year.\n\nOnce the fees are agreed, they are further allocated to the countries and reporting units via a global allocation process with the allocations communicated to local CFOs and FAR Controllers. As the year comes to a close, actual fees charged are reviewed and agreed with the local CFOs. At all levels - Group and local - there is a clear understanding of the basis for the current year fee including the impacts of changes in scope or other factors. Unplanned overruns are reviewed and agreed with the business (responsible CFO or audit contact).\n\n## Non-audit fees\n\nTotal fees (including expenses and value added taxes) in the year 2021 for non-audit services, such as tax advice, audit-related services (primarily for Service Organization Control reports, non-audit assurance engagements and actuarial regulatory reviews) and other services were USD 16.8 million.\n\nThe Audit Committee has approved a comprehensive policy for non-audit services, which defines allowable and non-allowable non-audit services as well as approval limits for non-audit service mandates at the local and Group level. Allowable non-audit services may include tax advice, comfort and consent letters as well as certifications and attestations, to the extent that such work complies with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and does not compromise the independence or objectivity of EY. To avoid conflicts of interest, all allowable non-audit services need pre-approval from the Audit Committee (Chairman), the Group CFO, the Head of Group FAR or the local CFO, depending on the expected fee. The policy further requires, among other things, an engagement letter specifying the services to be provided.\n\nEY also tracks non-audit services and reports quarterly to the Head of Group FAR and the Audit Committee the extent of non-audit services provided worldwide.\n\nThe audit and non-audit fees of EY (for 2021) respectively of PwC (for 2020) were as follows:\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   |   2021 |   2020 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total audit fees                     |   39.3 |   44.3 |\n| Total non-audit fees                 |   16.8 |   12.9 |\n| - Tax advice                         |    1.6 |    0.7 |\n| - Audit-related services             |   12.9 |    5.9 |\n| - Other services                     |    2.2 |    6.3 |\n\nAudit and non-audit fees",

During 2021, the Audit Committee met with EY eight times (including two times before EY's election at the AGM 2021). The external auditors regularly have private sessions with the Audit Committee without management present. Based on written reports, the Audit Committee and the external auditors discuss the quality of the Group's financial and accounting function and any recommendations that they may have. Topics considered during such discussions include strengthening of internal financial controls, applicable accounting principles and management reporting systems. In connection with the audit, the Audit Committee obtains from the external auditors a timely report relating to the audited financial statements of the Group.\n\nThe Audit Committee oversees external auditor's work. It reviews, at least annually, the external auditors' qualification, performance and independence and reviews any matters that may impair their objectivity and independence. The review is based on a written report by EY describing the firm's internal quality control procedures, any material issues raised and all relationships between EY and the Group and/or its employees that could be considered to bear on their independence. The Audit Committee evaluates the external auditors' performance during their audit examination. It elicits the comments of management regarding the auditors' performance (based on criteria such as their understanding of Zurich's business, technical knowledge and expertise, etc.) and the quality of the working relationship (responsiveness to the needs of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and the Group and the clarity of communication). The Audit Committee reviews, prior to the commencement of the annual audit, the scope and general extent of the external audit and suggests areas requiring special emphasis.\n\nThe Audit Committee proposes the external auditor to the Board for election by the shareholders and is responsible for approving the audit fees (see page 79 for further information).",

The regulations for the Group's share-based long-term incentive plan, which apply to all of the plan's participants including ExCo members and a defined group of senior managers, provide that in case of a change of control, the plan administrator may at its discretion either roll over existing share obligations into new share rights or provide for consideration in lieu of share obligations, or provide for accelerated vesting and removal of sales-restrictions.\n\nThere are no further change-of-control clauses that would benefit Board members, ExCo members, or other members of senior management.\n\n## Close periods\n\nUnder Zurich's Group Policy on Dealing in Securities (the Policy), persons qualifying as 'Group Insiders' are prohibited from dealing in 'Zurich Securities' during periods Zurich has designated as 'Close Periods'. 'Close Periods' are those periods (of a minimum of 30 days) leading up to and including the trading day of the announcement of the Group's quarterly, half-year and annual results. In practice, Close Periods last approximately 40 days with a longer time span over year-end.\n\nIn addition, dealing restrictions during 'Prohibited Periods' apply to insiders who are involved in (potentially) price-sensitive projects. Outside of Close and Prohibited Periods, Group Insiders may deal in Zurich Securities with prior clearance from Group Compliance.\n\n## Persons in scope\n\nSenior executives (such as e.g. ExCo members, head of certain Group functions) and the members of the Board of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd (ZIG) and certain significant subsidiaries are deemed Group Insiders by reason of their positions.\n\nAdditional persons can be designated as Group Insiders based on the persons' exposure to potentially price-sensitive information regarding Zurich Securities. Zurich keeps a list of these individuals.\n\nFurthermore, Group Insiders must ensure that 'Connected Persons' (such as spouse, life or civil partner, minor child, financial advisor, affiliated company, etc.) do not deal in Zurich Securities during Close and Prohibited Periods.\n\n## Securities in scope\n\n'Zurich Securities' are 'Securities' of ZIG or of its subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. The term 'Securities' includes:\n\n- - Securities admitted to trading on a stock exchange or an institution similar to a stock exchange in and outside Switzerland;\n- - Securities traded on the primary (e.g., Initial Public Offering/IPO) and secondary market;\n- - Over-the-counter (OTC) financial instruments (e.g., ADRs, derivatives);\n- - Financial instruments deriving from Securities whose price is materially dependent (i.e., Zurich Securities weigh more than 20 percent) on the underlying Security, including debt instruments.\n\n## Exceptions\n\nDuring a Close or Prohibited Period, clearance to sell may be granted to the Group Insider if the Group Insider is not in possession of inside information about Zurich and there is an exceptional circumstance (such as a personal or family emergency involving a health matter or legal or financial emergency) in which selling Zurich Securities is the only reasonably available course of action for the Group Insider. The determination whether circumstances are deemed exceptional is made by the Group Chief Compliance Officer and the Chairman.\n\nFurthermore, provided the requirements of the Policy are met, periodic investments based on a pre-defined trading plan do not require clearance and may continue during Close and Prohibited Periods.",

These metrics remained unchanged even as uncertainty related to COVID-19 persisted into 2021.\n\nBusiness operating profit (BOP) of USD 5.7 billion, along with an increase of 4.1 points in the overall net promoter system (NPS) score measuring customer satisfaction, led to an achievement level of 105 percent of the target amount for the STIP pool relevant for the Executive Committee (ExCo). The overall STIP awarded across all the pools is 114 percent of the target amount for all STIP participants.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee continues to ensure that stakeholders' interests are reflected in remuneration decisions.\n\nThe target card framework of the ExCo and the wider leadership team, used to assess the individual performance component of the STIP awards, once again included both financial, as well as non-financial targets. These support the strategy and include non-financial targets related to customers, employees and strategic projects and accountabilities such as those with an ESG focus.\n\nFor the LTIP, no discretion was applied when determining the calculated vesting level of 200 percent of target, based on the performance during the period 2019-2021, as detailed in this report.\n\nWe value your input and in particular, your engagement on remuneration-related topics throughout the past year. You will see we have further enhanced our disclosures in this report, focusing on clearer communication of the metrics used to determine variable pay for the ExCo.\n\n## Our remuneration framework considers the interests of all our stakeholders\n\nZurich's remuneration framework is regularly reviewed to ensure it complies with regulatory requirements, supports our strategic objectives and incentivizes the right behaviors.\n\n## Short-term incentive plan (STIP) 105%\n\n## Long-term incentive plan (LTIP) 200%\n\nachievement level as a percentage of the target amount for the STIP pool relevant for the ExCo.

The remuneration system is embedded in the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework and is designed to not encourage or reward inappropriate risk-taking.\n\nBoard members receive fixed remuneration as an annual fee, of which the basic fee is paid half in cash and half in five-year sales-restricted shares which are not subject to the achievement of any specific performance conditions. Total remuneration for employees, including members of the Executive Committee (ExCo), comprises as applicable, fixed remuneration consisting of base salaries, pension benefits and other remuneration including employee benefits, as well as variable remuneration consisting of short- and long-term incentive awards. The Group's short-term incentive plan (STIP) and long-term incentive plan (LTIP) aim to align the remuneration architecture with the achievement of the Group's key financial and strategic targets, the Enterprise Risk Management Framework and operational plans, while considering the interests of key stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more: Pages 92-98\n\nThe illustration below shows a greater emphasis on variable remuneration elements, with a higher weighting on average toward the long term, for our most senior employees.\n\n## 2021 remuneration structure 1\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 At target, as a percentage of total remuneration.\n- 2  Considering all members of the ExCo that were active for the full year, including the Group CEO.\n- 3  Fixed remuneration includes base salaries, pension benefits and other remuneration.",

Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Zurich Insurance Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges as attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services. The Farmers Exchanges are owned by their policyholders.\n- 2   Dividend at transaction day exchange rate in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n- 3   The corresponding amount of total variable remuneration in Swiss francs is CHF 746m for 2021 and CHF 650m for 2020.\n\nAs can be seen from the metrics in the table, relative to Zurich's overall revenue and shareholders' equity, expenditure on variable remuneration remains relatively small.\n\nThe total variable remuneration for 50,292 employees across the Group in 2021, amounting to CHF 746 million, includes the following elements:\n\n- - The total expenditure on cash incentives to be paid for the performance year comprising the amount of the aggregated funding pools under the STIP, and the amounts to be paid under local short-term incentive plans.\n- - The one-off special COVID-19 payment communicated in the remuneration report for 2020, but made in 2021, equal to one-week of base salary, for approximately 30 percent of employees in the lowest career levels across the Group.\n- - The value of the target share allocations made in 2021 on the assumption that the LTIP allocations will vest at 100 percent of the target level in 2024 for performance over the three years 2021, 2022 and 2023.\n- - The total amount of sign-on payments 1 committed in 2021, regardless of when the payments are due, for people taking up their employment in 2021.\n- - The total amount of severance payments 2 committed in 2021, regardless of when the payments are due.\n\nCommission payments made to employed sales agents are not included in the total variable remuneration amount.\n\nIn determining the amount of total variable remuneration, the Board considers the long-term economic performance of the Group as well as other relevant factors. The average economic profit is calculated by subtracting the required return on economic capital, based on the weighted average cost of capital, from the adjusted BOP (the amount before interest and variable remuneration) after tax. In this respect, the Group has continued to generate economic profit over the long term which exceeds the actual expenditure on variable pay.\n\n- 1 Zurich defines sign-on payments as payments (whether paid immediately or over time) that are agreed on the execution of an employment contract. Sign-on payments may include compensation made prior to a person joining the company and providing any services (payments in advance) or compensation for benefits foregone with a previous employer (replacement payments). Payments in advance are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n- 2  Zurich defines severance payments as payments that are provided in connection with the termination of an employment relationship. Zurich does not include under the term severance payments, garden leave or similar payments for employees in jurisdictions where such payments are required by applicable law, or where they are based on contractual notice periods which conform with recognized market practice, or where they are non-contractual, but in line with recognized market practice. Zurich does include garden leave or similar payments however, that go beyond recognized market practice, irrespective of whether these are provided pursuant to an agreement or are ex gratia. Severance payments are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n\n## Key financial figures",

The remuneration system and practices are embedded in the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework and consider legal and regulatory requirements, as well as market developments.\n\n## Guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy\n\nThe guiding principles of the remuneration philosophy, aligned to Zurich's Remuneration Rules, are as follows:\n\n- - The remuneration architecture is simple, transparent, can be put into practice and considers the interests of key stakeholders such as customers, shareholders and employees.\n- - Reward decisions are made on the basis of merit - performance, skills, experience, qualifications and potential - and are free from discrimination toward or against particular diverse backgrounds. The remuneration system and practices ensure all employees have equal opportunities.\n- - The structure and level of total remuneration are aligned with the Group's risk policies and risk-taking capacity.\n- - The elements of remuneration for each individual reflect appropriate internal and external factors and are tied to long-term results for individuals who have a material impact on the Group's risk profile.\n- - A clearly defined performance and development approach guides employees throughout the year to achieve personal goals and exhibit behaviors in line with the Group's Code of Conduct, purpose and values, and this can be used to support remuneration decisions.\n- - Variable remuneration awards are linked to key performance factors which can include performance of the Group, countries, business units, functions, as well as individual achievements.\n- - The Group's STIP and LTIP, used for variable remuneration, are linked to appropriate performance criteria that are selected to support the execution of the Group's strategy. The overall expenditure on variable pay is considered in connection with the Group's long-term economic performance.\n- - The design of the LTIP links remuneration with the future development of performance and risk by including features for deferred remuneration, thereby encouraging participants to operate the business in a sustainable manner.\n- - Employees are provided with a range of benefits based on local market practices.\n\n## Elements of remuneration Total remuneration\n\nTotal remuneration for an individual employee and its composition may be influenced by factors such as the scope and complexity of the role, level of responsibility, risk exposure, business performance and affordability, individual performance, professional experience, internal relativities, external competitiveness, geographic location and legal requirements. Remuneration is benchmarked toward median levels in clearly defined markets which can be local, regional or global, and reflects practices in either insurance, financial services or general industry, depending on the role.",

Benefit levels are targeted toward the relevant market median. The Group Pensions Committee provides oversight and a point of focus and coordination at Group level in relation to the long-term financial and operational risk and governance relating to the Group's pension arrangements. In recent years, there has been a significant shift away from final salary defined benefit pension arrangements such that almost all new employees are now enrolled in defined contribution and/or cash balance type arrangements.\n\nThe Group also provides a range of other relevant employee benefits in line with the local market, for example life insurance, medical coverage and flexible benefits, and may also include distinctive Zurich components. Further, the Group operates several mobility-related policies to facilitate the movement of people across the organization.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nIncentive plans are designed to provide a range of award opportunities linked to levels of performance. Business and individual performance may result in remuneration levels above target for superior performance, and reduced levels that are below target for performance below expectations. Variable remuneration opportunities are provided to motivate employees to achieve key short-term and long-term business goals that support the execution of the Group's strategy. Further information on the Group's STIP and LTIP is set out below.\n\n## Short-term incentives\n\nShort-term (one-year) incentives are performance-driven based on the following design for 2021:\n\nShort-term cash incentives support employees to focus their performance on the achievement of key financial, customer and individual goals set at the beginning of the year. They are delivered primarily through the Group's STIP, which is utilized across the organization and in many countries covers all employees. In some countries, based on market practice in that location, only the most senior individuals participate. Determination of the final individual STIP award for the year ending December 31, 2021, is based on an individual's STIP target amount, the performance of the business in line with the pool an individual has been allocated to, and an individual's personal achievements in terms of goals and behaviors as set out in the overview on the next page. For employees below a certain job level, markets also have the option to base the award solely on an individual's STIP target amount and the achievement level of the relevant pool, provided a minimum standard of individual performance and expected behaviors has been demonstrated.",

This group generally includes the individuals with the highest levels of total remuneration. The LTIP aligns the incentives and behaviors of participants with the long-term interests of the Group and its shareholders. To further support this purpose, the individual hedging of any shares of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd is prohibited.\n\nIn alignment with the Group's risk profile and business strategy, and considering best practice principles among insurance companies, as well as views from proxy advisers and shareholders, long-term incentives are provided with a deferral element that takes into account material risks and their time horizon. Such deferred remuneration is structured to promote the risk awareness of participants and to encourage participants to operate the business in a sustainable manner. An overview of the LTIP for the performance period 2021-2023 is set out on the following page.\n\nDetails of the LTIP relevant for the 2022 vesting decision following the performance period from 2019-2021, can be found in the remuneration report for 2019 (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/results-and-reports), and the performance outcomes are detailed in the remuneration summary of this report on page 90.",

This amount is converted into DEUs based on the closing share price on the day prior to the dividend payment.

The performance criteria are set ahead of the performance period and reviewed by the Board annually to ensure alignment with the strategic and financial targets.\n\n| Performance  criteria       | Weight   | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 0%  vesting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | 50%  vesting   | 100%  vesting   | 150%         | vesting       | 200%  vesting   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| Relative TSR  position      | 1/3      | Considers Zurich's performance in comparison with  an international peer group of insurance companies  derived from the Dow Jones Insurance Titans 30  Index.

An adjustment of +/-25 percent to the calculated vesting level may be applied and this can be positive or negative. No discretionary adjustment was made to the calculated vesting level for 2022 following the 2019-2021 performance period.\n\nThe right to modify awards to reflect individual circumstances is reserved for the Group CEO, except for modifications regarding members of the ExCo where this right is reserved for the Board based on recommendation by the Remuneration Committee. An adjustment of +/-25 percent to the calculated final vesting level may be applied on an individual level prior to vesting. However, if performance under exceptional or unusual circumstances warrants it, exceptions to the +/-25 percent adjustment may be made. In this respect, Zurich reserves the right to adjust and even set the vesting level to 0 percent for an individual to reflect specific circumstances (e.g., in connection with a breach of internal or external rules) during the period prior to vesting. Any such adjustment is reserved exclusively for the Board based on recommendation by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Clawback and malus conditions\n\nVariable remuneration is subject to clawback provisions for members of the ExCo and also for additional participants in some jurisdictions as required by local laws and regulations, to allow for the recovery or forfeiture of awards. Malus conditions to reduce or eliminate awards are applicable to all STIP and LTIP participants. Clawback or malus conditions may apply for example, in cases of misconduct, violation of the Group's Code of Conduct or applicable laws, or where there has been a material financial restatement.",

Details on the votes can be found in the AGM invitation 2022 (www.zurich.com/en/investor-relations/shareholder-area/ annual-general-meeting) and in the respective sections of the remuneration report for the Board (page 105) and for the ExCo (page 111). Art. 18, 28, 32 and 34 of the Articles of Association outline the approach regarding the votes on pay, supplementary amounts for any new members of the ExCo during a period for which the remuneration for the ExCo has already been approved, performance-related remuneration for the ExCo, allocation of shares, contracts with Board and ExCo members, and loans and credits.\n\n## Remuneration and risk\n\nThe Remuneration and the Risk and Investment Committees meet jointly once a year to discuss a risk review of the remuneration architecture and the remuneration governance framework. The assessment of risk in making reward decisions, and the ability to apply risk adjustments and exercise malus and clawback, if required, are features of Zurich's remuneration framework. Group Risk Management evaluated the remuneration architecture in 2021 and reported that the remuneration architecture does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking that exceeds the Group's level of tolerated risk.\n\nTo help align remuneration with the Group's risk-taking capacity, Group Risk Management consults with other control, governance and assurance functions to provide the Group CEO with a review of risk factors to consider when assessing overall performance for the annual funding of incentive awards. The Group Chief Risk Officer is available to discuss these findings with the Remuneration Committee and the Board. The Group CEO considers Group Risk Management's assessment, amongst other factors, when proposing the STIP awards to the Remuneration Committee, which in turn makes its recommendation to the Board for final approval.\n\nAll leadership team roles are considered key risk-taker positions. The remuneration for key risk-taker positions includes STIP and LTIP, with a greater emphasis toward long-term incentives and therefore, deferred remuneration. Group Risk Management, together with other control and assurance functions, provide risk, compliance, and audit information about each key risk taker as part of the annual individual performance assessment and for the target cards of the leadership team, including the ExCo. This is considered when assessing performance and making reward decisions.\n\nThe variable remuneration of employees in control and assurance functions is structured to avoid conflicts of interest by linking to Group profitability metrics rather than the profitability of the business controlled by such functions.\n\nGroup Audit periodically assesses the operational implementation of Zurich's Remuneration Rules to verify that the remuneration architecture is adhered to across the Group.",

ExCo members achieve this through their participation in the LTIP and market purchases. Directors, the Group CEO and other ExCo members have a period of five years to meet their ownership requirements and the Remuneration Committee monitors compliance with these guidelines annually.\n\nAt the end of 2021, all Directors and all ExCo members who have served at least five years on the Board or the ExCo, respectively, met the required share ownership level.\n\n## Share dilution\n\nIn 2018, Zurich began purchasing its own shares on the market to fulfill share obligations for share-based compensation awards. Zurich further took additional measures to offset the impact of historic dilution from previously vested long-term share plans with the completion of its public share buyback program for cancellation purposes in 2018. On April 3, 2019, the AGM approved the cancellation of the 1,740,000 own shares of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 repurchased under the public share buy-back program. In March 2020, Zurich issued 852,140 new shares to fund the vesting of LTIP.

In addition, the information according to art. 663c of the Swiss Code of Obligations is being audited and disclosed as such in the remuneration report. All audited sections have been highlighted accordingly.\n\n## Remuneration and shareholdings 2021\n\nThe following section sets out the remuneration and shareholdings of members of the Board of Directors and members of the ExCo, as well as the remuneration of all employees.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\n## Directors' fees\n\nAs a global insurance provider, the Directors' fees need to be established at a level which enables the Group to attract and retain individuals with a long-term interest in Zurich's success and reflecting the diversity of the Group's employee and customer base. To assist in determining Board remuneration, an independent adviser carries out benchmarking studies on a regular basis. Zurich aims to set the remuneration of its Directors at the relevant median levels using the Swiss Market Index (SMI) as a basis. Adjustments to the Chairman and Vice-Chairman fees, and to the committee membership and chair fees, were proposed to shareholders and subsequently approved as of the AGM 2020. There was no change to the basic fee for the other Board members and half of this fee continues to be provided in five-year sales-restricted shares. Based on the role and the fee structure, fee levels are established for each member of the Board. The fees paid to Directors (including the portion provided in sales-restricted shares) are not subject to the achievement of any specific performance conditions.\n\nThe following table sets out the current fee structure. All Board members of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd are also Board members of Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, and the fees cover duties and responsibilities under both boards.\n\n|                                                                            | Fee elements   in cash   (CHF 000)   | Fee elements   in sales-  restricted   shares   (CHF 000)   | Total fees   2021  (CHF 000)   | Total fees   2020 (CHF 000)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Basic fee for the Chairman of the Board  2                                 | 1,000                                | 1,000                                                       | 2,000                          | 2,000                         |\n| Basic fee for the Vice-Chairman of the Board  2                            | 225                                  | 225                                                         | 450                            | 450                           |\n| Basic fee for a member of the Board                                        | 120                                  | 120                                                         | 240                            | 240                           |\n| Committee fee  3                                                           | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                             | 80                            |\n| Chair fee for the Audit Committee                                          | 100                                  | -                                                           | 100                            | 100                           |\n| Chair fee for the Remuneration Committee  4                                | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                             | 80                            |\n| Chair fee for the Risk and Investment Committee                            | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                             | 80                            |\n| Chair fee for the Governance, Nominations and  Sustainability Committee  4 | 80                                   | -                                                           | 80                             | 80                            |\n\n- 1 These amounts are for the period from AGM to AGM.

In 2021, the Board consisted entirely of non-executive Directors independent from management.\n\nWhere a Director is also a member of one or more subsidiary boards of Zurich, the Director is entitled to an additional fee of CHF 50,000 per annum plus CHF 10,000 per annum if he or she also chairs an audit committee of such a board. The fee structure for subsidiary boards can be modified if certain circumstances, for example, the additional time commitment to discharge the duties of a board member, warrant it.\n\nThe following tables set out the actual fees paid to the Directors for 2021 and 2020 in Swiss francs. In 2021, ten members served for the full year and two members served for part of the year. In 2020, eleven members served for the full year. The total aggregate fees for the calendar year 2021 amounted to CHF 5,510,000, which is higher compared with the corresponding amount of CHF 5,386,250 for 2020, due to the fee adjustments effective as of the AGM on April 1, 2020.\n\n## Audited\n\n| Directors' fees   | in CHF                     | 2021  1              | 2021  1              | 2021  1              | 2021  1   | 2021  1       | 2021  1   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|\n| 2021              |                            | Fee elements in cash | Fee elements in cash | Fee elements in cash |           | Basic fee     |           |\n|                   |                            | Basic                | Committee            | Chair                | Total     | restricted    | Total     |\n|                   |                            | fee                  | fee  2               | fee  3               | cash      | shares  4,  5 | fees      |\n|                   | M.

To assist with decisions regarding the remuneration structure and the mix of the individual remuneration elements for ExCo members, the Board conducts benchmarking studies on a regular basis, taking into account relevant market practices within peer groups, as well as internal relativities.\n\nThe remuneration structures and practices of a core peer group, consisting of the following insurance and reinsurance firms in the Dow Jones Insurance Titans 30 Index, are analyzed:\n\nAIG, Allianz, Allstate, Aviva, AXA, Chubb, Generali, Legal & General, Manulife Financial Corp., MetLife, Munich Re, Progressive Ohio, Prudential Plc, QBE, Swiss Re, The Hartford and Travelers Cos. Inc.\n\nThe core peer group is regularly reviewed by the Remuneration Committee. Further, the analysis is supplemented by additional benchmarking studies as appropriate, for example, reviewing practices of large SMI companies in Switzerland or companies of a similar size in other countries.\n\nThe distribution of the individual elements making up the total remuneration of the ExCo in 2021 is set out in the following chart and is based on the target values for performance-related remuneration. It shows an appropriate balance of remuneration elements, with a significant emphasis on performance-related remuneration (STIP and LTIP), particularly long-term, deferred remuneration.\n\n## 2021 remuneration structure 1\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nAt target, as a percentage of total remuneration.\n\n- 2  Considering all members of the ExCo that were active for the full year, including the Group CEO.",

The PSUs are valued using the closing share price of CHF 406.20 on the day prior to the allocation (second working day in April), assuming a vesting level of 100 percent in 2024. DEUs that may accrue during the performance period are not included.\n\nThe LTIP targets for the allocation in 2021 varied between 125 percent and 225 percent of base salary for ExCo members and the maximum vesting level, to be assessed in 2024, is 200 percent of the aggregate number of target shares (PSUs and DEUs).\n\nThe LTIP vesting level in 2022 for target shares allocated in 2019 is 200 percent. No discretionary adjustment was made to the calculated vesting level as outlined on page 90.\n\n## Replacement payments\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances where payments are made to new hires to replace forfeitures under the incentive plans of the previous employer, the payments tend to mirror the type and timing of the forfeited payments and can include cash payments and/or awards of restricted share units (RSUs) or PSUs. Where payments are made in cash, there is typically a clawback period if the employee leaves the company voluntarily during the first two years of employment. RSUs typically vest over three to five years following the date of allocation and are also credited with DEUs during the vesting period to compensate for any dividend paid. RSUs and associated DEUs are typically forfeited if the holder of such allocations leaves the company before the vesting date and the employment relationship terminates.\n\nNo replacement payments were made in 2021. In 2020, replacement payments made to the new members of the ExCo who took up employment with the Group during 2020, comprised of cash payments made in 2021 and RSUs vesting between 2021-2026.",

Differences in value between the initial estimated amount expensed in the income statement for the LTIP and the actual shares vesting in 2022, along with adjustments to the estimated value of shares vesting in 2023, depending on performance to date, are reflected in the 2021 consolidated income statement in line with accounting principles. For the 2019 and 2020 plans with shares vesting in 2022 and 2023 respectively, there was an increase of USD 81 million in the expense recognized in the 2021 income statement to reflect actual performance to date compared with original estimates. In 2020, there was an increase of USD 9 million to the expense recognized in the income statement to reflect adjustments due to actual performance.\n\n## Sign-on and severance payments for key risk takers\n\nThe following definition and principles for sign-on and severance payments apply:\n\n- -Sign-on payments are payments that are agreed on the execution of an employment contract (whether paid immediately or over time). Sign-on payments may include compensation made prior to a person joining the company and providing any services (payments in advance) or compensation for benefits foregone with a previous employer (replacement payments). Payments in advance are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo. Any replacement payments for members of the ExCo, including the Group CEO, must be approved by the Board based on a proposal by the Remuneration Committee.\n- -Severance payments are provided in connection with the termination of an employment relationship. Zurich does not include under the term severance payments, garden leave or similar payments for employees in jurisdictions where such payments are required by applicable law, or where they are based on contractual notice periods which conform with recognized market practice, or where they are non-contractual, but in line with recognized market practice. Zurich does include garden leave or similar payments, however, that go beyond recognized market practice, irrespective of whether these are provided pursuant to an agreement or are ex gratia. Severance payments are not paid to members of the Board or the ExCo.\n\nThe Group as a principle does not make any sign-on or severance payments, however, if circumstances which in the Group's interest warrant such payments, these can be approved through a clear governance process. Any such payment with a value of CHF 1 million or more is approved by the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee prior to the time the employment offer is made or prior to the time the severance payment is committed to.\n\nThe following table discloses sign-on and severance payments committed to key risk takers. Key risk takers are incumbents of Zurich's most senior positions, as well as positions that have a significant influence on the risk profile of Zurich. For key risk-taker roles where the incumbent is a member of the ExCo, no payments in advance and/or severance payments have been made. Replacement payments for the ExCo in 2021 and 2020 are included where such payments were made.\n\n| in CHF millions, for the years ended December 31   | 2021            | 2021                      | 2020 Number of   | 2020 Number of   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                                    | Amount  (CHF m) | Number of   beneficiaries | Amount  (CHF m)  | beneficiaries    |\n| Sign-on payments/number of beneficiaries           | 2.0             | 5                         | 3.1              | 8                |\n| Severance payments/number of beneficiaries         | -               | -                         | -                | -                |\n\nSign-on and severance payments for key risk takers",

In 2022, there will be a particular focus on aligning the metrics and approach with the targets to be defined for the next strategic cycle from 2023-2025. Legal, regulatory and market developments, along with risk considerations and a strong governance framework, will remain an important part of the review process.\n\nAlongside this, we will continue to explore additional ESG metrics within variable remuneration. The Group's STIP currently incorporates a non-financial customer metric to determine STIP funding for the majority of participants. Personal goals may also incorporate relevant ESG topics, supporting the Group's commitment to sustainability, to assess individual performance when determining STIP awards. Potential options to embed additional ESG metrics will be assessed ahead of the next strategic cycle. Considerations for this include the strategic relevance and materiality of any possible metrics for Zurich and its stakeholders.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee welcomed the engaging dialogue with investors and proxy advisers in the past year and looks forward to having the opportunity again in 2022. Shareholders are also invited to express their opinion on the remuneration report 2021, through an advisory vote at the AGM 2022. In addition they will have the opportunity to approve the maximum total amount of remuneration for the Board for the one-year period from the AGM 2022 - AGM 2023 and for the ExCo for the financial year 2023, in the binding votes. More information on these votes can be found in the AGM invitation 2022 (www.zurich.com/investor-relations/shareholder-area/annual-general-meeting) and in the relevant sections of this report.",

In 2021, for example, the Foundation agreed to support UNICEF's efforts to deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses to the most vulnerable.

We're therefore using the resources we have at hand to take bold climate action through our 1.5\u02daC future plan. Our efforts are reflected in our own operations, our underwriting and our investments. In March 2021, we presented interim climate targets for our operations, setting out our intention to reduce our own carbon footprint by 50 percent by 2025 and 70 percent by 2029. For our investments, we aim to cut 25 percent in carbon intensity for listed equity and corporate bond investments, and target a 30 percent cut for our direct real estate by 2025.

During the past year, we also focused on the development of ethical artificial intelligence solutions and invested in our digital capabilities to enhance customer experience.\n\n## Preparing our workforce for the future\n\nWithin our own organization, as part of our strategic pillar work sustainability, we introduced a new hybrid world of work. We placed an increased focus on health and wellbeing in the workplace. In 2021, we also developed our global wellbeing strategy and launched a wellbeing employee resource group through which employees can support each other with mental, physical, financial and social wellbeing.\n\n## Reporting on our progress\n\nSupporting our customers and society at large to build resilience against some of the most challenging environmental and social risks is at the heart of our purpose to create a brighter future together. To demonstrate the impact our actions are having we will provide more transparency about how we measure progress on our own sustainability ambition, how we respond to regulatory requirements and how we offer more sustainable solutions to our customers.

Independent assurance report\n\nGeorge Quinn Group Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Zurich Insurance Group\u00b9 is committed to creating sustainable value for all its stakeholders, and we aim to achieve outcomes that benefit both the planet and its people in the long term.\n\nAs an insurer, a key component of our success is the trust built through doing the right things, in the right way, and measuring and reporting the effects of those actions. Therefore, we recognize and strongly believe in the need for transparency to disclose clear, comprehensive, and high-quality information on our performance on key non-financial and environment, social and governance (ESG) indicators.\n\nThe sheer number of frameworks and inherent complexity in quantifying some of these issues makes this a journey for the private sector and supervisors, regulators, and governmental agencies. We endeavor to create a meaningful sustainability disclosure based on good practices, sustainability regulations and reporting frameworks. Accordingly, this report has adopted a combination of existing reporting frameworks to provide insights into the topics that are most material to our business and our key stakeholders. It provides insights into sustainability risks and opportunities our business faces while embedding compliance and transparency.\n\nThis integrated sustainability disclosure (ISD) is complemented by the stand-alone Sustainability Report 2021 2 , which provides more in-depth information on selected items.\n\nThis report contains our disclosure in line with the recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), which we have enhanced this year with a portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis. This analysis has provided us with a deeper insight into the challenges and opportunities associated with climate risk. It allows us to understand the resilience of our strategy to such risks. Read more about it in the Planet section, pages 134 to 166. Additionally, we have considered the 21 core World Economic Forum (WEF) Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standard for the insurance industry. Some of the indicators under these external frameworks are industry, entity or geography agnostic, precluding a one-size-fits-all situation. Within the report, therefore, we follow a 'disclose or explain' approach. We disclose the indicators that are most material to our business and our stakeholders in the ISD, while we address less material indicators in the index table with a short explanation.\n\nIn addition to these external frameworks, this report includes reporting on our targets under the three pillars of our sustainability strategy and the indicators we use to measure progress on them.\n\nThe indicators included in this report cover the period from January 1 to December 31, 2021, unless stated otherwise. Some data may be collected and reported as of an earlier date in the year. Certain cases are extrapolated for the remaining months of the year based on the Group's internal methodology and are indicated by footnotes in the respective tables.\n\nFor a detailed overview, please see the index tables related to the frameworks SASB, WEF IBC, Zurich Sustainability pillars, as well as the index table related to the key metrics of our planet section on our website 3 . Furthermore, we have used references to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), without adhering to the standards listed in the index 3 in its entirety.\n\n## Our ESG reporting monitors strategy execution, meeting stakeholders' needs while ensuring compliance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Zurich sustainability strategy and objectives\n\nStrategy execution metrics for our sustainability objectives (i.e., our 1.5\u00b0C future, confidence in a digital society, work sustainability)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting standards adopted; stakeholder relevance\n\nStandards that we decided to adopt and that are of relevance to our stakeholders, especially investors (e.g., WEF IBC, SASB)\n\n- 1 Comprising Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its subsidiaries (the Group or Zurich or we).\n- 2  www.zurich.com/en/sustainability/reporting-and-news/reports-publications\n- 3  www.zurich.com/sustainability/strategy/measuring-our-progress\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nReporting requirements, such as FINMA disclosure requirements on climate risks",

Planet\n- 5. Customers\n- 6. Employees\n- 7. Independent assurance report\n\nWe believe social responsibility and care for our planet are aligned with shareholders' interests. Sustainability is a business opportunity as well as an urgent global imperative. Our ambition is to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world. This means creating positive outcomes for all stakeholders, taking economic, social and environmental considerations into account.\n\n## 2.1 Our purpose\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur purpose is to create a brighter future together. We do not strive to realize a static ideal, but rather to be an enabler for evolution and continuous improvement. Over a century and a half, we have refined our business model to make the most of our resources and generate value in a way that\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nconsiders all our stakeholders and the physical and social environment around us. We are proud of our heritage and understand that protecting our reputation and our assets is critical to our long-term success. When looking to the future, we are confident we will thrive based on our tradition and grow based on our purpose.\n\nWe are convinced that living up to our purpose will strengthen our core business and have a positive impact on our performance as an underwriter and investor. With changing customer expectations and an increasing demand for social and environmental engagement, sustainability is increasingly becoming a driver for success. Evolving legislation and the increasingly visible impacts of climate change underline the urgency of the topic. We are supporting our customers who face these risks, and we are enhancing preventative advisory solutions to complement traditional underwriting services.\n\n## 2.2 Sustainability in everything we do\n\nTo ensure we invest our resources where we can make the biggest impact, we continuously work to identify new challenges and opportunities that arise. We strive to understand the environment around us and look for ways to capture the opportunities it presents for our business. We believe that taking an integrated approach is the key to our success, hence we consider sustainability in everything we do.\n\nWe are conscious of the impact we have on people and planet and consider this in our own operations, our investment portfolio, and our underwriting. To set a solid foundation, we have been working on the efficiency and sustainability of our own operations for a long time. In 2021, for example, we established interim targets toward a climate-neutral 2050 to support our climate strategy on the one hand, and focused on digitalization and internal growth as part of our focus on developing our people, on the other. We believe challenging ourselves and our employees will enhance our positive environmental and social impact.\n\nSecondly, we have been one of the early adopters when it comes to sustainable investment. To date, we leverage this expertise to engage companies on our portfolio in the net-zero transition. Finally, we see great opportunities in the field of underwriting and want to strengthen our focus on this to capture the value it holds for our business and our customers. We support our customers in risk prevention and mitigation, for example the increasing challenges of cyber security during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also became a founding member of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) in 2021, as part of our goal to accelerate the transition to a net-zero emissions future and embed sustainability into our underwriting activities.",

To engage all regions, we combine top-down and bottom-up initiatives. By taking a hybrid approach, we ensure all countries can contribute toward the same goals in a mutually empowering manner.\n\n## 2.2.1 Assessing materiality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe want to work together with our employees, customers, investors and society to create a brighter future. To do this, it is necessary to involve these stakeholder groups in our decision-making process - and to figure out what issues matter most to them. In 2018, therefore, we carried out\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na materiality assessment to understand which sustainability-related issues are most relevant to internal and external stakeholders. The assessment included both quantitative and qualitative analyses and was built on internal risk expertise, engagement with 10 different stakeholder groups, and insights generated from big data tools. Based on this, 21 sustainability issues were identified and prioritized.\n\nThe outcome of the 2018 assessment was used to support the identification of our three strategic sustainability pillars 1 : our 1.5\u00b0C future, confidence in a digital society and work sustainability.\n\nAs the relevance of these issues fluctuates over time, we decided to partially revise the matrix in 2021. More specifically, we identified issues for which relevance has significantly shifted during the past three years. Among other things, we considered changing customer expectations, and upcoming legislation in the diverse areas we operate in.\n\nBased on this revision, we identified three topics that were already highly material in 2018 and have been reinforced by events that happened during the past three years. We also identified three topics that were qualified as less material in the 2018 assessment but have gained significantly in importance since then. In general, the concept of interconnectivity is changing the picture. We strive to join the dots between different challenges and no longer look at them in isolation.\n\n1",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 2.2.2 Managing risks and opportunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo carry out effective sustainability risk management, we consider the impact of our company on the planet and society (inside-out perspective), as well as the impact of climate and society on our company's core business (outside-in perspective). This approach enables us to understand\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsustainability risks, such as climate change as a risk driver of the key risks in our risk taxonomy. The concept of double materiality is used to understand the risks associated with sustainability. The sustainability risk framework addresses the process of identifying, assessing and mitigating risks largely from an inside-out perspective, whereas other approaches, such as scenario-based climate risk assessment, are used to understand the risks from an outside-in perspective.\n\nFigure 4:\n\nDouble materiality 1\n\n## Financial materiality\n\nTo the extent necessary for an understanding of the company's development, performance and position...\n\nClimate change impact on company\n\nCompany impact on climate can be financially material\n\n## Environmental and social materiality\n\n... and impact of its activities\n\nCompany impact on climate\n\n## Company\n\n## Company\n\n## Primary audience\n\nInvestors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Primary audience\n\nCustomers, Civil society, Employees, Investors\n\n## Recommendations of the TCFD\n\nThrough our risk management framework, our approach helps to protect our company against financial and reputational risks, and it supports the identification of potential business opportunities. For the same reasons, ESG integration is a core pillar of our responsible investment strategy.\n\nTo support our business in mitigating risks and managing the inside-out impact of our company, we have established a systematic and integrated approach to identifying and assessing the potential impact of sustainability issues, as well as recommending proper response strategies. This approach is applied across all Group activities, and in particular, in investment management and underwriting.\n\nFigure 5:\n\nRisk management framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk identification\n\nFilter risks from various sources (ESG research, social and traditional media, NGOs, businesses) and identify those selected risks to go through our risk assessment process.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisk assessment by filtering risks through public commitments, role of insurance, underwriting risk assessment, market exposure assessment, etc. Our Group CEO approves a position statement on the risk, recommends business actions and takes reputational management considerations into account.\n\n## Implementation\n\nBusinesses locally implement mitigation actions and reputational management plans. Support available from experts across the Group and escalation follows normal governance procedures.\n\nWe have used our proprietary risk-profiling methodology since 2012 to prioritize key sustainability risks that need to be monitored across all our business transactions. These include:\n\n- - Respect for human rights, in particular avoiding business involving child labor, forced labor, poor health and safety conditions or unfair remuneration.\n- - Banned weapons, avoiding business involving the manufacture, sale, distribution or stockpiling of cluster weapons or anti-personnel mines.\n- - Dam construction, avoiding unacceptable social, political or environmental risks of specific dam construction projects.\n- 1 The image represents the double materiality perspective of the EU Non-financial Reporting Directive.

These risks' impacts and the strategies to manage them are disclosed through the TCFD disclosure in the planet section (pages 134 to 166).\n\n## 2.3 Involving our stakeholders\n\nWe understand that the success of our sustainability strategy greatly depends on the willingness of our stakeholders to be involved in, and contribute to, our ambitions. Our customers and employees are two very important stakeholder groups. Therefore, we provide details on our interactions with them in the customer and people section respectively pages 167 to 171 and pages 172 to 177. In addition, we frequently interact with, for example, regulators, NGOs and industry associations. In our stand-alone Sustainability Report 2021 3 , you can read more on the mutual benefits we gain from this.\n\nIn addition, we strive to involve our investors, suppliers, and vendors, and the communities in which we operate, in diverse ways.\n\n## 2.3.1 Investors\n\nSustainability continues to grow in importance for many of our stakeholders. As a responsible business, we have embedded sustainability goals into our corporate strategy, and we are dedicated to transparently communicating on our progress. We therefore invest intensively in consistent and open engagement with stakeholders, including investors and rating agencies.\n\nAs part of our outreach to investors, dedicated interaction between our Board and larger investors has been established to provide insights into our sustainability strategy and performance. We also actively contribute to investor and rating agency events. This gives us objective insights into our current performance and supports us in our journey toward a more sustainable future. Based on our experience, we have learned that engaging with investors and rating agencies allows us to increase awareness on issues and potential solutions on the sustainability agenda, and also helps us to maintain our leadership position in this rapidly developing area.\n\n## 2.3.2 Sustainable sourcing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur focus on expanding efforts to interact with partners in a way that supports our values, in combination with the challenges presented by the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nglobal pandemic (see assessing materiality; emerging topic 'responsible supply chain' (page 127), have reiterated the need for formalizing sustainability efforts in external partnerships. As part of this, we have established a Sustainable Sourcing Program 4 . This development aims to enhance the resilience of our supply chain, supports our aspiration to the Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C commitment 5 , and create a positive social impact.\n\nThe program comprises three pillars that address environmental, social, and ethical factors. Its objective is to embed these factors throughout the sourcing lifecycle, align suppliers with our values and be transparent about our expectations.\n\nSo that there is a clear foundation for the systematic integration of responsible business conduct in our supply chain, we have developed a Supplier Code of\n\nFigure 6: Sustainable Sourcing Program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConduct (SCOC). By asking our suppliers to comply with this code, we aspire to use our influence as a significant buyer of goods and services to accelerate the adoption of sustainable business practices amongst our suppliers.\n\nBy the end of 2022, we aim to have 75 percent of our managed procurement spend (MPS) 6 in compliance with, or exceeding, our SCOC expectations. We measure compliance by asking suppliers to complete a self-assessment.\n\n- 1 www.zurich.com/sustainability/governance-and-policies/exclusion-policies\n- 2  www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/responsible-investment-at-zurich.pdf\n- 3  www.zurich.com/en/sustainability/reporting-and-news/reports-publications\n- 4  www.zurich.com/en/sustainability/governance-and-policies/sustainable-sourcing\n- 5  UN Global Compact - Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C: www.unglobalcompact.org/take-action/events/climate-action-summit-2019/business-ambition\n- 6  The spend of approximately USD 2 billion annually managed by Zurich's Procurement and Vendor Management function according to the 2020 baseline on goods and services that are required to enable Zurich to maintain and develop its operations.",

We will continue to invite suppliers to carry out self-assessments during 2022 as we move toward our target of 75 percent by end of 2022.\n\nWe are working with the suppliers comprising the top 75 percent of our MPS to address any areas where they do not meet expectations and are seeking to agree contractual clauses to embed our standards. This ensures a continuing focus on sustainability for the benefit of our business, our customers and society. We take our sustainability engagement seriously, now and for the future. So, where engagement fails and suppliers cannot or refuse to embed the minimum standards, we will review the relationship and consider phasing them out to protect our effort in doing the right thing.\n\nAs part of our continuous efforts to improve processes and guidelines for managing sustainability issues in the supply chain, we are currently working on a new third-party governance framework (TPGF). The TPGF aims to establish a globally consistent framework of Group minimum standards that applies to the onboarding and management of our suppliers. The TPGF will provide a risk-based approach for embedding sustainability in a consistent way across our supply chain.\n\n## 2.3.3 Responsible tax 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe aim to be recognized as a responsible member of the communities in which we operate and contribute to their prosperity. Being a responsible taxpayer is one of the ways we support their economic and societal development. We consider effective and efficient tax compliance to be\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na key objective and allocate significant resources to ensure that the tax affairs of the Group are sustainable, well governed and transparent.\n\nOur approach to tax is guided by our purpose - create a brighter future together - and is supervised by the Board and executed by members of the Executive Committee (ExCo).

The Foundation has continued to support the most vulnerable by providing tailored grants to support local disaster relief initiatives identified by our business units. Our employees also went above and beyond to support vulnerable people affected by the various natural hazards, mobilizing their network. These collective efforts led to results of which we are proud, with some of the highlights for 2021 being:\n\n- - A global fundraising campaign, engaging our employees and all business units to support UNICEF's efforts to deliver COVID-19 vaccines to low- and middle-income countries for the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.\n- - Significant developments of the Foundation's 'Adapting to Climate Change', 'Improving Mental Wellbeing' and 'Enabling Social Equity' activities with new local grants and new global partnerships signed.\n- - Seventeen new local grant programs to support projects under the Foundation's strategic areas.\n- - Sixteen Community Hero Awards presented to recognize Zurich employees, who are going above and beyond to support their communities.\n\nIn addition to the work driven by the Foundation, our local business units also hold smaller budgets to account for local needs and priorities.\n\n## Table 1:\n\nEmployee fundraising and volunteering 2020 figures 2, 3\n\nTable 2:\n\n|                                                        | 2020   | 2019    | Change      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|-------------|\n| Fundraising and donations (USD millions)  4            | 2.5    | 2.3     | 10%         |\n| Total time volunteered by workforce (business hours)   | 38,830 | 129,702 | (70%)       |\n| of which skills-based hours                            | 19,485 | 31,463  | (38%)       |\n| Workforce actively volunteering (% of total headcount) | 9.3%   | 20.9%   | (11.5 ppts) |\n\nCharitable cash contributions 2021 figures (USD millions)\n\n|                                  | 2021   | 2020   | Change   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Charitable cash contributions by |        |        |          |\n| Zurich business units  5         | 15.6   | 31.9   | (104%)   |\n| Charitable cash contributions by |        |        |          |\n| Zurich to Z Zurich Foundation  6 | 43.8   | 42.7   | 3%       |\n\nPlease note that parentheses around percentages or points indicate a reduction.\n\n- 1 Note: Zurich Insurance Group and its employees are contributing through fundraising, volunteering and cash contributions apart from the community investment activities carried out by the Foundation.\n- 2  All figures exclude Farmers Exchanges.

It is intergenerational, international, and interdependent. We strive to be a leader in helping the world better manage climate risk and improve resilience to the adverse consequences of climate change.\n\nSignificant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required to achieve the outcomes of the Paris Agreement, with current political will as demonstrated in COP26 falling short of what is required to achieve a 1.5\u00b0C future. Through engagement and collaboration with our stakeholders, we remain committed to aligning our underwriting activities, our investment activities and our own operations with a 1.5\u00b0C future. The risks and opportunities associated with climate change affect our products, services, and operations. Understanding, measuring, and managing these impacts - while seizing the opportunities that arise from the transition to a climate-neutral world - is important to sustainable value creation for all our stakeholders.\n\nThis section presents our disclosure in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). It outlines our understanding of potential climate risk impacts to our insurance and investment activities and an assessment of the resilience of our strategy to climate change risk. Also outlined is the governance we have established to make climate and sustainability an executive-level responsibility, our climate risk management processes and finally the metrics and targets we have implemented to track delivery of our stated targets. While climate change forms the focal point of this section, we are dedicated to environmental aspects in a broader sense.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more about our broader approach to sustainability\n\nin our Sustainability Report 2021\u00b9 and on www.zurich.com/sustainability\n\n## Our goals\n\n- 1.

Innovating for sustainable solutions\n\nWe believe insurance is key to facilitating the change required to achieve the low-carbon transition. We work with customers and collaborate with public and private organizations to enhance resilience and advocate for solutions to prevent or minimize damage and harm from climate-related perils. We develop insurance and risk management solutions for new technologies, business models and approaches that are needed to achieve a climate-neutral economy. We also use capital markets to search for and fund solutions to many pressing social or environmental issues. We apply our leading impact investing approach to build a portfolio of green impact investments that helps avoid five million tons of CO2e per year. We are working with the NZAOA to increase the pipeline of investment opportunities in climate solutions that are suitable for institutional investors.\n\n## Unit-linked sustainability solutions\n\nWe launched a set of innovative unit-linked sustainability solutions that leverage our responsible investment expertise for the benefit of our unit-linked customers. For example, we launched an industry-first Carbon Neutral World Equity Fund 1 that combines a low-carbon investment strategy with carbon offsetting. The fund is available in Germany, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland, with rollout to additional markets expected in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read more about our unit-linked funds\n\nin our Sustainability Report 2021\u00b2, section Customer\n\n## Climate risk solutions\n\nTo enhance our customers' ability to manage transition risk, we have strengthened our support for renewable energy through the addition of specialist roles within the organization to help manage and develop risk positions. This will help ensure we maintain a balanced portfolio, keeping in mind the potential for higher risks associated with renewable energy construction projects.\n\nWe have expanded our existing natural hazards risk advisory service to address customers' physical climate change risks. As part of our Climate Change Resilience Services (CCRS) 3 , a dedicated team of climate risk experts helps businesses better understand how climate change risk may affect their operations, strategy, and financial position and ultimately strengthen their resilience to climate risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our CCRS\n\nin our Sustainability Report 2021\u00b2, section Customer\n\n## Measuring sustainable solutions based on an internal definition\n\nIn 2021, we established an internal definition of sustainable solutions and measured their associated revenue for the first time. Those stringent criteria have been thoroughly assessed through an internal process to be qualified as sustainable solutions. Meeting those criteria are also a pre-requisite to promoting a product as sustainable.\n\n## Read more about our definition and progress\n\n- in the metrics and targets section, pages 157 to 158\n\n## Fostering internal innovation\n\nTo foster innovative thinking internally, we set up a community of practice focusing on knowledge sharing and the development of customer-facing solutions to support the transition (mobility, green consumerism, energy, carbon and sustainable infrastructure). We encourage our workforce to engage in efforts to reduce our operational footprint and in 2021 established an internal carbon fund to support this objective. Governed by the SLC, this fund supports the implementation of initiatives proposed by employees and intended to address operational emissions and ensure our continued carbon neutrality.

Deeply understanding and integrating climate risk into the way we conduct business\n\nUnderstanding and managing climate impacts is an important aspect of maintaining our long-term profitability. Our approach to climate risk is part of our Group-wide risk management process. It is managed in a way that is consistent with other risks to which the Group is exposed. We are integrating assessments of the evolving physical and transition risk landscape into our underwriting and investment strategies.\n\n## Natural catastrophe modeling\n\nTo manage our climate risks more effectively, we are investing to improve our understanding of them, with modeling the effects of physical risk on our portfolios as a key focus area. While climate change models are constantly improving, they remain less accurate at the smaller spatial resolutions needed for a detailed analysis of the impact of natural catastrophe changes on our portfolio. In contrast, traditional commercial catastrophe models that form the basis of our current modeling are typically based on historical data and hence would not reflect future changes in trends. For this reason, we have started to combine climate change scenarios and natural catastrophe models to complement our Zurich view framework with a view of climate change, and to integrate this view into our accumulation risk and peril-region modeling.\n\n- Read more about natural catastrophe modeling\n\nin the managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes section, page 155\n\n## Portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis\n\nA deep understanding of potential medium- to long-term impacts of climate change risk to our underwriting and investment portfolios is fundamental to formulating appropriate strategic responses. We employ scenario analysis at the portfolio level to develop such an understanding. Our first exploratory scenario-based climate risk assessment, performed in 2021, considered outcomes from 2030 onward, with impacts quantified where possible. Outcomes of this analysis are used to determine appropriate responses and ensure the resilience of our strategy.\n\nWe view disclosure of the outcomes of these processes in line with the TCFD recommendations as a critical proof point to demonstrate our understanding and management of this risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead more about the outcomes of our first scenario-based climate risk assessment\n\nin the climate risk assessment 2021 section, pages 144 to 152\n\nRead more about how we have integrated scenario analysis into our risk management processes in the portfolio-level scenario-based climate risk assessment section, pages 153 to 154",

Accordingly, our climate-related strategy must be understood as feeding into a broader sustainable approach to investment management.\n\n## Our responsible investment approach as an asset owner and manager\n\nResponsible investment can mean different things to different people. We have primarily chosen to pursue it in three ways:\n\n- - ESG integration: Besides examining financial performance, we also assess environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors when analyzing individual investments and investment managers. We consider these sustainability risks and opportunities when we decide whether to buy or sell assets.\n- - Impact investing: We fund institutions or projects that, while generating a safe, adequate return on our premiums, also generate targeted and measurable positive environmental or social impacts. More specifically, we are aiming to build an impact investment portfolio that helps avoid 5 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions and benefits 5 million people every year.\n- - Advancing together: Responsible investing is becoming more sophisticated. We are glad to play a leadership role in developing new and innovative ways to measure impact, scale sustainable investment markets and practices with integrity, and promote climate action - working together with a broad group of stakeholders.\n\nWe apply a holistic responsible investment strategy across all our investments. Our three main ways of managing our portfolio responsibly, as described above, are supported by a variety of other technical approaches such as active ownership, selective exclusion screens and a net-zero by 2050 decarbonization target. This enables us to apply the appropriate responsible investment approach to each individual asset class. In 2021, nearly all of our own assets were managed by a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) or asset managers meeting our requirements for responsible investment, giving us confidence that these assets are managed in line with our strategy. We also believe that we can achieve the best outcomes when we specify the responsible investment management approach used on an asset class level.\n\nAs the graph below illustrates, every asset class is covered by at least one element of our responsible investment approach. The graph is a simplified visualization of our holistic responsible investment strategy, comprising a variety of tools we match with the asset classes where they have the most practical influence.\n\nFigure 8: Our holistic responsible investment approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Read more about our holistic approach to responsible investment on our website\u00b9\n\n- * Signatory to the PRI or fulfilling Zurich minimum requirements.",

Climate-related physical risk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate-related physical risk\n\n## Physical risk\n\n## Acute physical risks\n\n- -  Tropical and extra-tropical cyclones\n- -  Severe convective storms\n- -  Hail\n- -  Floods (riverine, pluvial, storm surge)\n- -  Heatwaves\n- -  Droughts\n- -  Wildfires\n\n## Chronic physical risks\n\n- -  Sea level rise\n- -  Variability in temperature\n- -  Variability in precipitation\n- -  Water stress\n\n## Impact channels\n\n## Changes to extreme weather events\n\n- -  Changes in severity of events\n- -  Changes in frequency of events\n- -  Geographic shifts of events\n\n## Land degradation\n\n## Changes in productivity\n\n- -  Agricultural production\n- -  Labor productivity\n\n## Economic impact\n\n## Individual companies\n\n- -   Changes in revenue and costs from impacts on workforce and production assets\n- -Increased  operating costs for adaptation measures\n- -   Changes in revenue and costs from changes in supply chain costs and reliability\n- -   Write-offs and early retirement of assets\n- -   Increased costs of capital\n\n## Macroeconomy\n\n- -Higher  infrastructure costs\n- -   Increased disaster relief and recovery costs\n- -   Changes in GDP and growth rates\n- -Changes  in borrowing costs\n- -Interest  rates changes\n\nThere is unequivocal scientific consensus that human greenhouse gas emissions are leading to an increase in global surface temperature and that this is driving changes in climate and weather systems across the globe. The Working Group I contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report, released in August 2021, provided further evidence that changes in climate extremes can already be attributed to the humaninduced increase in global surface temperature, and that continuing emission trends will further exacerbate the direction of many of the emerging trends. Overwhelmingly, these developments will bring negative economic and societal impacts as extreme weather events increase in severity and frequency or undergo geographic shifts.\n\nThe scientific understanding of how weather events will respond to climate change varies greatly, but there is high confidence that further temperature increases will accelerate sea level rise due to thermal expansion and melting of glaciers and icesheets. It will also lead to more extreme temperatures, heatwaves, and droughts, impacting agricultural production and human productivity. As the warming atmosphere will also intensify evaporation, more extreme precipitation and variability in the global water cycle is seen as highly likely. There is less certainty around how other weather events will react to climate change, such as tropical and extra-tropical cyclones, severe convective storms and hail. Secondary effects of climate change can also have negative impacts, such as when extreme heat and drought lead to more wildfires and the combination of sea level rise and changes in hurricane intensity or tracks lead to higher storm surge damage.\n\n## Impact to demand and loss profiles\n\nUp to 2030, we expect climate change-driven changes to physical risks to become increasingly relevant, but not yet to become a dominant loss driver over and above what is currently embedded into our risk appetite. We expect the inherent volatility and natural variability of extreme weather events and socioeconomic trends will continue to have a stronger influence on loss experience. Natural variability comes both from random fluctuations of extreme but rare events and multi-year variations in regional climate systems, such as the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation or AtlanticMultidecadal Oscillation. This variability is also embedded in historic loss trends and taken into account in our pricing and capital management.\n\n## Impact to insurer's balance sheet\n\n## Liabilities (insurance)\n\n- -   Changes in and shift of demand for products and services across geographies/ sectors/ lines of business\n- -   Changes in loss ratios and profits\n- -   Changes in loss frequency\n- -   Changes in loss severity\n\n## Assets (investments)\n\n- -Valuation  changes\n- -   Changes in default rates",

Independent assurance report\n\nSocioeconomic trends such as increase in asset values and accumulation through population growth and concentration in urban areas also contribute to increases in losses over time. The impact of such trends is considered in pricing and modelling, such that annual policy renewals provide mitigation against increasing physical risks for short-tail business and mitigate transition risk to the underwriting portfolio.\n\nThrough certain lines of business, we can be directly impacted by the changes in physical risk caused by climate change. Increases in severity and frequency of natural catastrophes such as tropical cyclones, flood or hail can lead to higher losses by customers that are covered under our property policies. More droughts and extreme precipitation can also impact losses in our agriculture insurance. Other lines are less sensitive to physical risk, and within these, only a minority of our losses are driven by natural catastrophes (see the current exposure to physical risk section, pages 142 to 144).\n\n## Impact through valuation changes\n\nThe physical impacts of climate change on the built environment are becoming more significant. With their locations fixed, buildings themselves may be at risk of suffering significant damage costs from climate change impacts. We currently explore possibilities to assess physical risks on property level by using our risk model on catastrophes and integrating data into our central portfolio management system.\n\nThe valuation of assets in our investment portfolio can also be affected by direct and indirect exposures to physical risk. Businesses will be directly affected through the impact on their costs and revenues, with a potential for supply chain disruptions and asset write-offs. The vulnerability of nations to physical risk, including through costs associated with infrastructure and adaptation measures, or through disruptions and vulnerability to extreme weather events, can also have an impact on the valuation of sovereign debt.\n\n## 2.

This will in turn affect demand for insurance from shrinking sectors. The transition will also shift demand toward low-carbon technologies and products, creating opportunities for companies that provide new solutions or are able to reduce their emissions more efficiently than competitors. The aggregate effect of transition risk will greatly vary across individual actors, depending on their detailed business models, assets, and transition strategy, complicating the assessment of aggregate transition impacts.\n\n## Economic impact\n\n## Individual companies\n\n- -  Lower product margins\n- -More  operational break-downs\n- -   Early write-offs and stranded assets\n- -  Changes in borrowing costs\n- -   Higher sales volumes and profits for companies providing low-carbon products and services\n\n## Macroeconomy\n\n- -   Changes in GDP and growth rates\n- -   Changes in borrowing costs\n- -   Interest rates changes\n\n## Impact to insurer's balance sheet\n\n## Liabilities (insurance)\n\n- -   Changes in and shift of demand across geographies/sectors/ lines of business\n- -  Changes in loss frequency\n- -  Changes in loss severity\n\n## Assets (investments)\n\n- -  Valuation changes\n- -  Changes in default rates",

Independent assurance report\n\nOn a portfolio level, for both our proprietary investments and underwriting, there will be winners and losers in any transition scenario. There will also be aggregate macro effects arising in a transitioning scenario, including the impact on economic activity, inflation and potentially also government borrowing costs.\n\nAs new policy measures and technologies are rolled out, uncertainties around their effectiveness and unintended consequences are likely to increase, with higher market volatility, and uncertain loss ratios among possible outcomes. Transition risk will have high dependencies on how predictable policy responses are and the time available for the economy to decarbonize. More disruptive impacts can be anticipated with a faster transition.\n\n## Impact through valuation changes and other drivers\n\nIn the commercial real estate sector, transition risk will manifest from the need to adhere to tighter policies, carbon and energy costs, market preferences and challenges to achieve energy efficiency, and will threaten to impact asset values.\n\nThe transition will also bring legal or litigation risks. Carbon intense energy producers are already defending lawsuits seeking to hold them accountable for their alleged historical contribution to CO2e emissions. This current litigation could expand to other industries whose operations contribute to CO2 or other climate-impacting emissions. Companies may be sued for failing to disclose climate-related risks, for failing to mitigate the impacts of their activities on climate change, for allegedly misrepresenting their level of climate impact, or for failing to adapt to the changing climate. Asset managers could be sued for financing climate change-inducing activities, or for inadequately driving emission reductions in their portfolios.\n\nThe global transition to a greener society will also bring with it new and emerging technologies that could potentially present unanticipated risks and new environmental concerns from both a resourcing and disposal aspect. Extreme weather events could present new risks to employers regarding worker safety or to companies engaged in building design, engineering, and construction. Governments could enact laws seeking to hold companies accountable for the climate impact of their supply chains.\n\n## 4.1.3 Climate risk assessment 2021\n\n## 1. Current exposure to physical risk 1\n\nCurrent exposures to physical climate risk are expressed through average expected loss (AEL) and probable maximum loss (PML). Note that PML is a tail metric that looks at severe unexpected outcomes as opposed to AEL that provides a view on the expected. The PML is driven by different peril regions compared to the AEL.\n\nModelled exposures are shown below. 2 Our approach to modelling is discussed further in the managing risks from climate-related natural catastrophes section (page 155). We highlight how various drivers including exposed insurance portfolio and vulnerability changes, model updates, exposure data quality, foreign exchange rates and reinsurance can influence natural catastrophe modelling output (e.g., AEL, PML) over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Average expected loss\n\nAverage expected losses for top five peril regions in USD millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(hail and tornado)\n\nOur modelled AEL from climate-related natural catastrophes provide an indicator of our current exposure to perils that might be affected by climate change. The AEL analysis above reflects the current top five peril regions in the Group, net of reinsurance, before tax and excluding unallocated claim adjustment expenses. This analysis helps us manage risks related to insuring these perils, such as accumulation risk. Risk appetite limits by peril region are in place and exposure is currently within appetite.\n\n- 1 Countries comprising the peril regions referred to here are as follows:\n- - Central Europe Hail: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxemburg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.\n- -  Europe Wind: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Guernsey, Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.\n- -  Europe Flood: Austria, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and the UK, plus other small nations like Guernsey, Isle of Man, Jersey, San Marino and Vatican. -  CB, MX and US Hurricane: Caribbean, Mexico and the U.S.\n- 2  Results from the Q4 2021 Group Cat Model are presented. There are timing differences in the underlying exposures considered in this analysis (underlying exposures by peril region are generally as at June or September 2021, and in exceptional cases as at September or December 2020).\n- 3  The geographic scope is extended when compared to 2020 TCFD to include correlated exposure in the Caribbean (CB) and Mexico (MX) .

Planet\n\n- 5.  Customers\n- 6.  Employees\n- 7. Independent assurance report\n\nAn important aspect of our proprietary view on natural catastrophe risk is the evaluation of patterns and trends in catastrophe activity with time. Natural variability of event activity is an integral part of our view on natural catastrophe risk, as are statistically significant trends that may be detectable in our claims experience or credible, conclusive modeling of past, present and future climate as a driver of loss activity. We regularly revisit our risk views on climate-related perils in order to reflect trends in the hazard, whereas exposure trends are naturally captured by exposure data updates. Natural variability is at the same time evaluated and kept up-to-date as part of the regular reviews of our natural catastrophe risk view, which underpins the structuring and purchase of reinsurance along with the profitability assessment and strategic capacity allocation for risk assumed from customers.\n\nWe follow a gross-line underwriting strategy and focuse substantial time and resource on ensuring risk-adequate underwriting and pricing of the business we assume up-front, including consideration of potential climate changeinduced trends. Reinsurance is used as a means to maximize diversification of net retained risks and to protect shareholders against earnings volatility. We engage with a core panel of reinsurance partners to secure the required capacity at sustainable pricing over the medium term. Given our financial strength, we have the option to weigh the benefits and cost of reinsurance against other forms of risk financing and thus adapt to supply-side changes in the reinsurance market as a potential consequence of the macroeconomic response to climate change adaptation.\n\n## 2. Forward-looking scenario analysis Approach\n\nOur assessment of climate risk leverages both our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology and scenario analysis. 1 While Total Risk Profiling\u2122 offers a short term (1-3 years) qualitative risk assessment, scenario analysis allows us to assess the strategic implications of climate change over the medium (up to 10 years) and longer term (to 2050) and improve our ability to assess the resilience of our business model to potential climate risks.\n\nThe scenarios used to analyze our underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios are drawn from the NGFS suite, with scenarios chosen to cover a relevant set of emissions pathways and modelled to closely incorporate specific attributes required as part of the Bank of England Climate Biennial Exploratory Scenario (CBES) exercise. 2 The emissions pathways of the selected scenarios correspond broadly to representative concentration pathways (RCP) 2.6 and RCP 6.0. 3 The selected scenarios afford a broad analysis of potential risks and opportunities, covering high and low physical and transition risks. As shown below, the no additional action (NAA) scenario primarily explores physical risks from climate change where no new climate policies are introduced, while both early- and late-action scenarios consider alternative routes to net-zero emissions by 2050, and as such are aligned with our strategic objectives. Both scenarios anticipate significant transition risks due to the rapid change in the economy over that period as emissions decrease.\n\nFigure 14: NGFS scenario framework 4 Figure X: NGFS scenario framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs outlined in the risk management section (pages 153 to 155), our scenario analysis leverages a third-party model to assess both our insurance and investment business.\n\nAs physical risk is assumed identical for both early- and late-action scenarios (per CBES guidance) and as transition risk is considered materially the same in both late-action and NAA over the quantification window (10 years), analysis of our underwriting portfolio excludes the late-action scenario.\n\nThe scenarios used to understand physical risk impacts to our own operations are broadly aligned with those used for our insurance and investment analysis in terms of the RCPs assumed (RCP 2.6 & RCP 8.5). 5\n\nOur scenario analysis leverages a third-party model and associated data to assess both our insurance and investment businesses. A high- level overview of the model, data sources and key assumptions are provided in the risk management section (pages 153 to 154).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe scenario-based assessment of our proprietary investment portfolio considers listed equities, corporate credit and real estate and places a focus on understanding potential risks to the valuation of corporate equities. While equities as an asset class has a low absolute share in our investment portfolio (5 percent), it has a material impact on our investment-related market risk position. The valuation of equity in\n\nthe scenarios involves discounting future revenues and costs (quantified at 2050) to arrive at a net present value of future cash flows.\n\n- 1 For details on the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology and scenarios analysis process, see the risk management section (pages 153 to 155).\n- 2  In line with the requirements of the CBES exercise, and to ensure severe physical risks that may crystallise post 2050 are considered, physical risk is stressed in the NAA scenario by calibrating physical risk in the period 2021-2050 based on the level of physical risk that could be prevalent between 2050 and 2080. This is achieved by assuming temperature increases in this scenario are at the 90th percentile of expected temperature increases; a higher level than the expected (mean) temperature increase. Physical risks are therefore modelled based on a temperature trajectory that reaches 3.3\u00b0C by 2050. Because the level of physical risk is similar in the early-action and late-action scenarios, it is assumed when modelling physical risk that the early-action scenario has the same temperature trajectory as the late-action scenario in the period 2021-2050.\n- 3  As described by NGFS, 'the RCPs are greenhouse gas concentration scenarios that are commonly used in the climate modelling community. [...] They were officially adopted by the IPCC and provide a basis for the projections and predictions of the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC'. The correspondence between CBES/NGFS scenarios and RCP pathways is based on the emissions trajectory in those scenarios over time. The correspondence is not exact, but NGFS Net-Zero 2050 and Disorderly scenario temperature pathways fall in the range of RCP 2.6, and current policies falls in the range of RCP 6.0. (More details available in the NGFS Technical Documentation).\n- 4  www.ngfs.net/ngfs-scenarios-portal\n- 5  These correspond to SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 respectively according to the new IPCC designations.",

Independent assurance report\n\nThe analysis of our underwriting portfolio leverages outputs from the same third-party model as inputs to a bespoke modeling of the relationship between key climate drivers, insurance demand, and loss experience. The total book was analyzed by line of business, geographic region and industry/sector to identify a set of nine at risk 'clusters' with potentially high exposure to the impacts of physical and transition risks. Each cluster was then subject to a deep dive analysis to identify and translate key drivers of physical and transition risk into quantitative impacts. The resultant deep dives performed consider 49 percent of the total Property & Casualty (P&C) portfolio (USD 18 billion of USD 37 billion), mostly concentrated in North America (NA) and Europe, reflective of our underwriting footprint. Analysis of our Life book focuses on protection-related products in EMEA and Latin America (LATAM), representing 37 percent of the Life portfolio (USD 5 billion of USD 14 billion).\n\nQuantification is performed to underpin our medium-term assessment (to 2030), an approach considered reasonable for determining strategic management actions in response to risks identified given the prevalence of annual policy renewals across a high proportion of our portfolio. Given the increasing uncertainty inherent in considering longer time periods, impacts to 2050 are analyzed qualitatively.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTwo metrics are chosen to quantify scenario-based impacts of climate risk on our insurance business:\n\n- -percentage change in demand: estimated impacts on size and composition of demand for insurance products due to physical and transition climate risk drivers in each scenario, compared with a baseline of no further climate action and no further climate change relative to current day levels.\n- -percentage change in expected losses: estimated impacts on claims due to physical and transition climate risk drivers in each scenario, compared with a baseline of no further climate action and no further climate change relative to current day levels.\n\nA scenario-based assessment of the potential impacts of physical climate risk on our business operations was performed, leveraging a separate modelling approach underpinned by third-party data.

Independent assurance report\n\n## NAA: a closer look\n\nNo additional climate action leads to an increased need for more sophisticated modelling as weather events increasingly impact portfolio, as well as stronger push on resilience. It also requires the focused reshaping of portfolios away from areas with high risk from physical impact of unabated climate change.\n\nPhysical risk is assumed to dominate in the NAA scenario. In line with scenario narratives, increased levels of physical risk modestly suppress economic activity up to 2030 due to impacts on productivity, reducing GDP and consequently demand for insurance. Impacts to demand quantified at the Group level are observed to be pervasive, relatively low and geographically inhomogeneous. The reduction in GDP impacts the motor book by reducing demand in commercial insurance and declining retail purchasing power leading to overall decline in vehicle sales. Retail property and life protection demand is similarly impacted due to suppressed economic activity. Impacts from insuring financial services are mostly second order, being driven by the exposure companies have to climate sensitive sectors.\n\nPotential increase in demand in the agricultural sector is driven by the expansion of the North American biofuel sector and could represent an opportunity in this scenario but is expected to be offset by a decrease in other crop types. Other minor growth opportunities are noted in books to which we have limited exposure and in areas which are not aligned with our strategic objectives as we commit to move our underwriting portfolio toward net-zero.\n\nThe impact of climate change on physical losses in property, and to a lesser extent, construction is expected to be the main driver of increased losses under the NAA scenario. Adverse loss trends in property are reflective of expected average annual loss increase due to (extra-)tropical cyclones, floods and severe convective storms. Increase in frequency and severity of claims due to hydrological events such as heavy rain, cyclones and flooding are noted to drive trends for construction.\n\n## Early-action: a closer look\n\nThe early-action scenario aligns to our commitment to a 1.5\u00b0C future, and brings greater opportunities for growth in various sectors. The well-balanced nature of our portfolio limits negative demand impacts even before strategic actions aimed at maximising growth and limiting loss exposure are considered.\n\nThe transition to low carbon is observed to have pervasive impacts on our portfolio under the early-action scenario.\n\nIncreasing explicit and implicit carbon prices will in particular affect the heavy industry, mining and the fossil fuels sectors and the expected shift away from fossil fuels will in turn benefit the power sector, as end-use sectors move energy demand toward alternate sources of power.\n\nWithin the power sector, the transition will yield a shift toward renewables. The resulting impact on demand for insurance from the power sector will be contingent on the price trajectory of renewable assets. Indeed, by 2030 the increase in demand for electricity is expected to be offset by fast decreasing renewable asset prices in some regions, meaning overall sector revenue and insurance demand will stabilize.\n\nSignificant investment in the power sector to increase renewable generation capacity and grid infrastructure will have positive spillover impacts on the construction sector, together with the growing need to renovate and rebuild to reduce building emissions.\n\nThe increasing importance of biofuels to power the clean-energy transition will potentially drive growth in the agriculture sector (above that observed in the NAA scenario), together with increased yield size due to adoption of more efficient farming practices.\n\nHeavy industry and mining will suffer from increased carbon costs potentially resulting in reduced demand. However, increases in demand for minerals critical to the transition to a low-carbon future, particularly cobalt and copper, which are input into key low-carbon technologies like batteries and photovoltaic panels, represent an opportunity for the mining portfolio.\n\nThe cumulative effect of corporate sectoral shifts associated with an early-action scenario contribute to overall decreases in demand for Life protection products.\n\nIncreasing carbon costs will drive the uptake of new low-carbon technologies; such emerging technologies represent opportunities for insurers, but they will also come with increased risk. This applies to new technologies in renewables, carbon capture and storage for power and industry, hydrogen for industry, as well as new construction materials and techniques in the construction sector.\n\nThe transformation of the motor industry, with increasing uptake of electric or alternatively fueled vehicles, is not expected to significantly impact demand or expected losses, as the behavior of drivers of electric vehicles will align with that of standard vehicles, meaning loss profiles will in turn align.\n\nIn the agriculture sector the increased productivity of land serves as an additional loss driver for agriculture as any loss event would potentially have a greater financial impact, however this would potentially be compensated for through the pricing mechanism within the crop business.",

Planet\n\n- 5.  Customers\n- 6.  Employees\n- 7. Independent assurance report\n\n## Looking to 2050\n\nIn the long term (beyond 2030), the severity and frequency of acute and chronic physical risks are expected to increase, shifting loss profiles across many lines of business including, for example, property, given the expected concentration of acute hazards around high-risk regions (e.g., coastal areas, wildfire zones). The high degree of uncertainty over how electric vehicles and autonomous technology affects the functioning of the transport system (e.g., car sharing, modal shifts, self-driving vehicles) and the resulting demand for cars will likely lead to demand and loss impacts to our motor book. Overall, shifting loss profiles could mean that certain impacts can no longer be compensated through pricing, and that some risks may become uninsurable. 1\n\nThe energy transition continues beyond 2030 and extends to other industrial sectors: this could further increase risks for sectors such as fossil fuels and create opportunities in others such as construction and power. The scale of electrical and mechanical construction projects required to deliver the low-carbon stock necessary for net-zero is a once-ina-generation opportunity, but it will also come with new risks. Offsite construction, increasing value of materials and components and unknown risk profiles could all contribute to an increase in the number and value of claims in our property and engineering lines book.\n\nDemand for insurance due to the growth in cropland for biofuels will continue to increase in the long term, as biofuel production picks up pace. Improvements in crop yields will remain constant after 2030 due to high initial penetration of new technologies in the sector. Demand profiles for financial services are likely to shift as exposure to climate sensitive holdings by financial institutions becomes a key driver of demand from individual companies. Liability risks are also likely to increase as stricter climate-related accountability and responsibility on financial institutions are introduced.\n\n## Proprietary investment portfolio analysis\n\n## High-level outcomes\n\nThe scenarios, as currently modeled, indicate that climate change-related risk to asset valuation would not pose a major risk to our capital position, either at aggregate portfolio or individual asset class level, even without considering the potentially mitigating effect on liability valuation. This conclusion considers impacts across three major asset classes (listed equities, corporate credit and real estate) covering 36 percent of the investment portfolio, without considering the potential mitigating effect on liability valuation, and is made in accordance with our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology. 2 This methodology considers a major risk to be one that could have a negative impact on the Group's economic capital position in excess of USD 5 billion, either at aggregate portfolio or individual asset class level.\n\nIn the NAA scenario, physical risk is limited over the time horizon in the analysis (2021-2050), with the exception of a few sectors and regions (e.g., agriculture and tropical regions) to which we have limited investment exposure.\n\nIn the transition risk scenarios, the aggregate impact is also low as transitioning is modelled as being relatively frictionless. Moreover, while some industries and businesses would experience a large negative impact on their market valuations in these scenarios, the aggregate risks stemming from this are limited.\n\nGiven the enormous transformation that is required, an orderly and smooth transition, such as the one described by the two 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, may be difficult to achieve, with periods of higher volatility likely. There is the potential for significant spill-over effects from the most affected sectors and regions, as well as a potentially positive - but possibly also disruptive - impact stemming from the development of new technology and productivity gains. As the scenarios highlight, there will also be large divergencies across businesses and sectors, with opportunities, as well as risk, associated with the transitioning.\n\n## Listed equities: a closer look\n\nApplying the various scenarios and third-party model to our global listed equity portfolio in comparison with a broad market benchmark, transition risk is found to be material for businesses that operate in carbon-intensive sectors, have relatively high emissions, and are less able to absorb, reduce or pass on carbon costs. The approach also sheds light on transition opportunities, including those that stem from the greening of the economy.\n\nIn contrast to transition risk, additional physical risk relative to today's level is estimated to be relatively limited over the time span considered, even in the NAA scenario, as it will take time before more significant additional climate change effects materialize. More severe impact will therefore be restricted to a few regions and sectors such as agriculture and tropical regions, to which we have limited investment exposure.\n\nAs shown below, the largest relative valuation effects on our global listed equity portfolio are found in the early-action scenario, where the impact is somewhat higher than in the late-action scenario, due to the discounting of future impact, and a very front-loaded, albeit gradual, rise in the carbon price. From a financial materiality perspective, only minor impacts to our listed equity portfolio are observed.\n\n- 1 This risk was not analysed quantitatively.\n- 2  See the risk management section (pages 153 to 155) for further details on the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology.",

Planet\n\n- 5.  Customers\n- 6.  Employees\n- 7. Independent assurance report\n\nThe results demonstrate how relatively higher transition risks to our listed equity portfolio are limited to few sectors, including energy, non-energy materials, and consumer cyclicals (which includes vehicles). This result is not a reflection of the relative weighting of our book but captures the general impact on the economy and consequently market pricing in a transition risk scenario. By contrast, the services sector, which contributes the largest share to global economy activity, sees little impact. The relative resilience of services appears reasonable, but there are a few caveats to this result. For the finance sector, only direct exposure to climate-related risk is considered. Indirect exposure through the valuation of assets and financial interlinkages, which are arguably more important in a transitioning scenario, are not captured. Additionally, if rapid transitioning were to lead to energy scarcity and bottlenecks in the economy and rising costs for energy and materials, this could impact sentiment and demand and have broader effects on the economy, including on the services sector.\n\nOverall, the impacts on our global equity portfolio are somewhat smaller than those of a broad market benchmark. Reasons contributing to the difference are differing sector weights and geographic exposure; differing security selection resulting from our long-standing practice of ESG integration as part of our responsible investment approach as well as our climate-related exclusion screens. Since 2017 we have divested from companies that derive more than 30 percent of their revenues from mining of or generate more than 30 percent of electricity from thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale.\n\nThe applied model assumes that an early-transition scenario can lead to transition opportunities and risks within industry sectors. Within the energy, utilities, and non-energy materials sectors that experience significant and negative median impacts, the characteristics of individual counterparties also have a strong impact on their exposure to climate risk. In the utilities sector, for example, some utilities experience significant decreases in value, as their high CO2e emissions intensity leaves them in a weak competitive position relative to less emissions-intensive rivals, leading to reduced profitability and market share. Other utilities with lower emissions intensity benefit from increased electricity demand, higher electricity prices, and the ability to gain market share at the expense of more emissions-intensive rivals. This variance in individual counterparty impacts also occurs in other sectors, including for example industrials and consumer cyclicals, where median impacts are small.\n\nOverall, the applied model suggests a manageable level of risk across all scenarios and results in a valuation impact of minor materiality. Relatively more material risks are connected to sectors where these risks are relatively well understood and an increasing body of climate risk-related ESG research provides ongoing insights. We also believe that an early transition to a climate-neutral economy may provide opportunities in a wider variety of business models and industry sectors than the applied model assumes. Our portfolio continues to be well diversified across sectors and geographies and is managed with an ESG integration lens, which includes information about both climate change risks and opportunities. It is also managed to become net-zero by 2050, with the progressing decarbonization successively shielding it from the companies that are lagging behind in the transition.\n\nThe analysis supports various hypotheses: earlier-action scenarios materially increase transition risks, but in turn reduce the long-term impacts of physical risks. Even in a challenging transition risk scenario, the overall negative effect on the listed equity portfolio is moderate and concentrated in sectors that are most CO2e emission intensive, but also play the largest role in actively driving the transition. Emissions in the economy are disproportionally concentrated in a few sectors (utilities, energy, materials, agriculture, forestry and land use) and so are financed emissions in a global equity portfolio. In our listed equity portfolio, 62 percent of financed emissions in the top emitting sectors (building materials, energy, chemicals and utilities) represent only 12 percent of market value. However, sector deep dives show that there are also investment opportunities in these sectors.\n\nOverall, the risk appears well diversified though the portfolio requires ongoing monitoring and active management as risks materialize.\n\n## Own operations\n\nAn assessment of potential climate change impacts on our own business operations was performed in collaboration with our CCRS team.\n\nPhysical risk assessment scope and approach\n\nA scenario-based assessment of physical risk was performed leveraging a third-party model and data 1 with quantification performed for 2030 and 2050.\n\nThe assessment considered:\n\n- - Offices supporting more than 250 employees (41 office locations).\n- - All strategic data centers (10 locations).\n- - Supplier locations including those providing critical services to the Group (focusing on the known service locations) and suppliers that together comprise 75 percent of managed procurement spend (346 locations).\n\nAn assessment of physical perils was conducted to understand exposure level and criticality under two scenarios: early-action and NAA. The assessment identified the number of employees or percentage of locations (relative to the overall total) exposed to the qualitative hazard levels, for our offices, data centers, and supplier locations. The qualitative hazard levels are based upon specific physical parameters for each peril and include flood, wind, temperature, drought, hail, wildfire, precipitation, thunderstorms (lightning), and coastal flooding.",

Planet\n\n- 5.  Customers\n- 6.  Employees\n- 7. Independent assurance report\n\nThe consequences of some of these hazards (hail, lightning, precipitation, wildfire, wind) may affect both property (buildings, equipment, cars, etc.) and employee safety, while others are limited to employees' wellbeing (temperature, drought). There is a potential interdependency (or combined effect) of some hazards. Increased temperature and drought may influence water availability and quality, and increase demand for electricity. Increased thunderstorm and temperature hazard may increase the likelihood of hailstorms. Roof-mounted equipment may be damaged (impact by lightning or hailstones). High wind speeds (intense rainfall may occur concurrently with windstorms) may displace (poorly anchored) roof-mounted equipment, with ensuing damage to the roofing system, resulting in ingress of water to the building interior. Poorly maintained or older roofing systems may also be damaged during a windstorm. Water penetration/ingress into the building may also occur if the roof drainage systems are poorly maintained (blockage of drains or collector pipes).\n\nFor data centers, a particular vulnerability is related to lightning strikes (thunderstorm). Loss of power or even data transmission cables may be exposed in thunderstorms if the lightning protection system (internal and external, e.g., power surge protection as well as lightning arrestors) is not effective or reliable.\n\n## Key outcomes\n\n- - Current exposure levels across offices, strategic data centers and suppliers are effectively managed through existing processes.\n- - In the early-action scenario, precipitation and drought demonstrated increased exposure (by at least 15 and 10 percent, respectively) between 2030 and 2050 across offices, strategic data centers and supplier locations.\n- - In the NAA scenario, the increased risk exposure for these perils persisted, most notably leading to an at least 90 percent exposure by 2050 across offices, strategic data centers and supplier locations. In the same scenario, thunderstorm risks are at least high across 70 percent of strategic data center locations already in 2030.\n- - We did not observe significant variances in risk exposures levels across either of the two scenarios between 2030 and 2050.\n\nOur existing business resilience activities focus on protecting and recovering critical business assets and resources from a wide range of existing and developing risks, including those related to the impacts of climate change. Corporate real estate and security teams are responsible to ensure offices comply with evolving building safety and security codes and requirements. Local teams are aware of risks associated with public infrastructure including risks from aging infrastructure that impact mobility and security of energy supply. To avoid situations where safety, security, and business continuity can no longer be effectively managed, office re-locations would be planned for. These activities are forward looking and iterative, taking into account the changing and evolving risk landscape. The adaptive nature of the resilience program and daily operational planning requirements mean that processes will continue to change in response to the risks resulting from climate change. We note the significant increase in distributed workforces as a result of COVID-19, something which has redefined the operational boundaries to be considered for business continuity. Further analysis is required to identify opportunities to adapt our business continuity planning to a distributed workforce.\n\nBusiness resilience planning is carried over into supply chain relationship management. We are aware of and manage concentration risks where multiple suppliers are located in a common geographic area. We run annual disaster recovery tests for our strategic data centers. The test assumes complete loss of the primary data center and recovery in the secondary data center which is located out of region or country.\n\n## Transition risks\n\nGiven the low-carbon intensity of the insurance sector's operations compared to more carbon-intensive manufacturing sectors, our focus on sustainability within our operations, and business-as-usual planning processes, we do not consider transition risk to be material for our own operations considering impacts through to 2050. Regulatory changes related, for example, to the price of carbon, are monitored and can be planned for, with impacts minimized by reducing our carbon footprint in line with our science-based targets.\n\nRisks within our supply chain are mitigated by placing increasing scrutiny on our suppliers' sustainability performance and commitments and setting clear expectations for suppliers in our SCOC. Overall, price increases for products and services are anticipated with carbon pricing schemes and other policy or voluntary requirements to internalize the cost of climate change.",

Planet\n\n- 5.  Customers\n- 6.  Employees\n- 7. Independent assurance report\n\n## Other climate risk assessment outcomes\n\nOur climate risk assessment includes consideration of both litigation and reputational risks.\n\nLitigation risk: Though not a focus of our scenario analysis, some current litigation drivers were considered in specific deep dive areas, with none presently identified as a material risk driver in the medium term. We closely monitor developments potentially impacting litigation-related risks and drive actions to address them proactively.\n\nReputational risk: Given our strong ambitions to address the impacts of climate change, we acknowledge we are under higher public scrutiny and any perceived or real failure to live up to our set objectives and targets could have a particularly significant impact on our reputation. To reduce the risk of failing against our targets, we employ controls and monitor progress through the governance structures described in the corporate governance report (see pages 38 to 83). We believe strong internal focus on delivery coupled with detailed public disclosure on progress are sufficient to mitigate this risk.\n\n## 3. Conclusions\n\nOur initial scenario-based climate risk assessment has strengthened our understanding of the potential impacts of climate risk on our business. The assessment suggests our customer focused approach and diversified portfolios, supported by strong risk management practices, provide the resilience and flexibility to adapt to the impacts observed.\n\nFrom an underwriting perspective, we believe annual repricing will provide mitigation against short-tail business lines and mitigate transition risk in our underwriting portfolio. As the effects of climate change materialize over time, we have the possibility to ensure that our risk appetite for natural catastrophe exposure is maintained or adapted accordingly. We also purchase reinsurance to protect the company's balance sheet from large natural catastrophe impacts and to support earnings volatility management. The reinsurance strategy is regularly reviewed to account for relevant loss trends.\n\nWe believe our multi-faceted responsible investment strategy is sufficiently flexible to adapt to the impacts highlighted by this analysis and will continue to demonstrate resilience. Our structured and disciplined investment management approach is carefully crafted to match liabilities, minimize unrewarded risks and remain stable throughout the macroeconomic cycle. The resulting portfolio is highly diversified across asset classes, sectors and geographies. On an issuer level, both transition risks and opportunities are reflected through ESG integration. Our net-zero 2050 strategy is leading to a continuous decarbonization of the portfolio, which also reduces transition risks stemming from highly carbon intensive issuers without adequate transition pathways that could mitigate their risk, while seizing opportunities created by the transition.\n\nHighly carbon intensive pockets of our insurance and proprietary investment portfolios experience elevated exposure to transition risk, however we believe our in force thermal coal, oil sands and oil shale exclusion policy allows us to address this exposure whilst aligning with our commitment to a low carbon future.\n\nThe adaptive nature of our business resilience program mean processes will adapt to changing physical risk profiles ensuring operational resilience.\n\nWe caveat these conclusions by acknowledging the hypothetical nature of scenarios, the uncertainty inherent in scenario modelling over the timeframes considered and the somewhat conservative modelling of physical and transition risk.\n\nAs the effects of climate change gradually increase over the coming decades, adaptation efforts at the individual, company and state level will increase and provide resilience against expected impacts. This is likely to reduce societal and economic losses, however the details heavily depend on uncertain societal and technological developments. On the other hand, exceeding tipping points, such as accelerated melting of Antarctic ice sheets or permafrost thawing, could lead to large-scale discontinuities in the global climate systems and accelerate the impacts from physical climate risk. We believe our strategy of continually analyzing changing risk profiles and retaining customer focus provides the flexibility required to maintain our resilience and continue to serve our customers' needs as climate-related risk profiles evolve.",

Independent assurance report\n\nPeter Giger Group Chief Risk Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2 Governance\n\n## The organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\nAs outlined in the governance section of the ISD (see pages 132 to 133), sustainability, and therefore climate-related topics, are integrated into our existing governance structure.\n\nWe ensure climate change is discussed with our Board and committees where and when required. In 2021, as part of regular strategy discussions, the Board requested a discussion of how major global forces stand to shape the future of our industry over a 10- to 15-year period. Considering the relevance of climate change to our underwriting and investing activities and our own operations, this topic was covered as part of the discussion. Outcomes of scenario-based climate risk assessments are considered as part of strategy setting processes.\n\nTo accelerate our understanding of climate risk and support consistent management of our aspiration toward a climateneutral economy, we established a cross-functional 1.5\u00b0C taskforce under the sponsorship of the Group Underwriting Officer, reporting into the SLC.\n\n## 4.3 Risk management\n\n## The processes used by the organization to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks.\n\n## 4.3.1 Integration of climate risk within the overall risk management framework\n\nWe consider impacts from climate change as drivers for other risks, such as market or natural catastrophe risks, that are managed within our existing risk management framework. Our approach to managing climate risk is embedded in our multi-disciplinary Group-wide risk management framework, following the same objectives of informed and disciplined risk taking. The risk management framework is based on a governance process that sets forth clear responsibilities for taking, managing, monitoring and reporting risks.\n\nTo identify, assess, manage, monitor and report risks that can have an impact on the achievement of our strategic objectives, including climate change, the Group applies a proprietary Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology. This short-term assessment considers our planning horizon and allows us to classify risks according to their materiality based on the estimated severity and the likelihood of the risk materializing. Further, it supports the definition and implementation of mitigating actions. At Group level, this is an annual process, followed by regular reviews and updates by management.\n\nTaking the long-term nature of climate change into account, we complement our Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology with portfolio-level climate risk scenario analysis to provide an outlook on medium- and long-term risk developments relevant to our underwriting and investment portfolios, as outlined in the strategy section (see page 137). The details of our risk management framework are outlined in the risk review (see pages 182 to 215).\n\n## 4.3.2 Portfolio-level scenario-based climate risk assessment\n\nAssessments of the resilience of our business model to potential climate risks over longer time periods are performed using scenario analysis. To ensure a consistent Group view on potential climate change pathways, scenarios selected for this analysis will underpin all assessments Group wide, unless other local regulatory requirements exist. Assessment granularity and timeframes can be tailored to the specific requirements of the assessment.\n\nIn line with established governance, the ExCo Sponsor for Sustainability reviews the outcomes of the climate change scenario analysis exercise and reports key outcomes and agrees actions with the ExCo for Group CEO approval. The ExCo Sponsor for Sustainability reports outcomes and actions to the Board's Governance, Nominations and Sustainability Committee (GNSC). The GNSC makes recommendations to the Board, as required.\n\nAn integrated modeling approach, leveraging a third-party model, is adopted for the analysis of our underwriting and proprietary investment portfolios to ensure, to the extent possible, the consistent use of assumptions.\n\nTo quantify impacts on Group assets, the model adopts a bottom-up approach to analyze the exposures of businesses and industries to physical and transition risk. To provide a map of vulnerabilities, it uses asset-level data on relevant risk drivers, including carbon emissions, abatement options, exposure to physical risks (including location-based exposure to acute physical risks), exposure to the greening of the economy, dependency on fossil fuels and competitiveness. The strength of this bottom-up approach is that it provides a coherent framework for analyzing climate change-related\n\nrisk at the industry and corporate sector level.",

This implies quantified impacts assume no strategic reaction from us to the risks identified, and no movements in pricing to adapt to changing conditions.\n- - Scenario analysis has been performed using year-end 2020 financial data with latest available emissions data (mostly 2019). Given this difference in data recency, baseline emissions intensities for the modelling were calculated for 2019 and then scaled to reflect 2020 revenues, in order to avoid the risk of emissions intensity numbers being distorted by year-on-year changes in revenue between 2019 and 2020.\n- - Modelled impacts of acute physical risks on expected losses are, to every extent possible, based on our own natural catastrophe modeling. Coupled with the narrower set of perils captured in the underlying third-party model, this introduces a slight discrepancy with the modelling of acute physical risk impacts on our investment portfolios where such data substitution was not possible. This discrepancy will reduce as the set of perils modelled in the third-party model is expanded.\n- - While the bottom-up approach adopted by the underlying model facilitates granular analysis of climate change-related risk, the model displays characteristics that serve to present a somewhat conservative view of impacts, namely:\n- - The assumption of smooth transitioning, as capital moves from carbon-intensive to low-carbon activities without bottlenecks or frictions (e.g., costs are passed to consumers), leads to a muted 'cost of transition', despite a very steep rise in the price of carbon (toward USD 700 per ton CO2e).\n- - The assumption of perfect information, where action is only taken once new policies are in place, omits an important uncertainty effect.\n- - Modeling of physical risk considers three acute hazards (coastal flood, inland flood and tropical cyclones), is location based and does not consider supply chain impacts, meaning aggregate estimates of physical risk are somewhat limited.\u00b9\n\nFor further details on our risk management process and supporting committees, see the risk review (pages 182 to 215).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Objectives\n\n- - Assess impact on underwriting volumes of key sectors, lines of business and geographies due to climate risks in 2030 (relative to the baseline scenario)\n\n## Method\n\n- -Impact on demand due to change in climate-related exposure\n- -Impact on expected losses arising from transition and physical risks\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Objectives\n\n- - Identify key risks and opportunities (for risk management framework and disclosure)\n- -Quantification of portfolio-level impact on underwriting volumes\n\n## Method\n\n- - Building on analysis in steps 1 and 2, quantify impacts on underwriting volumes in 2030 (relative to baseline) due to climate risks",

To manage our underwriting selection and ensure accumulations stay within intended exposure limits and assess the capital requirement due to natural catastrophes, we have established sophisticated natural catastrophe modeling capabilities. The resulting view on natural catastrophe risk also underpins profitability assessments and strategic capacity allocation and guides the type and quantity of reinsurance that we buy. To ensure global consistency, natural catastrophe exposures are modeled in the Group Risk Management function.\n\nThird-party models provide a starting point for the assessment of natural catastrophe risk. However, they are generally built for the market average and need validation and adjustment by specialized teams to reflect the best view of risk. We have been a leader in model validation and developed our proprietary 'Zurich View' of risk since 2005, giving us over a decade of experience in applying a structured and quantitative approach to optimize our risk view. To arrive at the Zurich View, models are adjusted in terms of frequency, severity and event uncertainty. Adjustment factors address potential losses from non-modeled property-related exposures or secondary perils to the extent not covered by the third-party models. Every catastrophe event provides an opportunity to learn from our own claims experience and the modeling framework provides a place to capture the new insights. We constantly review and expand the scope and sophistication of our modeling and strive to improve data quality. We supplement internal know-how with external knowledge (e.g., the Advisory Council for Catastrophes). We are also a shareholder of catastrophe exposure and loss data aggregation and estimation firm PERILS AG, Switzerland and are a member of the open-source initiative Oasis Loss Modeling Framework.\n\nCatastrophe models that are generally based on historical data would not capture potential future climate change-related shifts of extreme weather events. However, when combined with general circulation models (GCMs) they are best positioned to help also understand the risk of future climate conditions. GCMs build representations of the Earth's physical climate systems and therefore can provide model results for climatic scenarios beyond past events. The quality of GCMs continues to evolve as scientific understanding of the earth's climate systems increases and is also driven by progress in computing power and artificial intelligence that extrapolates insights from current modeled regions to future climate scenarios. This science is evolving, and we have strengthened our catastrophe modeling team with dedicated resources to create methodologies to integrate forward-looking aspects such as this into our modeling approach.",

This section outlines the main targets underpinning our climate strategy and lists key performance indicators (KPIs) we track.\n\n## 4.4.1 Our targets\n\nOutlined below are the principle targets we have set to align our business activities with the outcomes of the Paris Agreement. In line with the efforts of the NZIA, we aim to establish, to the extent permissible by applicable laws and regulations, intermediate, science-based targets for our underwriting portfolios.\n\n| Target                            | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Target year                | Base  year   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------|\n| Reduction  of financed  emissions | Our emissions reduction targets cover both listed equity and corporate bond  investments as well as direct real estate investments.

Please find below a set of examples.\n\n## Supporting climate informed practices\n\nOur 'Build Back Better' program is one of the responsible initiatives that can be found in a range of policy clauses. For example, we offer retail customers in Europe a 20 percent payback above the cost of a property restoration after damage when environmentally friendly materials are used. In North America, we cover additional costs that might occur when choosing environmentally friendly alternatives to rebuild property, thereby helping customers rebuild their property after damage in compliance with existing or emerging green standards.\n\nWe have also launched several initiatives for our commercial customers. For example, as part of our CCRS, we help businesses to identify, assess, mitigate and adapt to current and future climate change risks.\n\nAs well as incentivizing green building and resource-efficient investment, we encourage green travel. For example, we provide retail customers in Italy with a 50 percent discount on their third party liability car insurance if the vehicle is fully electric. In Switzerland, customers receive a discount on their insurance if the vehicle uses alternative fuels. In addition, we developed a product called 'AutoSense' that incentivizes safe and ecological driving and allows customers to compensate for their CO2 emissions.\n\n## Incentivizing healthy behavior\n\nIn 2020, we developed our LiveWell program with a mission to inspire positive change and provide services and solutions that encourage our customers to make positive lifestyle choices. In 2021, LiveWell added capabilities around lifestyle tracking, challenges, screenings and telemedicine. To date, we are supporting one million contracted lives (lives in scope as per the customer contracts) on a daily basis to live a healthy lifestyle. LiveWell has achieved a strong NPS score in its first year. We will continue to measure our progress to understand how to best serve our customers and improve their daily experiences.",

All companies covered by the thresholds have either been cleared, excluded or are under continued engagement, contingent on the presentation of credible transition plans. Progress on these targets is monitored and can be revoked if companies fail to meet their transition targets.\n\n## Exclusion screens\n\nTo measure the progress of the implementation of our coal policy, we are monitoring the number of companies affected by its thresholds and actions taken on both the insurance and investment side. Since the introduction of our first coal policy in 2017, our actions resulted in the divestment of USD 573 million in assets (equity and fixed income already disposed) and the phaseout of insurance relationships covering USD 38 million of gross written premiums. These figures represent less than half a percent of our respective investment or insurance portfolios, as our exposure to the thermal coal and oil sands industry was already limited before policy inception, reflecting our ESG integration approach.\n\nNumber of companies subject to our coal and oil sands policy since November 2017:\n\n113\n\nExcluded\n\n## Engagement for the transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 19: Our engagement approach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We contributed to an NZAOA paper that outlines how asset owners can engage their asset managers on climate-change topics. This can include: asking asset managers to set their own science-based targets; joining the Net-Zero Asset Manager Initiative; becoming a signatory to CA100+; and making sure their active ownership policies (proxy voting and engagement) are fit to manage climate transition risks and are conducive to climate change mitigation and the transition to a climate-neutral economy.",

and debt investors who are ready to take additional responsibility for these emissions.\n\nTo calculate corporate financed emissions, we use the following methodology:\n\n- - Scope 1+2 emissions in line with the GHG Protocol are provided by S&P Trucost.\n- - EV is defined as the sum of market capitalization of common stock at fiscal year end, the market capitalization of preferred equity at fiscal year end, and the book values of debt and minorities' interests minus the cash and cash equivalents held by the\n\nenterprise. When EV is not available (for example for financial companies) it is substituted with market capitalization. EV data is provided by S&P Trucost.\n\n- - Market value (MV) is defined as the market value of listed equities and listed corporate debt at fiscal year end.\n- - While all financial data (EV and MV) is calculated as of 31.12.xx, we use the latest available corporate emission data available as of January, when portfolio-level financed emissions are calculated on an annual basis. This means that emissions data is systematically lagging. For example, financed emissions for 2021 will be largely based on FY2020 emissions data, as FY 2021 emissions data will only be made\n\navailable by investees in H1 2021, and tends to flow to data providers via Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) submissions in Q4 of a given year.",

Independent assurance report\n\nCoverage tends to be almost universal for our listed equity universe, where data gaps were almost exclusively due to missing look-through to single holdings for comingled funds and ETFs. In the listed debt portfolio, data gaps were largely due to missing reported or estimated emission data for smaller or emerging market-based companies. To close these data gaps, we have worked on creating proprietary industry-based estimates that are based on the sector emission intensities.\n\nIn addition, to address issues with emissions data in the wider portfolio, work is ongoing: to match ETFs and mutual funds with the financed emission intensities provided by their respective fund managers or benchmark provider; engage with data providers to increase coverage of modeled emissions to small-cap and emerging market issuer; and engage with companies directly, encouraging them to report their operational emissions.\n\nWe have already made substantial progress in reducing the emission intensity of our corporate portfolio, based on latest available emission data - which is predominantly from 2020. With the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in the largest-ever decline in global emissions, undoubtedly Zurich's emission reduction benefited from this effect. As primary energy demand dropped nearly 4 percent in 2020, global energy-related CO2e emissions fell by 5.8 percent according to the latest statistical data.\u00b9 Unfortunately, we already know that global CO2e emissions have rebounded in 2021. In addition, the divestments of restricted names based on our thermal coal, oil sand and oil shale policy contributed to the financed emission reduction. These two effects positively impacted the reduction of financed emissions, which might not continue at the same pace in forthcoming years.\n\nIn real estate, the entire Swiss portfolio has been optimized and monitored since 2014. The target set to reduce 20 percent of total operational carbon emissions (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) against the baseline of 2010 was achieved by the end of 2019. The target to reduce 80 percent by 2050 has been reviewed as it was not in line with our net-zero strategy and current science-based target setting methodology. Energy and carbon reduction data have been audited and published in our sustainability report since 2016. As agreed in the NZAOA's target setting protocol, we calculated a baseline 2019 for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions for our global real estate investments and communicated a 30 percent reduction by 2025. As a science-based scenario is required, the use of Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM) 1.5\u00b0C pathways was analyzed and piloted in the Swiss real estate portfolio, then applied globally. Over the course of 2021, a carbon management platform was implemented in order to evaluate and report the progress of the global real estate carbon reduction performance. According to the methodological framework of CRREM, the reference area for the calculation of carbon intensity (kgCO2e/m\u00b2) and energy intensity (kWh/m\u00b2) figures is the Gross Internal Area (GIA: Gross floor area minus area of external walls).\n\nGiven the importance of sovereign debt for institutional investors, we are currently working with the NZAOA to develop a methodology that allows the target-setting protocol to be expanded to sovereign debt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financing the transition 2021\n\nFinancing the transition 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTable 6:\n\n| Climate solution investments (USDm)                                    | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   (baseline)   | Diff   (to baseline)   | Target upward   trend   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                        | 8,203  | 8,054  | 7,408               | 11.0%                  |                         |\n| of which green impact investments  1                                   | 5,115  | 4,424  | 3,662               | 39.7%                  |                         |\n| of which green certified buildings  2 ,  3                             | 3,088  | 3,631  | 3,747               | (18.0%)                |                         |\n| Milllion tCO2e avoided  through climate-related impact  investments  4 | 4.6    | 2.9    | 2.8                 | 64.0%                  | 5                       |\n\n- 1 Values refer to the environmental share of Zurich's impact investments displayed in table 8: Impact investing portfolio.\n- 2   Green certified buildings based on balance sheet investments, incl. buildings used by Zurich.\n- 3   Values refer to the share of green certified buildings of Zurich's Global Real Estate Portfolio displayed in table 5: Emission reduction targets.\n- 4   Impact numbers for 2021 include methodology upgrade from previous years, as explained in Zurich's impact measurement methodology paper: www.zurich.com/-/media/project/zurich/dotcom/sustainability/docs/zurich-impact-measurement-framework.pdf",

Supporting collaborative initiatives and working together with other industry participants to advance responsible investment practices forms an integral part of our approach. We have signed the UN-backed PRI as well as the Principles for Sustainable Insurance (PSI) and collaborate with a number of industry initiatives and research bodies. Most notably we are a founding member of the NZAOA, as well as Investor's Leaders Group at the University of Cambridge, have co-chaired the Executive Committee of the Green and Social Bond Principles for the first six years after its formation and represent asset owners on the Advisory Board of the Operating Principles for Impact Management. In 2021, we participated actively in 23 membership organizations. Our colleagues spoke about responsible investment at 48 conferences and other industry events around the globe.\n\n## Own operations\n\nProgress in the achievements of Group targets for its operations against a 2019 baseline is presented below.

At Zurich we continue to take action to build more meaningful relationships with customers as part of an ongoing transformation program.\n\nWe have proven to be a reliable and trustworthy company in an unstable world, with a long history of using our expertise to care for society and people. However, customer expectations are evolving and lifestyles are changing, creating new demands. As technology has a profound impact on our lives, customers increasingly expect a seamless digital experience.

To create the solutions and experiences that support our customers, we must understand their evolving needs and innovate along the way.\n\nThis focus on innovative, customer-centric solutions is illustrated by the wide range of new products and services being developed across the Group. In the planet section, on page 136, of this report, we discussed the CCRS and the unitlinked sustainability solutions. Additionally, Zurich Global Ventures (ZGV), an innovation hub that drives the development of a series of independent and multi-faceted insurance-related solutions, was created with the aim, amongst others, of providing innovative services and product offerings that go beyond traditional insurance coverage and are available across markets globally. The goal is to get closer to our customers by offering a customized, proactive and digital experience that empowers individuals and businesses to be better prepared for the future.\n\nThese new products and services complement our existing insurance propositions, ensuring that we are providing our customers with a wide range of solutions that meet their needs.",

Our ability to continue driving growth here is testament to our constant efforts to build long-term relationships with our customers and distribution partners. In 2021, this led to a net growth of 2.2 million new customers. In addition to the customer growth in our retail business, we have also delivered premium growth in our P&C commercial business across all regions within the Group.\n\nCommercial insurance - customer retention rate and net new customers 2021 2\n\n## P&C commercial retention rate\n\n(FY 21 vs. FY 20)\n\n## Stable\n\n## Net new customers Customer (k)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLooking at Commercial Insurance, it is testament to Zurich's strength and position in the market, that customer loyalty has remained strong during a period of hard market conditions. Commercial Insurance executed on its customerfocused strategy throughout the year and in conjunction with achieving the desired rate increases, achieved a flat customer retention compared to 2020. This, coupled with targeted new business growth in selected markets, has resulted in almost 21,000 net new customers in 2021 through either organic growth or acquisition.\n\nThis strong performance gives us confidence that we are providing products and services that are attractive to our customers. In addition, we continue to evolve our customer experience by listening and acting on customer feedback through our NPS programs. We interviewed around one million customers in 2021 across our business and took action based on their feedback. Actions ranged from small process optimizations to more sizeable measures, such as collaborating with leading tech firms to co-create new technology solutions to deliver a more frictionless customer experience. One example is the collaboration with Sprout.ai in the UK, which has cut property claim settlement decisions to a few hours and gives customers additional clarity on the outcome of the claim. The combination of these small and large actions contributed to record levels of customer satisfaction, achieving a 4.1-point increase in our overall TNPS score in 2021.\n\n- 1 The customer retention rate and number of customers are calculated based on retail customers in our biggest business units: Australia, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and UK. For both indicators, we report on the change between 2020 and 2021.

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.2 Fair and transparent advice and engagements\n\nIn line with our Group's Code of Conduct, we strive to manage the risks of poor outcomes for our customers and conduct our business in a way that treats them fairly. We acknowledge that they can be exposed to different risks at different stages of the customer journey and believe that clear and transparent communication is critical to mitigate these risks. To support strong customer management, including fair communication practices, in all our business units, we have a Global Customer Facing Conduct Framework 1 in place.\n\nAs part of our continued focus on enhancing customer experience, we have also defined a set of customer experience standards. These standards define what good customer experience looks like at Zurich and provide a common benchmark of quality for the whole organization. By going beyond what is required in local laws and regulations to strive for customer experience standards, we are better positioned to meet and exceed customer expectations.\n\n## 5.2.1 Customer communication\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo account for the wide range of products and services we provide across more than 215 countries and territories, our local businesses ensure that our approach to informing customers about our products is fully in line with both regulatory and customer expectations. We have a wide range of product\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nliterature available to inform customers about our products and services, including product suitability, policy coverage, cost structures, exclusions, etc. Information on our range of products is available through several channels, including our website, financial intermediaries, email, social media, television, press, digital and print advertising.\n\n## 5.2.2 Continuously measuring and improving claims handling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs part of our TNPS survey, we strive to get a better understanding of how our customers experience different aspects of the customer journey. One of the elements that is very important to our customers, is the way we handle claims when we receive them. The claims TNPS provides us with insights on how\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nour customers value our claims handling procedure and which aspects, or drivers affect their experiences most over time. The claims TNPS is calculated for a broad set of countries 2 , both for retail and commercial insurance.\n\nCompared to 2020, the claims TNPS score increased by 3.4 points 3 by end of 2021. In general, our customers value that we are easy to deal with and that we have helpful advisors in customer support. The lead time to handle claims and the quality of the information we provide, are the areas most in need of improvement. The main difference compared to last year is that the driver 'it was easy to deal with Zurich' has moved from an area in need of improvement to one of our strengths.\n\nThe results shown above prove that dedicated initiatives can have a direct impact on customer satisfaction. Some examples that helped us increase customer experience in 2021 include the obligatory onboarding of all advisors in Switzerland on the Digital Agents Workplace, leading to more personalized advice for our customers. Furthermore, we invested in additional education for our Swiss staff and the recruitment of extra advisors for the high-volume summer months. 4 All of this has led to quicker and easier claims settlements in Switzerland. In Brazil, we introduced several initiatives to simplify the communication toward our customers and reduced the lead time by digitalizing our processes. And in Japan, we simplified our claim process, which led to a steady increase in customer satisfaction. These initiatives confirm that our efforts improve our customer experience and, by consequence, strengthen our claims TNPS score.\n\n- 1 www.zurich.com/about-us/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct/we-care-about-our-customers\n- 2  Argentina, Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, UK, U.S., and Zurich International.\n- 3  Due to optimizations in our system, we continue to collect feedback from an increasing number of customers. This can also impact the TNPS score, meaning that part of the increase should be attributed to this trend.\n- 4  High volumes due to increased need for road assistance during the holiday period.",

Independent assurance report\n\n## 5.3 Digital confidence and trust\n\nOne of our goals is to make people and organizations more resilient by fostering confidence in a digital society. We aim to use this goal to improve customer experience. We are determined to be transparent about data management and Zurich's data protection and privacy policy, as we believe this is a critical factor for customer trust. During the past year, we also focused on the development of AI solutions and invested in a resilient digital experience, in line with our customer promise.\n\n## 5.3.1 Data Commitment 1\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have accelerated global efforts to deliver on our Data Commitment, which aims to go beyond regulatory compliance. Particular focus is given to enhancing standards, processes, systems and controls across regions to ensure an increased level of transparency on how we collect, use and share personal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndata. The analysis of the effectiveness, strength and robustness of processes and controls in place is used to calculate the transparency score per country. 2\n\nIn EMEA and North America (NA), more than 90 percent of countries achieved the transparency score we aim for.\n\nAcross LATAM and APAC, more than 70 percent of the countries have also achieved the targets we aim for, in spite of the different level of robustness of local data protection and privacy regulations. Countries with less demanding data protection and privacy regulations are using ongoing transformation and digitalization initiatives to enhance processes and systems, so they can proactively inform customers 3 about how their personal data is being used (and with whom it is being shared) and obtain appropriate consent. Overall, since Q1 2020 our transparency score has increased by 30 percent globally, taking into account the ratio of countries that made major improvements against the targets we aim for.\n\n## 5.3.2 Cybersecurity 4\n\nGiven the scale of the cybercrime threat, we have opted for a layered approach to protect our data and ensure resilience, by leveraging industry best practices and frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. 5 We continuously work on important areas of focus such as data protection, attack surface reduction and security capabilities development.\n\nTo strengthen our data protection, we have developed a global standard policy for data loss prevention (DLP), and we provide solution for DLP to our business units throughout the EMEA region, and this will be expanded globally over time. Local data protection coordinators for each country and business unit ensure responsiveness to local regulatory requirements for data protection. Data is protected and stored in accordance with its level of sensitivity. We address privacy by design from a forward-looking perspective for all new systems.\n\nOur attack surface reduction efforts are focused on finding, reporting, and reducing risk associated with vulnerabilities and exploitable configuration issues for systems and applications. Cybersecurity and response capabilities allow us to understand the cyber threat environment and prevent, detect, and respond to malicious threats. To ensure proper oversight, our defense-in-depth security model enables us to identify information security risk across the organization through programs such as phishing and awareness training, insider threat detection, strategic and dedicated risk assessments, threat intelligence acquisition and vulnerability management. During 2021, we met all targets for application website protection from malicious threats and continued an aggressive attack surface reduction campaign to ensure positive management of all IT vulnerabilities.\n\nWe leverage dedicated security technologies with detection, protection, logging and monitoring capabilities and we are making additional investments to counter growing security threats. In 2021, we significantly enhanced our server and workstation threat protection capabilities by upgrading to an industry-leading threat management solution.\n\nOur focus moving forward is to bring all privileged user 6 and system accounts under management, continuing vulnerability reduction, conducting dataflow analysis for confidential data, strengthening third-party information security governance, and continuing to enhance business resilience.\n\nSince 2021 we have begun to implement a new internal controls integrated framework 7 , which will provide control testing and assurance to ensure the effectiveness of information security controls (see the risk review, pages 210 to 211 for more information).\n\nWe are also dedicated to full transparency concerning information security and cyber incidents that may affect customer data. We have strict protocols in place to comply with all regulatory notification requirements and will immediately inform and provide full assistance to any customers whose data or data privacy may be impacted, regardless of whether the incident involved Zurich directly or one of our partners.\n\n- 1 Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services, Joint Ventures and Zurich Global Ventures except for Zurich International.\n- 2  The calculation of the score is based on self-assessment by reporting units, complemented by quality assurance reviews conducted at regional and Group level.\n- 3  In the section on 'our digital society', customer refers to policyholders, claimants, beneficiaries and employees.\n- 4  Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services, and Zurich Global Ventures except for Zurich International.\n- 5  A set of guidelines for mitigating organizational cybersecurity risks, published by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices.\n- 6  A privileged user has special/higher access rights.

Our goal is to be able to continue providing highly critical services to our customers under a 'total loss of technology' scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo do this, we have identified all critical services and management activities in all countries and functions. Services are considered end-to-end, to the ultimate third-party provider. They are defined as critical if their disruption, whether internally within Zurich or with a third party, can generate distress to our customers or threaten our viability under an extreme loss of technology scenario. The combination of these services and management activities represents the Zurich minimum viable operating environment (MVOE).\n\nTo ensure continuity of MVOE services and activities, we are implementing a set of digital capabilities that are required for internal and external communication (email, telephony), and to make key customer, policy and claims data available for minimum service, such as claims notification and claim settlement.\n\nIn parallel, we are building recovery capabilities, beyond traditional disaster recovery, to allow restoration of our critical IT infrastructure, and, ultimately, recovery of critical business applications before a transition to business as usual.\n\nWe set out clear expectations for suppliers in our SCOC including in relation to data protection, privacy and cyber security. We carry out risk based due diligence to verify that the supplier meets Zurich's expectations and have in place detailed policies and guidelines which our Procurement and Vendor Management teams follow. Our due diligence is based on the nature of the supplier engagement and the relevant risks. With supplier engagements that involve the processing of personal data, we carry out extensive checks on a supplier's cyber security and compliance measures. Once completed, we enter appropriate contractual clauses with robust obligations to keep personal data secure.\n\n## 5.3.4 Ethical use of artificial intelligence (AI) 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn Q3 2021, we initiated the roll-out (field-testing phase) of an AI assurance framework - a governance model that ensures the ethical use of AI solutions taking into consideration emerging regulations (e.g., EU AI Act).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe use AI for several purposes, including i) to better understand our customers' needs; ii) to enhance the efficiency of our business operations; iii) to develop innovative solutions that best protect and serve our customers; and iv) to contribute to positive and sustainable societal outcomes, such as financial and social inclusion, affordability and fair treatment of vulnerable customers.\n\nIn the course of 2021, new AI / machine learning (ML) solutions have been implemented across the value chain in major markets, for example in Germany, Japan, Switzerland and the UK with processes and controls to ensure adherence to globally consented ethical principles of fairness, transparency and accountability. Currently, we have three focus areas for AI / ML. First the deployment of predictive models to better understand risks, e.g., in the area of property risk engineering or property enrichment with open data. Second, document classification techniques, e.g., to generate efficiency gains in the areas of underwriting or claims. And finally, testing of conversational AI by using chatbots to improve customer experience and increase operational efficiency.\n\nGiven this domain's growing importance, we are establishing AI ethics committees to provide assurance and guidance over implementation of AI solutions. These committees provide a holistic, diverse and balanced view on the risks and potential benefits of the AI solution and its compliance with our Ethical AI Principles.\n\n- 1 Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services, and Zurich Global Ventures except for Zurich International.\n- 2  Reporting excludes Farmers Group Services, Joint Ventures and Zurich Global Ventures except for Zurich International.",

Independent assurance report\n\nKathleen Savio Group Chief Transformation Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Let's grow together', reflects our aspiration to support employees in their lifelong learning and growth. It is a shared engagement that asks our people to play an active role in shaping their careers and reinforces the provision of good working conditions and fair and equal compensation, in line with our focus on work sustainability.\n\n## Our goals\n\n- 6.1 Talent attraction for a sustainable future\n- 6.2  A safe working environment that supports health and wellbeing\n- 6.3  Integrated and systematic approach to diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging (DEIB)\n- 6.4  Prevention of bribery and corruption\n\n## 6.1 Talent attraction for a sustainable future\n\n## 6.1.1 Talent attraction and retention\n\nIn 2021, we observed an increase in headcount composition across the organization, with a 6 percent increase year on year. At the same time, we have seen the continued effects of high demand for key skills and capabilities, with candidates holding strong choice and negotiating power in certain markets. In response, we have closely examined where to invest and how to attract and retain talent.\n\nWe have seen a decrease in Group employee turnover since 2016, with a drop in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we had anticipated an increase in 2021 as labor markets picked up, the impact was less than expected, with continued low employee turnover across the Group.\n\nWe saw a higher turnover in NA, APAC and LATAM in 2021. This is partly in line with historical trends and the local context of more dynamic markets.\n\nA particular area of attention for us is the increasing voluntary turnover of next-generation (NextGen) employees compared to other employee groups. In addition to us strengthening our junior pipeline, we are running 'listen and act' initiatives to understand more about their preferences, pain points, and recommendations for developing potential solutions. We are also focused on offering more transparent and flexible career paths, which will form an integral part of developing and retaining all segments of the workforce.",

With this strategy we aim to reach gender balance across the organization. To increase gender balance, we are continuing to run a number of initiatives to support the development and promotion of women across the Group. For example, we have rolled out female sponsorship programs in Group Functions and business units to promote visibility of women. Another example is our FlexWork@Zurich program enabling flexible working arrangements for employees so that they can work in ways that better suit their lifestyles. As a result of these and other initiatives, we have seen some evolution in gender diversity in our workforce since 2017, particularly at the senior leadership level. In 2017, the percentage of senior executives at career level E who were female was 18 percent. At the end of 2021, it was 24 percent.\n\nWe also see that across the Group, non-national employees tend to have a larger representation at more senior career levels. This can be explained by the movement of seasoned, internal talent to new opportunities across our Group.\n\n- 1 www.edge-cert.org\n- 2  As of December 2021, the following business units are EDGE certified: Argentina, Australia, Brazil Chile, Corporate Center, Ireland, Mexico, Santander Brazil and Mexico, Spain and Switzerland.

We are firmly engaged with strong and effective controls, and we monitor financial, legal and regulatory developments to conduct business in an ethical and compliant manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nZurich's Group Policy Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (Group Policy ABC) sets out the minimum requirements with which its subsidiaries and employees need to comply, and provides a list of best practices and recommendations that business units should adopt.\n\nThe Group Policy ABC requires the appointment of an Anti-Bribery and Corruption Officer (ABCO) for each business unit. The ABCO's duty is to monitor compliance with the Group Policy ABC and the applicable local anti-bribery and anti-corruption framework. The ABCO is also responsible for maintaining the local framework and reviewing it regularly to ensure that it appropriately addresses bribery and corruption risks in the business unit.\n\nOur Group Policy ABC sets out minimum requirements in relation to the following, amongst others:\n\n- - Associated persons due diligence.\n- - Third-party payment due diligence.\n- - Incentives.\n- - Gifts, entertainment, and other adavantages.\n\n## 6.4.2 Training and awareness\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are aware of the importance of fostering a culture of compliance among all our employees, and we understand that creating general awareness and understanding of potential areas of bribery and corruption risk, applicable laws, and our policies is critical to achieving this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe frequently educate our employees and senior management on topics related to compliance and ethics. This begins with mandatory Code of Conduct training. 1 This annual training raises awareness on what it means to do the right thing and makes employees and managers more confident in making ethical decisions in their day-to-day work. Among other topics covered, the training helps employees to spot and report possible bribery and corruption incidents. In 2021, almost all our employees and senior management completed the training, resulting in a global completion rate of 99.96 percent. The completion rate was above 99 percent in all regions. 2\n\nEmployees and managers whose role exposes them to potentially greater bribery and corruption-related risks are also required to undergo enhanced training on how to identify and respond to potential bribery and corruption risks. Group Compliance develops the training in line with the Group Policy ABC and in consideration of local risks, regulations and requirements for each jurisdiction. The training is reviewed on an annual basis to incorporate new developments and requirements. This keeps our employees and management at the forefront of managing the prevention of bribery and corruption and helps us make good on our ambition of being a responsible and ethical business.\n\n## 6.4.3 Protected advice\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs discussed above, Zurich and its employees are all subject to our Group Policy ABC 3 and Code of Conduct 4 , and we provide them with training and other resources that aim to prevent and detect misconduct. If employees suspect misconduct, we want them to feel comfortable reporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntheir concern and feel supported by the organization when doing so.\n\nThere are multiple channels for employees to raise concerns, including local line managers and legal or compliance functions. They can also use the Zurich ethics line (ZEL) to report concerns, either via telephone or online via a web form. The ZEL can also be used by other (external) stakeholders to raise concerns. Reports to the ZEL can be made anonymously. We do not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports a concern in good faith.\n\nThe ZEL is available globally and offers support in local languages. Once a report is received, it is sent to a designated person within Zurich to be reviewed and if necessary investigated. If a report of misconduct is substantiated, we will take remedial actions as appropriate, including potential disciplinary action, and if required, referring the matter to the relevant authorities.\n\n- 1 The Code of Conduct training includes the topic of anti-bribery and anti-corruption.\n- 2  The Code of Conduct training is shared with Board members and may be shared with various business partners depending on country requirements.

Box CH-8010 Zurich\n\nTo the Executive Committee of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd, Zurich\n\nZurich, February 18, 2022\n\n## Independent assurance report\n\nWe have been engaged to perform assurance procedures to provide limited assurance on Sustainability Disclosures of the Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its consolidated subsidiaries ('ZIG' or 'Zurich Insurance Group' or 'Zurich'). Our engagement is focused on selected quantitative performance indicators (the 'performance indicators 2021') disclosed in the Annual Report 2021 of ZIG 'Integrated sustainability disclosure' ('the sustainability disclosures') for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2021. A listing of these performance indicators 2021 including section references and page numbers is attached as appendix to our independent assurance report.\n\nOther than as described in the preceding paragraph, which sets out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform assurance procedures on the remaining information included in the sustainability disclosures, and accordingly, we do not express a conclusion on this information.\n\n## Applicable criteria\n\nZurich Insurance Company Ltd defined as applicable criteria (the 'applicable criteria'):\n\n- \u25ba World Economic Forum's (WEF) Metrics of Sustainable Value Creation for performance indicators 2021 listed under 'WEF IBC metrics' section in the appendix. The guideline is presented on the WEF webpage.\n- \u25ba SASB Insurance reporting standard for performance indicators 2021 listed under 'SASB standard disclosures' section in the appendix. The guideline is presented on the SASB webpage.\n- \u25ba ZIG's own methodology for performance indicators 2021 listed under 'Disclosures based on Zurich Insurance Group Ltd's own methodology' section in the appendix. A description of the methodology for these performance indicators is included in the relevant sections of the sustainability disclosures as listed in the appendix.\n\nWe believe that these criteria are a suitable basis for our limited assurance engagement.\n\n## Responsibility of Zurich Insurance Group's management\n\nZIG's management is responsible for the selection of the applicable criteria and for the preparation and presentation of the performance indicators 2021 in accordance with the applicable criteria. This responsibility includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal controls relevant to the preparation of the performance indicators 2021 that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Independence and Quality Control\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code), which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behavior.\n\nOur firm applies the International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nZurich Insurance Group Annual Report 2021\n\nPhone:\n\n+41 58 286 31 11\n\nFax:\n\n+41 58 286 30 04\n\nwww.ey.com/ch",

We conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information . That standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the performance indicators 2021 are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn accordance with the engagement agreement, our duty of care for this engagement only extends to the management of Zurich Insurance Group.\n\nBased on risk and materiality consideration we have undertaken procedures to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence. The procedures selected depend on the practitioner's judgment. This includes the assessment of the risks of material misstatements in the performance indicators 2021. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in scope than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\n## Summary of work performed\n\nOur limited assurance procedures included, amongst others, the following work:\n\n- \u25ba Assessment of the suitability of the underlying criteria and their consistent application\n- \u25ba Inquiries of company's representatives responsible for collecting, consolidating and calculating the performance indicators 2021 in order to assess the process of preparing the data, the reporting system, the completeness of the data capture and compilation methods as well as internal controls to the extent relevant for the limited assurance engagement\n- \u25ba Inspection of the relevant documentation of the systems and processes for compiling, analyzing, and aggregating the performance indicators 2021 and testing such documentation on a sample basis\n- \u25ba Analytical procedures and inspection of documents on a sample basis with respect to the compilation and reporting of the performance indicators 2021\n- \u25ba Analytical procedures of the sustainability report regarding plausibility and consistency with performance indicators 2021\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our limited assurance conclusion.\n\n## Our conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the performance indicators 2021 have not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the applicable criteria.\n\nErnst & Young Ltd\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPartner\n\nDirector\n\n## Appendix:\n\nSelected quantitative performance indicators (performance indicators 2021)\n\nIsabelle Santenac (Qualified Signature)\n\nMark Veser (Qualified Signature)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Similarly, our wellestablished Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology continued to support in delivering risk insights and focus on the risks that mattered.\n\nBy effectively managing our risks, we maintained our resilience and made sure we were there to help when our customers needed us most.\n\n## A dynamic risk landscape\n\nThe speed of change was a key element in the risk landscape of the Group in 2021. This was best illustrated by the evolution of cyber risk as attacks changed rapidly in scale, sophistication and targets. Cyber insurability is an area of increasing focus as risk appetites are adjusted.\n\nElsewhere, the sudden re-appearance of inflation concerns has brought to the fore the continued large-scale fiscal costs of the pandemic and the disconnect between markets and the real economy due to expansionary monetary policy. With limited appetite for changes to current policies, economic risks will continue to build.\n\nWe continue to apply our expertise and tools, such as dynamic scenario and sensitivity analyses, to assess and proactively manage potential impacts. Using output from the scenario assessments, we continue to develop, implement and monitor actions to give optimal outcomes for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nVarious events in 2021 illustrated the increasing risks posed by climate change. The Group's commitment to sustainability, including managing the risks posed by climate change, continues to be an integral part of Zurich's risk management approach.\n\n## Development of Swiss Solvency Test ratio\n\n## Highlights by risk type\n\nThe Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio increased to 212 percent\u00b9 as of January 1, 2022 from 182 percent as of January 1, 2021.

Zurich takes and manages risks in an informed and disciplined manner and within a pre-determined risk appetite and tolerance.\n\nThe major risk management objectives at Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich, or the Group) are to:\n\n- - Support achievement of the Group's strategy and protect capital, liquidity, earnings and reputation by monitoring that risks are taken within the Group's risk tolerance.\n- - Enhance value creation by embedding disciplined risk-taking in the company's culture and contributing to an optimal risk-return profile where risk-reward trade-offs are transparent, understood, and risks are appropriately rewarded.\n- - Efficiently and effectively diversify risk and avoid or mitigate unrewarded risks.\n- - Encourage openness and transparency to enable effective risk management.\n- - Support decision-making processes by providing consistent, reliable and timely risk information.\n- - Protect Zurich's reputation and brand by promoting a sound culture of risk awareness, and disciplined and informed risk-taking.\n\n## Enterprise Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Enterprise Risk Management Framework is based on a governance framework that sets forth clear responsibilities for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks.\n\nThe Group's risk appetite and tolerance statement reflects Zurich's willingness and capacity to take risks in pursuit of value creation and sets boundaries within which the businesses act. Zurich protects its capital, liquidity, earnings and reputation by monitoring that risks are taken within agreed risk appetite levels and tolerance limits. The Group regularly assesses and, as far as possible, quantifies material risks to which it is exposed.\n\nThe Zurich Risk Policy sets the principles and approach for effective risk management throughout the Group. The policy describes the Group's Enterprise Risk Management Framework and provides a standardized set of risk types. Risk-specific policy manuals provide requirements and procedures to implement the principles in the Zurich Risk Policy.\n\nThe Group identifies, assesses, manages, monitors and reports risks that have an impact on the achievement of its strategic objectives by applying its proprietary Total Risk Profiling\u2122 methodology. The methodology allows Zurich to assess risks in terms of severity and likelihood, and supports the definition and implementation of mitigating actions. At Group level, this is an annual process, followed by regular reviews and updates by management.\n\nTo foster transparency about risk, the Group regularly reports on its risk profile at business and Group levels. The Group has procedures to refer risk topics to senior management and the Board of Directors in a timely manner.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Further adjustments usually include items such as intangible assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, allowing for discounting of liabilities and the value of in-force business, and market-consistent valuation of external debt according to the methodology under SST.\n\nZurich strives to simplify the Group's legal entity structure to reduce complexity and increase fungibility of capital.\n\n## Capital management framework\n\nThe Group's capital management framework forms the basis for actively managing capital within Zurich. The Group uses a number of different capital models, taking into account economic, regulatory, and rating agency constraints. The Group's capital and solvency position is monitored and regularly reported to the Executive Committee (ExCo) and Board of Directors.\n\nZurich's policy is to allocate capital to businesses earning the highest risk-adjusted returns, and to pool risks and capital as much as possible to operationalize its risk diversification.\n\nThe Group's executive management determines the capital management strategy and sets the principles, standards and policies to execute the strategy. Group Treasury and Capital Management executes the strategy.\n\n## Capital management program\n\nThe Group's capital management program comprises various actions to optimize shareholders' total return and to meet capital needs, while enabling Zurich to take advantage of growth opportunities. Such actions include paying and receiving dividends, capital repayments, share buybacks, issuance of shares, issuance of senior and hybrid debt, securitization and purchase of reinsurance.\n\nThe Group seeks to maintain a balance between returns for shareholders and the security that a sound capital position provides, also for our customers. Dividends, share buybacks, and issuances and redemption of debt have a significant influence on capital levels. In 2021, the Group paid a dividend out of retained earnings, bought own shares to reduce future dilution from share-based employee compensation plans and issued senior and hybrid debt to finance redemptions and investments in the Group's development.\n\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations stipulates that dividends may only be paid out of freely distributable reserves or retained earnings. Apart from what is specified by the Swiss Code of Obligations, Zurich Insurance Group Ltd faces no legal restrictions on dividends it may pay to its shareholders. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of the statutory general legal reserve was more than 50 times the paid-in share capital. The ability of the Group's subsidiaries to pay dividends may be restricted or indirectly influenced by minimum capital and solvency requirements imposed by insurance and other regulators in the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. Other limitations or considerations include foreign exchange control restrictions in some countries, and rating agencies' methodologies.\n\nFor details on issuances and redemptions of debt, see notes 18 and 29 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In each country in which the Group operates, the local regulator specifies the minimum amount and type of capital that each of the regulated entities must hold in addition to their liabilities. In addition to the minimum capital required to comply with the solvency requirements, the Group aims to hold an adequate buffer under local solvency requirements to ensure regulated subsidiaries can absorb a level of volatility and meet local capital requirements.\n\n## Regulatory solvency regimes\n\n## Regulatory requirements in Switzerland\n\nThe Swiss Solvency Test (SST) adopts a risk-based and total balance sheet approach. Insurance companies are required to provide a market-consistent assessment of the value of their assets and liabilities. Possible changes to these balance sheet positions are modelled over a one-year period to arrive at the total required capital.\n\nUnder the SST, insurance companies and insurance groups can apply to use company-specific internal models to calculate risk-bearing and target capital, as well as the SST ratio. The SST ratio must be calculated as per January 1 and submitted to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). Zurich filed with FINMA an SST ratio of 182 percent (unaudited) as of January 1, 2021. Zurich met the regulatory solvency requirements in Switzerland throughout 2021.\n\nThe estimated SST ratio as of January 1, 2022 stands at 212 percent (unaudited). The final SST ratio as of January 1, 2022 will be filed with FINMA by the end of April 2022 and is subject to review by FINMA.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the European Economic Area (EEA)\n\nThe main regulatory framework governing the Group's subsidiaries in the EEA is Solvency II. This is a risk-based capital framework which covers capital requirements (pillar 1), governance and risk management (pillar 2) and reporting (pillar 3). All EEA-based legal entities of the Group use the Solvency II standard formula for their pillar 1 requirements with the exception of Zurich Insurance plc (Ireland) that applies an approved internal model.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the UK\n\nThe United Kingdom left the EU and the EEA on January 31, 2020 and the transition period ended on December 31, 2020, meaning UK regulations can diverge from Solvency II regulatory requirements. As of December 31, 2021 the UK regulations have not materially diverged.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in the U.S.\n\nIn the U.S., required capital is determined to be 'company action level risk-based capital' calculated using the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' risk-based capital model. This method, which builds on statutory accounts, measures the minimum amount of capital for an insurance company to support its overall business operations by taking into account its size and risk profile.\n\n## Regulatory requirements in other jurisdictions\n\nEvery country has a capital standard for insurance companies. Several jurisdictions (e.g., Brazil and Mexico) have implemented approaches similar to Solvency II.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market value margin, also known as risk margin, is the cost of future regulatory risk capital stemming from the present portfolio of assets and liabilities.\n\nIn 2021, the solvency of the Group returned to a pre-pandemic level with an estimated SST ratio of 212 percent as of January 1, 2022, well above the Group's SST ratio target of 160 percent. The main drivers of the Group's SST ratio increase in 2021 were strong underlying capital generation and improved market conditions.\n\nIn the SST ratio calculations as of January 1, 2022, no allowances have been made for the sale of the Italian life and pension back book which is subject to regulatory approval or the redemption of USD 1bn of subordinated debt in January 2022.\n\n## SST available financial resources\n\nThe Group's AFR are derived from the SST net asset value (NAV). The NAV represents the difference between the market-consistent value of assets and liabilities according to the market-consistent valuation methodology under SST.\n\nDuring 2021, the Group's AFR increased by USD 0.5 billion to USD 52.4 billion as of January 1, 2022, compared to USD 51.9 billion as of January 1, 2021. The main drivers of the AFR increase in 2021 were economic profits, positive equity market development, new net issuance of subordinated debt eligible as capital, partly off-set by the dividend accrual, U.S. dollar appreciation and assumption and model changes.\n\n## SST target capital\n\nThe Group uses an internal risk model to determine the required target capital (TC).\n\nThe Group's TC as of January 1, 2022 amounted to USD 27.7 billion, a decrease of USD 3.4 billion compared to USD 31.1 billion as of January 1, 2021, primarily due to a reduction in market risk following improved market conditions.\n\n## Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio and underlying components\n\nTable 1\n\n| in USD billions                         | January 1,   2022  1   | January 1,  2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n| Total risk capital                      | 24.3                   | 26.8               |\n| Other effects on target capital (TC)  2 | (2.3)                  | (1.5)              |\n| Market value margin (MVM)               | 5.7                    | 5.8                |\n| TC                                      | 27.7                   | 31.1               |\n| TC minus MVM                            | 22.0                   | 25.3               |\n| Available financial resources (AFR)     | 52.4                   | 51.9               |\n| AFR minus MVM                           | 46.7                   | 46.0               |\n| Group SST ratio                         | 212%                   | 182%               |\n\n- 1 The SST results as of January 1, 2022 are estimated and may differ from the final SST results, which will be presented in the Financial Condition Report at the end of April 2022.\n- 2   Other effects are expected business development over the forecasting horizon, additional business costs and FINMA requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As of January 1, 2022, the largest components of total risk are market risk and premium and reserve risk, comprising 63 percent and 16 percent of the total risk capital, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in total risk capital as of January 1, 2022 compared to January 1, 2021, reflects a reduction in market risk, mainly as a result of U.S. dollar appreciation against major currencies and a higher interest rate environment. Other risk types saw smaller movements as of January 1, 2022 compared to January 1, 2021, predominantly impacted by business growth and economic environment changes.\n\n## Total risk capital, split by risk type\n\n## January 1, 2022\n\nin %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Market risk               | 63%   |\n|---------------------------|-------|\n| Premium &  reserve risk   | 16%   |\n| Business risk             | 9%    |\n| Life insurance risk       | 5%    |\n| Natural  catastrophe risk | 6%    |\n| Other credit risk         | 1%    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Market risk               | 68%   |\n|---------------------------|-------|\n| Premium &  reserve risk   | 14%   |\n| Business risk             | 9%    |\n| Life insurance risk       | 4%    |\n| Natural  catastrophe risk | 4%    |\n| Other credit risk         | 1%    |\n\n## Sensitivity and scenario analysis\n\nThe Group evaluates sensitivities to, and stress scenarios on, the SST ratio, and assesses results relative to Zurich's risk appetite and tolerance. The sensitivities and stress scenarios in the chart below capture two key risks to the Group: market risk and insurance risk.\n\nMarket risk sensitivities show the estimated impact on the Group's SST ratio of a half percentage-point (50 basis points, or bps) increase or decrease in yield curves, a 10 percent appreciation or depreciation in the U.S. dollar, a 20 percent rise or decline in all stock markets, and a 100 bps increase in credit spreads, with and without euro-denominated sovereign bonds. The sensitivities are considered as separate but instantaneous shocks. They are a best estimate and non-linear, for example, a change to the size of the market movement could result in disproportionally higher (or lower) impact on the SST ratio depending on the prevailing market conditions at the time.\n\nFor insurance risk, the chart shows the three largest natural catastrophe events to which the Group is exposed. Insurance risk scenarios are defined as events that have a small probability of occurring but could, if realized, negatively affect the Group's AFR. The impact of insurance-specific scenarios on the target capital is not taken into account.\n\n## January 1, 2021\n\nin %\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the interest rate sensitivities, shocks are applied to the liquid part of the yield curve. Credit spreads (CS) include mortgages, including and excluding euro sovereign spreads. CS sensitivities of available capital include changes to the volatility adjustment applied to the interest rate curves but exclude profit sharing.\n- 2  The insurance risk-specific scenarios relate to natural catastrophe events that are estimated o n a modeled 250-year net aggregate loss (equivalent to a 99.6 percent probability of non-exceedance).\n\n## Insurance financial strength rating\n\nThe Group has interactive relationships with three global rating agencies: S&P Global Ratings (S&P), Moody's, and AM Best. The insurance financial strength rating (IFSR) of the Group's main operating entity, Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC), is an important element of Zurich's competitive position, while the Group's credit ratings also affect the cost of debt capital.\n\nThe insurance financial strength rating was upgraded by S&P to AA on March 15, 2021 because 'ZIC's financial performance has sustainably improved' while also 'improving its balance sheet resilience and capital-allocation discipline'.\n\nOn October 1, 2021, AM Best revised the issuer credit rating (ICR) outlook of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its main subsidiaries to positive from stable. This 'reflects Zurich's consolidated balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, very favorable business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management'.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the IFSR of Zurich Insurance Company Ltd, the main operating entity of the Group, was rated 'AA/Stable' by S&P Global Ratings, 'Aa3/Stable' by Moody's, and 'A+ (Superior)/Stable' by AM Best. AM Best ICR was 'aa-/positive'.\n\nAudited\n\n<!-- image -->",

This may result from inherent uncertainty of insured events or losses, inadequate or ineffective underwriting or accumulation management, inappropriate product development, pricing, claims management, reserving or reinsurance. The profitability of insurance business is also susceptible to business risk in the form of unexpected changes in expenses, policyholders' behavior, and fluctuations in new business volumes. Zurich manages insurance risk through:\n\n- - Specific underwriting and claims standards and controls.\n- - Robust reserving processes.\n- - External reinsurance.\n\n## Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nP&C insurance risk arises from coverage provided for motor, property, liability, special lines and worker injury. It comprises premium and reserve risk, catastrophe risk, and business risk. Premium and reserve risk covers uncertainties in the frequency of the occurrence of the insured events as well as in the severity of the resulting claims. Catastrophe risk predominantly relates to uncertainty around natural catastrophes. Business risk for P&C predominantly relates to unexpected increases in the expenses relating to claims handling, underwriting, and administration.\n\n## Management of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nThe Group's underwriting strategy takes advantage of the diversification of P&C risks across lines of business, customers and geographic regions. Zurich defines Group-wide governance for insurance risk including for new products. Underwriting discipline is a fundamental part of managing insurance risk. The Group sets limits on underwriting capacity and delegates authority to individuals based on their specific expertise and sets appropriate underwriting and pricing guidelines. Technical reviews assure that underwriters perform within authorities and adhere to underwriting policies.\n\nP&C insurance reserves are regularly estimated, reviewed and monitored by qualified and experienced actuaries at local, regional and Group levels. To arrive at their reserve estimates, the actuaries take into consideration, among other things, the latest available facts, trends and patterns of loss payments. Inflation is monitored with insights feeding into actuarial reserving models and Zurich's underwriting processes and pricing.\n\nTo ensure a common understanding of business insights and new trends for reserve analysis, financial plans, underwriting and pricing decisions, the Group has established a culture of continuous cross-functional collaboration. For this, underwriting, actuarial (pricing and reserving), claims, finance, sales and distribution, risk engineering and risk management contribute to quarterly meetings at local and Group level.\n\nZurich's Emerging and Sustainability Risk Committee - with cross-functional expertise from core insurance functions such as underwriting, claims and risk management - identifies, assesses and recommends actions for emerging risks.\n\nGovernance is in place to ensure appropriate focus on top-line targets and profitability. Reinsurance is deployed to help manage insurance risk. Group Risk Management also provides independent assurance through risk reviews.\n\nThe Group is exposed to losses that could arise from natural and man-made catastrophes. The main concentrations of risks arising from such potential catastrophes are regularly reported to executive management. The most important peril regions for natural catastrophes are U.S. and Caribbean hurricane, California earthquake and European windstorm.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consistent with this view on natural catastrophes, Zurich performs profitability assessments and strategic capacity allocations, and chooses the type and quantity of reinsurance it buys.\n\nTo ensure global consistency, exposures to natural catastrophes are modeled by a dedicated Group function. Potential losses from property, motor and marine policies with material exposure in hazard-prone geographical areas are probabilistically modeled, as well as worker injury policies with material exposure in U.S. seismic zones. Losses for other lines of business are estimated based on adjustments to these modeled results. Risk modeling mainly addresses weather- induced perils such as wind, flood, tornado, and hail, and geological-induced perils such as earthquake.\n\nZurich regularly reviews and expands the scope and sophistication of its modeling and strives to improve data quality. Zurich has invested in a diversified, multi-vendor-based catastrophe modeling ecosystem and in expanding its catastrophe research and development capabilities to complement existing expertise in natural catastrophe risk management (e.g., risks relating to climate change, cyber, communicable diseases, and casualty catastrophes).\n\nZurich supplements internal know-how with external knowledge (e.g., the Advisory Council for Catastrophes) and is a shareholder of PERILS AG, Switzerland, a catastrophe exposure and loss data aggregation and estimation firm. Zurich is also a member of the open-source initiative, Oasis Loss Modelling Framework.\n\n## COVID-19 pandemic\n\nZurich has developed scenario modeling capabilities for the COVID-19 pandemic which continue to be refined based on claims data. The scope in terms of lines of business includes primarily property, travel, accident and health, and credit and surety. The scenario modeling continues to inform the Group about the financial impact of COVID-19 and understand the main sensitivities. The data and risk insights gained from COVID-19 were used to build a model to better assess the risk in the P&C portfolio from pandemics.\n\n## Man-made catastrophes\n\nMan-made catastrophes include events such as industrial accidents, terrorism and cyber attacks.\n\nFor terrorism, worker injury and property risk exposures are analyzed to identify areas with significant risk concentration. Other lines of business are assessed, although the potential exposure is not as significant. A vendor-provided catastrophe model is used to evaluate potential exposures in every major U.S. city. The Group's analysis for the P&C business has shown that its exposures outside of North America are lower, in a large part due to governmentprovided pools. Outside the modeled areas, exposure concentrations are identified in Zurich's Risk Exposure Data Store (REDS). Exposure concentrations for location-based man-made scenarios, other than terrorism, are also identified in REDS, for example, industrial explosions at global ports.\n\nThe Group uses third-party models to manage its underwriting and accumulations for cyber and casualty catastrophe risks. The Group actively monitors and manages its cyber exposure and continues to refine products to ensure their appropriateness. Improving modeling capabilities and data quality for cyber and casualty catastrophe risks are key focus areas.\n\n## Concentration of Property & Casualty (P&C) insurance risk\n\nThe Group defines concentration risk in the P&C business as the risk of exposure to increased losses associated with inadequately diversified portfolios. Concentration risk for a P&C insurer may arise due to a concentration of business written within a geographical area or of underlying risks covered.\n\nTables 2.a and 2.b show the Group's concentration of risk within the P&C business by region and line of business based on direct written premiums before reinsurance. P&C premiums ceded to reinsurers (including retrocessions) amounted to USD 9.2 billion and USD 8.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Reinsurance programs are managed on a global basis, and therefore, the net premium after reinsurance is monitored on an aggregated basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The actual experience may differ to that expected at the time of writing the business. For example, mortality could be either higher or lower than expected due to an unexpectedly harsh or benign flu season.\n\nTo understand the potential impact of experience differing from expectations, Zurich uses models to perform sensitivity analyses. The impact of changing the assumptions is considered under different scenarios across the risk types and products. Changes relating to absolute level and trend development in assumptions are considered by product category. For example, Zurich looks at the impact of an increase in morbidity rates for protection products or changes in the level and trend of longevity for annuity products. These analyses assist in understanding how sensitive the business is to changes in various assumptions and where there are benefits of having a diversified portfolio of risks and products. Changes in the same assumption can have a positive impact on one product and a negative impact on another. For example, people living longer than expected may have a positive impact on products that offer life cover, as claims are then paid later than expected, but could have a negative impact on annuity products as payments are made for longer than expected. At Zurich, the Life liability risks are managed through established processes with requirements described in the Zurich Risk Policy.\n\nThe Group has local product development and approval committees and a Group-level committee to review potential new life products that could significantly increase or change the nature of the risks or introduce new risks. The Group also regularly reviews the continued suitability and the potential risks of existing life products open to new business to ensure sustainability of the business.\n\nProduct pricing involves setting assumptions relating to life insurance risks. Local teams have responsibility for the pricing of the products in line with the experience and emerging trends observed in each market. The emerging experience is regularly monitored and compared against expectations. Where permitted, premiums are adjusted for factors such as age, gender, and smoker status to reflect the corresponding risks. Policy terms and conditions and disclosure requirements are designed to mitigate the risk arising from non-standard and unpredictable risks that could result in a severe financial loss.\n\nThe underwriting process forms an important part of risk management and risk selection for life insurance risks. This process is supported through setting standards in the Zurich Risk Policy and providing support through additional underwriting guidelines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Risks that are inherent in these products are largely passed on to the policyholder, although a portion of the Group's management fees is linked to the value of funds under management, and hence is at risk if fund values decrease. Contracts may have minimum guaranteed death benefits where the sum at risk depends on the fair value of the underlying investments. Other life insurance liabilities include traditional life insurance products, such as protection and life annuity products.\n\nProtection products (including disability products) provide benefits linked to policyholders' life and health and mainly carry mortality and morbidity risks. Changes in medical treatments and lifestyle changes are among the most significant factors that could result in earlier or more claims than expected or customers claiming for longer than expected. Disability, when defined in terms of the ability to perform an occupation, could also be affected by adverse economic conditions. This impact could come through, for example, an increase in claims relating to mental health conditions triggered by an economic downturn.\n\nLife annuity products provide benefits that are paid to the customer either for a selected number of years, or until they die. Therefore, these products carry longevity risk as people living longer than expected can have a material impact on these products. Medical advances and improved social conditions that lead to increased longevity are significant risk drivers for these products. Annuitant (beneficiary) mortality assumptions include allowance for future mortality improvements. The trends in mortality improvements are monitored to ensure that changes in experience are considered. The exposure to longevity risk at a Group level is measured regularly and compared against the limit set by the Group.\n\nThe Group is exposed to risks posed by policyholder behavior and fluctuating expenses. These are mitigated by designing products that, as closely as possible, match revenue and expenses associated with the contract.\n\nThe Group is also exposed to investment and surrender risks related to bank-owned life insurance contracts sold in the U.S. These risks have reduced significantly in recent years as several significant policies have switched into less risky investment divisions. See heading 'other contracts' in note 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nIn the past, low interest rates have led to an increase in both Life business risks and Life liability risks (especially longevity risk). While interest rates have recently started to rise, the level of interest rates remains an important factor in the evaluation of insurance risks.\n\nFurthermore, interest rate guarantees (with concentration in traditional guaranteed business in Germany, Switzerland and Italy and variable annuity business in the U.S. containing minimum guaranteed death benefits) expose Zurich to financial losses that may arise as a result of adverse movements in interest rates. These guarantees are managed through a combination of asset-liability management and hedging.\n\nThe Group has a dynamic hedging strategy to reduce the investment risk associated with the closed book of variable annuitants written by its U.S. subsidiary Zurich American Life Insurance Company. This exposure has fallen substantially as a result of several policy buyback programs since 2015.\n\nDiversification across regions and businesses, as shown in table 4 below, contributes to reducing the impacts of the risks associated with the Life business described above.\n\n## Concentration of Life insurance risk\n\nThe Group defines concentration risk in the Life business as the risk of exposure to increased losses associated with inadequately diversified portfolios of assets or obligations. Concentration risk for a life insurer may arise with respect to investments in a geographical area, economic sector, or individual issuers, or due to a concentration of business written within a geographical area, of a product type, or of underlying risks covered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The life insurance reserves also include policyholder surplus reserves with a loss absorbing capacity\u00b9, predominantly in Germany in the amount of USD 9.5 billion in 2021 (2020: USD 12.0 billion) and in the UK in the amount of USD 0.5 billion in 2021 (2020: USD 0.6 billion). The net movement in Italy reserves in 2021 is mainly related to an agreement entered into by Zurich Investments Life S.p.A. to sell part of its life and pension back book (see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements). The Group's exposure to life insurance risks varies significantly by geographic region and line of business and may change over time. See note 8 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on reserves for insurance contracts.\n\n- 1 Policyholder surplus reserves with loss-absorbing capacity refer to funds allocated to the policyholders that can be used by the shareholders, and which, under certain conditions, may require regulatory approval.\n\nTable 4\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   | Unit-linked   insurance contracts   | Unit-linked   insurance contracts   | Other life   insurance liabilities   | Other life   insurance liabilities   | Total reserves   | Total reserves   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                                      | 2021                                | 2020                                | 2021                                 | 2020                                 | 2021             | 2020             |\n| Life                                 |                                     |                                     |                                      |                                      |                  |                  |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa         | 51,005                              | 50,476                              | 78,194                               | 90,470                               | 129,199          | 140,945          |\n| of which:                            |                                     |                                     |                                      |                                      |                  |                  |\n| United Kingdom                       | 15,700                              | 15,934                              | 4,116                                | 4,018                                | 19,816           | 19,952           |\n| Germany                              | 22,757                              | 22,016                              | 38,155                               | 43,235                               | 60,912           | 65,251           |\n| Switzerland                          | 1,148                               | 936                                 | 17,069                               | 18,491                               | 18,216           | 19,426           |\n| Italy                                | 4,071                               | 4,163                               | 3,227                                | 6,859                                | 7,297            | 11,023           |\n| Ireland                              | 976                                 | 1,315                               | 2,052                                | 2,451                                | 3,028            | 3,766            |\n| Spain                                | 602                                 | 676                                 | 11,428                               | 12,802                               | 12,031           | 13,478           |\n| Zurich International                 | 5,298                               | 4,982                               | 235                                  | 352                                  | 5,532            | 5,334            |\n| Rest of Europe, Middle East & Africa | 454                                 | 453                                 | 1,913                                | 2,262                                | 2,367            | 2,715            |\n| North America                        | 11,749                              | 10,983                              | 1,297                                | 1,235                                | 13,046           | 12,218           |\n| Asia Pacific                         | 703                                 | 697                                 | 4,467                                | 4,740                                | 5,170            | 5,437            |\n| Latin America                        | 13,516                              | 13,740                              | 5,068                                | 5,984                                | 18,585           | 19,725           |\n| Group Reinsurance                    | -

The Group follows a centralized reinsurance purchasing strategy for both P&C and Life, and bundles programs, where appropriate, to benefit from diversification and economies of scale. In support of the Group's empowerment-based management model and to align risk-bearing capacities between the Group and individual country operations, internal reinsurance applies to all externally reinsured lines of business. In addition, to actively manage and reduce potential claimsrecovery risks on facultative cessions and to support the strategy on operational excellence, the Group has specific facultative property and casualty reinsurance facilities.\n\nThe Group structures and aligns its external reinsurance protection to its capital position to achieve an optimal risk-return ratio. This includes participation in the underlying risks through self-retentions in line with the risk appetite of each line of business. The cession rate for P&C was 23.0 percent (14.2 percent excluding captives, unaudited) as of December 31, 2021 and 24.2 percent (14.4 percent excluding captives, unaudited) as of December 31, 2020. The cession rate for Life was 10.8 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 8.8 percent as of December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Group uses traditional and collateralized reinsurance markets to protect itself against extreme single events, multiple event occurrences across regions, and increased frequency of events. Specifically, to protect the Group against man-made and natural catastrophe scenarios per event, Zurich arranges an annual aggregate global cover as illustrated in the graph on the next page.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The natural catastrophe reinsurance covers are on a loss-occurrence basis, except for the global aggregate catastrophe cover, which operates on an annual aggregate basis. The in-force natural catastrophe covers renew annually, with the exception of the global property catastrophe cover, which is up for renewal on April 1, 2022, following a three-year term.\n\nIn addition to these covers, the Group purchases several regional catastrophe covers, has a bilateral risk swap, and various line of business-specific risk treaties. These covers are reviewed continuously and are subject to change in the future.\n\nTo complement existing treaties, the Group purchases catastrophe reinsurance specific to life insurance for its exposure to natural and man-made catastrophes.\n\n## Catastrophe reinsurance treaties in USD millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- - Global aggregate cat treaty renewed on January 1, 2021; US treaties renewed per April 1 , 2021; Global all perils cat treaty renewed on April 1, 2021 (automaticaly renewed into year of the three years period); International and Europe all perils cat treaty renewed July 1, 2021.

Risk factors include:\n\n- - Equity market price changes.\n- - Real estate market price changes.\n- - Interest rate changes.\n- - Credit and swap spread changes.\n- - Defaults of issuers.\n- - Changes in currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Group manages the market risk of assets relative to liabilities on an economic total balance sheet basis. This is done to achieve the maximum risk-adjusted excess return on assets relative to the liability benchmark, while also taking into account the Group's risk tolerance and local regulatory constraints.\n\nThe Group has policies and limits to manage market risk and keep its strategic asset allocation in line with its risk capacity. Zurich centrally manages certain asset classes to control aggregation of risk and provides a consistent approach to constructing portfolios and selecting external asset managers. It diversifies portfolios, investments and asset managers, and regularly measures and manages market risk exposure. The Group defines limits on concentration of investments in single issuers and certain asset classes, as well as the degree to which asset interest rate sensitivities may deviate from liability interest rate sensitivities. The Group regularly reviews its capacity to hold illiquid investments.\n\nThe Asset/Liability Management Investment Committee reviews and monitors the Group strategic asset allocation and tactical boundaries, and monitors Group asset/liability exposure. The Group oversees the activities of local asset/liability management investment committees and regularly assesses market risks at both Group and local business levels. The economic effect of potential extreme market moves is regularly examined and considered when setting the asset allocation.\n\nRisk assessment reviews include the analysis of the management of interest rate risk for each major maturity bucket and adherence to the aggregate positions with risk limits. The Group follows processes to manage market risks and to analyze market risk hotspots. Actions to mitigate risks are taken, if necessary, to manage fluctuations affecting asset/ liability mismatch and risk-based capital.\n\nThe Group may use derivative financial instruments to mitigate market risks arising from changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices, from credit quality of assets, and from commitments to third parties. The Group enters into derivative financial instruments mostly for economic hedging purposes and, in limited circumstances, the instruments may also meet the definition of an effective hedge for accounting purposes.\n\nIn compliance with Swiss insurance regulation, the Group's policy prohibits speculative trading in derivatives, meaning a pattern of so-called 'in-and-out trading' activity without any reference to an underlying position. The Group addresses the risks arising from derivatives through a stringent policy that requires approval of a derivative program before transactions are initiated, and by subsequent regular monitoring by Group Risk Management of open positions and annual reviews of derivative programs.\n\nFor more information on the Group's investment result, including impairments and the treatment of selected financial instruments, see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.

These could affect the Group's liquidity, reported income, economic surplus and regulatory capital position. Equity risk exposure includes common stocks (including equity unit trusts), private equity, common stock portfolios backing participating-with-profit policyholder contracts, and equities held for employee benefit plans. Exposure to real estate risk includes direct holdings in property and property company shares and funds. Returns on unit-linked contracts, whether classified as insurance or investment contracts, may be exposed to risks from equity and real estate, but these risks are borne by policyholders. The Group is however indirectly exposed to market movements from unit-linked contracts with respect to both earnings and economic capital; market movements affect the amount of fee income earned when the fee income level is dependent on the valuation of the asset base. Therefore, the value of in-force business for unit-linked business can be negatively affected by adverse movements in equity and real estate markets.\n\nThe Group manages its risks related to equity securities and real estate as part of the overall investment risk management process and applies limits as expressed in policies and guidelines. Specifically, Zurich limits holdings in equities, real estate and alternative investments. To realize an optimal level of risk diversification, the strategy for equities is defined through a composite of market benchmark indices. The Group has the capability and processes in place to change the exposure to key equity markets via the use of derivatives or purchase or sale of securities within a short time frame.\n\nFor additional information on equity securities and investment property, see note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Risk from interest rates and credit spreads\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of an adverse economic impact resulting from changes in interest rates, including changes in the shape of yield curves. Yield curve changes affect the value of interest rate-sensitive investments and derivatives as well as the fair value of insurance liabilities. Other balance sheet items, such as liability investment contracts, debt issued by the Group, commercial and residential mortgages, employee benefit plans, loans and receivables, are also affected.\n\nThe Group manages credit spread risk, which is the variation in economic value due to changes in the level or the volatility of credit spreads over the risk-free interest rate. Movements of credit spreads are driven by several factors including changes in expected default probability, default losses, risk premium, liquidity and other effects.\n\nReturns on unit-linked contracts, whether classified as insurance or investment contracts, are at the risk of the policyholder; however, the Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and credit spreads insofar as they affect the amount of fee income earned if the fee income level is dependent on the valuation of the asset base.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

For a 50 bps decrease in interest rates, the sensitivity was USD 6.7 billion in 2021 (USD 7.9 billion as of 2020). For a 10 percent decline in equity markets, Group investments drop in value by USD 1.3 billion in 2021 compared with USD 1.3 billion as of 2020. A 100 bps increase in credit spreads resulted in a decrease of USD 6.2 billion in 2021 compared with USD 6.8 billion as of 2020.\n\nThe following describes limitations of the Group investment sensitivities. Group sensitivities show the effects of a change of certain risk factors, while other assumptions remain unchanged. The interest rate scenarios assume a parallel shift of all interest rates in the respective currencies. They do not take account of the possibility that interest rate changes might differ by rating class; these are disclosed separately as credit spread risk sensitivities.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is based on economic assets, and not on shareholders' equity or net income as set out in the consolidated financial statements. The sensitivities only cover Group investments and do not cover insurance or other liabilities. The equity market scenarios assume a concurrent movement of all stock markets. The sensitivity analysis does not take account of actions that might be taken to mitigate losses. Actions may involve changing the asset allocation, for example through selling and buying assets. Sensitivity calculations do not assign a probability to the scenario considered. The sensitivities do not indicate a probability of such events occurring in the future. They do not necessarily represent the Group's view of expected future market changes.\n\nIn addition to the gross sensitivities, management uses sensitivities and stress scenarios to assess the impact of market movements on the Group's net assets. For more information on sensitivities see 'Group economic net asset sensitivities' (unaudited), below.\n\n## Group economic net asset sensitivities\n\nThe following section presents the sensitivities of Group economic net assets under Swiss Solvency Test (SST) assumptions with respect to certain standard financial market scenarios.\n\nThe net asset impact - the difference between the impact on Group investments and liabilities - represents the economic risk related to changes in market risk factors to which the Group is exposed. Tables 5, 6 and 7 show the estimated economic market risk sensitivities of the net asset impact. Positive values represent an increase in the net assets, and values in parentheses represent a decrease. Mismatches in changes in value of assets relative to liabilities represent an economic risk to the Group.\n\nIn determining the sensitivities, investments and liabilities are fully re-valued under the given scenarios. Each instrument is re-valued separately, taking relevant product features into account. Non-linear valuation effects, where they exist, are reflected in the calculations. The sensitivities are shown before tax.\n\nThe basis of the presentation for tables 5, 6, and 7 is an economic valuation represented by the fair value of Group investments. IFRS insurance liabilities are discounted at risk-free market rates to reflect the present value of insurance liability cash flows and other liabilities, for example, own debt. The Group uses FINMA allowed risk-free curves for discounting. In the sensitivities, own debt does not include subordinated debt, which Zurich considers available to protect policyholders in a worst-case scenario.\n\nThe basis of presentation for the Life business to financial market movements uses replicating portfolios calibrated according to the methodology and cashflow models approved by FINMA. The replicating portfolios are portfolios of assets that replicate the cash flows or present values of the life insurance liabilities under stochastic scenarios from the local life valuation models. They are calibrated to match dependencies of life insurance liabilities on financial market developments in respect of interest rates, equity and property. The options and guarantees of the underlying life insurance liabilities are captured through the inclusion of options in the replicating portfolios.\n\nSensitivities are shown split by segment and for economic net assets net of minority interest.

Limits tighten progressively for lower-rated exposures. Where the Group identifies investments that are expected to trigger limit breaches, appropriate mitigating actions are implemented.\n\nThe risk-weighted average credit rating of the Group's debt securities portfolio is 'A-' in 2021, unchanged from 2020.\n\n## Debt securities - credit risk concentration by industry in %, as of December 31\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the largest concentration in the Group's debt securities portfolio was government related at 48 percent of all debt securities. In all other categories, a total of USD 28.6 billion (38 percent) was secured. As of December 31, 2020, 51 percent of the Group's debt portfolio was invested in government-related securities. In all other categories, a total of USD 29.5 billion (38 percent) was secured.\n\nThe second-largest concentration in the Group's debt securities portfolio is financial institutions, comprising investments mainly in banking, finance companies and insurance.\n\nIn addition to debt exposure, the Group had loan exposures of USD 3.5 billion to the German central government or German federal states as of December 31, 2021. The equivalent figure for December 31, 2020 was USD 4.2 billion. For more information, see the 'mortgage loans and other loans' section on page 207.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group also maintains an authorized list of acceptable cash counterparties.\n\nCash and cash equivalents amounted to USD 8.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and USD 11.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. The risk-weighted average rating of the overall cash portfolio was 'A-' as of December 31, 2021 and 'A' as of December 31, 2020. The ten largest bank exposures represent 68 percent of the total, the riskweighted average rating of which was 'AA-' as of December 31, 2021 and 'AA-' as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Mortgage loans and other loans\n\nMortgage loans amounted to USD 6.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and USD 5.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. The Group's largest mortgage loan portfolios are held in Switzerland (USD 3.0 billion) and in Germany (USD 1.5 billion); these are predominantly secured against residential property but also include mortgages secured by commercial property. The Group invests in mortgages in the U.S. (USD 0.5 billion); these are mainly participations in large mortgage loans secured against commercial property.\n\nThe credit risk arising from other loans is assessed and monitored together with the debt securities portfolio. Out of the USD 7.1 billion reported loans as of December 31, 2021, 56 percent are government related, of which 89 percent are to the German central government or German federal states. As of December 31, 2021, USD 3.7 billion were rated as 'AAA' (52 percent) compared with 4.1 billion as of December 31, 2020; USD 1.0 billion as 'AA' (14 percent) compared with 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2020; USD 1.2 billion as 'A' (18 percent) compared with 1.4 billion as of December 31, 2020; USD 1.2 billion as 'BBB' and below (16 percent) compared with 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020; and USD 0.0 billion as unrated (0 percent) compared with 0.3 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe replacement value of outstanding derivatives represents a credit risk to the Group. These instruments include interest rate and cross-currency swaps, forward contracts and purchased options. A potential exposure could also arise from possible changes in replacement values. The Group regularly monitors credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions. Outstanding positions with external counterparties are managed through an approval process embedded in derivative programs.\n\nTo limit credit risk, derivative financial instruments are executed with counterparties rated 'BBB' or higher as per Zurich Risk Policy requirements. The Group's standard practice is to only transact derivatives with those counterparties for which the Group has in place an ISDA Master Agreement, with a Credit Support Annex. This mitigates credit exposures from over-the-counter transactions due to close-out netting and requires the counterparty to post collateral when the derivative position exceeds an agreed threshold. The Group further mitigates credit exposures from derivative transactions by using exchange-traded or centrally cleared instruments whenever possible. The Group remained under the applicable thresholds for phase 5 of the initial margin rules for over-the-counter derivatives and therefore was not subject to a duty to exchange initial margin in 2021.\n\n## Risk from currency exchange rates\n\nCurrency risk is the risk of loss resulting from changes in exchange rates. The Group operates internationally and therefore is exposed to the financial impact of changes in the exchange rates of various currencies. The Group's presentation currency is the U.S. dollar, but its assets, liabilities, income and expenses are denominated in many currencies, with significant amounts in euro, Swiss franc, British pound and U.S. dollar. On entity balance sheets a currency mismatch may cause a balance sheet's net asset value to fluctuate, either through income or directly through equity. The Group manages this risk by matching foreign currency positions on entity balance sheets within prescribed limits. Residual entity mismatches are reported centrally to make use of the netting effect across the Group. Zurich hedges these residual entity mismatches within an established limit through a central balance sheet. For information on net gains/losses on foreign currency transactions included in the consolidated income statements, see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements. The monetary currency risk exposure on entity balance sheets is considered immaterial.\n\nDifferences arise when functional currencies are translated into the Group's presentation currency, the U.S. dollar. The Group applies net investment hedge accounting to protect against the impact that changes in certain exchange rates might have on selected net investments.\n\nTable 9 shows the sensitivity of total IFRS equity to changes in exchange rates for the main functional currencies to which the Group is exposed. Positive values represent an increase in the value of the Group's total equity. See notes 1, 3 and 7 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on foreign currency translation and transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The sensitivities do not indicate a probability of such events occurring in the future. They do not necessarily represent Zurich's view of expected future market changes. While table 9 shows the effect of a 10 percent increase in currency\n\nexchange rates, a decrease of 10 percent would have the converse effect.\n\n## Other credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk associated with a loss or potential loss from counterparties failing to fulfill their financial obligations. See section 'risks from defaults of counterparties' for market risk-related asset categories. The Group's exposure to other credit risk is derived from the following main categories of assets:\n\n- - Reinsurance assets.\n- - Receivables.\n\nThe Group's objective in managing credit risk exposures is to maintain them within parameters that reflect the Group's strategic objectives, and its risk appetite and tolerance. Sources of credit risk are assessed and monitored, and the Group has policies to manage specific risks within various subcategories of credit risk. To assess counterparty credit risk, the Group uses ratings assigned by external rating agencies, qualified third parties, such as asset managers, and internal rating assessments. If the ratings of external rating agencies differ, the Group generally applies the lowest, unless other indicators justify an alternative, which may be an internal credit rating.\n\nThe Group actively uses collateral to mitigate credit risks. Underlying credit risks are managed independently from the collateral. The Group has limits and quality criteria to identify acceptable letter of credit providers. Letters of credit enable Zurich to limit the risks embedded in reinsurance, captives, deductible programs, trade credit and surety.\n\nThe Group has counterparty limits which are regularly monitored. Exposure to counterparties' parent companies and subsidiaries is aggregated to include reinsurance assets, investments, derivatives, and certain insurance products. Group aggregate concentration limits and relevant exception approvals are monitored in line with risk policy requirements.\n\nOn-balance sheet exposures are the main source of credit risk. Off-balance sheet credit exposures are related primarily to certain insurance products, reinsurance and collateral used to protect underlying credit exposures on the balance sheet. The Group has no material amount of off-balance sheet exposures related to undrawn loan commitments as of December 31, 2021. See note 22 of the consolidated financial statements for undrawn loan commitments.",

The Group typically only cedes new business to authorized reinsurers with a minimum rating of 'A-.' Of the exposure ceded to reinsurers that are rated below 'A-' or are not rated, 54 percent was collateralized as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of the exposure ceded to reinsurers that are rated below 'A-' or are not rated, 66 percent was ceded to captive insurance companies in 2021, and 62 percent in 2020.\n\nReinsurance assets included reinsurance recoverables (the reinsurers' share of reserves for insurance contracts) of USD 25.7 billion and USD 25.6 billion, and receivables arising from ceded reinsurance of USD 1.6 billion and USD 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, gross of allowance for impairment. Reserves for potentially uncollectible reinsurance assets amounted to USD 119 million as of December 31, 2021 and USD 149 million as of December 31, 2020. The Group's policy on impairment charges takes into account both specific charges for known situations (e.g., financial distress or litigation) and a general, prudent provision for unanticipated impairments.\n\nReinsurance assets in table 10 are shown before taking into account collateral such as cash or bank letters of credit and deposits received under ceded reinsurance contracts. Unsecured reinsurance assets shown are after deducting collateral. Bank issuing letters of credit for the benefit of Zurich are, on average, 'A' rated. The value of the collateral received amounts to USD 10.6 billion and USD 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nTable 10 shows reinsurance assets and unsecured reinsurance assets split by rating.\n\nTable 10\n\n| as of December 31   | 2021 2020             | 2021 2020             | 2021 2020             | 2021 2020             | 2021 2020             | 2021 2020             | 2021 2020             | 2021 2020             |\n|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                     | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance | Unsecured reinsurance |\n|                     | Reinsurance assets    | Reinsurance assets    |                       | assets                | Reinsurance assets    | Reinsurance assets    |                       | assets                |\n|                     | USD                   | % of                  | USD                   | % of                  | USD                   | % of                  | USD                   | % of                  |\n|                     | millions              | total                 | millions              | total                 | millions              | total                 | millions              | total                 |\n| Rating              |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |                       |\n| AAA                 | 26                    | 0.1%                  | 26                    | 0.2%                  | 37                    | 0.1%                  | 37                    | 0.2%                  |\n| AA                  | 8,267                 | 30.3%                 | 7,525                 | 45.2%                 | 8,382                 | 31.1%                 | 7,445                 | 45.9%                 |\n| A                   | 11,461                | 42.1%                 | 5,630                 | 33.8%                 | 11,851                | 43.9%                 | 5,644                 | 34.8%                 |\n| BBB                 | 3,604                 | 13.2%                 | 1,642                 | 9.9%                  | 3,094                 | 11.5%                 | 1,385                 | 8.5%                  |\n| BB                  | 652                   | 2.4%                  | 324                   | 1.9%                  | 411                   | 1.5%                  | 192                   | 1.2%                  |\n| B and below         | 206                   | 0.8%                  | 77                    | 0.5%                  | 204                   | 0.8%                  | 45                    | 0.3%                  |\n| Unrated             | 3,020                 | 11.1%                 | 1,416                 | 8.5%                  | 3,004                 | 11.1%                 | 1,485                 | 9.1%                  |\n| Total               | 27,236                | 100.0%                | 16,640                | 100.0%                | 26,983                | 100.0%                | 16,233                | 100.0%                |\n\n## Credit risk related to receivables\n\nThe largest amount of the Group's credit risk exposure to receivables is related to third-party agents, brokers and other intermediaries. It arises where premiums are collected from customers to be paid to the Group, or to pay claims to customers on behalf of the Group. The Group has policies and standards to manage and monitor credit risk related to intermediaries. The Group requires intermediaries to maintain segregated cash accounts for policyholder money. The Group also requires that intermediaries satisfy minimum requirements of capitalization, reputation and experience, and provide short-dated business credit terms.\n\nReceivables that are past due, but not impaired, are regarded as unsecured; however, some of these receivable positions may be offset by collateral. The Group reports internally on Group past-due receivable balances and strives to keep the balance of past-due positions as low as possible, while taking into account customer satisfaction.\n\nReceivables from ceded reinsurance are part of reinsurance assets and managed accordingly. See notes 15 and 24 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information on receivables.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich has a framework to identify, assess, manage, monitor, and report operational risk within the Group. Within this framework, the Group:\n\n- - Uses a scenario-based approach to assess, model and quantify the capital required for operational risk for business units under extreme circumstances. This approach allows information to be compared across the Group and highlights the main scenarios contributing to the capital required under Zurich Economic Capital Model (Z-ECM).\n- - Documents and reviews operational events exceeding a threshold determined by the Zurich Risk Policy. Remedial action is taken to avoid the recurrence of such operational events.\n- - Conducts risk assessments where operational risks are identified for key business areas. Risks identified and assessed to be above a certain threshold must have a risk response. Risk mitigation plans are documented and tracked on an ongoing basis. In the assessments, the Group uses sources of information such as the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 process, internal control assessments, and audit findings, as well as scenario modeling and operational event data.\n\nThe Group has specific processes and systems in place to focus on high-priority operational matters such as managing information security and business resilience (see sub-section 'risk focus specific to digital transformation'), as well as combating fraud.\n\nPreventing, detecting and responding to fraud are embedded in Zurich's business processes. Both claims and non-claims fraud are included in the common framework for assessing and managing operational risks. For Zurich's internal model calculations, claims fraud is part of insurance risk and non-claims fraud is part of operational risk.\n\n## Risk focus specific to digital transformation\n\nDigital and technological advances have not only created a wide spectrum of benefits for society but also amplified the associated risks. Organizations are realigning their operations, forging new third-party relationships and putting data at the heart of their decision-making and analysis. All of this is happening at a rapid pace and against a backdrop of an increasingly hostile cyber threat landscape. In order to succeed, organizations need to be able to assess and understand the risks inherent in this changing environment and ensure that they are managed appropriately.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group assesses and monitors exposure to defined information security and cyber risk scenarios through key risk indicators (KRIs) to effectively focus on actions and adequate resource allocation.\n\n## Data risk\n\nThe strategic relevance of data as a business asset is rising at a rapid pace and the risks associated with data management are becoming more and more prominent. Preventing risks such as data losses and privacy breaches and assessing and monitoring the potential misuse of data and losses triggered by failures in data management remain in focus. Specifically, appropriate governance of data for business purposes and decision-making processes, including automation, machine-learning techniques and other advanced technologies, remains a priority. As Zurich strives to inspire confidence in a digital society with its data commitment, assurance on the ethical use of advanced technologies is provided from a risk management perspective for the protection and privacy of data of our customers and other stakeholders.\n\nThe relevance of technological risks, such as cyber risk, is rapidly increasing across all data-driven industries. Exposure to these risks has grown in lockstep with the significant rise in digital services provided directly to customers and the increasing prevalence of digital ecosystems and cloud solutions in today's interconnected world.\n\n## Third-party risk\n\nOutsourcing and engagement with third parties introduces risks relevant to the delivery of our strategy, such as data loss or disclosure, disruption to critical customer services and regulatory compliance. Digitalization has accelerated the complexity and changes to the Group's third-party ecosystem. The Group addresses risks associated with third-party engagements along its supply and value chain. Applying a consistent Group-wide approach to outsourcing governance is among Zurich's key priorities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In addition, increasing automation of processes, development of advanced analytics capabilities, and fragmented supply chains have contributed to an increasingly complex operating environment. In response to these challenges, and to better protect the interests of stakeholders, the Group continues to evolve its business resilience capability through a number of ongoing initiatives in relation to the protection and recovery of critical services and enhancing transparency around any associated risks. Zurich's response to COVID-19 to date has proven to be effective with critical business services maintained throughout the Group.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls\n\nThe Group considers internal controls to be essential for managing operational risk. The Board has overall responsibility for the Group's risk management and internal control frameworks. The objectives of the Group's internal control system are to provide reasonable assurance that Zurich's financial statements and disclosures are materially correct, support reliable operations, and ensure legal and regulatory compliance. The internal control system is designed to mitigate rather than eliminate risks that could impact the achievement of business objectives.\n\nThe Group promotes risk awareness and understanding of controls through communication and training. Risk management and internal control systems are designed at Group level and implemented across the Group. Management, as the first line of defense, is responsible for identifying, evaluating and managing risk, and designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls. Testing effectiveness of relevant internal controls by the first line of defense also forms part of the control life cycle.\n\nKey processes and controls in the organization are subject to review and challenge by all three lines of defense. The second and third lines of defense regularly report on observations, conclusions and recommendations that arise from their independent reviews of internal controls. Control issues of Group-level significance and associated mitigation actions are reported regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board. The Risk and Investment Committee of the Board reviews the effectiveness of the Group's risk management system, including the Group's risk tolerance and enterprise-wide risk governance framework, in accordance with the charter for each committee.\n\nThe Group's Disclosure Committee, chaired by the Head of Group Financial Accounting and Reporting, reviews the accuracy, completeness and timeliness and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements of external disclosures and the effectiveness of the respective internal controls. The conclusions result in a recommendation to the Group Chief Financial Officer to release the disclosures to the Audit Committee of the Board, who may then challenge the disclosures further. The Board reviews and approves the announcement of the results and the annual report before they are made public.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Zurich's policy is to maintain adequate liquidity and contingent liquidity to meet its liquidity needs under normal conditions and in times of stress. To achieve this, the Group assesses, monitors and manages its liquidity needs on an ongoing basis.\n\nGroup-wide liquidity management policies and specific guidelines govern how entities plan, manage and report their entity liquidity and include regular stress tests for all major legal entities and branches within the Group. The stress tests use a standardized set of internally defined stress events, and are designed to provide an overview of the potential drain on liquidity should the Group have to recapitalize entity balance sheets. Similar guidelines apply at the Group level, and detailed liquidity forecasts are regularly conducted, based on entities' input and the Group's forecasts. As part of its liquidity management, the Group maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents and high-quality, liquid investment portfolios to meet outflows under expected and stressed conditions.\n\nThe Group also maintains internal liquidity sources that cover the potential liquidity needs within the Group, including those that might arise in times of stress. The Group takes into account the amount, availability and speed at which these sources can be accessed. The Group has access to diverse funding sources to cover contingencies, including asset sales, external debt issuance and making use of committed borrowing facilities or letters of credit. The Group maintains a range of maturities for external debt securities. A potential source of liquidity risk is the effect of a downgrade of the credit rating of the Group. This could affect the Group's commitments and guarantees, potentially increasing liquidity needs. This risk - and mitigating actions that might be employed - are assessed on an ongoing basis within the Group's liquidity framework.\n\nThe Group regularly analyzes the liquidity of the investment assets and ensures that the liquidity of assets stays in line with liquidity requirements. In 2021, the Group's holdings in illiquid assets were within its capacity.\n\nFor more information on debt obligation maturities, see note 18 of the consolidated financial statements, and for information on commitments and guarantees, see note 22 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group's ongoing liquidity monitoring includes regular reporting to the executive management and quarterly reporting to the Risk and Investment Committee of the Board, covering aspects such as the Group's actual and forecast liquidity, possible adverse scenarios that could affect the Group's liquidity and possible liquidity needs from the Group's main subsidiaries, including under conditions of stress.\n\nFor more information on the Group's other financial liabilities, see note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. See note 6 of the consolidated financial statements for information on the maturity of debt securities.\n\nThe Group has committed to contribute capital to subsidiaries and third parties that engage in making investments in direct private equity and private equity funds. Commitments may be called by the counterparty during the term of the investment (generally three to five years) and must be funded by the Group on a timely basis.

As part of the annual assessment of strategic risks, the Executive Committee assesses potential risks from both external and internal factors, looking at the current year and beyond. The Executive Committee members define actions to respond as appropriate and review changes to the key risks and their status of actions at least quarterly.\n\nThe Group evaluates the risks of merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions both from a quantitative and a qualitative perspective. The Group conducts risk assessments of M&A transactions to evaluate risks specifically related to integrating acquired businesses.\n\n## Risks to the Group's reputation\n\nRisks include acts or omissions by the Group or any of its employees that could damage the Group's reputation or lead to a loss of trust among its stakeholders. Every risk type has potential consequences for Zurich's reputation. Effectively managing each risk type supports preventing adverse reputational outcomes.\n\nThe Group aims to preserve its reputation by:\n\n- - Adhering to applicable laws and regulations.\n- - Following the core values and principles of the Group's code of conduct that promote integrity and good business practice.\n- - Living up to its sustainability commitments.\n\nThe Group centrally manages certain aspects of risk to reputation, for example, communications, through functions with the appropriate expertise. Potential risks to Zurich's reputation are included in its risk assessment processes and tools, including the Total Risk Profiling\u2122 process.\n\n## Sustainability risk\n\nZurich's ambition is to be one of the most responsible and impactful businesses in the world. Trends like globalization, the mobility of talent and funds, shifting geopolitics, reskilling for a digital workplace, demographics, and climate change all pose immensely complex social issues.\n\nSustainability means doing business today in a way that safeguards the future of our company and our society. Sustainability risks and opportunities emanate both from effects that environmental, social and governance (ESG) challenges have on the company, as well as from how the company handles its positive or negative impact on ESG issues. To protect against financial and reputational impacts, both perspectives are included in the identification and assessment of sustainability issues.\n\nClimate change, as one of the most complex risks facing society today, is intergenerational, international and interdependent. As a global insurer, Zurich faces risks from climate change and discloses its climate risk in line with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\nSustainability topics associated with ESG challenges are also becoming more complex and interconnected as a result of these trends. Insurers are increasingly becoming agents of change and playing a more impactful role in addressing sustainability risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Group has policies in place that define the sustainability positions for which Zurich has no underwriting or investment appetite. Zurich continuously works to develop relevant products and services that help solve the most pressing societal and environmental issues of today.\n\n## Sustainability risk approach\n\nTo support the Group's businesses in applying its purpose and values, as well as mitigating reputational risk impacts, Zurich has established a systematic and integrated approach to identifying, assessing and recommending action on potential risk and opportunity areas from a sustainability perspective across all the Group's activities, in particular in investment management and underwriting.\n\n## This is a three-step process:\n\n- - Issue identification: Identify relevant issues to be considered within the risk assessment process by monitoring channels such as media, social media, information from non-governmental organizations and Zurich's businesses.\n- - Risk assessment: Assess issues related to public commitments, the role of insurance underwriting, market exposure and materiality. The Group Chief Executive Officer approves position statements, recommended business actions, and reputational management considerations.\n- - Implementation: Implement mitigation actions, including managing reputational impacts locally in the businesses. Mobilize expert support available across the Group and escalate as necessary, according to governance procedures.\n\nZurich applies these steps across portfolios based on stated thresholds and verified data. Wherever possible, Zurich engages and works together with customers on the margins of Zurich's thresholds to ensure responsible and sustainable business practices. This engagement may be short, or in some cases, last up to two years, depending on which part of the renewal cycle customers are in and the time required for them to demonstrate credible progress on ESG issues.\n\nClear roles and responsibilities, starting with the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and Zurich management, aim to ensure effective oversight and action with respect to climate change and other sustainability risks.",

Growth was driven by an underlying improvement across all businesses and reduced claims from COVID-19. Net income attributable to shareholders amounted to USD 5.2 billion and a dividend of CHF 22 has been proposed.\n\n## Executing on strategic priorities\n\nThe delivery of the strongest BOP performance since 2007 demonstrates the strength of the Group's franchise and the benefits of repositioning the business in recent years. During the year, the Group continued to advance its customer-focused strategy, reflected in increased customer satisfaction and strong net customer growth. The Group further extended its customer reach through incremental distribution partnerships.

Commercial insurance benefited from higher premium rates and net new business, while growth in retail was primarily driven by net new business.\n\nThe combined ratio of 94.3 percent was 4.1 percentage points lower than in the prior year, driven by lower COVID-19 and catastrophe losses, increased reserve releases, as well as underlying improvement as higher premium rates fed into the results.\n\nThe Group's Life business BOP increased 27 percent compared with the prior year. Excluding COVID-19 effects, Life BOP grew 26 percent driven by the Group's continued focus on protection and capitallight saving products.\n\n## Property & Casualty (P&C)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrior-year development\n\n## Like-for-like GWP growth\n\n1\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis, together with portfolio management actions and favorable claims experience, led to margin improvements in Asia Pacific and Europe, which were complemented by profitable growth in Latin America and Europe and higher investment returns. The quality of new business growth remained high with more than 90 percent of annual premium equivalent (APE) sales from protection and capital-light savings products.\n\nGross written premiums of the Farmers Exchanges 2 increased 20 percent. Excluding the contribution of the MetLife U.S. P&C transaction, which closed at the beginning of April 2021, gross written premiums rose 7 percent. Key customer metrics continued to improve as a result of the Farmers Exchanges' customer focused strategy.\n\nFarmers BOP was 8 percent higher compared to the prior year. A 12 percent increase in BOP at Farmers Management Services (FMS) was partially offset by higher mortality claims related to COVID-19 in Farmers Life.\n\nGroup Functions and Operations' net expenses increased by 14 percent, largely due to financing and foregone investment income related to the acquisition of the U.S. P&C business of Metlife as well as unfavorable currency movements.\n\nLife\n\n## Farmers Exchanges 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2021 APE product mix\n\n%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 In local currency and adjusted for closed acquisitions and disposals.\n- 2  The Farmers Exchanges are owned by their policyholders. Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges as attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services.\n\n## Very strong capital position and cash generation\n\nDuring the year, management continued to optimize the use of capital. The Group's balance sheet and Swiss Solvency Test (SST) remained very strong at an estimated 212 percent 2 , well above the Group's target level of 160 percent or above.\n\nThe Group continued to successfully convert earnings into distributable cash flow, with overall Group remittances of USD 4.4 billion, equivalent to more than 80 percent of net income attributable to shareholders. During the year, the level of remittances was driven both by operational earnings and remittances of excess capital that had built up over time from previously retained earnings.\n\n## Dividend proposal of CHF 22\n\nIn line with the stated dividend policy, the board proposes a dividend of CHF 22 per share, representing a 10 percent increase.\n\nGeorge Quinn Group Chief Financial Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Farmers\n\n## Farmers BOP\n\nin USD millions\n\n<!-- image -->",

Excluding COVID-19 effects, Life business operating profit grew 26 percent, driven by the Group's continued focus on protection and capital-light saving products. This, together with portfolio management actions and favorable claims experience, led to margin improvements in Asia Pacific and Europe, which were complemented by profitable growth in Latin America and Europe and better investment returns. Other drivers were positive one-off benefits of around USD 150 million largely related to EMEA and resulting from favorable reserve releases, assumption updates and other one-offs.\n\nIn EMEA, business operating profit improved by 27 percent to USD 1.2 billion on a reported basis. Adjusted for COVID-19, business operating profit increased by 16 percent compared with the prior year to USD 1.3 million. Switzerland's business operating profit improved as a result of growth in higher-margin individual life business together with a positive claims experience largely related to the favorable reserve releases. Italy and Ireland delivered strong and profitable growth in unit-linked products and benefited from favorable markets conditions. Germany's business operating profit increased due to favorable economic assumption updates and other one-offs, while the UK benefited from loss reserve reviews and profitable growth in protection.\n\nIn Latin America, business operating profit increased 1 percent on a reported basis. Excluding COVID-19 claims, business operating profit grew by 43 percent. This growth was driven by profitable sales through Zurich Santander together with a positive run-off development of a large corporate protection scheme in Chile, which benefited from favorable market conditions.\n\nAsia Pacific contributed a business operating profit of USD 347 million, USD 79 million higher compared with the prior year. The performance improved significantly due to re-pricing and portfolio improvement actions in Australia as well as higher investments returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The growth in sales reflects favorable growth momentum in unit-linked business and protection products, partially offset by a strong reduction in savings and annuity business. On a reported basis, APE was 5 percent higher.\n\nIn EMEA, APE sales increased by 5 percent on a like-for-like basis, compared with the same period in 2020. This was mainly driven by strong growth of unit-linked business in Ireland, Italy and Switzerland and favorable APE sales of protection products in Spain, Switzerland and the UK. These factors were partially offset by lower sales of traditional life products in Germany and Italy, as well as by the reduction in corporate savings business in Switzerland, due to the COVID-19-related economic slowdown at the beginning of the year and competitive market conditions.\n\nAPE sales in Latin America increased 7 percent on a like-for-like basis, reflecting higher sales volumes of individual protection products at Zurich Santander and strong growth of unit-linked business in Chile and Brazil. These were partially offset by the non-renewal of a large corporate life and protection account in Chile.\n\nIn North America, APE sales increased 35 percent on a like-for-like basis, excluding the life business which was sold in the prior year. This was primarily driven by growth in unit-linked business.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, lower sales in Japan, Australia and Indonesia led to a decline of 10 percent on a like-for-like basis. The decline in Australia was in part due to repricing actions to improve margins.\n\nThe new business margin increased to an attractive level of 29.1 percent as reported and on a like-for-like basis. New business value (NBV) rose 21 percent on a like-for-like basis, driven by higher volumes and a more favorable sales mix in EMEA and Latin America. On a reported basis, NBV improved by 22 percent. The Group continues to focus on protection, unit-linked and corporate savings business, with these products accounting for more than 90 percent of APE sales. Protection business contributed around 75 percent of the total NBV.\n\n## NBV, APE and NBM by Segment",

While the overall asset allocation remained stable, rising rates affected the valuation of debt securities. Investment property decreased by USD 679 million, driven by disposals and foreign exchange impacts due to a stronger U.S. dollar.\n\nThe completion of the acquisition of the Metlife's P&C business by Zurich subsidiary Farmers Group, Inc. and the Farmers Exchanges 1 increased the goodwill by USD 418 million and also increased the value of the attorney-in-fact intangible asset to USD 2.65 billion.\n\nThe Group also reclassified about USD 9 billion of assets and liabilities as held for sale reflecting the Group's capital optimization actions.

The acquisition successfully closed on April 7, 2021. The acquisition gives the Farmers Exchanges 1 a truly nationwide presence and access to new distribution channels. This includes a 10-year exclusive distribution agreement through which the Farmers Exchanges 1 will offer their personal lines products on MetLife's industry-leading U.S. Group Benefits platform, which today reaches 3,800 companies and 37 million employees.\n\nOn May 18, 2021, the Group acquired a 19.99 percent share in Project Policy BidCo Limited, the owner of MyPolicy Limited, a UK usage-based insurance technology provider and managing general agent, and Minerva. As part of the acquisition Zurich contributed Bright Box Hong Kong Limited and its subsidiaries as well as 10 million in cash.\n\nOn August 4, 2021, Zurich Italy reached an agreement to acquire the network of Financial Advisors of the Deutsche Bank Group in Italy. The terms of the agreement provide for the transfer of a business unit consisting of approximately 1,085 financial advisors, 97 employees and 16.5 billion euros of assets under management. The acquisition allows Zurich Italy to further develop its financial and insurance distribution network in the Italian market. The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2022, subject to regulatory approval.\n\n## Being a responsible taxpayer\n\nAs part of Zurich's tax strategy, the Group strives to manage tax costs- and control-associated risks for the benefit of its customers, employees, shareholders and for society as a whole. The Group employs rigorous tax accounting and reporting oversight. The location of Group subsidiaries and affiliated companies is driven by business reasons and not the avoidance of tax. The Group's consolidated result includes only a very limited number of companies located in low or nil tax rate jurisdictions and in all cases these carry out operative insurance, reinsurance and asset management activities.\n\nTotal tax contribution reflects Zurich's economic contribution to the economy in taxes - the direct and indirect taxes paid by Zurich ('tax borne by the shareholders') and those taxes that Zurich is legally obliged to collect on behalf of the tax administrations ('tax collected'):\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee more details on our tax strategy in our Sustainability pages at www.zurich.com/en/sustainability.\n\nThe shareholders' effective tax rate decreased to 23.0 percent for the period ended December 31, 2021 compared with 23.9 percent for the same period of 2020.

We launched a Carbon-Neutral World Equity Fund, an insurance industry first that combines a low-carbon investment strategy with carbon offsetting.\n\n## Peter Giger\n\n## Strong global growth, but resurgent inflation\n\nGlobal economic conditions were broadly favorable over the course of the year, with growth significantly above trend despite continuing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. While a number of developed economies surpassed pre-pandemic levels of activity, growth was unbalanced, with emerging economies experiencing a slower and more disjointed recovery. A defining feature of the year was the return of inflation. Disrupted supply chains, combined with rampant demand for manufactured goods and rising energy prices, pushed inflation well above the targets of many central banks, leading to a step change in monetary policy. Strong growth and surging inflation brought forward interest rate hikes and pushed bond yields higher, albeit relatively modestly by historic standards. From an asset class perspective, government bond returns were negative for the year, and while credit markets saw some pickup in yields, it was equities in developed markets that, once again, gave a stellar performance.\n\nGroup Chief Risk Officer and Group Chief Investment Officer ad interim\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2021, impairments dropped significantly to below USD 60 million, led by the positive performance of the equity market and stable public and private credit markets. Zurich's fixed-income portfolio retained its high-quality profile with 96 percent invested in securities with credit rating BBB- and above. The credit and private debt portfolio further benefited from being well diversified across industries and issuers with private credit retaining a more defensive approach focused on senior credit. In real estate, the strategy to focus our investments on core properties in markets with growing demand continues to reward us: we recorded another year of excellent performance, with very limited COVID-19related impacts on rental income and portfolio valuations.\n\n## Our net investment income remains stable versus prior year\n\nThough bond yields remained near historically low levels, our net investment income rose by 3 percent to USD 5.0 billion compared with 2020, supported by continuing efforts in private credit and real estate, as well as by effects from foreign exchange and inflation. Compared with the prior year, net capital gains\n\n## Total investments\u00b9, 2021 %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Credit, private debt                  | 44.9%   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|\n| Government and  government guaranteed | 33.2%   |\n| Real estate                           | 7. 5 %  |\n| Cash                                  | 5.1%    |\n| Equities                              | 5.0%    |\n| Mortgages                             | 2.5%    |\n| Hedge funds, private equity           | 1.9%    |\n\n- 1 Market value of the investment portfolio (economic view).\n\n| AAA                  | 18.5%   |\n|----------------------|---------|\n| AA                   | 14.1%   |\n| A                    | 26.8%   |\n| BBB                  | 34.6%   |\n| Non-investment grade | 6.1%    |\n| Unrated              | 0.0%    |\n\n| Non-Financial Credit                | 32.0%   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------|\n| Financial Credit                    | 23.5%   |\n| Municipals, Agencies,  State Credit | 17.3%   |\n| Other                               | 13.0%   |\n| Asset Backed Securities             | 8.6%    |\n| Covered Bonds                       | 5.7%    |\n\nremained at the same level, largely supported by public equities and selected portfolio reallocations, as well as successful coinvestments in alternative assets.\n\nCompensated risk-taking in public equities, private equities, public credit, and real estate contributed positively to the total investment return of assets. However, the middling performance of public credit and the negative performance, driven by higher yields, of our government bonds resulted in negative total return of 0.84 percent on the assets.\n\nWhile the total asset return was negative, we saw a considerable outperformance of assets over liabilities during 2021. Market risk capital required in support of our investments reduced during the year, benefiting from an improved asset/liability management position.\n\n## Delivering on responsible investment goals and driving innovation\n\nDuring 2021 our responsible investment strategy saw considerable progress across multiple fronts: from advancing on our net-zero journey by setting interim targets and increasing our allocation to impact investments, to thought leadership and accelerating environmental, social, and governance (ESG) integration. We also developed a responsible investment strategy\n\n## Rating of Credit, Private Debt Securities, 2021\n\n%\n\nthat ensures our knowledge also flows into the unit-linked space. We have increased our impact investment by 22 percent, reaching USD 7.0 billion, leading to an estimated avoidance of 4.6 million tons of CO 2 -equivalent emissions and improving the lives of 3.6 million people. While driving this performance, we have started implementing our 2025 targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent in our credit and equity portfolio and by 30 percent in our real estate portfolio. We initiated bottom-up exercises to measure and implement these reductions judiciously across multiple internal and external asset managers. We have also launched a Carbon-Neutral World Equity Fund, an insurance industry first in the unitlinked space that combines a low-carbon investment strategy with carbon offsetting. Various unit-linked ESG offerings are now available to our Life customers in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and Portugal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Further details are available online:\n\nwww.zurich.com/en/sustainability/responsible-investment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Giger\n\nGroup Chief Risk Officer and Group Chief Investment Officer ad interim\n\n## Credit and Private Debt Securities per segment, 2021 %",

The Group operates in Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA), North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific through subsidiaries, as well as branch and representative offices.\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd, a Swiss corporation, is the holding company of the Group and its shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Zurich Insurance Group Ltd was incorporated on April 26, 2000, in Zurich, Switzerland. It is recorded in the Commercial Register of the Canton of Zurich under its registered address at Mythenquai 2, 8002 Zurich.\n\nOn February 9, 2022, the Board of Directors of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd authorized these consolidated financial statements for issue. These financial statements will be submitted for approval to the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on April 6, 2022.\n\n## 1.  Basis of presentation\n\n## General information\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and comply with Swiss law. Where IFRS does not contain clear guidance governing the accounting treatment of certain transactions, including those that are specific to insurance and reinsurance products, IFRS permits reference to another comprehensive body of accounting principles that uses a similar conceptual framework. The Group's accounting policies for insurance and reinsurance contracts are therefore based on those developed by the Group before the adoption of IFRS 4 in areas where IFRS 4 did not include specific requirements. Before the adoption of IFRS 4 on January 1, 2005, the Group typically applied U.S. GAAP pronouncements issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on insurance and reinsurance contracts. Any changes to such pronouncements subsequent to this adoption are not reflected in the Group's accounting policies. In case of business combinations, the Group may decide to maintain the local statutory treatment if this does not distort the fair presentation of the financial position of the Group. If significant, the impact of such cases would be described elsewhere in the notes to these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe accounting policies applied by the reportable segments are the same as those applied by the Group. The Group accounts for inter-segment revenues and transfers as if the transactions were with third parties at current market prices. Dividends, realized capital gains and losses as well as gains and losses on the transfer of net assets are eliminated within the segment, whereas all other intercompany gains and losses are eliminated at Group level. In the consolidated financial statements, intersegment revenues and transfers are eliminated.\n\nCertain amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and assumptions made by management about insurance liability reserves, investment valuations, interest rates and other factors.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve globally with new variants of the virus emerging, and so do the impacts on the insurance industry and the global economy. Though most of the impacts of the pandemic on the Group's businesses, especially in the P&C business, are already known and management's best estimate of claims is reflected in the loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses, some uncertainties remain. The Group is closely monitoring and actively dealing with the potential for further exposure from (i) claims litigation on policy coverage, (ii) regulator and market-led test cases or legislative developments in certain jurisdictions that could impact the scope of intended coverage, (iii) potential second-order impact on health which could have mortality or morbidity effects, and (iv) other extended macroeconomic impacts around the pandemic, including governmental actions. While expected to be very remote, any extreme outcomes on the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations or growth. For additional information on insurance liabilities, please see note 8.\n\nInvestment valuations and interest rates incorporate market conditions as of December 31, 2021 and recoverability of intangible assets has been tested where the value of these intangible assets, including goodwill, is sensitive to prevailing economic conditions. For more information on investments and fair value, please see note 6 and 23, respectively. For more information on intangible assets, please see note 14. Management has also implemented amendments to IFRS 16 Leases which allow lessees not to account for rent concessions as lease modifications if they are a direct consequence of COVID-19 and meet certain conditions. The impact of the amendments to IFRS 16 Leases is immaterial to the Group.\n\nDisclosures under IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' and IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures' relating to the nature and extent of risks, and capital disclosures under IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' have been included in the audited sections of the risk review on pages 187 to 214, and they form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.",

The following balances are generally considered to be current: cash and cash equivalents, deferred policy acquisition costs on property and casualty contracts, receivables, reserve for premium refunds and obligations to repurchase securities.\n\nThe following balances are generally considered to be non-current: equity securities, investment property, investments in associates and joint ventures, deferred policy acquisition costs on life insurance contracts, deferred tax assets, property and equipment, goodwill, other intangible assets and deferred tax liabilities.\n\nThe following balances are mixed in nature (including both current and non-current portions): debt securities, mortgage loans, other loans, reinsurers' share of liabilities for insurance contracts, deposits made under assumed reinsurance contracts, deferred origination costs, other assets, reserves and investments for unit-linked contracts, liabilities for investment contracts, deposits received under ceded reinsurance contracts, deferred front-end fees, reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, reserves for unearned premiums, future life policyholder benefits, policyholder contract deposits and other funds, other liabilities, senior and subordinated debt, and assets and liabilities held for sale.\n\nMaturity tables have been provided for the following balances: debt securities (table 6.4), derivative assets and derivative liabilities (tables 7.1 and 7.2), reserves for insurance contracts (tables 8.9a and 8.9b), liabilities for investment contracts (tables 9.3a and 9.3b), finance lease receivables (table 13.6), operating lease payments to be received (table 13.7), other financial liabilities (table 16.2), lease liabilities (table 16.3) and outstanding debt (table 18.2).\n\nAll amounts in the consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise stated, are shown in U.S. dollars, rounded to the nearest million with the consequence that the rounded amounts may not add to the rounded total in all cases. All ratios and variances are calculated using the underlying amounts rather than the rounded amounts.\n\nTable 1 summarizes the principal exchange rates used for translation purposes. Net gains/(losses) on foreign currency transactions included in the consolidated income statements were USD (158) million and USD (65) million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Foreign currency exchange forward and swap gains/(losses) included in these amounts were USD (56) million and USD 154 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nTable 1\n\n| USD per foreign currency unit   | Consolidated balance sheets   | Consolidated balance sheets   | Consolidated income   statements and cash flows   at average exchange rates   | Consolidated income   statements and cash flows   at average exchange rates   |\n|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                 | 12/31/21                      | 12/31/20                      | 12/31/21                                                                      | 12/31/20                                                                      |\n| Euro                            | 1.1373                        | 1.2231                        | 1.1831                                                                        | 1.1415                                                                        |\n| Swiss franc                     | 1.0969                        | 1.1304                        | 1.0941                                                                        | 1.0663                                                                        |\n| British pound                   | 1.3539                        | 1.3656                        | 1.3758                                                                        | 1.2836                                                                        |\n| Brazilian real                  | 0.1793                        | 0.1924                        | 0.1856                                                                        | 0.1958                                                                        |\n| Australian dollar               | 0.7272                        | 0.7716                        | 0.7515                                                                        | 0.6907                                                                        |\n| Japanese Yen                    | 0.0087                        | 0.0097                        | 0.0091                                                                        | 0.0094                                                                        |\n\n## Principal exchange rates",

For long-duration life insurance contracts, IFRS 17 is expected to have a significant impact on actuarial modeling as granular cash flow projections and regular updates of all assumptions will be required resulting in either profit or loss volatility or affecting 'contractual service margin (CSM)', a separate component of the insurance liability representing unearned profits from in-force contracts. IFRS 17 further introduces a risk adjustment for non-financial risk, a separate component of the liability covering uncertainty in the amount and timing of future cash flows. Thus, the insurance liabilities will be composed on the current best estimate present value of future cash flows (PVFCF), risk adjustment and CSM.\n\n## Standard/ Interpretation\n\n## Standard/ Interpretation",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\nIFRS 17 introduces different measurement approaches for the insurance contract liabilities reflecting a different extent of policyholder participation in investment or insurance entity performance: non-participating or indirect participating (general model) and direct participating (variable fee approach). For short-duration contracts, IFRS 17 foresees a simplified (or premium allocation) approach, which can be applied to contracts that have a coverage period of 12 months or less or for which such simplification would produce a measurement of the liability for remaining coverage that would not differ materially from the one obtained applying the general model. The simplification applies to the measurement of the liability for remaining coverage, which is not required to be disaggregated into PVFCF, risk adjustment and CSM but rather is largely based premium received, less earned premium and unamortized acquisition cash flows. The liability for incurred claims is measured consistently with the general model, whereby all the incurred claims are subject to discounting and risk adjustment.\n\nIFRS 17 will also affect the presentation of the insurance contracts revenue, which will no longer include gross written premium or investment components. Further, the insurance revenue and insurance service expenses will be presented gross of reinsurance, with the reinsurance result included in the insurance service expense. Under IFRS 17, the insurance liabilities are subject to discounting; the unwind of the discount on insurance liabilities will be part of the investment result, rather than insurance service result.\n\nIFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' introduces a classification and measurement concept for financial assets that is based on the contractual cash flow characteristics and the holding intent. Under IFRS 9, all equity securities and fund investments, and some debt instruments will be measured at fair value through profit or loss because the characteristics of the contractual cash flows from such instruments are not solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. Though IFRS 9 introduces an option to account for some equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI) with no recycling of gains or losses through profit or loss, the Group does not intend to make material use of this option. The debt instruments that are not measured at fair value through profit or loss will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in OCI, if held under the standard business model to collect contractual cash flows and for sale, or at amortized cost, if part of selected portfolios held to collect contractual cash flows. Furthermore, IFRS 9 introduces a requirement to recognize expected credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost or at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in OCI.\n\nThough overall profit or loss volatility is expected to increase under IFRS 9, the measurement approach for direct participating contracts in IFRS 17 allows such volatility to be largely absorbed in the measurement of insurance liabilities with an option to reflect in shareholders' equity (OCI) the effect of any asset-liability mismatch. Therefore, the Group decided to defer the full implementation of IFRS 9 until IFRS 17 becomes effective to better align the measurement approaches for the financial assets held and the insurance liabilities where appropriate. Based on the analysis performed as of December 31, 2015, the Group was eligible to apply the temporary exemption from the adoption of IFRS 9 for reporting entities that have not previously applied any version of IFRS 9 and whose activities are predominantly related to insurance, as the predominance ratio reflecting the share of liabilities connected with insurance to total liabilities exceeded 90 percent. No reassessment of eligibility was required during subsequent annual periods up to and including 2021 as there was no significant change in the activities performed by the Group. We refer to the Annual Report 2016 for further details on the eligibility assessment. The Group presents additional disclosures of indicative effects from adoption of IFRS 9 required by IFRS 4 'Applying IFRS 9 with IFRS 4' during the period of deferral (see note 24).\n\nOn December 9, 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) published a narrow-scope amendment to the transition requirements of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9. The proposed amendment permits better alignment of presentation of comparative information under IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 by applying a 'classification overlay'. The Group does not intend to restate the comparative period on initial application of IFRS 9 and therefore anticipates applying the classification overlay for selected asset portfolios backing direct participating insurance contracts which are accounted for at amortized cost under IAS 39 but are expected to be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in OCI under IFRS 9. The Group does not envisage to apply the expected credit loss requirements as part of the overlay approach.\n\nIn order to adopt IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 in the consolidated financial statements, a joint IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 Group Implementation Program (Program) sponsored by the Group Chief Financial Officer has been operating since 2017. A steering committee comprised of senior management from various functions (finance, risk, IT, operations and investment management) oversees the work performed by individual work streams. A dedicated methodology work stream covers group accounting policies, actuarial methodologies and disclosure requirements to be consistently implemented throughout the Group. This work stream further contributes to the industry-wide discussions on standard interpretation and its operational effects and has been closely monitoring the developments in the IASB Transition Resource Group for IFRS 17 and IASB re-deliberations to evaluate the effects and align the accounting policies and actuarial methodologies accordingly. The implementation work stream drives the development of the target core solution landscape at Group and local levels and analyses processes, data and systems implications. In 2021, the focus of the program has shifted towards education of key stakeholders and analysis of wider impacts on Group operations while finalizing the implementation efforts and completing another set of parallel run activities.",

The Group expects that the majority of its non-life insurance contracts issued, and reinsurance contracts held in force as of transition date will be eligible for application of the simplified approach and intends to apply the simplified approach for such contracts under IFRS 17. As the Group already applies best estimate reserving under its current accounting policies, the implementation of IFRS 17 is not expected to have a major impact on non-life nominal reserves. The Group further expects that a significant portion of its life insurance liabilities (including unit-linked insurance liabilities) will qualify as direct participating contracts under IFRS 17. For the majority of its in-force insurance and reinsurance contracts, the Group intends to apply the option in IFRS 17 to disaggregate the (re-)insurance finance income or expense between profit or loss and OCI. Under this option, the unwind of discount in profit or loss under the general model and the simplified approach is based on locked-in discount rates and the difference between the current rates and locked-in rates valuation due to changes in discount rates is presented in OCI. Consistently, the Group expects that the majority of debt instruments held will be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2021, it was not practicable to quantify what the potential impact would be on the Group's financial position or performance once these standards are adopted.\n\nOther standards, amendments and interpretations shown in table 2.2 are expected to have no, or an insignificant, impact on the Group's financial position or performance.\n\n## Interest rate benchmark reform (including Phase 2 amendments to IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16)\n\nThe ongoing market-wide reform targets replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative reference rates (ARRs). To ensure an orderly transition to ARRs, the Group launched a cross functional IBOR transition working group that has analyzed the exposure and defined mitigating actions, for example, by adhering to the ISDA fallback protocols for derivatives, amending terms and conditions of new debt issuances and entering into bilateral negotiations with counterparties.\n\nDuring 2021, further progress has been made with transitioning most of the Group's exposures indexed to GBP, CHF and JPY to new ARRs. The decision to transition was made considering market readiness and liquidity. With the completion of the EURIBOR reform, no transition is required for financial instruments referencing those rates. Therefore, the exposures which are still subject to transition mainly consist of USD LIBOR linked instruments (such as floating rate notes, sinking bonds, asset- and mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations) representing 2.8 percent of the debt securities held by the Group. Given transition for these instruments is not foreseen before June 2023, the Group is not exposed to immediate risks arising from the IBOR reform. The reform has not resulted in changes to the Group risk management strategy.\n\nThe IASB addressed the financial reporting implications of the IBOR reform through IFRS amendments, which were fully adopted by the Group on January 1, 2020. Specifically, the phase 2 amendments introduce a practical expedient to account prospectively for a change in the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial instrument attributable to the replacement of IBORs with ARR and relieves from specific hedge accounting requirements. Overall, the IBOR reform has no material effect on the Group's financial statements and the effectiveness of Group's hedging relationships.",

Summary of significant accounting policies\n\nSignificant accounting policies applied in these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all years presented unless otherwise stated. Other accounting policies are presented as part of the respective note disclosures.\n\n## a) Consolidation principles\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses and cash flows of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and its subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity that Zurich Insurance Group Ltd either directly or indirectly controls. The results of subsidiaries acquired are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The results of subsidiaries that have been divested during the year are included up to the date control ceased. All intra-Group balances, profits and transactions are eliminated.\n\nChanges in ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in a change in control are recorded within equity.\n\nNon-controlling interests are shown separately in equity, consolidated income statements, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of changes in equity.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared as of December 31 based on individual company financial statements at the same date. In some cases, information is included with a time lag of up to three months. The resulting effect on the Group's consolidated financial statements is not material.\n\n## b) Foreign currency translation and transactions\n\nForeign currency translation\n\nDue to the Group's economic exposure to the U.S. dollar (USD), the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated financial statements is USD. Many Group companies have a different functional currency, being that of the respective primary economic environment in which these companies operate. Assets and liabilities are translated into the presentation currency at end-of-period exchange rates, while income statements and statements of cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recorded directly in other comprehensive income (OCI) as cumulative translation adjustment (CTA).\n\n## Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction or, for practical reasons, a weighted average rate, if exchange rates do not fluctuate significantly. Foreign currency monetary items and foreign currency non-monetary items that are carried at fair value are translated at end-of-period exchange rates. The resulting foreign currency translation differences are recorded in income, except for the following:\n\n- - Foreign currency translation differences that are recognized in OCI in conjunction with the recognition of unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale investments; and\n- - Foreign currency translation differences arising on monetary items that form part of net investments in foreign operations, as well as foreign currency translation differences arising from monetary items that are designated as hedging instruments in a qualifying net investment hedge relationship, are included directly in OCI as CTA.\n\n## Hyperinflation\n\nThe Group considers various factors to determine whether an economy in a country where a foreign operation is situated is hyperinflationary, including the cumulative three-year inflation rate. If an economy becomes hyperinflationary, the financial statements of foreign operations with the functional currency of the hyperinflationary economy are restated to reflect the current purchasing power at the end of the reporting period using the official consumer price indices commonly used in the respective country. The restatement includes all balance sheet amounts that are not expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date and items of comprehensive income for the current year by applying the change in the price index from the dates when the items of income and expense were originally recorded. The restated financial statements of a foreign operation are translated into the Group's presentation currency at closing rates. Any translation adjustment resulting from initial application of the hyperinflationary accounting is recognized directly in equity.\n\n## c) Insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features (DPF)\n\n## Classification\n\nContracts issued that transfer significant insurance risk to the Group and obligations arising from investment contracts with DPF are accounted for as insurance contracts.",

Where this results in the reclassification of an investment product to a product that meets the definition of an insurance contract, the previously held reserve and the related deferred origination costs are reclassified and are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy that is to be applied to the new product on a prospective basis. As a consequence, no gain or loss is recognized when a contract is reclassified from an investment to an insurance contract.\n\nOnce a contract has been classified as an insurance contract, no reclassification can subsequently be made.\n\n## Premiums\n\n## Property & Casualty\n\nPremiums from the sale of property & casualty products are generally recorded when written and are recognized as revenue in relation to the insurance coverage provided. The unearned premium reserve represents the portion of the premiums written related to the unexpired coverage period.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nPremiums from traditional life insurance contracts, including participating contracts and annuity policies with life contingencies, are recognized as revenue when they are due from the policyholder. For single premium and limited pay contracts, premiums are recognized as revenue when due, with any excess profit deferred and recognized in income in a constant relationship to the insurance in-force or, for annuities, the amount of expected benefit payments.\n\nAmounts collected as premiums from investment-type insurance contracts such as universal life, unit-linked and unitized with-profits contracts are generally reported as deposits. Revenue from these contracts consists of policy fees for the cost of insurance, administration and surrenders during the period. Front-end fees charged to the customer at inception, particularly for single premium contracts, are deferred and recognized over the estimated life of the contracts following the same pattern that is applied to deferred acquisition costs and addressed below. Regular fees charged to the customer periodically (monthly, quarterly or annually) either directly or by making a deduction from invested funds are billed in advance and recognized on a straight-line basis over the period in which the service is rendered. Fees charged at the end of the period are accrued over the service period as a receivable and are offset against the financial liability when charged to the customer.\n\nCash flows from certain universal life-type contracts in the Group's Spanish operations are recognized as gross written premiums and insurance benefits and losses and not as deposits.\n\n## Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses\n\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses are charged to income as incurred. Reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses represent estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred. Any changes in estimates are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which estimates are changed. The Group does not discount its loss reserves, other than for claims with payment patterns which are fixed and reasonably determinable, and claims in economies determined to be hyperinflationary where inflation constitutes a significant input in the reserving process.\n\n## Reserves for life benefits\n\nFuture life policyholder benefits represent the estimated future benefit liability for traditional life insurance policies and include the value of accumulated declared bonuses or dividends that have vested to policyholders.\n\nThe reserves for life benefits for participating traditional life insurance policies are calculated using a net level premium valuation method based on actuarial assumptions taking into account guaranteed mortality benefits and interest rates.\n\nThe reserves for life benefits for other traditional life insurance policies are calculated using a net level premium valuation method based on actuarial assumptions including mortality, persistency, expenses and investment return, plus a margin for adverse deviations. These assumptions are locked in at inception and are regularly assessed as part of the liability adequacy testing over the period of the contract.\n\nPolicyholder contract deposits represent the estimated policy benefits for investment-type insurance contracts invested in non-unit-linked funds. This liability comprises the accumulation of premiums received, less charges, plus declared policyholder dividends.\n\nSome insurance contracts and investment contracts with DPF offered by the Group contain benefit features for which the amount and timing of declaration and payment are at the discretion of the Group. Where that discretion has not been exercised, the total amount expected to be allocated to policyholders as required by local insurance regulation or contractual provisions is included in the policyholder other funds.",

Where these assets are related to life insurance, corresponding adjustments to the reserves for life benefits and related assets are also recognized directly in OCI.\n\nReserves for unit-linked contracts are based on the fair value of the financial instruments backing those contracts less any fees and assessments charged to the policyholders. The related assets for unit-linked insurance contracts are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce measurement inconsistencies.\n\nFor products containing guarantees in respect of minimum death benefits (GMDB), retirement income benefits (GRIB) and/or annuitization options (GAO), additional liabilities are recorded in proportion to the receipt of the contracted revenues which are subject to a liability adequacy test taking into account policyholder behavior and current market conditions.\n\nFor products managed on a dynamic basis using derivative hedging strategies, an option in IFRS 4 is used to measure insurance liabilities using current financial and non-financial assumptions to better reflect the way that these products are managed. Financial assets related to these liabilities are designated at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)\n\nCosts that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal business, including for example commissions and certain underwriting and policy issue expenses, are deferred and subsequently amortized over a defined period. Such costs are presented on balance sheet net of commissions paid to reinsurers in respect of business ceded.\n\n## Property & Casualty\n\nDAC for property & casualty contracts is amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned.\n\n## Life insurance\n\nDAC for traditional participating life insurance contracts is amortized based on estimated gross margins expected to be realized over the life of the contract. Estimated gross margins are updated for actual and anticipated future experience and discounted using the latest revised interest rate for the remaining benefit period. Resulting deviations are reflected in income.\n\nDAC for other traditional life insurance and annuity contracts is amortized over the life of the contracts, based on expected premiums. Expected premiums are estimated at the date of policy issue for application throughout the life of the contract unless a premium deficiency subsequently occurs.\n\nDAC for investment-type insurance contracts such as universal life, unit-linked and unitized with-profits contracts is amortized based on estimated gross profits expected to be realized over the life of the contract. Estimated gross profits are updated for actual and anticipated future experience and discounted using either the interest rate in effect at the inception of the contracts or the latest revised interest rate for the remaining benefit period, depending on whether crediting is based on the policyholder's or on the reporting entity's investment performance. Resulting deviations are reflected in income.\n\nUnamortized DAC for life insurance contracts accrues interest at a rate consistent with the related assumptions for reserves.\n\nFor traditional participating and investment-type life insurance contracts, DAC is adjusted for the impact of unrealized gains/(losses) on allocated investments that are recorded in OCI.\n\n## Liability adequacy tests\n\nLiability adequacy tests are performed annually for groupings of contracts determined in accordance with the Group's manner of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of its insurance contracts.\n\n## Property & Casualty\n\nFor property & casualty contracts, unearned premiums are tested to determine whether they are sufficient to cover related expected losses, loss adjustment expenses, policyholder dividends, unamortized DAC and maintenance expenses, using current assumptions and considering anticipated investment returns. If a premium deficiency is identified, the DAC asset for the respective grouping of contracts is written down by the amount of the deficiency. If, after writing down the DAC asset to nil, a premium deficiency still exists for the respective grouping of contracts, then an additional reserve is established for the amount of the remaining deficiency.",

If a deficiency is identified, the DAC or PVFP for the respective grouping of contracts is written down by the amount of the deficiency. If, after writing down the DAC or PVFP to nil, a deficiency still exists for the respective grouping of contracts, the reserve for life benefits is increased by the amount of the remaining deficiency.\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nThe Group's insurance subsidiaries cede risk in the normal course of business to limit the potential for losses arising from certain exposures. Reinsurance does not relieve the originating insurer of its liability. Certain Group insurance companies assume reinsurance business as part of their normal business.\n\nReinsurance contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk are accounted for using the deposit method.\n\nA deposit asset or liability is recognized based on the premium paid, or received less any explicitly identified premiums or fees to be retained by the ceding company. Interest on deposits is accounted for using the effective interest rate method. Future cash flows are estimated to calculate the effective yield, and revenues and expenses are recorded as interest income or expense. Reinsurance deposit assets or liabilities also include funds deposited or held by the Group under assumed or ceded reinsurance contracts, respectively, when funds are retained by the reinsured under the terms of the contract.\n\nReinsurance is recorded gross in the consolidated balance sheet. Reinsurance assets include balances expected to be recovered from reinsurance companies for ceded paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future life policy benefits. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the assumptions used for the liabilities associated with the underlying insurance contracts.\n\nReinsurance assets are assessed for impairment on a regular basis and impairment losses, if any, are recorded in the same manner as for loans and receivables.\n\n## d) Liabilities for investment contracts (without DPF)\n\nInvestment contracts are those contracts that do not transfer significant insurance risk. The Group issues investment contracts without fixed terms (unit-linked) and investment contracts with fixed and guaranteed terms (fixed interest rate).\n\n## Unit-linked investment contracts\n\nThese represent portfolios maintained to meet the specific investment objectives of policyholders who bear the credit, market and liquidity risks related to the investments. The liabilities are carried at fair value, which is determined by reference to the underlying financial assets. Changes in fair value are recorded in income. The related assets for unit-linked investment contracts are designated at fair value through profit or loss in order to reduce measurement inconsistencies.\n\nThe services provided by the Group under such contracts are investment management and policy administration services that are provided over time and are not contingent on meeting specified performance criteria. Fees from such services are recognized ratably over the service period as policy fee revenue except where such fees are charged in connection with contract origination in which case such fees are recognized as contract liabilities (included within deferred front-end fees). The costs to fulfill the services over time are generally recognized as incurred, except the costs of acquiring new investment contracts with investment management services, such as commissions and other incremental expenses directly related to the issuance of each new contract. Such fees enhance the resources that will be used to satisfy future performance obligations and - to the extent recoverable - are capitalized as contract assets (deferred origination costs; DOC) and amortized in line with the revenue generated by providing investment management services. See note 11 for further information.\n\n## Investment contracts at amortized cost\n\nLiabilities for investment contracts with fixed and guaranteed terms are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. Transaction costs are included in the calculation of the effective yield. As of each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the expected future cash flows and re-calculates the carrying amount of the financial liability by computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using the original effective interest rate for the financial liability. Any adjustment is immediately recognized in income.",

The Group continues to apply the requirements in IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement' until implementation of IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' on January 1, 2023 (see note 2).\n\nThe majority of Group investments are accounted for at fair value through OCI (available-for-sale financial assets) and include debt and equity securities as well as fund investments. Such assets are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in OCI, until the securities are either sold or impaired. Interest income determined using the effective interest method and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through OCI is included in net investment income. The cumulative unrealized gains or losses recorded in OCI are net of cumulative deferred income taxes, certain related life policyholder liabilities and deferred acquisition costs. When available-for-sale financial assets are sold, impaired or otherwise disposed of, the cumulative gains or losses are reclassified from OCI to income as net capital gains/(losses) on investments and impairments.\n\nGroup investments at fair value through profit or loss include debt and equity securities backing certain life insurance contracts with participation features, and financial assets evaluated on a fair value basis. The designation of these assets at fair value through profit or loss eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets or recognizing the gains and losses on these assets on a different basis to the liabilities.\n\nGroup investments at amortized cost include debt securities for which the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity (held-to-maturity financial assets) as well as mortgage and other loans (loans and receivables). Such investments are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method, less any charges for impairment. When an impairment is determined to have occurred, the carrying amount of held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the movement in the impairment allowance is recognized in income as an impairment loss.\n\nThe Group recognizes regular purchases and sales of financial assets on the trade date, which is the date on which the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value are recognized in income, within net capital gains/(losses) on investments and impairments, in the period in which they arise. Interest income determined using the effective interest method and dividend income from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss is included in net investment income.\n\nGroup investments include investment property accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. Rental income from investment property is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in net investment income along with rental operating expenses for investment property recognized on an accrual basis.\n\nGroup investments include the following in cash and cash equivalents: cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, cash collateral received, and other highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of acquisition that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are stated at current redemption value.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is objective evidence that loss events have occurred that negatively affect the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset or a group of financial assets. The evaluation of whether a financial asset is impaired requires significant judgment (see note 4).\n\n## f) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments, except those designated under a qualifying cash flow or net investment hedge relationship, are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in fair value recognized in income.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting\n\nDerivative financial instruments are used by the Group to economically hedge risks. In limited circumstances derivative financial instruments are designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes in:\n\n- - Fair value hedges, which are hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.\n- - Cash flow hedges, which are hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognized asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss.\n- - Net investment hedges, which are hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.",

At inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis, the hedge relationship is formally assessed to determine whether the hedging instruments are expected to be (prospective assessment) and have been (retrospective assessment) highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk. If the qualifying criteria for the application of hedge accounting are no longer met, the hedge relationship is discontinued prospectively, in which case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are then subsequently reported independently in accordance with the respective accounting policy.\n\nThe accounting treatment of a qualifying hedge relationship is further described in note 7.\n\n## g) Attorney-in-fact (AIF) contracts\n\nThe AIF contracts reflect the ability of the Group to generate future revenues through Farmers Group Inc. (FGI) based on the FGI's relationship with the Farmers Exchanges. The Farmers Exchanges are not owned by FGI, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group. In determining that these relationships have an indefinite useful life, the Group took into consideration the organizational structure of inter-insurance exchanges, under which subscribers exchange contracts with each other and appoint an attorney-in-fact to provide non-claims services, and the historical AIF relationship between FGI and the Farmers Exchanges. The value of the AIF contracts is tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nThe services provided by FGI under such contracts are non-claims services including risk selection, preparation and mailing of policy documents and invoices, premium collection, management of the investment portfolios and certain other administrative functions. The multiple performance obligations covered by the consideration received are considered to be a series with the same pattern of transfer, therefore, the performance obligations are not separated. The revenue for the services provided includes Farmers management fee, membership fees and revenues for ancillary services. Farmers management fees are determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges and recognized ratably over the period the services are provided. Membership fees are one-time fees charged at the time of the policy issuance that do not cover a distinct performance obligation. Such fees are recognized as revenue over the expected life of the customer relationship. The incremental costs incurred in connection with the customer setup activity are recognized as an asset and subsequently amortized using the same pattern as the related revenue. The revenue for ancillary services includes remuneration for services provided that are not covered by Farmers management fees where FGI acts as a principal. Typically, these services are provided over time, so that the revenue is also recognized over time. See note 26 for further information.\n\n## h) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalized and tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications of impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units (CGUs) based on the level at which management monitors operations and makes decisions related to the continuation or disposal of assets and operations. If goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and an operation within that unit is disposed of, the carrying amount of the operation includes attributable goodwill when determining the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## i) Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets typically have finite lives and are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization and impairments. Such assets are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\n\n## Present value of future profits from acquired insurance contracts (PVFP)\n\nAn intangible asset representing the PVFP arises from the acquisition of life insurance businesses. Such an asset is amortized over the expected life of the acquired contracts, following the same principles as for DAC. The carrying value of the PVFP asset is tested periodically for impairment as part of the liability adequacy test for insurance contracts.\n\n## Distribution agreements\n\nDistribution agreements may have useful lives extending up to 30 years, estimated based on the period of time over which they are expected to provide economic benefits, but for no longer than the contractual term, after taking into account all economic and legal factors such as stability of the industry, competitive position and the period of control over the assets.",

Costs incurred during the development phase are capitalized. Software under development is tested for impairment annually.\n\nAcquired computer software licenses are capitalized on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring the specific software into use.\n\nThe useful lives of computer software licenses and capitalized internal software development costs generally range from three to five years. In limited circumstances, capitalized software development costs may be amortized over a period of up to 10 years, taking into account the effects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other economic and legal factors.\n\n## j) Employee benefits\n\n## Share-based compensation and cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group operates long-term incentive plans that are accounted for as equity-settled share-based compensation plans. The fair value of these incentive plans is determined at the grant date and is recognized as an expense in income over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase recorded in additional paid-in capital.\n\nSubsequently, depending on the underlying performance metrics, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares that are expected to be issued and recognizes the impact of the revision, if any, in income with a corresponding adjustment to additional paid-in capital. However, no subsequent adjustment is made after the vesting date.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nThe Group operates various post-employment benefit plans for its employees worldwide, which include defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, and other post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life insurance.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recorded as an expense in the period in which the economic benefit from the employees' service was received.\n\nDefined benefit plan obligations and current service costs are determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The defined benefit liability represents the present value of defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets with changes from remeasurements recorded in OCI. If the fair value of the plan assets is higher than the present value of the defined benefit obligation, the recognition of the resulting net asset is limited to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nGroup's expense related to these plans is accrued over the employees' service periods based on the actuarially determined cost for the period. Net interest and service costs are determined using the spot rate approach. Actuarial gains and losses are recognized, in full in the period in which they occur, in OCI. Past service costs, which result from plan amendments and curtailments, are recognized in income when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs (which is the date from which the plan change is irrevocable) and the date on which a constructive obligation arises. Settlement gains or losses are recognized in income when the settlement occurs.\n\n## Other post-employment benefits\n\nOther post-employment benefits, such as medical care and life insurance, are also provided for certain employees and are primarily funded internally. Similar to defined benefit plans, the cost of such benefits is accrued over the service period of the employees based on the actuarially determined cost for the period.",

Further, the Group is acting as a lessor in leases of investment property.\n\nWhen acting as a lessee, under IFRS 16, the Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability at the lease commencement date when the leased asset is available for use by the Group. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the lease payments due over the lease term, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate. Any options to extend or terminate a lease that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise are included in the lease term. The right-of-use asset is initially recognized at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments made or lease incentives received, initial direct costs and any estimated costs to dismantle or restore the leased asset.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the leased asset's useful life or the lease term on a straight-line basis. The right-of-use asset is included in 'Property and equipment' and disclosed separately in note 13. The carrying amount of the lease liability is increased to reflect the unwinding of the discount so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period and is reduced by the lease payments made during the period. Lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on a non-leveraged index or a rate. Lease liabilities are included within 'Other Liabilities.'\n\nThe Group records short-term leases and leases of low-value assets as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets are comprised of hardware and smaller office equipment. The lease expense is included in 'Administrative and other operating expense.'\n\nWhen acting as a lessor of investment property in an operating lease, the Group follows the accounting policy in paragraph e).",

Critical accounting judgments and estimates\n\nThe application of certain accounting policies requires critical accounting estimates that involve discretionary judgments and the use of assumptions which are susceptible to change due to inherent uncertainties. Because of the uncertainties involved, actual results could differ significantly from the assumptions and estimates made by management. Such critical accounting estimates are of significance to insurance reserves and deferred acquisition costs, the determination of fair value for financial assets and liabilities, impairment charges, deferred taxes and employee benefits.\n\n## a) Reserves for insurance contracts and deferred acquisition costs\n\n## Property & Casualty\n\nThe Group is required to establish reserves for payment of losses and loss adjustment expenses that arise from the Group's property & casualty products. These reserves represent the expected ultimate cost to settle claims occurring prior to, but still outstanding as of, the balance sheet date. The Group establishes its reserves by product line, type and extent of coverage and year of occurrence. There are two categories of loss reserve: reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported (IBNR) losses. Additionally, reserves are held for loss adjustment expenses, which contain the estimated legal and other expenses expected to be incurred to finalize the settlement of the losses.\n\nThe Group's reserves for reported losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates of future payments to settle reported claims. The Group bases such estimates on the facts available at the time the reserves are established. These reserves are generally established on an undiscounted basis to recognize the estimated costs of bringing pending claims to final settlement. The reserve calculation takes into account inflation, as well as other factors that can influence the amount of reserves required, some of which are subjective and some of which are dependent on future events. In determining the level of reserves, the Group considers historical trends and patterns of loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims and types of coverage. In addition, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes may affect the ultimate cost of settlement and, as a result, the Group's estimation of reserves. Between the reporting and final settlement of a claim circumstances may change, which may result in changes to established reserves. Items such as changes in law and interpretations of relevant case law, results of litigation, changes in medical costs, as well as costs of vehicle and home repair materials and labor rates can substantially impact ultimate settlement costs. Accordingly, the Group reviews and re-evaluates claims and reserves on a regular basis. Amounts ultimately paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses can vary significantly from the level of reserves originally set.\n\nThe Group establishes IBNR reserves, to recognize the estimated cost of losses for events which have already occurred but which have not yet been notified. These reserves are established to recognize the estimated costs required to bring such claims to final settlement. As these losses have not yet been reported, the Group relies upon historical information and statistical models, based on product line, type and extent of coverage, to estimate its IBNR liability. The Group also uses reported claim trends, claim severities, exposure growth, and other factors in estimating its IBNR reserves. These reserves are revised as additional information becomes available and as claims are actually reported.\n\nThe time required to learn of and settle claims is an important consideration in establishing the Group's reserves. Short-tail claims, such as those for motor and property damage, are normally reported soon after the incident and are generally settled within months. Long-tail claims, such as bodily injury, pollution, asbestos and product liability, can take years to develop and additional time to settle. For these claims, information concerning the event, such as the required medical treatment for bodily injury claims and the required measures to clean up pollution, may not be readily available. Accordingly, the reserving analysis of long-tail lines of business is generally more difficult and subject to greater uncertainties than for short-tail claims.\n\nSince the Group does not establish reserves for catastrophes in advance of the occurrence of such events, these events may cause volatility in the levels of its incurred losses and reserves subject to the effects of reinsurance recoveries. This volatility may also be contingent upon political and legal developments after the occurrence of the event.\n\nThe Group uses a number of accepted actuarial methods to estimate and evaluate the amount of reserves recorded. The nature of the claim being reserved for and the geographic location of the claim influence the techniques used by the Group's actuaries. Additionally, the Group's Corporate Center actuaries perform periodic reserve reviews of the Group's businesses throughout the world. Management considers the results of these reviews and adjusts its reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses, where necessary.",

These assumptions can vary by country, year of policy issuance and product type and are determined with reference to past experience adjusted for new trends, current market conditions and future expectations. As such the liabilities for future life policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits may not represent the ultimate amounts paid out to policyholders. For example:\n\n- - The estimated number of deaths determines the value of the benefit payments. The main source of uncertainty arises because of the potential for pandemics and wide-ranging lifestyle changes, such as changes in eating, smoking and exercise habits, which could result in earlier deaths for age groups in which the Group has significant exposure to mortality risk.\n- - For contracts that insure the risk of longevity, such as annuity contracts, an appropriate allowance is made for people living longer. Continuing improvements in medical care and social conditions could result in further improvements in longevity in excess of those allowed for in the estimates used to determine the liability for contracts where the Group is exposed to longevity risk.\n- - Under certain contracts, the Group has offered product guarantees (or options to take up product guarantees), including fixed minimum interest rate or mortality rate returns. In determining the value of these options and/or benefits, estimates have been made as to the percentage of contract holders that may exercise them. Changes in investment conditions could result in significantly more contract holders exercising their options and/or benefits than has been assumed.\n- - Estimates are made as to future investment income arising from the assets backing long-term insurance contracts. These estimates are based on current market returns as well as expectations about future economic and financial developments.\n- - Assumptions are determined with reference to current and historical customer data, as well as industry data. Interest rate assumptions reflect expected earnings on the assets supporting the future policyholder benefits. The information used by the Group's qualified actuaries in setting such assumptions includes, but is not limited to, pricing assumptions, available experience studies and profitability analysis.\n\nDeferred policy acquisition costs and the present value of future profits (PVFP) are recognized on balance sheet only to the extent that they are recoverable from future policy income which also depends on the above assumptions. Recoverability is tested at contract inception and subsequently on a regular basis with reference to current expectations of future profits or margins.\n\nSee note 8 for further information on liabilities for insurance contracts and note 11 for deferred policy acquisition costs. Also refer to the insurance risk section of the risk review.\n\n## b) Fair value measurement\n\nIn determining the fair values of investments in debt and equity instruments traded on exchanges and in over-thecounter (OTC) markets, the Group makes extensive use of independent, reliable and reputable third-party pricing providers and only in rare cases places reliance on valuations that are derived from internal models.\n\nIn addition, the Group's policy is to ensure that independently-sourced prices are developed by making maximum use of current observable market inputs derived from orderly transactions and by employing widely-accepted valuation techniques and models. When third-party pricing providers are unable to obtain adequate observable information for a particular financial instrument, the fair value is determined either by requesting selective non-binding broker quotes or by using internal valuation models.\n\nValuations can be subject to significant judgment, especially when the fair value is determined based on at least one significant unobservable input parameter; such items are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. See notes 6, 7 and 23 for further information regarding the estimate of fair value.",

When assessing impairment of available-for-sale debt securities, the Group places emphasis on issuer specific factors, such as significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency on interest or principal payments. A credit rating downgrade, worsened liquidity or decline in fair value below the weighted-average cost is not by itself considered a loss event, but rather incorporated in the impairment analysis along with other available information.\n\nThe Group determines that there is objective evidence of impairment of an available-for-sale equity security, if at the reporting date:\n\n- - its fair value is below the weighted-average cost by an amount significantly exceeding the volatility threshold determined quarterly for the respective equity market (such as North America, Asia Pacific, UK, Switzerland and other European countries); or\n- - its fair value has been below the weighted-average cost for a prolonged period of 24 consecutive months or longer.\n\n## Goodwill and attorney-in-fact (AIF) contracts\n\nGoodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit (CGU) as outlined in note 3. The Group has defined the CGUs according to regions, separating Property & Casualty (P&C), Life businesses and other (see note 27). The CGUs which carry the majority of goodwill and AIF contracts are presented in table 4.\n\nFor goodwill impairment testing, the Group estimates the recoverable amount based on the value-in-use of the CGU.\n\nValue-in-use is determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to be generated from the CGU. Cash flow projections are based on business plan projections, which are approved by management, typically covering a three-year period or, if appropriate and adequately justified, a longer period, which may be necessary to more accurately represent the nature of the cash flows used to test the goodwill. Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using, among others, estimated perpetual growth rates, which typically do not exceed the expected inflation of the geographical areas in which the cash flows supporting the goodwill are generated. If cash flows are generated in different geographical areas with different expected inflation rates, weighted averages are used. The discount rates applied reflect the respective risk-free interest rate adjusted for the relevant risk factors to the extent they have not already been considered in the underlying cash flows.\n\nThe discount rates used in the recoverable amount calculations for developed markets are based on the weighted average cost of capital and consider government bond rates which are further adjusted for equity risk premium, appropriate beta and leverage ratio. In emerging markets, discount rates are based on the U.S. dollar discount rate taking into account inflation differential expectations and country risks. All input factors to the discount rates are based on observable market data.\n\nTable 4 sets out for the major CGUs the applied discount rates and the perpetual nominal growth rates beyond the projection period that depend on expectations about country-specific growth rates and inflation as of the date of valuation, as well as the value of goodwill and AIF contracts as of December 31, 2021.\n\nTable 4\n\n|                              | Business   | in USD   millions   |   Discount  rates in %  2021 |   Discount  rates in % 2020 |   Perpetual  nominal  growth   rate in %  2021 |   Perpetual  nominal  growth   rate in % 2020 |\n|------------------------------|------------|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Farmers                      | Farmers    | 3,888               |                          9.2 |                         7.9 |                                            2.2 |                                           2.3 |\n| North America                | P&C        | 350                 |                          9   |                         7.8 |                                            2.2 |                                           2   |\n| Europe, Middle East & Africa | P&C        | 332                 |                          8.3 |                         7.5 |                                            1.8 |                                           1.8 |\n| Asia Pacific                 | P&C        | 876                 |                          9   |                         8.4 |                                            1.8 |                                           2.2 |\n| Asia Pacific                 | Life       | 1,198               |                          9.1 |                         8.4 |                                            2   |                                           2.1 |\n| Latin America                | P&C        | 262                 |                         17.8 |                        18.1 |                                            6   |                                           5.9 |\n| Latin America                | Life       | 74                  |                         15.4 |                        14.2 |                                            4.4 |                                           4.3 |\n\nDiscount and perpetual growth rates for goodwill and AIF contracts for major CGUs",

If the estimated future cash flows and other assumptions deviate significantly from the Group's current outlook, there is a risk that the goodwill is impaired.\n\nQuantitative sensitivity tests have been performed for all CGUs, by applying a reasonably possible change to each of the key assumptions to capture potential future variations in market conditions: a decrease in cash flows of up to 20 percent, an increase in the discount rate of 1.0 percentage point and a decrease in the perpetual growth rate of 1.0 percentage point. Under each individual scenario, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not impair goodwill and AIF contracts.\n\n## Distribution agreements\n\nQualitative analyses have been performed on distribution agreements, typically comprising an analysis of the current financial performance, any change in the conditions in the agreement and environment that would indicate an impairment. No impairment was identified.\n\nSee notes 3, 6, 13, 14 and 15 for further information on impairment of assets.\n\n## d) Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized if sufficient future taxable income, including income from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and available tax planning strategies, is available for realization. The utilization of deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their tax bases depends on the generation of sufficient taxable profits in the period in which the underlying asset or liability is recovered or settled. If applicable tax law acknowledges different types of expenses to be tax deductible, deferred tax assets are only recognized if they give rise to deductions against the same type of taxable income. The utilization of deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses or tax credits depends on the generation of sufficient taxable profits before the unused tax losses or tax credits expire. As of each balance sheet date, management evaluates the recoverability of deferred tax assets and, if it is considered probable that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be utilized, then a valuation allowance is recognized.\n\nSee note 17 for further information on deferred taxes.\n\n## e) Employee benefits\n\nThe Group provides defined benefit plans and other post-employment plans. In assessing the Group's liability for these plans, critical judgments include estimates of mortality rates, rates of employment turnover, disability, early retirement, discount rates, future salary and pension increases and increases in long-term health care costs. Discount rates for significant plans are based on a yield curve approach. The Group sets the discount rate by creating a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximate the estimated payouts of the defined benefit plan. These assumptions may differ from actual results due to changing economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants. These differences may result in variability of pension income or expense recorded in future years.\n\nSee note 20 for further information on employee benefits.",

Acquisitions and divestments\n\n## Transactions in 2021\n\n## Acquisitions\n\n## Deutsche Bank Italian Financial Advisors network acquisition\n\nOn August 4, 2021, Zurich Italy reached an agreement to acquire the network of Financial Advisors of the Deutsche Bank Group in Italy. The terms of the agreement provide for the transfer of a business unit consisting of approximately 1,085 Financial Advisors, 97 employees and 16.5 billion euros of assets under management. The acquisition allows Zurich Italy to further develop its financial and insurance distribution network in the Italian market. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the second half of 2022.\n\n## My Policy Group\n\nOn May 18, 2021, the Group acquired a 19.99 percent share in Project Policy Bidco Limited, the owner of MyPolicy Limited, a UK usage-based insurance managing general agent, and Minerva. Science Limited. As part of the acquisition Zurich contributed Bright Box Hong Kong Limited and its subsidiaries as well as USD 10 million in cash. The investment is valued at USD 28 million. As a result of the transaction, the Group recognized a USD 33 million loss on sale of Bright Box Hong Kong Limited.\n\n## MetLife Property and Casualty business\n\nOn December 11, 2020, Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich) subsidiary Farmers Group, Inc. (FGI) and Farmers Exchanges announced the acquisition of MetLife's property and casualty (P&C) business in the U.S. for a purchase price of USD 3.96 billion. The acquisition successfully closed on April 7, 2021, and the acquired P&C business has since been rebranded to Farmers Workplace Solutions (FWS). As part of the transaction in effect, FGI acquired MetLife P&C's management and administrative-related assets and liabilities to conduct its responsibilities as attorney-in-fact of the Farmers Exchanges and the Farmers Exchanges' underlying insurance business. Zurich contributed USD 2.44 billion through FGI and the Farmers Exchanges, USD 1.52 billion. Farmers Group, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges as its attorney-in-fact and receives fees for its services. Attorney-in-fact services primarily include risk selection, preparation and mailing of policy documents and invoices, premium collection, management of the investment portfolios and certain other administrative and managerial functions. Fees for these services are primarily determined as a percentage of gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges. Ancillary services primarily include information technology, brand advertising and certain distribution-related services that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts for which FGI acts as a principal in arranging for those services to the Exchanges.\n\nThe acquisition gives the Farmers Exchanges a truly nationwide presence and access to new distribution channels. This includes a 10-year exclusive distribution agreement through which the Farmers Exchanges are offering their personal lines products on MetLife's industry-leading U.S. Group Benefits platform, which today reaches 3,800 companies and 37 million employees.\n\nTable 5.1 shows the updated opening balance sheet line items as of the acquisition date, representing the fair value of tangible and intangible assets. Goodwill has increased by USD 133 million due to adjustments to the purchase price allocation, in the second half of 2021, based on the finalization of certain tax contingencies associated with the acquisition.",

The majority of these assets were debt securities.\n\nUnder the terms of securities lending or repurchase agreements, the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the transferred securities, and also retains contractual rights to the cash flows from these securities. These securities are therefore not derecognized from the Group's consolidated balance sheet. Cash received as collateral is recorded as an asset, and a corresponding liability is established. Interest expense is charged to income using the effective interest rate method over the life of the agreement.\n\nUnder a reverse repurchase agreement, the securities received are not recognized on the Group's consolidated balance sheet, as long as the risk and rewards of ownership have not been transferred to the Group. The cash delivered by the Group is derecognized and a corresponding receivable is recorded within receivables and other assets. Interest income is recognized in income using the effective interest rate method over the life of the agreement.\n\n## Net unrealized gains/(losses) on Group investments included in equity\n\n## Securities lending, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements",

Group derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments mainly for economic hedging purposes to mitigate risks. Such risks result from changes in interest rates, equity prices and exchange rates. Derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value are reported in receivables and other assets (see note 15) and those with a negative fair value are reported in other liabilities (see note 16).\n\nTable 7.1 shows the fair value and notional amounts for all group derivatives as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 separated by risks. While these notional amounts express the extent of the Group's involvement in derivative transactions, they do not, however, represent the amounts at risk.\n\nTable 7.1\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31            |                             |                             |                             |                    | 2021                  | 2021                  | 2021              | 2020         | 2020         |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                                               | Maturity by notional amount | Maturity by notional amount | Maturity by notional amount |                    |                       |                       |                   | Positive     | Negative     |\n|                                               | < 1 year                    | 1 to 5  years               | > 5 years                   | Notional   amounts | Positive  fair values | Negative  fair values | Notional  amounts | fair  values | fair  values |\n| Interest rate contracts  1                    | 2,520                       | 11,072                      | 4,265                       | 17,857             | 738                   | (296)                 | 20,890            | 1,401        | (250)        |\n| Equity contracts                              | 1,669                       | 330                         | 523                         | 2,522              | 57                    | (65)                  | 11,790            | 87           | (68)         |\n| Foreign exchange contracts                    | 17,961                      | 529                         | 319                         | 18,808             | 143                   | (171)                 | 20,699            | 275          | (162)        |\n| Total Group derivative  financial instruments | 22,149                      | 11,931                      | 5,106                       | 39,186             | 938                   | (532)                 | 53,379            | 1,763        | (481)        |\n| Thereof exchange-traded                       | 511                         | -                           | -                           | 511                | 1                     | (3)                   | 1,187             | 6            | (6)          |\n| Thereof OTC                                   | 21,638                      | 11,931                      | 5,106                       | 38,676             | 937                   | (529)                 | 52,192            | 1,757        | (475)        |\n\n- 1 Includes USD 1.8 billion and USD 679 million notional related to derivatives which are centrally cleared as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Interest rate contracts\n\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge risks from changes in interest rates and to manage asset liability mismatches. Whenever possible the Group enters into exchange-traded contracts, which are standardized and regulated. Furthermore, because of the structure of the exchanges, exchange-traded contracts are not considered to carry counterparty risk. Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are otherwise entered into and comprised of swaps and swaptions.\n\n## Equity contracts\n\nEquity contracts are entered into, either on a portfolio or on a macro level, to protect the fair value of equity investments against a decline in equity market prices or to manage the risk return profile of equity exposures. Short positions are always covered and sometimes used to mitigate hedging costs.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nSwaps and forward contracts are used to hedge the Group's foreign currency exposures and to manage balance sheet mismatches.\n\n## Credit contracts\n\nThe Group may from time to time enter into credit contracts. Credit contracts are credit default swaps entered into either on a portfolio or on a macro level to limit market risks arising from the investment portfolios against a change in credit spreads or to manage the risk return profile of the credit exposures. As of December 31, 2021, the Group does not hold credit defaults swaps.\n\n## Other contracts\n\nOther contracts predominantly include stable value products (SVPs) issued to insurance company separate accounts in connection with certain life insurance policies (Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) and Company Owned Life Insurance (COLI)) with an account value of USD 11.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and USD 11.1 billion as of December 31, 2020, and with a market value of the underlying investments of USD 11.3 billion and USD 11.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively (not included in the table above). The Group includes the likelihood of surrender as one of the input parameters to determine the fair value of the SVPs, which was nil as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn certain circumstances, derivative financial instruments meet the requirements of an effective hedge for accounting purposes. Where this is the case, hedge accounting may be applied. Financial information for these instruments is set out in table 7.2.\n\n## Maturity profile of notional amounts and fair values of Group derivative financial instruments",

The effective portion of the gains and losses on these swaptions are initially recognized in OCI. Subsequently the gains or losses will be recycled to profit or loss within net investment income on Group investments over the period to December 31, 2036. The gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of these hedges are recognized immediately in income within net capital gains/(losses) on investments and impairments.\n\nThe Group also uses interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps for cash flow hedging to protect against the exposure to variability of cash flows attributable to interest rate and currency risk. The hedging instrument is measured at fair value, with the effective portion of changes in its fair value recognized in OCI. The effective portion, related to spot rate changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument, is reclassified to profit or loss within administrative and other operating expense as an offset to foreign currency revaluation on the underlying hedged debt securities. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognized in net capital gains/(losses) and impairments.\n\nThe net change of gains/(losses) deferred in OCI on derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges were USD 338 million and USD 276 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe Group recognized gains/(losses) of USD 36 million and USD 35 million in the consolidated income statements within net investment income on Group investments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Group also recognized net gains of USD 26 million and USD 2 million within administrative and other operating expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as an offset to the foreign currency revaluation on the underlying hedged items.\n\nA nil amount for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was recognized in net capital gains/ (losses) and impairments due to hedge ineffectiveness. The IBOR Reform did not impact the effectiveness of Group's hedging relationships and it is not expected to have any material impact in the future (see note 2).\n\n## Gains/(losses) arising from fair value hedges",

Gains and losses on the designated hedging derivative and non-derivative financial instruments related to the effective portion of the hedge are recognized in OCI together with the translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment. The accumulated gains and losses in OCI are reclassified to income on disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nThe net change of gains/(losses) deferred in OCI were USD (69) million and USD 120 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively as a result of a hedge relationship by foreign exchange forwards and swaps.\n\nThe Group has also designated certain debt issuances as hedging instruments on a non-derivative net investment hedge relationship. The notional amount of these financial instruments was USD 11 billion and USD 9.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The net gains/(losses) deferred in OCI were USD 171 million and USD 324 million before tax for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nInformation on debt issuances designated as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge relationship is set out in note 18.\n\nNo ineffectiveness of net investment hedges was recognized in net capital gains/(losses) and impairments for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments: offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nTable 7.4 shows the net asset and liability position of Group derivative financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. Master netting arrangements are used by the Group to provide protection against loss in the event of bankruptcy or other circumstances that result in a counterparty being unable to meet its obligations. These arrangements commonly create a right of offset that becomes enforceable and affects the realization or settlement of individual financial assets and financial liabilities only following a specified event of default or other circumstances which would not be expected to arise in the normal course of business.\n\nGroup derivative financial instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements\n\nTable 7.4\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31     | Derivative assets   | Derivative assets   | Derivative liabilities   | Derivative liabilities   |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                        | 2021                | 2020                | 2021                     | 2020                     |\n| Fair value                             | 938                 | 1,763               | (532)                    | (481)                    |\n| Related amounts not offset             | (51)                | (192)               | 30                       | 196                      |\n| Cash collateral (received)/pledged     | (791)               | (1,520)             | 246                      | 114                      |\n| Non-cash collateral (received)/pledged | (6)                 | (26)                | 72                       | 61                       |\n| Net amount                             | 89                  | 25                  | (185)                    | (110)                    |",

In 2020, net reserves increased by USD 288 million following the acquisition of the CSS Versicherung AG Commercial Accident and Health business and USD 23 million following the acquisition of Adira Insurance. Additionally, Zurich North America entered into an agreement with Lyft, a ride-sharing provider, which resulted in an increase in ceded reserves of USD 144 million. The increase in reserves is partially offset by the transfer of a portfolio in Brazil of USD 103 million to DPVAT, a motor insurance pool.\n\nThe Group establishes loss reserves, which are estimates of future payments of reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses, with respect to insured events that have occurred. Reserving is a complex process dealing with uncertainty, requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments. Any changes in estimates or judgments are reflected in the results of operations in the period in which estimates and judgments are changed.\n\n## Liabilities for insurance contracts\n\n## Discounted reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses\n\n## Development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses",

The reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses are determined on the basis of the information available. However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the increase of USD 47 million in net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses is the result of an increase in reserves following natural catastrophe losses in North America including the Texas freeze event and Hurricane Ida and also in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) being offset by foreign exchange-related reserve decreases.\n\nNet favorable reserve development emerged from reserves established in prior years amounting to USD 600 million mainly related to the following:\n\n- - In EMEA, favorable prior year development of USD 143 million driven by retail motor;\n- - In North America, favorable prior year development of USD 509 million driven by worker injury.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase of USD 1.9 billion in net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses is mainly driven by foreign exchange-related increases as the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro and British pound, and from reserves related to catastrophe losses including Hurricane Laura and Civil Unrest in North America, and COVID-19-related losses mainly in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific.\n\nNet favorable reserve development emerged from reserves established in prior years amounting to USD 408 million mainly related to the following:\n\n- - In EMEA, favorable prior year development of USD 286 million driven by motor and liability in retail segment;\n- - In North America, favorable prior year development of USD 140 million driven by worker injury in retail and commercial segments.",

Reserves are presented by financial year, not by accident year. The reserves (and the development thereon) are for all accident years in that financial year. The top line of the table shows the estimated gross reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of each balance sheet date, which represents the estimated amount of future payments for losses incurred in that year and in prior years. The cumulative paid portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid through each subsequent year in respect of the reserves established at each year end. Similarly, the cumulative change in reserves section details the cumulative changes in loss reserves at the end of each financial year. The net undiscounted reserves reestimated portion of the table shows the reestimation of the initially recorded reserve as of each succeeding year end. Reserve development is shown in each column. Changes to estimates are made as more information becomes known about the actual losses for which the initial reserves were established. The cumulative deficiency or redundancy is equal to the initial net reserves less the liability reestimated as of December 31, 2021. It is the difference between the initial net reserve estimate and the last entry of the diagonal in the net undiscounted reserves reestimated portion of the table. Conditions and trends that have affected the development of reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses in the past may or may not necessarily occur in the future, and accordingly, conclusions about future results cannot be derived from the information presented in table 8.4.\n\nThe Group has considered asbestos, including latent injury, claims and claims expenses in establishing the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Group continues to be advised of indemnity claims asserting injuries from asbestos. Coverage and claim settlement issues, such as determination that coverage exists and the definition of an occurrence, together with increased medical diagnostic capabilities and awareness have often caused actual loss development to exhibit more variation than in other lines of business. Such claims require specialized reserving techniques and the uncertainty of the ultimate cost of these types of claims has tended to be greater than the uncertainty related to standard lines of business.\n\nNet reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for asbestos amounted to USD 124 million and USD 121 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nTable 8.5\n\n| in USD millions                                              | Gross    | Gross    | Ceded   | Ceded   | Net     | Net      |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|---------|----------|\n|                                                              | 2021     | 2020     | 2021    | 2020    | 2021    | 2020     |\n| As of January 1                                              | 83,958   | 77,756   | (4,256) | (3,978) | 79,703  | 73,778   |\n| Premiums                                                     | 12,653   | 12,579   | (1,717) | (1,385) | 10,937  | 11,194   |\n| Claims                                                       | (10,902) | (11,182) | 1,324   | 1,141   | (9,578) | (10,041) |\n| Fee income and other expenses                                | (4,341)  | (3,856)  | 451     | 238     | (3,890) | (3,618)  |\n| Interest and bonuses credited to policyholders               | 1,634    | 2,080    | (73)    | (101)   | 1,561   | 1,979    |\n| Changes in assumptions                                       | 14       | 76       | -       | -       | 14      | 76       |\n| Acquisitions/(divestments) and transfers  1                  | (3,411)  | 20       | 11      | 39      | (3,399) | 59       |\n| Increase/(decrease) recorded in   other comprehensive income | (1,135)  | 728      | -       | -       | (1,135) | 728      |\n| Foreign currency translation effects                         | (4,494)  | 5,757    | 163     | (208)   | (4,331) | 5,548    |\n| As of December 31                                            | 73,977   | 83,958   | (4,096) | (4,256) | 69,881  | 79,703   |\n\n- 1 The 2021 net movement is mainly related to an agreement entered into by Zurich Investments Life S.p.A. to sell part of its life and pension back book (see note 5). The 2020 net movement is mainly related to adjustments to the acquisition of OnePath.\n\nLong-duration contract liabilities included in future life policyholder benefits result primarily from traditional participating and non-participating life insurance products. Short-duration contract liabilities are primarily accident and health insurance products.\n\nFuture life policyholder benefits are generally calculated by a net premium valuation. In terms of U.S. dollars, the weighted average discount rate used in the calculation of future life policyholder benefits is 2.2 percent and 2.1 percent as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe amount of policyholder dividends to be paid is determined annually by each life insurance subsidiary. Policyholder dividends include life policyholder share of net income and unrealized appreciation of investments that are required to be allocated by the insurance contract or by local insurance regulations. Experience adjustments related to future policyholder benefits and policyholder contract deposits vary according to the type of contract and the country. Investment, mortality and morbidity results may be passed through by experience credits or as an adjustment to the premium mechanism, subject to local regulatory provisions.\n\n## Development of future life policyholder benefits",

As of December 31, 2020, the net carrying amount of liabilities for investment contracts decreased by USD 301 million due to portfolio transactions by Zurich International Life Limited and Zurich Life Assurance plc (see note 5).\n\n## Liabilities for investment contracts\n\n## Development of liabilities for investment contracts",

The undiscounted contractual cash flows for investment contract liabilities are USD 69 billion as of December 31, 2021 and USD 69 billion as of December 31, 2020. Liabilities for unit-linked investment contracts amounted to USD 61 billion and USD 55 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Policyholders of unit-linked investment contracts can generally surrender their contracts at any time, leading the underlying assets to be liquidated, risks arising from liquidation of unit-linked assets are borne by the policyholders. Certain non-unit-linked contracts also allow for surrender of the contract by the policyholder at any time. Liabilities for such contracts amounted to USD 416 million and USD 444 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Property and equipment\n\nBuildings held for own use and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment loss. Generally, these assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis to income over the following estimated useful lives:\n\n- - buildings 25 to 50 years;\n- - furniture and fixtures 5 to 10 years;\n- - computer equipment 3 to 6 years;\n- - other equipment 6 to 10 years (or determined by the term of lease).\n\nLand held for own use is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment loss.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the leased asset's useful life or the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Table 13.1\n\nTable 13.2\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31   | Real Estate   | Real Estate   |   Equipment |   Equipment |       | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|\n|                                      | 2021          | 2020          |        2021 |        2020 | 2021  | 2020    |\n| Right-of-use                         | 1,412         | 1,608         |          59 |          47 | 1,471 | 1,655   |\n| Owned and subject to operating lease | 501           | 527           |         464 |         523 | 965   | 1,050   |\n| Total                                | 1,912         | 2,135         |         523 |         570 | 2,436 | 2,705   |\n\n| in USD millions                               | Real Estate   | Real Estate                            | Real Estate    | Real Estate   | Equipment   | Equipment      | Equipment   | Total                          | Total         | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------|---------------|---------|\n|                                               | Owned         | Owned  - subject  to  operating  lease | Right-  of-use | Total         | Owned       | Right-  of-use | Total       | Owned  incl.  operating  lease | Right- of-use | Total   |\n| Gross carrying value as of  January 1, 2021   | 661           | -                                      | 2,637          | 3,298         | 1,394       | 94             | 1,488       | 2,055                          | 2,731         | 4,785   |\n| Less: accumulated  depreciation/impairments   | (134)         | -                                      | (1,029)        | (1,163)       | (871)       | (46)           | (918)       | (1,005)                        | (1,075)       | (2,081) |\n| Net carrying value as of  January 1, 2021     | 527           | -                                      | 1,608          | 2,135         | 523         | 47             | 570         | 1,050                          | 1,655         | 2,705   |\n| Additions and improvements                    | 96            | -                                      | 76             | 172           | 92          | 35             | 127         | 188                            | 111           | 299     |\n| Lease modifications                           | -             | -                                      | (17)           | (17)          | -           | -              | -           | -                              | (16)          | (16)    |\n| Depreciation and impairments                  | (8)           | -                                      | (200)          | (208)         | (120)       | (20)           | (140)       | (129)                          | (220)         | (348)   |\n| Acquisitions/(divestments)   and transfers    | (97)          | -                                      | (7)            | (104)         | (14)        | (3)            | (17)        | (111)                          | (10)          | (121)   |\n| Foreign currency   translation effects        | (17)          | -                                      | (49)           | (66)          | (16)        | (1)            | (17)        | (33)                           | (49)          | (82)    |\n| Net carrying value as of                      | 501           | -                                      | 1,412          | 1,912         | 464         | 59             | 523         | 965                            | 1,471         | 2,436   |\n| December 31, 2021 Plus: accumulated           | 70            | -                                      |                |               |             | 44             | 929         | 955                            | 1,165         | 2,120   |\n| depreciation/impairments                      |               |                                        | 1,121          | 1,191         | 885         | 103            |             |                                |               |         |\n| Gross carrying value as of  December 31, 2021 | 571           | -                                      | 2,533          | 3,104         | 1,349       |                | 1,452       | 1,920                          | 2,636         | 4,556   |\n\n## Property and equipment overview\n\n## Property and equipment current period",

Goodwill further increased following the acquisition of the CSS Versicherung AG Commercial Accident and Health portfolio in Switzerland and also as a result of post-acquisition adjustments related to the OnePath acquisition.\n\nA goodwill impairment of USD 33 million was recognized relating to Bright Box, which is part of the Group Functions & Operations segment.\n\nThe Group performs quantitative tests of goodwill recoverability annually during the third quarter by applying a reasonably possible change to each of the key assumptions to capture potential future variations in market conditions: a decrease in cash flows of up to 20 percent, an increase in the discount rate of 1.0 percentage point and a decrease in the perpetual growth rate of 1.0 percentage point. Under each individual scenario, reasonably possible changes in key assumptions did not impair goodwill and AIF contracts. The Group's quantitative tests support the carrying value of the goodwill in these CGUs.\n\n| in USD millions,  as of December 31, 2020   | Attorney-  in-fact  contracts   | Goodwill   | PVFP   | Distribution  agreements   | Software   | Other   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------|------------|---------|---------|\n| Property & Casualty                         | -                               | 1,876      | -      | 762                        | 749        | 183     | 3,570   |\n| Life                                        | -                               | 1,365      | 381    | 1,625                      | 57         | 26      | 3,455   |\n| Farmers                                     | 1,025                           | 819        | 32     | -                          | 351        | -       | 2,228   |\n| Group Functions and                         |                                 |            |        |                            |            |         |         |\n| Operations                                  | -                               | 29         | -      | -                          | 64         | -       | 92      |\n| Net carrying value                          | 1,025                           | 4,089      | 413    | 2,388                      | 1,221      | 209     | 9,345   |",

Accordingly, the income tax expense or benefit attributable to these life insurance policyholder earnings is included in income tax expense. In certain jurisdictions an accrual for future policy fees that will cover the tax charge is included in insurance benefits and losses.\n\nTaxes paid by certain of the Group's life insurance businesses are based on the investment result, and it is normal practice for certain of the Group's businesses to recover from policyholders the taxes attributable to their share of the investment result. While the relevant insurance businesses have the contractual right to charge policyholders for the taxes attributable to their share of the investment result, the obligation to pay the tax authority rests with the company and therefore the full amount of tax including the portion attributable to policyholders is accounted for as income tax. Income tax expense, therefore, includes an element attributable to policyholders.",

Legal entities are grouped as a single taxpayer only when permitted by local legislation and when deemed appropriate. The first part of table 17.3 includes single taxpayers with a net deferred tax asset position and the second part includes single taxpayers with a net deferred tax liability position.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates and interests in joint ventures, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized amount to approximately USD 26 billion and USD 26 billion, respectively. In the remote likelihood that these temporary differences were to reverse simultaneously, the resulting tax liabilities would be very limited due to participation exemption rules.\n\n## Deferred tax assets/(liabilities) analysis by source",

The extension of the authorized share capital required the corresponding extension of the validity of the combined dilution limitations for the authorized and contingent share capital (Art. 5 bis 5 and 5 ter 1d of the Articles of Association).\n\nThe Board of ZIG is authorized to increase the share capital of ZIG by an amount not exceeding CHF 4,488,240 by issuing up to 44,882,400 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each until April 7, 2023. An increase in partial amounts is permitted. The Board would determine the date of issue of any such new shares, the issue price, type of payment, conditions for exercising subscription rights, and the commencement of entitlement to dividends.\n\nThe Board may issue such new shares by means of a firm underwriting by a banking institution or syndicate with a subsequent offer of those shares to current shareholders.

Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of retirement benefit arrangements for employees. Historically, the majority of employees belonged to defined benefit pension plans and some will still have past service benefits accrued in those plans.\n\nHowever, the majority of employees now accrue benefits under defined contribution plans, which provide benefits equal to the amounts contributed by both the employer and the employee plus investment returns.\n\nCertain of the Group's operating companies also provide post-employment benefit plans covering medical care and life insurance, mainly in the U.S. Eligibility for these plans is generally based on completion of a specified period of eligible service and reaching a specified age. The plans typically pay a stated percentage of medical expenses subject to deductibles and other factors. The cost of post-employment benefits is accrued during the employees' service periods.\n\nThe Group Pensions Committee is responsible for developing, reviewing and advising on the Group governance framework in matters related to pension and post-employment benefit arrangements. It provides oversight and guidance in the areas of market, demographic and reputational risk. It reports to and makes recommendations to the Group Balance Sheet Committee on material pension-related matters and reports regularly to the Remuneration Committee. The Group Pensions Committee provides a point of focus and coordination on the topic of pensions and post-retirement benefits at Group level for the supervision and exercise of company powers and obligations in relation to pension and post-retirement benefit plans.\n\nFunding and asset allocation is subject to local legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## a) Defined benefit pension plans\n\nThe largest defined benefit obligations are in the pension plans in Switzerland, the UK, the U.S. and Germany, which together comprise over 90 percent of the Group's total defined benefit obligation. The remaining plans in other countries are not individually significant, therefore no separate disclosure is provided.\n\nCertain Group companies provide defined benefit pension plans, some of which provide benefits on retirement, death or disability related to employees' service periods and pensionable earnings. Others provide cash balance plans where the participants receive the benefit of the accumulated employer and employee contributions (where paid) together with additional cash credits in line with the rules of the plan.\n\nMost of the Group's defined benefit pension plans are funded through contributions by the Group and, in some cases also by employees, to investment vehicles managed by trusts or foundations independent of the Group's finances, or by management committees with fiduciary responsibilities. Where a trust or foundation exists, it is required by law or by articles of association to act in the interests of the fund and of all relevant beneficiaries to the plan, which can also include the sponsoring company, and is responsible for the investment policy with regard to the assets of the fund. The trust/foundation board or committee is usually composed of representatives from both employers and plan members. Independent actuarial valuations for the plans are performed as required. It is the Group's general principle that plans are appropriately funded in accordance with local pension regulations in each country.\n\nThe pension plans typically expose the company to risks such as interest rate, price inflation, longevity and salary increases. To the extent that pension plans are funded, the assets held mitigate some of the liability risk but introduce some investment risk.\n\nThe overall investment policy and strategy for the Group's defined benefit pension plans is to achieve an investment\n\nreturn which, together with contributions, targets having sufficient assets to pay pension benefits as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks in the plans. The actual asset allocation is determined by reference to current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. The Group has a governance framework to ensure the trust/foundation board or committee considers how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the potential impact on the funding status of the plans, including short-term liquidity requirements. The investment strategies for each pension plan are independently determined by the governance body in each country, with oversight by the Group Pensions Committee. The pension assets are invested in diversified portfolios across geographical regions and asset classes to ensure diversified returns, also taking into account local pension laws. The investment strategies aim to mitigate asset-liability mismatches in the long run. In recent years, the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors has become a significant element of Zurich's pension plans' investment decision making. Pension plans will continue progressing on their responsible investment journey, leveraging Zurich's expertise and leadership while being cognizant of their fiduciary responsibility.\n\nFor post-employment defined benefit plans, total contributions to funded plans and benefits paid directly by the Group were USD 331 million for 2021 compared with USD 268 million for 2020. The estimated total for 2022 is USD 297 million (actual amount may differ).",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Consolidated financial statements (continued)\n\n## Swiss pension plan\n\nThe main plan provides benefits that exceed the minimum benefit requirements under Swiss pension law. It provides a lifetime pension to members based on their accrued retirement savings in the basic and additional accounts multiplied by the applicable conversion rate at the normal retirement age of 65 (age 62 for Executive Staff). Participants can draw retirement benefits early from age 60 (age 58 for Executive Staff). Alternatively, the benefit can be taken as a lump sum payment at retirement. In addition, at retirement, the plan pays a one-off cash sum settlement equal to the accrued retirement savings in the capital account. Contributions to the plan are paid by the employees and the employer, both for retirement savings and to finance risk benefits paid out in the event of death and disability. The accumulated balance on the pension account is based on the employee and employer pension contributions and interest accrued. The interest rate credited is defined annually by the plan's Board of Trustees which is responsible for the governance of the plan. The trustees review the Pension Plan's funding status regularly as well as the technical interest rate and the conversion rates. The conversion rate at age 65 is currently being phased down to 5 percent until 2023 to align it more closely with the low interest rate environment and increased life expectancy. In 2018, both the employer and employee savings contributions were increased. The insured salary was increased by reducing the coordination deduction. The flexibility of the plan was improved by introducing three levels of savings. Top-up payments from the company were introduced to those members' pension accounts which had been part of the plan in 2017 and were affected by the changes. For them, this ensures that expected benefits at normal retirement age will be at least equal to 98.5 percent of their pensions expectations under the previous conversion rates. The top up payments will be made until 2023.\n\nAlthough the Swiss plan operates like a defined contribution plan under local regulations, it is accounted for as a defined benefit pension plan under IAS 19 'Employee Benefits' because of the need to accrue a minimum level of interest on the mandatory part of the pension accounts and the payment of a lifetime pension at a fixed conversion rate under the plan rules.\n\nActuarial valuations are completed annually and if the plan becomes underfunded under local regulations, options for dealing with this include the Group paying additional contributions into the plan and/or reducing future benefits. At present, the plan is sufficiently funded, meaning that no additional contributions into the plans are expected to be required in the next year. The investment strategy of the Swiss plan is constrained by Swiss pension law including regulations related to diversification of plan assets. Under IAS 19, volatility arises in the Swiss pension plan net asset because the fair value of the plan assets is not directly correlated to movements in the value of the plan's defined benefit obligation in the short-term.\n\nIf the fair value of plan assets exceeds the plan's defined benefit obligation, a surplus is only recognized on the balance sheet to the extent that it does not exceed the estimated future economic benefit. The value of the future economic benefit is estimated as the sum of two items: the difference between the present value of the estimated future net service cost and the present value of estimated future employer contributions, plus employer contribution reserves in accordance with local Swiss regulations.\n\n## UK pension plan\n\nThe major UK pension plan is a hybrid arrangement and defined benefits entitlements accrued to December 31, 2015, increase in line with salary increases. Normal retirement age for the plan is 60. The plan is split into distinct sections and the two defined benefit sections are closed to new entrants and, with effect from January 1, 2016, to future benefit accrual. All employees now participate in a defined contribution section within the same trust. The notes that follow consider only the defined benefit sections. The UK Pension Trustee Board is responsible for the governance of the plan. The employer contributions are determined based on regular triennial actuarial valuations which are conducted using assumptions agreed by the Trustee Board and the sponsoring company. A local statutory valuation was carried out at an effective date of June 30, 2019, and was finalized in September 2020. This valuation disclosed a funding surplus of USD 86 million (GBP 63 million) after taking into account the value of the asset-backed funding arrangement established in 2014. The asset-backed funding arrangement does not qualify as a plan asset under IAS19 and is therefore not included in the tables set out in the rest of this note.\n\nThe ongoing funding of the plan is closely monitored by the Trustee Board and a dedicated funding committee is made up of representatives from the Trustee Board and the Group. The plan rules and UK pension legislation set out maximum levels of inflationary increases applied to plan benefits. The plan assets are invested in diversified classes of assets.",

(FGI) pension plan. Both plans are funded entirely by the participating employers. The ZNA plan is a cash balance and the FGI pension plan utilizes a cash balance pension formula for benefits accruing after January 1, 2009, except with respect to certain grandfathered participants who retained a final average pay formula. Under a cash balance pension formula, an amount is credited to the cash balance account each quarter, determined by an employee's age, service and their level of earnings up to and above the social security taxable wage base. The minimum annual interest credited on the account balance is 5 percent. The cash balance account is available from age 65, or age 55 with five years of service. The benefit can be taken as a monthly annuity or as a lump sum. Both the ZNA plan and the FGI pension plan have fiduciaries as required under local pension laws. The fiduciaries are responsible for the governance of the plans. Actuarial valuations are completed regularly. The annual employer minimum required contributions are equal to expected expenses paid from the plan each year, plus a rolling amortization of any prior underfunding.\n\nThe ZNA and FGI plans have been frozen with effect from December 31, 2018. ZNA and FGI employees with a cash balance account will continue to earn interest credits on their existing cash balance account balance after the freeze date and will continue to earn eligibility service used to determine vesting and early retirement eligibility. FGI employees participating in the final average pay formula will continue to earn eligibility service used to determine vesting and the percentage of pension benefit payable for early retirement before normal retirement age of 65. ZNA and FGI employees earn only defined contribution retirement benefits with effect from January 1, 2019. In conjunction with the change in the pension plan, ZNA and FGI employees receive an additional company contribution within their defined contribution plan.\n\n## German pension plans\n\nThere are a number of legacy defined benefit plans in Germany, most of which were set up under works council agreements. Contributions to support the pension commitments are made to a contractual trust arrangement. A separate arrangement was also established in 2010 to provide for retirement obligations that were in payment at that time. Consideration is given from time to time based on the fiscal efficiency of adding recent retirees to this arrangement and to adding assets to the contractual trust. In 2021 the pension liabilities are nearly fully funded therefore no additional funding was required.\n\nThe defined benefit plans provide benefits on either a final salary, career average salary or a cash balance basis. New entrants participate in a cash balance arrangement, which has the characteristics of a defined contribution arrangement, with a lump sum paid at retirement and a capital guarantee on members' balances, which mirrors the capital guarantee given in a conventional life insurance arrangement in Germany.",

For the UK, where price inflation is required for projecting benefits in those calculations, this is done using the full breakeven price inflation curve. The figures for discount rates and for UK price inflation in table 20.4 are singleequivalent rates for the defined benefit obligations (i.e., the single assumption that would produce the same defined benefit obligation as using the full curve); single-equivalent rates for other elements of the accounting results will differ slightly from the figures set out below.\n\n## Table 20.4\n\nTable 20.5a\n\n| as of December 31                   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020       | 2021 2020      | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020       | 2021 2020      | 2021 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|\n|                                     | Switzerland | United  Kingdom | United  States | Germany     | Switzerland | United  Kingdom | United  States | Germany     |\n| Discount rate                       | 0.2%        | 1.8%            | 2.8%           | 1.1%        | 0.0%        | 1.3%            | 2.5%           | 0.6%        |\n| Inflation rate (CPI)  1             | 1.0%        | 2.2%            | 2.7%           | 2.2%        | 1.1%        | 1.9%            | 2.2%           | 1.4%        |\n| Salary increase rate                | 1.0%        | 2.8%            | 5.2%           | 3.5%        | 1.1%        | 2.8%            | 4.7%           | 2.7%        |\n| Expected future   pension increases | 0.1%        | 3.5%            | n / a          | 2.2%        | 0.1%        | 3.4%            | n / a          | 1.4%        |\n| Interest crediting rate  2          | 1.0%        | n / a           | 5.0%           | n / a       | 0.3%        | n / a           | 5.0%           | n / a       |\n\n- 1 In the UK part of the liability is linked to the inflation measure of the Retail Price Index (RPI), which is assumed to be 1.0 percent higher than the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.

The effect on the defined benefit obligation shown allows for an alternative value for each assumption while the other actuarial assumptions remain unchanged. While this table illustrates the overall impact on the defined benefit obligation of the changes shown, the significance of the impact and the range of reasonably possible alternative assumptions may differ between the different plans that comprise the overall defined benefit obligation. In particular, the plans differ in benefit design, currency and average term, meaning that different assumptions have different levels of significance for different plans. The sensitivity analysis is intended to illustrate the inherent uncertainty in the evaluation of the defined benefit obligation under market conditions at the measurement date. Its results cannot be extrapolated due to non-linear effects that changes in the key actuarial assumptions may have on the overall defined benefit obligation. Furthermore, the analysis does not indicate a probability of such changes occurring and it does not necessarily represent the Group's view of expected future changes in the defined benefit obligation. Any management actions that may be taken to mitigate the inherent risks in the post-employment defined benefit plans are not reflected in this analysis.\n\n| in years, as of December 31, 2020   |                                                                                                                                  | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a male currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a female currently   | Life expectancy at age 65 for a female currently   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                     |                                                                                                                                  | aged 65                                          | aged 45                                          | aged 65                                            | aged 45                                            |\n| Country                             | Mortality table for major plans                                                                                                  |                                                  |                                                  |                                                    |                                                    |\n| Switzerland                         | BVG 2015 with generational  projections according to CMI  model adapted to Swiss mortality  with a long-term trend rate of 1.25% | 21.70                                            | 23.90                                            | 23.70                                              | 25.70                                              |\n| United Kingdom                      | SAPS Series 3 with CMI\\_2019  projection with plan specific  adjustments                                                          | 21.93                                            | 22.93                                            | 23.92                                              | 25.12                                              |\n| United States                       | Pri-2012 with MP-2020  Generational projection and white  collar adjustment                                                      | 21.74                                            | 23.12                                            | 23.14                                              | 24.49                                              |\n| Germany                             | Heubeck 2018G                                                                                                                    | 20.33                                            | 23.10                                            | 23.81                                              | 26.04                                              |\n\nTable 20.6 shows the expected benefits to be paid under the Group's major plans in the future.

The plans provide for voluntary contributions by employees and contributions by the employer which typically range from 2 percent to 13 percent of annual pensionable salary, depending on a number of factors.

Share-based compensation and cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group has adopted various share-based compensation and cash incentive plans to attract, retain and motivate employees. The plans are designed to reward employees for their contribution to the performance of the Group and to encourage employee share ownership. Share-based compensation plans include performance-based share plans and employee share purchase plans. Share-based compensation plans are based on the provision of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd shares.\n\n## a) Cash incentive plans\n\nThe Group's short-term incentive plan (STIP) is utilized across the Group and, in many countries covers all employees in that country who are selected to participate in a short-term incentive plan. In addition, there may be other local short-term incentive plans in place. Awards are made in cash, based on the accomplishment of both organizational and individual performance objectives. The expense recognized for these cash incentive plans amounted to USD 597 million and USD 532 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## b) Share-based compensation plans for employees\n\nThe Group encourages employees to own shares in Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and has set up a framework based on the implementation of performance share programs. Actual plans are tailored to meet local market requirements.\n\nThe cost of share-based payments depends on various factors, including achievement of targets, and are subject to the discretion of the Remuneration Committee and the Board. Costs may therefore vary significantly from year to year. The net amounts of USD 279 million and USD 187 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, reflect all aspects of share-based compensation, including adjustments made during the year.\n\nThe explanations below provide a more detailed overview of the main plans of the Group.\n\n## Employee share plans\n\n## Share incentive plans for employees in the UK\n\nThe Group established an Inland Revenue approved Share Incentive Plan and launched the Partnership Shares element of this plan in 2003, which enabled participating employees to make monthly purchases of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd shares at the prevailing market price from their gross earnings. This plan was terminated in 2007. There were 16 and 25 participants in the plan as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nA revised Partnership Share Scheme was launched in March 2013. Participants benefit from purchasing shares by making deductions from gross salary up to a maximum of GBP 1,800 or 10 percent of their year-to-date earnings. There were 694 and 690 active participants in the plan as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe Group also operates a profit-sharing element of the Share Incentive Plan (Reward Shares) which was launched in 2004 with annual share allocations being made in May each year subject to business performance. The awards are based on business operating profit (BOP) after tax for the year achieved by the business unit of each participating employee. Individual awards are subject to a maximum of 5 percent of a participant's base salary (before any flexible benefit adjustments) with an overall maximum of GBP 3,600. The total number of participating employees in Reward Shares as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 3,997 and 4,280, respectively.\n\nA Dividend Shares scheme was launched in 2014 which allows employees to reinvest their dividends from Partnership Shares and Reward Shares. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were 564 and 522 participants in the scheme, respectively.\n\n## Share incentive plan for employees in Switzerland\n\nUnder the Employee Share Plan, eligible employees are allowed to acquire sales-restricted shares at a 30 percent discount to the market value. The maximum permitted investment at the preferential price in shares is equivalent to CHF 3,500 per employee per annum. During 2021, 4,383 employees were eligible to participate in the plan, compared with 4,145 in 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 2,240 and 2,080 employees, respectively, purchased shares under the 2020 and 2021 share plans.\n\n## The Group Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)\n\nParticipants in this plan are allocated a target number of performance shares units (PSUs) as notional shares of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd in April each year. The number of PSUs is calculated as a percentage of the annual base salary of each participant. To further align participants with the interests of shareholders, PSUs are credited with dividend equivalent units (DEUs) during the vesting period to compensate participants in LTIP for dividends paid to shareholders.",

The performance criteria used to determine the level of vesting are the Group's net income attributable to shareholders' return on common shareholders' equity (NIAS ROE), the position of its relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured against an international peer group of insurance companies, and the achievement of cash remittance targets. The three pre-defined performance criteria are each assessed over a period of three consecutive financial years starting in the year of allocation and have an equal weighting. One half of the shares that actually vest are sales-restricted for a further three years for members of the Executive Committee. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 there were 1,228 and 1,162 participants in this plan, respectively.\n\nTable 21\n\n| for the years ended December 31    | Number   | Number   |   Fair value at the   allocation date (in CHF)  1 |   Fair value at the   allocation date (in CHF)  1 |\n|------------------------------------|----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                    | 2021     | 2020     |                                              2021 |                                              2020 |\n| Shares allocated during the period | 422,606  | 510,046  |                                               406 |                                               333 |\n\n- 1 Fair value measured using the market price of the shares at the allocation date and volatility indicators.\n\nThe shares allocated each year are based on parameters under the Group's LTIP.

Commitments may be called by the counterparty over the term of the investment (generally three to five years) and must be funded by the Group on a timely basis.\n\n## Guarantees and letters of credit\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, USD 643 million and USD 649 million, respectively, related to guarantees in the aggregate amount of GBP 475 million which were provided to the directors of a wholly owned subsidiary in connection with the repatriation of capital. These guarantees have no expiry date.\n\nThe Group knows of no event of default that would require it to satisfy financial guarantees. Irrevocable letters of credit have been issued to secure certain reinsurance contracts.\n\nThe Group is active in numerous countries where insurance guarantee funds exist. The design of such funds varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some, funding is based on premiums written, in others the Group may be called upon to contribute to such funds in case of a failure of another market participant. In addition, in some jurisdictions the amount of contribution may be limited, for example, to a percentage of the net underwriting reserve net of payments already made.\n\nThe Group carries certain contingencies in the ordinary course of business in connection with the sale of its companies and businesses. These are primarily in the form of indemnification obligations provided to the acquirer in a transaction in which a Group company is the seller. They vary in scope and duration by counterparty and generally are intended to shift the potential risk of certain unquantifiable and unknown loss contingencies from the acquirer to the seller.\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd has provided unlimited guarantees in support of entities belonging to the Zurich Capital Markets group of companies.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nThe Group has received notices from various tax authorities asserting deficiencies in taxes for various years. The Group is of the view that the ultimate outcome of these reviews will not materially affect the Group's consolidated financial position.\n\nThe Group has commitments to provide collateral on certain contracts in the event of a financial strength downgrading for Zurich Insurance Company Ltd from the current AA by Standard & Poor's. Should the rating by Standard & Poor's fall to A+, then the additional collateral based on information available amounts to nil as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nIn common with other insurance companies, the Group is mindful of the trend toward enhanced consumer protection. There is significant uncertainty about the ultimate cost this trend might have on our business. The main areas of uncertainty concern court decisions as well as the volume of potential customer complaints related to sales activities and withdrawal rights, and their respective individual assessments.\n\n## Quantifiable commitments and contingencies",

The total amount of pledged financial assets including the securities under short-term sale and repurchase agreements amounted to USD 2.1 billion and USD 1.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nTerms and conditions associated with the financial assets pledged to secure the Group's liabilities are usual and standard in the markets in which the underlying agreements were executed.\n\n## Legal, compliance and regulatory developments\n\nThe Group's business is subject to extensive supervision, and the Group is in regular contact with various regulatory authorities. The Group is also involved in legal and arbitration proceedings and regulatory investigations arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of its business operations in various jurisdictions where it operates. In addition, the Group and/or its subsidiaries are involved in legal matters arising out of transactions involving the transfer of portfolios or businesses. These legal matters can include claims brought by purchasers or other parties asserting claims for damages on various theories, including failure to disclose material information, failure to perform contractual duties or otherwise seeking to impose liability on the Group and/or its subsidiaries. With respect to significant legal or regulatory matters, the Group considers the likelihood of a negative outcome and when the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reliably estimated, a reserve or provision is established to record the estimated loss for the expected outcome. While the Group believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its subsidiaries the subject of, any unresolved current legal proceedings, claims, litigation and investigations that will have a material adverse effect on the Group's consolidated financial condition, proceedings are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the outcome of any proceeding could have a material impact on results of operations in the particular reporting period in which it is resolved.\n\n- - Specifically, COVID-19-related coverage litigation: Several of the Group's subsidiaries as well as other insurance companies are involved in litigation relating to the extent to which COVID-19 was intended to be covered under Property Damage Business Interruption policies. A limited number of class actions have also been initiated. To date, most of the litigation has been filed in United States courts, which have predominantly found in favor of insurers. The final determination of outcomes may take many years as appeals are pursued by the plaintiffs and insurers, including the Group or its subsidiaries.\n- - In 2016, the Group, on its own initiative, undertook an internal review of the life insurance, savings and pension business sold by its non-U.S. operating companies with relevant cross-border business to customers with a nexus to the U.S. The review confirmed that the Group's cross-border business with U.S. persons was very limited and of a legacy nature, with the large majority of sales having occurred more than a decade ago. The review also confirmed that the Group's U.S. operating companies were not involved in or connected to those activities. The Group voluntarily disclosed the results of the review and the regulatory issues presented by sales to U.S. residents to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and other authorities. The Group continues to cooperate with these authorities.\n\nIn April 2019, the DOJ announced that Zurich Life Insurance Company Ltd (ZLIC) and Zurich International Life Limited (ZILL) entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) with the DOJ, which memorializes the DOJ's decision not to prosecute these entities for any U.S. tax-related offenses in connection with legacy cross-border sales to U.S. persons. Under the terms of the NPA, ZLIC and ZILL have agreed to comply with certain specified conditions during the four-year term of the NPA.\n\nThis resolution has not had, and will not have, an adverse effect on the Group's business or consolidated financial condition.",

Fair value measurement\n\nTo measure fair value, the Group gives the highest priority to quoted and unadjusted prices in active markets. In the absence of quoted prices, fair values are calculated through valuation techniques, making the maximum use of relevant observable market data inputs. Whenever observable parameters are not available, the inputs used to derive the fair value are based on common market assumptions that market participants would use when pricing assets and liabilities. Depending on the observability of prices and inputs to valuation techniques, the Group classifies instruments measured at fair value within the following three levels (the fair value hierarchy):\n\nLevel 1 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined directly from unadjusted current quoted prices resulting from orderly transactions in active markets for identical assets/liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined using significant inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other observable market inputs.\n\nLevel 3 - includes assets and liabilities for which fair values are determined using valuation techniques with at least one significant input not being based on observable market data. This approach is used only in circumstances when there is little, if any, market activity for a certain instrument, and the Group is required to rely on third-party providers or develop internal valuation inputs based on the best information available about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.\n\nThe governance framework and oversight of the Group's standards and procedures regarding the valuation of financial instruments measured at fair value lies within the responsibility of Group Risk Management, Group Investment Management, Treasury Capital Management and Group Finance. Specialists from these departments ensure the adequacy of valuation models, approve methodologies and sources to derive model input parameters, provide oversight over the selection of third-party pricing providers, and on a semi-annual basis review the classification within the fair value hierarchy of the financial instruments in scope.\n\nThe Group makes extensive use of third-party pricing providers to determine the fair values of its available-for-sale and fair value through profit or loss financial instruments, and only in rare cases places reliance on prices that are derived from internal models. Investment accounting, operations and process functions, are independent from those responsible for buying and selling the assets, and are responsible for receiving, challenging and verifying values provided by thirdparty pricing providers to ensure that fair values are reliable, as well as ensuring compliance with applicable accounting and valuation policies. The quality control procedures used depend on the nature and complexity of the invested assets. They include variance and stale price analysis, and comparisons with fair values of similar instruments and with alternative values obtained from asset managers and brokers. Model review activities are also conducted for evaluated prices supplied by third parties to verify that their valuation processes, methodologies, models, and governance and control framework comply with applicable internal guidance, and that the allocation of those instruments within the fair value hierarchy is adequate. They include the compilation and review of relevant documentation as well meetings with third-party representatives to supplement the analysis.",

Subsequently, available-forsale financial assets, fair value through profit or loss financial assets, and derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value as of the balance sheet date. All other financial instruments are carried at amortized cost. The valuation techniques used to determine fair value measurement are described below.\n\nFair values of held-to-maturity debt securities and senior and subordinated debt are obtained from third-party pricing providers. The fair value received from these pricing providers may be based on quoted prices in an active market for identical assets, alternative pricing methods such as matrix pricing or an income approach employing discounted cash flow models. Such instruments are categorized within level 2.\n\nDiscounted cash flow models are used for mortgage loans and other loans (except for loans classified as private debt). The discount yields in these models use interest rates that reflect the return a market participant would expect to receive on instruments with similar remaining maturities, cash flow patterns, currencies, credit risk and collateral. Such instruments are categorized within level 3.\n\nDifferent valuation techniques are used to value private debt instruments, including the income approach (such as discounted cash flow models) or the market approach (such as relative value models). Where prices are obtained from an evaluated pricing service from a data vendor in which price transparency data indicates no use of significant unobservable inputs, they are categorized within Level 2. All other prices are classified to Level 3 unless factual evidence indicates that unobservable inputs are not significant to the valuation.\n\nFair values of liabilities related to investment contracts and investment contracts with DPF are determined using discounted cash flow models. Such instruments are categorized within level 3 due to the unobservability of certain inputs used in the valuation.\n\n## Fair value and carrying value of financial assets and financial liabilities",

The fair value received from these pricing providers may be based on quoted prices in an active market for similar assets, alternative pricing methods such as matrix pricing or an income approach employing discounted cash flow models. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated on the basis of information from external pricing providers or internal pricing models (for example, discounted cash flow models or other recognized valuation techniques).\n\nWhere there are active and transparent real estate markets and no significant adjustments to the observable data are required, the investment property held by the Group is classified within level 2.\n\nOver-the-counter derivative financial instruments are valued using internal models and third-party valuation services. The fair values are determined using dealer price quotations, discounted cash flow models and option pricing models, which use various inputs including current market and contractual prices for underlying instruments, time to expiry, yield curves and volatility of underlying instruments. Such instruments are classified within level 2 as the inputs used in pricing models are generally market observable or derived from market observable data.\n\nFair values of liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts are usually determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying assets backing these liabilities. Such instruments are classified within level 2.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy unit-linked current period\n\n## Fair value hierarchy unit-linked prior period",

The valuations of such instruments are obtained from quarterly net asset value information from the fund manager and annual audited financial statements provided by the issuing company. The prices are generally derived for each underlying company in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV) guidelines, using discounted cash flow (income approach) or multiple methods (market approach). The Group has only limited insight into the specific inputs used by the fund managers hence a narrative sensitivity analysis is not applicable.\n- - Non-agency MBS, ABS and collateralized loan obligations (CLO) rated below 'AAA' and private debt holdings including certain private placements that are valued by independent pricing providers or external asset managers using primarily the discounted cash flow method with significant unobservable input parameters such as asset prepayment rate, default rates and credit spreads. A significant market yield increase of the benchmark securities in isolation could result in a decreased fair value, while a significant market yield decrease could result in an increased fair value. However, a reasonable variation in the option-adjusted spread taken from a set of benchmark securities with similar characteristics has only immaterial impact on fair value.\n- - All investment properties for which there are no active and transparent real estate markets or observable data available. The valuation for majority of these investment properties - other than certain investment properties located in Switzerland - are typically performed annually by independent qualified appraisers. The parameters used for the valuations are specific to each country or region and vary significantly across different markets. External appraisals are reviewed by internal real estate valuation specialists, however, since the unobservable inputs were not developed by Zurich they are not readily available. In some cases, where external valuations are obtained at least every three years, interim valuations by internal valuation specialists are performed. Further, internal valuations are performed for certain investment properties located in Switzerland. Overall, as of December 31, 2021 around 30 percent of level 3 investment properties were covered by internal valuations. Where internal valuations are performed, significant unobservable inputs include rental income and discount rate. Significant increases/(decreases) in rental income, in isolation, would result in a significantly higher/(lower) fair value measurement. For example, a decrease in rental income by 5 percent, considered in isolation, would result in a decrease in fair value of internally valued properties by approximately USD 175 million. Significant increases/(decreases) in the discount rate, in isolation, would result in a significantly lower/(higher) fair value measurement. For example, an increase in discount rate of 10bps, considered in isolation, would result in a decrease in fair value of USD 70 million as of December 31, 2021.\n- - Options and long-dated derivative financial instruments with fair values determined using counterparty valuations or calculated using significant unobservable inputs such as historical volatilities, historical correlation, implied volatilities from the counterparty or derived using extrapolation techniques. Quantitative information on unobservable inputs are not available when counterparty pricing was used. For internally calculated fair values significant increases/ (decreases) in volatilities or correlation, would result in a significantly higher/(lower) fair value measurement, however, the overall effect on Group financial statements would not be material.\n- - Reinsurers' share of liabilities and liabilities for insurance contracts fair value option. The fair values are determined using discounted cash flow models. The discount factors used are based on derived rates for LIBOR swap forwards, spreads to U.S. Treasuries and spreads to U.S. corporate A or higher rated bond segments for financials, industrials and utilities. The liability-projected cash flows use contractual information for premiums, benefits and agent commissions, administrative expenses under third-party administrative service agreements and best estimate parameters for policy decrements. The primary unobservable inputs are the policy decrement assumptions used in projecting cash flows. These include disability claim parameters for incidence and termination (whether for recovery or death) and lapse rates. Significant increases/(decreases) in claim incidence rates and significant decreases/ (increases) in claim termination rates would result in a significantly higher/(lower) fair value measurement.\n\nFor details on Group investments sensitivities, refer to section analysis by risk type in the risk review.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy is reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether significant transfers between levels have occurred. Transfers between levels mainly arise as a result of changes in market activity and observability of the inputs to the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of certain instruments.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Group recorded a transfer of USD 66 million of non-unit-linked fair value through profit or loss equity securities out of level 1 into level 2 for mutual funds without daily published prices, and a transfer of USD 345 million of unit-linked fair value through profit or loss equity securities out of level 2 into level 1 for mutual funds with daily published prices.",

For further information on the Group's eligibility to the temporary exemption from IFRS 9, please refer to note 2.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the classification and measurement of all debt instruments will be driven by the business model in which these assets are held and by their contractual terms. The combined effect of the application of the business model and contractual cash flows characteristics determine whether the financial assets are measured at amortized cost, fair value with changes recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) or fair value through profit or loss. The business model will be assessed at the date of the initial application of IFRS 9.\n\nDebt instruments with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are solely payment of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding (SPPI) will be measured at either amortized cost or at fair value with changes recognized in OCI, unless they are managed on a fair value basis. The assessment of the features of the contractual terms is referred to as the SPPI test. Debt instruments that do not pass the SPPI test will always be measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nEquity instruments including fund investments will be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss. The Group does not intend to make use of the election to present changes in fair value of certain equity instruments that are not held for trading in OCI with no subsequent reclassification of realized gains or losses to the income statement.\n\n- - Financial assets with contractual terms that give rise to cash flows that are SPPI;\n- - Other financial assets not passing the SPPI test, as well as financial assets managed on a fair value basis for which no SPPI assessment has been performed. Financial assets that have not passed the SPPI test include equities, callable bonds with significant prepayment features, hybrid bonds with certain cash flows at the discretion of the issuer and some ABS/MBS that do not fulfill the SPPI criteria for contractually linked instruments.\n\nNet unrealized gains/(losses) on debt securities available for sale that are not SPPI amounted to USD 212 million and USD 408 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The carrying value on held-to-maturity debt securities, mortgage loans, other loans, and receivables include impairment allowances of USD 320 million and USD 340 million of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Development of allowance for impairments current period\n\n## Development of allowance for impairments prior period",

Thus, the same ECL requirements will apply to all financial assets measured at amortized cost and those measured at fair value with changes recognized in OCI.\n\nAt initial recognition of a debt instrument, a loss allowance is recognized for expected credit losses resulting from default events within the next 12 months after the reporting date (12-month ECL). Such instruments are classified as Stage 1. The Group does not originate or acquire financial assets that are credit-impaired at initial recognition.\n\nIn the event of a significant increase in credit risk (SICR) since initial recognition, IFRS 9 requires the ECL allowance to be measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (lifetime ECL). Such instruments are referred to as Stage 2.\n\n## Fair value and carrying value of financial assets split by SPPI and other financial assets current period\n\n## Fair value and carrying value of financial assets split by SPPI and other financial assets prior period",

For the remaining financial assets, the Group considers all relevant reasonable supporting information that is available without undue cost or effort when determining whether a SICR has occurred since initial recognition, or not. An increase in credit risk is assessed using a transition matrix approach that determines SICR thresholds depending on the credit rating at initial recognition and residual time to maturity of the instrument. Where necessary, the quantitative assessment is supplemented by a qualitative assessment of the issuer's credit quality. For certain less material portfolios, including residential mortgage loans, the '30 days past due' criterion is used as a primary indicator of a SICR. Where a SICR is no longer observed, the instrument transitions back to stage 1.\n\nThe Group has elected to apply the simplified approach for receivables from policyholders and other receivables that are allocated to 'Stage 2' unless individually impaired. Financial assets that have become credit-impaired are allocated to stage 3 based on similar principles as are applied under IAS 39 to determine whether credit loss has been incurred.\n\nThe tables 24.4a and 24.4b show the fair value and the carrying amount (before adjusting for any impairment in case of financial assets measured at amortized cost) of financial assets whose contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are SPPI, by impairment stages:\n\n## Table 24.4a\n\nTable 24.4b\n\n| in USD millions,   as of December 31, 2021   | Stage 1    | Stage 1         | Stage 2    | Stage 2         | Stage 3    | Stage 3         | Total      | Total           |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|\n|                                              | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying  value |\n| Available-for-sale                           |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |\n| debt securities                              | 127,179    | 127,179         | 418        | 418             | 26         | 26              | 127,622    | 127,622         |\n| Held-to-maturity debt                        |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |            |                 |\n| securities                                   | 2,358      | 1,897           | -          | -               | -          | -               | 2,358      | 1,897           |\n| Mortgage loans                               | 6,338      | 6,079           | 19         | 17              | 15         | 18              | 6,371      | 6,114           |\n| Other loans  1                               | 7,389      | 6,282           | 67         | 66              | -          | -               | 7,456      | 6,348           |\n| Receivables                                  | 3,195      | 3,255           | 10,150     | 10,283          | 17         | 124             | 13,362     | 13,662          |\n| Total financial assets                       | 146,458    | 144,692         | 10,654     | 10,784          | 58         | 168             | 157,170    | 155,643         |\n\n- 1 Do not include policyholder loans, which will come under IFRS 17 and are therefore not applicable for IFRS 9, of USD 794 million and USD 654 million for fair value and carrying value, respectively.\n\n| in USD millions,  as of December 31, 2020   | Stage 1    | Stage 1         | Stage 2    | Stage 2          | Stage 3    | Stage 3         | Total      | Total            |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|------------|-----------------|------------|------------------|\n|                                             | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying   value | Fair value | Carrying  value | Fair value | Carrying   value |\n| Available-for-sale                          |            |                 |            |                  |            |                 |            |                  |\n| debt securities                             | 143,508    | 143,508         | 560        | 560              | 38         | 38              | 144,106    | 144,106          |\n| Held-to-maturity                            |            |                 |            |                  |            |                 |            |                  |\n| debt securities                             | 2,927      | 2,216           | -          | -                | 1          | 1               | 2,928      | 2,217            |\n| Mortgage loans                              | 6,166      | 5,750           | 12         | 12               | 28         | 29              | 6,205      | 5,791            |\n| Other loans  1                              | 9,461      | 7,858           | 27         | 27               | -          | -               | 9,488      | 7,885            |\n| Receivables                                 | 2,441      | 2,505           | 10,554     | 10,718           | 42         | 145             | 13,036     | 13,368           |\n| Total financial assets                      | 164,503    | 161,838         | 11,153     | 11,316           | 108        | 213             | 175,764    | 173,367          |\n\n- 1 Do not include policyholder loans, which will come under IFRS 17 and are therefore not applicable for IFRS 9, of USD 861 million and USD 675 million for fair value and carrying value, respectively.\n\n## Financial assets (SPPI) by stages current period\n\n## Financial assets (SPPI) by stages prior period",

Ancillary services primarily include information technology, brand advertising and certain distribution related services that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts for which FGI acts as a principal in arranging for those services to the Exchanges. The finances and operations of the Farmers Exchanges are governed by independent Boards of Governors. In addition, the Group has the following relationships with the Farmers Exchanges.\n\n## a) Surplus notes issued by the Farmers Exchanges\n\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, FGI and its subsidiary held the following surplus note issued by the Farmers Exchanges.\n\nTable 26.1\n\n| in USD millions, as of December 31     |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| 3.758% surplus note, due December 2027 |    100 |    100 |\n| Total                                  |    100 |    100 |\n\nThe USD 100 million of 10-year, no call five-year note at a 3.758 percent rate that the Farmers Exchanges issued to Farmers New World Life Insurance Company remains unchanged in 2021. At the end of the five years, starting December 20, 2022, interest shall accrue at the floating annual rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 2.60 percent rate.\n\nConditions governing payment of interest and repayment of principal are outlined in the surplus note. Generally, repayment of principal and payment of interest may be made only when the issuer has an appropriate amount of surplus, and then only after approval is granted by the appropriate state insurance regulatory department in the U.S. Additionally, the approval by the issuer's governing board is needed for repayment of principal.\n\n## b) Quota share reinsurance treaty with the Farmers Exchanges\n\nThe Farmers Exchanges cede risk through a quota share reinsurance treaty, the All Lines Quota Share reinsurance agreement (All Lines agreement) with Farmers Reinsurance Company (Farmers Re Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of FGI, as well as numerous unrelated reinsurers. The All Lines agreement can be terminated after 90 days' notice by any of the parties.\n\nThe All Lines agreement provides for a cession of a quota share of the premiums earned and the ultimate net losses sustained in all lines of business written by the Farmers Exchanges.\n\n## Surplus note",

Another 25.75 percent was assumed by third parties. Effective April 1, 2021, Farmers Re Co assumed a 1.0 percent quota share. Another 32.00 percent was assumed by third parties. Effective December 31, 2021, Farmers Re Co assumed a 1.75 percent quota share. Another 29.25 percent was assumed by third parties.\n- 2   From January 1, 2020, Farmers Re Co assumed a 0.25 percent quota share. Another 25.75 percent was assumed by third parties. Effective December 31, 2020, Farmers Re Co participation in the All Lines agreement remained at 0.25 percent. Another 25.75 percent was assumed by third parties.\n- 3   Under the All Lines agreement, the Farmers Exchanges catastrophe losses are subject to a maximum of 6.75 percent of net earned premiums dependent on loss experience and recoveries at a specified rate for each year. Based on the results for 2021, the total catastrophe recoveries subject to the All Lines agreement was USD 1.5 billion. Effective December 31, 2021, the maximum will increase to 7.88 percent of net earned premiums in the year 2022.\n- 4   From 2012 to 2018, Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC) participated in the All Lines agreement. The insurance losses include prior-year loss development assumed by ZIC of USD 9 million and USD 8 million, for the years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n- 5   Under the All Lines agreement, the Farmers Exchanges receive 26.7 percent of premiums for ceding commissions, 8.1 percent of premiums for unallocated loss adjustment expenses and 5.3 percent of premiums for other expenses. Effective December 31, 2021, ceding commissions remain at 26.7 percent of premiums, the unallocated loss adjustment expenses decrease to 6.24 percent of premiums, and the other expenses decrease to 5.2 percent of premiums.\n\n## c) Farmers management fees and other related revenues\n\nFarmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FGI), wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group, are the appointed attorneys-infact of the Farmers Exchanges, which are not owned by FGI. As the attorney-in-fact, FGI is permitted by policyholders of the Farmers Exchanges to receive a management fee of up to 20 percent (up to 25 percent in the case of the Fire Insurance Exchange) of the gross premiums earned by the Farmers Exchanges. This management fee, the primary source of revenue for FGI, has an agreed upon margin cap of 7 percent which is derived from FGI gross management result divided by the gross premium earned by the Farmers Exchanges. The expected revenues and expenses are assessed monthly to determine if expected revenues will be in excess of the cap, in which case the revenue is reduced on a pro-rata basis to ensure that no revenue is recognized for the amounts exceeding the cap. For 2021 only, FGI and the Farmers Exchanges agreed to calculate the margin cap based on results excluding Farmers Workplace Solutions (FWS). In addition, FGI revenue includes reimbursement of certain ancillary service costs incurred by FGI on behalf of primarily the Farmers Exchanges that are not covered under the attorney-in-fact contracts. The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to FGI at cost in accordance with allocations that are subject to approval by the Farmers Exchanges Boards of Governors.\n\nFGI has historically charged a lower management fee than the amount allowed by policyholders. The range of fees has varied by line of business over time and from year to year. The gross earned premiums of the Farmers Exchanges were USD 23.7 billion and USD 20.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n| in USD millions, for the years ended December 31   | 2021   | 2020   | Change    |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-----------|\n| Management fees and other related revenues         | 4,265  | 3,703  | 15%       |\n| Management fees  1                                 | 3,141  | 2,749  |           |\n| Revenues for ancillary services  2                 | 1,019  | 842    |           |\n| Membership fees                                    | 59     | 59     |           |\n| Other revenues                                     | 46     | 53     |           |\n| Management and other related expenses              | 2,697  | 2,345  | 15%       |\n| Expenses for ancillary services  2                 | 1,019  | 842    |           |\n| Management and other expenses  3                   | 1,678  | 1,504  |           |\n| Gross management result                            | 1,568  | 1,357  | 15%       |\n| Managed gross earned premium margin  4             | 6.6%   | 6.8%   | (0.1 pts) |\n\n- 1 Increase in 2021 fee revenues in FWS (see note 5) as well as 2020 COVID-19 premium credits to customers at the Farmers Exchanges.\n- 2   Increase in ancillary service revenues and expenses in FWS and higher Exchanges brand advertising and distribution related service expenses.\n- 3   Increase in operating expenses in FWS.\n- 4   Decrease in 2021 margin due to lower FWS margin.\n\n## Quota share reinsurance treaty\n\n## Farmers Management Services",

Segment information\n\nThe Group pursues a customer-centric strategy, where the Property & Casualty (P&C) and Life businesses are managed on a regional basis. The Group's reportable segments have been identified on the basis of the businesses operated by the Group and how these are strategically managed to offer different products and services to specific customer groups. The Group has identified 13 reportable segments in accordance with IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' and segment information is presented accordingly as follows:\n\n- - Property & Casualty regions\n- - Life regions\n- - Farmers\n- - Group Functions and Operations\n- - Non-Core Businesses\n\nThe Group's reportable segments comprise the following:\n\n## Property & Casualty and Life regions\n\n- - Europe, Middle East & Africa\n- - North America\n- - Asia Pacific\n- - Latin America\n- - Group Reinsurance\n\nProperty & Casualty regions provide a variety of motor, home and commercial products and services for individuals as well as small and large businesses on both a local and global basis. Products are sold through multiple distribution channels including agents, brokers and bank distribution.\n\nLife regions provide a comprehensive range of life and health insurance products on both an individual and a group basis, including annuities, endowment and term insurance, unit-linked and investment-oriented products, as well as full private health, supplemental health and long-term care insurance. In addition to the agent distribution channel, certain of these products are offered via bank distribution channels.\n\nFarmers, through Farmers Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FGI), provides certain non-claims services and ancillary services to the Farmers Exchanges, which are owned by their policyholders. This segment also includes all reinsurance assumed from the Farmers Exchanges by the Group. Farmers Exchanges are prominent writers of personal and small commercial lines of business in the U.S. In addition, this segment includes the activities of Farmers Life, a writer of individual life insurance business in the U.S.\n\nGroup Functions and Operations comprise the Group's Holding and Financing, Headquarters and the new digital ventures of the Zurich Global Ventures. Certain alternative investment positions not allocated to business operating segments are included within Holding and Financing. In addition, this segment includes operational technical governance activities relating to technology, underwriting, claims, actuarial and pricing.\n\nNon-Core Businesses include insurance and reinsurance businesses that the Group does not consider core to its operations and that are therefore mostly managed to achieve a beneficial run-off. Non-Core Businesses are mainly situated in the U.S., Bermuda, and in Europe.",

It indicates the underlying performance of the Group's business units, after non-controlling interests, by eliminating the impact of financial market volatility and other non-operational variables. BOP reflects adjustments for shareholders' taxes, net capital gains/(losses) and impairments on investments (except for certain non-insurance operations included in Non-Core Businesses, investments in hedge funds as at fair value through profit or loss, certain securities held for specific economic hedging purposes and policyholders' share of investment results for the life businesses) and non-operational foreign exchange movements. Significant items arising from special circumstances, including restructuring charges, legal matters or large one-off regulatory projects outside the ordinary course of business, gains and losses on divestment of businesses, certain business combination integration costs and impairments of goodwill are also excluded from BOP.",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA Code) and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.",

It requires the use of complex formulas and computational tools that may be incorrectly configured, and for which inaccurate or incomplete input data may be used.\n\nThis is specifically the case for Property & Casualty lines of business that are considered longer-tail such as worker's compensation, general and professional liability, and other specialty lines where certain longer-term assumptions are required as part of the projection technics. These projection techniques also consider exposures to the prolonged impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic including uncertainty around claims litigation, timeliness of claims reporting, resultant impact of challenges with supply chains and inflation.\n\nAdditionally, reserves for catastrophes events which are usually of less frequency but higher severity, are more difficult to estimate and include expert judgments.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified this as a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates of the Group about the valuation of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are described in Notes 3 and 4 respectively and additional information regarding these reserves is presented in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n2",

In addition, uncertainty triggered by the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic requires an additional layer of analysis and judgment.\n\nMoreover, because of the long duration of many life insurance products, relatively small changes in key assumptions may have a significant impact on the valuation of the actuarially determined life insurance assets and liabilities. Specifically, the continued low interest rate, and the related impacted to policyholder behavior, creates a risk of accelerated amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and a strain on the sufficiency of life reserves.\n\nThe valuation of these assets and liabilities requires the use of complex formulas and the construction of models and other computational tools that may be incorrectly designed or configured, and for which inadequate assumptions and or incomplete or inaccurate input data may be used.\n\nAccordingly, we have identified this as a key audit matter.\n\nThe accounting policies and critical accounting judgments and estimates of the Group about the valuation of the actuarially determined life insurance assets and liabilities are described in Notes 3 and 4 respectively and additional information regarding these assets and liabilities is presented respectively in Notes 11 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4",

(FGI) and the Farmers Exchanges successfully closed on an acquisition of MetLife Property & Casualty business in the United States (MetLife P&C). As part of this acquisition, FGI in effect acquired MetLife P&C's management and administrative related assets and liabilities to conduct its responsibilities as attorney-in-fact of the Farmers Exchanges and the Farmers Exchanges underlying insurance businesses. FGI acquired approximately USD 2,444 million of net assets in this acquisition which led to the recognition of an additional attorney-in-fact (AIF) intangible of approximately USD 1,625 million and goodwill of USD 418 million. Accounting for this unique business combination was complex including identification of customer relationships, the valuation of identified intangibles (including the AIF), and assessing the indefinite life of the underlying AIF contracts.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the acquisition of MetLife's P&C's business in the United States as a key audit matter.\n\nFGI's acquisition is disclosed in Note 5 with additional information related to the AIF contracts in Note 14 and Relationship with Farmers Exchanges in Note 26 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe have inspected the underlying legal contracts provided to us by management and considered the substance of the FGI acquisition as basis for recognition as a business combination in the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe tested the consideration paid, and the identification and valuation of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\n\nWith the assistance of our valuation specialists where appropriate, we tested and evaluated the valuations prepared by the Group for the separately identified intangible assets (including the value assigned to the AIF contracts).\n\n## Our procedures included:\n\n- -Assessing the appropriateness of valuation methods and testing the associated models used by management.\n- -Evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions, including projected financial information, used by management based on a comparison to historical source records as well as current industry and economic data; such procedures included evaluating current or future trends in discount rates, premium growth and retention rates and management fee rates, among other assumptions.\n- -Performing sensitivity analyses to determine the impact of changes in key assumptions including the discount rate and projected fee revenue to determine potential valuation impacts.\n\nFinally, we assessed the appropriateness of accounting policies used and adequacy of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nBased on audit procedures performed, we did not find any exceptions related to the acquisition of MetLife's Property and Casualty business in the United States.\n\n6",

The other information comprises all information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd, the audited sections of the risk review on pages 187 to 214, the Remuneration report of Zurich Insurance Group Ltd and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information in the annual report and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information in the annual report and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibility of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS and the provisions of Swiss law, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located at the website of EXPERTsuisse: http://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report-for-publiccompanies.

The decrease was mainly driven by a lower dividend income from its subsidiary Zurich Insurance Company Ltd of CHF 2,600 million in 2021 compared to CHF 2,900 million in 2020, partially offset by a lower impairment of a subsidiary in 2021.\n\nShareholders' equity decreased by CHF 295 million to CHF 13,537 million as of December 31, 2021, from CHF 13,832 million as of December 31, 2020. The decrease was driven by the dividend of CHF 2,984 million paid in 2021, partially offset by net income after taxes for the year.\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting, which is to be held on April 6, 2022, to distribute a dividend of CHF 22.00 partially from the available earnings for 2021 and partially from the capital contribution reserve. The portion from the capital contribution reserve will be exempt from Swiss withholding tax.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

General information\n\nZurich Insurance Group Ltd (the Company) is a corporation domiciled in Zurich, Switzerland, and its shares are listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange. It was incorporated on April 26, 2000, and is the holding company of the Zurich Insurance Group (Group) with the principal activity of holding subsidiary companies. The Company does not employ staff, as employees work in a joint capacity for Zurich Insurance Company Ltd (ZIC).\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation\n\nThe Company presents its financial statements in accordance with Swiss law.\n\nAll amounts in these financial statements including the notes are shown in Swiss franc thousands, rounded to the nearest thousand, unless otherwise specified. All variances are calculated using the actual figures rather than the rounded amounts.\n\n## 3. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## a) Exchange rates\n\nUnless otherwise stated, assets and liabilities expressed in currencies other than Swiss francs are translated at year end exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Net unrealized exchange losses are recorded in the income statements and net unrealized exchange gains are deferred until realized.\n\n## b) Investments in subsidiaries\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are equity interests, held on a long-term basis for the purpose of the Company's business activities. Each investment in subsidiaries is valued individually and carried at its cost less adjustments for impairments.\n\n## c) Accrued income\n\nIncome is accrued for interest which is earned but not yet due for payment at the end of the reporting period.\n\n## d) Reserves for treasury shares (indirectly held via subsidiaries)\n\nReserves for treasury shares are accounted for at the acquisition costs of these shares held by the respective subsidiary.\n\n## 4. Other operating expenses\n\nOther operating expenses for the year were CHF 32.1 million compared with CHF 46.4 million in 2020. The decrease of CHF 14.3 million is mainly driven by a lower contribution in 2021 of CHF 17.0 million to the Z Zurich Foundation, whereas the contribution paid in 2020 was CHF 26.0 million. In addition, directors' fees of CHF 5.7 million and CHF 5.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, are included in this line item. Overhead expenses decreased by CHF 3.7 million to CHF 5.5 million in 2021. Furthermore, fees paid to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority of CHF 3.1 million and CHF 3.0 million are included for the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The line item also includes in 2020 stamp duty of CHF 2.2 million on the issue of new shares, whereas in 2021 no new shares were issued.\n\n## 5. Financial income\n\nFinancial income for the year 2021 consists of dividend income of CHF 2,612 million mainly received from the Company's subsidiary ZIC and interest income of CHF 134.3 million on the subordinated loan with ZIC. This interest income is recognized when ZIC declares its intention to pay a dividend to the Company.",

Furthermore, the Company has issued an unlimited guarantee in favor of the Institute of London Underwriters in relation to business transferred to Zurich Insurance plc from a Group company which no longer has insurance licenses.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any event of default that would require it to satisfy any of these guarantees or to take action under a support agreement.\n\n## 10.

The extension of the authorized share capital required the corresponding extension of the validity of the combined dilution limitations for the authorized and contingent share capital (Art. 5 bis 5 and 5 ter 1d of the Articles of Association). Since April 2020, the authorized share capital (Art. 5 bis 1 of the Articles of Association) is comprised of 44,882,400 shares and the contingent share capital for Financial Instruments (Art. 5 ter 1a of the Articles of Association; term as defined in section b) below) is comprised of 29,921,600 shares.

The Board of the Company is authorized to increase the share capital of the Company by an amount not exceeding CHF 4,488,240 by issuing up to 44,882,400 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each until April 7, 2023. An increase in partial amounts is permitted. The Board would determine the date of issue of any such new shares, the issue price, type of payment, conditions for exercising subscription rights, and the commencement of entitlement to dividends.\n\nThe Board may issue such new shares by means of a firm underwriting by a banking institution or syndicate with a subsequent offer of those shares to current shareholders. The Board may allow the expiry of subscription rights which have not been exercised, or it may place these rights as well as shares, the subscription rights of which have not been exercised, at market conditions.\n\nThe Board is further authorized to restrict or exclude the subscription rights of shareholders and to allocate them to third parties, the Company or one of its Group companies, up to a maximum of 14,960,800 shares, if the shares are to be used:\n\n- - for the take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise or of participations or for investments by the Company or one of its Group companies, or the financing including re-financing of such transactions; or\n- - for the purpose of expanding the scope of shareholders in connection with the quotation of shares on foreign stock exchanges or issuance of shares on the national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors); or\n- - for the conversion of loans, bonds, similar debt instruments, equity-linked instruments or other financial market instruments (collectively, the 'Financial Instruments') issued by the Company or one of its Group companies; or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or the rating capital position of the Company or one of its Group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nUp to April 7, 2023, the total of new shares issued from (i) authorized share capital where the subscription rights were restricted or excluded, and (ii) contingent share capital in connection with Financial Instruments where the advance subscription rights were restricted or excluded, may not exceed 14,960,800 new shares.\n\n## c) Contingent share capital (as specified in Article 5 ter of the Articles of Association) Financial Instruments\n\nThe share capital of the Company may be increased by an amount not exceeding CHF 2,992,160 by issuing of up to 29,921,600 fully paid registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each by the voluntary or mandatory exercise of conversion and/or option rights which are granted in connection with the issuance of Financial Instruments by the Company or one of its Group companies or by mandatory conversion of Financial Instruments issued by the Company or one of its Group companies, that allow for contingent mandatory conversion into shares of the Company, or by exercising option rights which are granted to the shareholders. The subscription rights are excluded. The then-current owners of the Financial Instruments shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares. The conversion and/or option conditions are to be determined by the Board.\n\nThe Board is authorized, when issuing Financial Instruments to restrict or exclude the advance subscription rights in cases where they are issued:\n\n- - for the financing including re-financing of a take-over of an enterprise, of parts of an enterprise, or of participations or of investments by the Company or one of its Group companies; or\n- - on national or international capital markets (including private placements to one or more selected investors); or\n- - for the improvement of the regulatory and/or the rating capital position of the Company or one of its Group companies in a fast and expeditious manner.\n\nIf the advance subscription rights are restricted or excluded by a resolution of the Board, the following applies: the Financial Instruments are to be issued at prevailing market conditions (including standard dilution protection clauses in accordance with market practice) and the setting of the conversion or issue price of the new shares must take due account of the stock market price of the shares and/or comparable instruments priced by the market at the time of issue or time of conversion.",

This responsibility includes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies and making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity's preparation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control system. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 comply with Swiss law and the company's articles of association.",

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For the matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibility section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matter below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.\n\n## Recoverability of investments in subsidiaries\n\n## Area of focus\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe consider the investments in subsidiaries to be a key audit matter not only due to the judgment involved but also based on the magnitude of CHF 11.3 billion, which makes up 83% of the company's total assets.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less necessary impairments and valued on an individual basis.\n\nThe determination whether an impairment is required includes assumptions about the profitability of the underlying business and growth, which involves management's judgment. In addition, there is increased uncertainty surrounding the projections of future income of certain businesses due to COVID-19.\n\nRefer to Note 3, para b) ('Summary of significant accounting policies') and Note 8 ('Investments in subsidiaries') to the 2021 financial statements.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of management's process and controls and assessed the design effectiveness of selected key controls over the recoverability of the carrying value of investments in subsidiaries.\n\nIn addition, we performed the following substantive testing procedures in order to address the areas of focus above:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the company's impairment testing methodology.\n- \uf0b7 Testing the mathematical accuracy of management's calculation.\n- \uf0b7 Testing the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the impairment assessment. We have assessed the impact of COVID-19 on future income.\n- \uf0b7 Re-performing management's impairment test on the carrying value of all investments in subsidiaries and challenged the impairment decisions taken.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nBased on audit procedures performed, we did not identify any exceptions with regards to the recoverability of investments in subsidiaries.",

It indicates the underlying performance, after non-controlling interests, by eliminating the impact of financial market volatility and other non-operational variables. BOP reflects adjustments for shareholders' taxes, net capital gains/(losses) and impairments on investments (except for certain noninsurance operations included in Non-Core Businesses, investments in hedge funds as at fair value through profit or loss, certain securities held for specific economic hedging purposes and policyholders' share of investment results for the life businesses) and non-operational foreign exchange movements. Significant items arising from special circumstances, including restructuring charges, legal matters or large one-off regulatory projects outside the ordinary course of business, gains and losses on divestment of businesses, certain business combination integration costs and impairments of goodwill are also excluded from BOP. Business operating profit before interest, depreciation and amortization (BOPBIDA) excludes interest expense on debt, depreciation and impairments of property and equipment and amortization and impairments of intangible assets. BOPBIDA includes amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred origination costs and distribution agreements. Please refer to the 'consolidated financial statements, Note 27. Segment information, Table 27.4' for further information.\n\n## Business operating profit (after-tax) return on shareholders' equity (BOPAT ROE)\n\nindicates the level of BOP relative to resources provided by shareholders. It is calculated as BOP, annualized on a linear basis and adjusted for taxes, divided by the average value of shareholders' equity, adjusted for net unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges, using the value at the beginning and end of each quarter within the period. The average shareholders' equity for each quarter is then added together and divided by the number of quarters. If the dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting within the first ten working days in April, then the dividend is deducted from the second quarter opening shareholders' equity. Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/ROE, EPS and BVPS' for further information.\n\n## Cash remittances\n\nis the net extraction of capital from each of the business units (P&C, Life, Farmers and Non-Core Business) to Group Functions & Operations (GF&O) and after all central costs in GF&O. Cash remittances are typically extracted from subsidiaries by way of dividends, capital reductions, repayment of intragroup debt and reinsurance profits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Investments\n\nTotal investments in the consolidated balance sheets include Group investments and investments for unit-linked contracts. Group investments are those for which the Group bears part or all of the investment risk. They also include investments related to investment contracts with discretionary participation features. Average invested assets include investment cash, but exclude cash collateral received for securities lending. The Group manages its diversified investment portfolio to optimize benefits for both shareholders and policyholders while ensuring compliance with local regulatory and business requirements under the guidance of the Group's Asset/Liability Management and Investment Committee. Investments for unit-linked contracts include investments where the policyholder bears the investment risk, and are held for liabilities related to unit-linked investment contracts and reserves for unit-linked contracts. They are managed in accordance with the investment objectives of each unit-linked fund. The investment result for unit-linked products is passed to policyholders through a charge to policyholder dividends and participation in profits.\n\n## Like-for-like\n\nis the change in the underlying metric over a period of time and after removing the impact of foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Return on shareholders' equity (ROE)\n\nis a measure that indicates the level of profit or loss relative to resources provided by shareholders. It is calculated as net income after taxes attributable to shareholders, annualized on a linear basis, divided by the average value of shareholders' equity, adjusted for net unrealized gains/(losses) on available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges, using the value at the beginning and end of each quarter within the period. The average shareholders' equity for each quarter is then added together and divided by the number of quarters. If the dividend is approved at the Annual General Meeting within the first ten working days in April, then the dividend is deducted from the second quarter opening shareholders' equity.

Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/P&C by segment & customer units' for further information.\n\n## Total net technical expenses\n\nincludes underwriting and policy acquisition costs, as well as the technical elements of administrative and other operating expenses, amortization of intangible assets, interest credited to policyholders and other interest, and other income. Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/P&C by segment & customer units' for further information.\n\n## Combined ratio\n\nis a measure that indicates the level of claims and net technical expenses during the period, relative to net earned premiums and policy fees. It is calculated as the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/P&C by segment & customer units' for further information.\n\n## Loss ratio\n\nis a measure that indicates the level of claims during the period relative to net earned premiums and policy fees. It is calculated as insurance benefits and losses net, which include incurred claims, both paid and reserved, and claims handling costs, divided by net earned premiums and policy fees. Please refer to the 'supplementary information (unaudited)/P&C by segment & customer units' for further information.\n\n## Expense ratio\n\nis a measure that indicates the level of technical expenses during the period relative to net earned premiums and policy fees. It is calculated as the sum of net technical expenses and policyholder dividends and participation in profits, divided by net earned premiums and policy fees. Please refer to the 'Supplementary information (unaudited)/P&C by segment & customer units' for further information.\n\n## Net non-technical result\n\nincludes expenses or income not directly linked to insurance operating performance, such as gains/losses on foreign currency translation and interest expense on debt.

In particular, asset and liability cash flows are valued using risk discount rates consistent with those applied to similar cash flows in the capital markets. Options and guarantees are valued using market consistent models calibrated to observable market prices.\n\n## Insurance deposits\n\nare deposits, similar to customer account balances, not recorded as revenues. However, the fees charged on insurance deposits are recorded as revenue within gross written premiums and policy fees. These deposits arise from investment contracts and insurance contracts that are accounted for under deposit accounting. They represent the pure savings part, which is invested.\n\n## New business annual premium equivalent (APE)\n\nis a sales index that reflects the volume of life new business sales during the period. APE is calculated as the value of new annual premiums plus 10 percent of new single premiums sold in the period and is stated before the effect of non-controlling interests. Present value of new business premiums (PVNBP) is calculated as the present value of new business premiums discounted at the risk-free rate, before the effect of non-controlling interests.\n\n## New business margin (NBM)\n\nis a measure that reflects the profitability of new business and is calculated as the new business value divided by APE after the effect of non-controlling interests.\n\n## New business value (NBV), after tax\n\nis a measure that reflects the value added by new business written during the period, including allowances for frictional costs, time value of options and guarantees, and the cost of non-market risk, and is valued at the point of sale. It is calculated as the present value of the projected after-tax profit from life insurance contracts sold during the period using a valuation methodology consistent with the EV principles, after the effect of non-controlling interests.",
