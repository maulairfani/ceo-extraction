We acquired the highquality Loma Larga project in Ecuador, which is a great fit with the core strengths and unique capabilities where DPM has a proven track record of unlocking value.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverall, 2021 was another very strong year for Dundee Precious Metals as we delivered record annual gold production for the third consecutive year and generated record financial results. We strengthened our asset portfolio by adding the high-quality Loma Larga development project in Ecuador, advancing the Timok project to a feasibility study and continuing to advance our exploration activities at Chelopech, Ada Tepe and Timok. We also continue to deliver on our ESG priorities and seek further opportunities to achieve our strategic objective of generating a net positive impact from our operations.\n\n## Review of 2021 Performance\n\nIn 2021, we delivered strong operating performance, producing a record 309,965 gold ounces and 35 million pounds of copper, and continued to manage our costs, resulting in an industry-leading all-in sustaining cost of $657 per ounce of gold sold. This translated into record financial results, including free cash flow generation of $252 million and adjusted net earnings of $202 million. Notably, we delivered these results while achieving an impressive health and safety record, including 3.5 million hours without a lost time injury at our Bulgarian operations and a 41% year-over-year reduction in our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate.\n\nDuring the year, we made significant steps towards building for our future. We acquired the high-quality Loma Larga project in Ecuador, which is a great fit with the core strengths and unique capabilities where DPM has a proven track record of unlocking value. Following the positive results of the pre-feasibility study ('PFS'), we advanced the Timok project in Serbia to a feasibility study ('FS'), which is now nearing completion. We also added Mineral Reserves at Chelopech, continuing our track record of extending mine life, and advanced our exploration activities at Chelopech, Ada Tepe and Timok.\n\n## ADA TEPE: DRIVING GROWTH IN PRODUCTION AND CASH FLOW\n\nSince commencing operations in 2019, Ada Tepe has continually delivered impressive performance, quarter after quarter. In 2021, Ada Tepe produced 132,964 ounces of gold and achieved a new record for quarterly performance, producing 33,774/uni00A0ounces of gold in the fourth quarter of the year.\n\nAs we look to the year ahead, we are assessing the results of the accelerated grade control drilling program at Ada Tepe, which was completed in January 2022. We are in the process of incorporating these results into an optimized mine plan, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nWe are continuing our exploration efforts around Ada Tepe, with 20,000 metres of drilling planned in 2022 which will be focused on near-mine target delineation and drilling within the mine concession and surrounding Krumovitsa exploration licence, as well as scout and target delineation on regional licences, including Chiirite, where several new vein targets were identified in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## CHELOPECH: HIGH-QUALITY CORNERSTONE ASSET\n\nChelopech continued its track record of consistent performance, producing 177,001 ounces of gold and 35 million pounds of copper.\n\nWe continue to focus on extending the mine life through our in-mine and brownfields exploration programs. In November 2021, we received approval for a 1-year extension to the Sveta Petka exploration licence, which surrounds the Chelopech mine. This allows us to move forward with the Commercial Discovery phase of work. We commenced a 50,000-metre drilling campaign, which is primarily focused on Sveta Petka, during the first quarter of 2022.\n\nChelopech has a robust mine life that extends to 2030, based on current Mineral Reserve estimates, and a strong Mineral Resource base. Combined with our demonstrated track record of converting Mineral Resources into Mineral reserves and our inmine and growing brownfield exploration programs, there is strong potential to continue extending mine life at Chelopech.\n\n## TSUMEB: FOCUSED ON OPERATIONAL STABILITY, EFFICIENCIES AND COST REDUCTION\n\nIn 2021, the Tsumeb smelter processed approximately 189,705 tonnes of complex concentrate. This was slightly below our revised guidance for the year, as a result of the unplanned maintenance downtime during the second half of the year.\n\nDespite lower-than-expected throughput, cash cost performance was in-line with guidance. As we look to the year ahead, we are expecting cash cost per tonne to improve at the smelter, relative to 2021, as a result of increased throughput as well as estimated cost savings from a comprehensive initiative directed at optimizing the cost structure of the smelter.\n\n## Disciplined Growth\n\n## LOMA LARGA: LOW-COST FUTURE GROWTH\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we completed the acquisition of INV Metals Inc., which added the Loma Larga project to our development portfolio. Loma Larga is a high-quality, advanced stage gold project with the potential to generate meaningful production growth and significant value for our stakeholders.\n\nLoma Larga has the potential to produce approximately 200,000 ounces of gold annually (average for the first five years) at a low all-in sustaining cost which would continue to support DPM's peer-leading cost profile. With similar\n\ngeology, mining method and processing flowsheet to our Chelopech underground mine in Bulgaria, which DPM has developed into a world-class, modern operation, Loma Larga leverages DPM's proven operating strengths. As well, the project will benefit from additional engagement with local and national stakeholders, as was the case in the initial stages of development of Ada Tepe, which is now a highly successful DPM operation that enjoys strong support from local communities.\n\nOur approach to advancing Loma Larga will benefit from our firm commitment to the highest standards for engagement with local communities and environmental stewardship, in addition to our development and operating experience to unlock the significant potential of the project.\n\nSince completing the acquisition in the third quarter of 2021, we have focused on integration, stakeholder engagement and permitting activities, as well as a review and update of the technical studies.\n\nWe are targeting to complete a revised feasibility study in 2022 and are progressing discussions with the government of Ecuador on the investor protection agreement, which we plan to complete prior to making any significant capital commitments on the project.\n\nBased on our revised permitting schedule, we are targeting receipt of major environmental permits towards the end of 2022, which we expect to be followed by finalization of an exploitation agreement with the government and receipt of construction permits.\n\nIn 2021, Dundee Precious Metals delivered record annual gold production for the third consecutive year and generated record financial results. We also continue to deliver on our ESG priorities and seek further opportunities to achieve our strategic objective of generating a net positive impact from our operations.\n\nDAVID RAE President and CEO\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In February 2021, we released the positive results of the PFS, which focused on the development of the oxide and transitional portions of the project, and announced that the project is advancing to a FS.\n\nWe discovered Timok in 2008, and while the team has worked to advance the project, we have developed strong relationships within the local communities and government. With additional optimization opportunities to enhance the project, and very encouraging exploration results, we believe Timok represents an attractive opportunity that has the potential to provide organic growth in a region where we have had a presence for many years.\n\n## Growing Financial Strength\n\nIn 2021, we generated $252 million of free cash flow and significantly strengthened our balance sheet, ending the year with $334 million of cash, no debt, and approximately $48 million of investments, comprised primarily of our 8.9% interest in Sabina Gold and Silver Corp. and 8.4% interest in Velocity Minerals Ltd.\n\nWe have also demonstrated a strong track record of deploying our capital in a disciplined manner that balances our desire to reinvest in growing and optimizing the business with our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. In addition to enhancing our portfolio with the high-quality Loma/uni00A0Larga project, we have continued to pay a quarterly dividend since 2020, and in 2021, repurchased approximately 1.7 million common shares under our Normal Course Issuer Bid.\n\nIn aggregate, we returned approximately $33 million or 13% of our free cash flow back to our shareholders in 2021. In February 2022, we announced that we are further increasing our quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.04 per share, reflecting our positive outlook for the business.\n\n## Industry-Leading ESG\n\nWe are focused on generating value for all of our stakeholders through our strong ESG performance. ESG is fundamental to our culture and is integrated into all levels of our organization. We have long understood the strategic importance of maintaining our social license, and have seen first-hand how excelling in this important area is a competitive advantage that can unlock additional value and lead to superior long-term returns.\n\nDuring 2021, we made progress on a number of social and environmental initiatives, including work to define DPM's approach to climate change. We are always looking for ways to reduce the impact of our operations, and we are very proud of what we have achieved at Chelopech, which has one of the lowest greenhouse gas emission intensity rates among gold mines in the world. However, we also recognize the global importance of climate change and our responsibility to further contributing to mitigating its impacts. We previously assessed the risks and opportunities of climate change on DPM's business, which were summarized in our inaugural climate change report, published at the end of 2020. In 2021, we continued to work towards defining our greenhouse gas targets and commitments and look forward to sharing our commitments publicly in 2022.\n\nWe are a leader in ESG, as demonstrated by our positive ratings from a growing number of ESG rating agencies. In 2021, DPM scored in the 91st percentile for ESG performance among companies in the metals and mining industry in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment, which is recognized by investors as a high-quality ESG rating agency. This result led to our inclusion in the 2022 S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook, which features companies that scored in the top 15% of their industry. As well, we received a rating of 'A' by MSCI ESG Research LLC, a well-respected independent ESG rating agency.\n\nWhile we are proud of being recognized for our strong performance, we are constantly seeking opportunities to improve, and to achieve our strategic objective of generating a net positive impact from our operations.",

To date, as a result of the proactive actions being taken within the regions in which we operate and by personnel at each of our sites, the Company has not experienced any material disruptions to its operations as a result of COVID-19. The Company's Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines in Bulgaria continue to operate at full capacity and have not experienced any disruptions to their operations.\n\nAs previously reported, the Tsumeb smelter in Namibia curtailed its operations by shutting down ancillary plants for 30 days in April 2020 in response to a government directive to the natural resources sector aimed at limiting staffing levels. Full operations resumed in May 2020 with ongoing management of the number of employees and contractors working at site and continued observance of the COVID-19 controls that have been established across all sites. Tsumeb's maintenance shutdown, which was originally planned for 30 days in the first quarter of 2021, was extended to 45 days in part as a result of COVID-19 related safety protocols, travel restrictions and the use of remote commissioning support.\n\nThe Company continues to closely assess and monitor the COVID-19 situation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company is continuing with a number of measures to mitigate the associated risks, including procedures and contingency plans that were established at each operating location, which are directed  at safeguarding  employees,  managing  potential  supply  chain  disruptions  and  maintaining production at each of its operations. These precautionary steps include, but are not limited to, the use of personal protective equipment, workplace and social distancing practices, remote and rotational working options, health hygiene protocols, elimination of non-essential business travel and site access, widespread workforce education on COVID-19 and the benefits of getting vaccinated as well as the support for vaccination programs in the Company's areas of operations.\n\nManagement of the situation is being overseen by an experienced cross-functional team that includes members of senior management and leaders at each of the Company's operations.

        "page_content": "engage with local communities and authorities in Bulgaria, Namibia, Serbia and Ecuador as they respond to the challenges of the pandemic. To date, the Company has contributed approximately $1.2 million to support numerous COVID-19 related initiatives to benefit local communities. This financial support has primarily focused on local hospitals to provide additional medical facilities, supplies, transportation and protective equipment.\n\nThe Company has experienced several positive cases of COVID-19 within its workforce. Positive cases are being effectively managed with testing, contact tracing and isolation measures and, to date, the vast majority of employees have recovered with the remaining employees isolating offsite in accordance with the  Company's  procedures.  Given  management  protocols  in  effect,  the  impact  on  the  Company's operations has been minimal. Multiple COVID-19 variants have emerged and are circulating globally. These variants spread more easily and quickly than the original virus resulting in a surge in the number of cases, including in regions in which the Company operates.\n\nCertain vaccines have received regulatory approval in the countries in which the Company operates, and the respective governments are progressing vaccination of their populations although vaccination rates remain low in some jurisdictions. The timing and speed of vaccination in each jurisdiction is uncertain at this time and depends on several factors including supply of the vaccines and increasing the levels of vaccine acceptance.\n\nAt present, there do not appear to be any imminent COVID-19 related circumstances that are expected to disrupt the Company's operations, however, given the highly uncertain and evolving nature of this situation, the Company is not able to reliably estimate the likelihood, timing, duration, severity and scope of this pandemic and the potential impact it could have on the Company's operating and financial results. There is no assurance that the pandemic will not have a material adverse impact on the future results of the Company.\n\n## Summary of significant operational and financial highlights\n\nFinancial results from operations in 2021 reflected the impact of stronger realized metal prices and strong production at Chelopech and Ada Tepe.\n\n## Consolidated\n\n- x Record gold production of 309,965 ounces, up 4% relative to 2020, and at the upper end of 2021 guidance.\n- x Sold a record 279,051 ounces of payable gold and 32.7 million pounds of payable copper, and smelted 189,705 tonnes of complex concentrate, generating revenue of $641.4 million, up 5% relative to 2020. Payable gold sold was at the upper end of 2021 guidance and payable copper sold was in line with 2021 guidance.

This measure is used by management and investors to assess the extent of discretionary capital spending being undertaken by the Company each period.\n- Sustaining capital expenditures are generally defined as expenditures that support the ongoing operation of the asset or business without any associated increase in capacity, life of assets or future earnings. This measure is used by management and investors to assess the extent of non-discretionary capital spending being incurred by the Company each period.\n\n## Commodity prices and foreign exchange rates\n\nCommodity prices are one of the principal determinants of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as an entity reporting in U.S. dollars with operations in several countries, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Bulgarian lev, which is pegged to the Euro, the Namibian dollar, which is pegged to the South African rand ('ZAR') on a 1:1 basis, and the Canadian dollar ('Cdn$') can also impact the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe following table summarizes the average trading price for gold and copper based on the London Bullion Market Association ('LBMA') for gold and the London Metal Exchange ('LME') for copper (Grade A) for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and highlights the overall year over year change in commodity prices.\n\n| Metal Prices (Market Average)    | Three Months   | Three Months   |        | Twelve Months   | Twelve Months   |        |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|\n| Ended December 31,               | 2021           | 2020           | Change | 2021            | 2020            | Change |\n| LBMA gold  ($/ounce)             | 1,795          | 1,874          | (4%)   | 1,800           | 1,770           | 2%     |\n| LME settlement copper  ($/pound) | 4.40           | 3.25           | 35%    | 4.22            | 2.80            | 51%    |\n\nThe average realized gold price for the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 of $1,780 per ounce and $1,790 per ounce, respectively, was 2% lower and 5% higher than the corresponding periods in 2020. These changes reflect year over year market movements as well as the impact of 2020 gold deliveries that were made in respect of Ada Tepe's prepaid forward gold sales arrangement, which was fully satisfied with the final delivery in December 2020.\n\nThe average realized copper price for the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 of $3.77 per pound and $3.82 per pound, respectively, was 16% and 39% higher than the corresponding periods in 2020. Realized prices in 2021 and the increases over 2020 were lower than those based on market as a result of substantially all payable copper sold during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 being hedged.\n\nThe following table sets out the average foreign exchange rates for the principal currencies impacting the Company and highlights the overall year over year strengthening (weakening) of the U.S. dollar relative to these currencies.\n\n| Foreign Exchange Rates   | Three Months   | Three Months   |        | Twelve Months   | Twelve Months   |        |\n|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|\n| (Market Average)         |                |                |        |                 |                 |        |\n| Ended December 31,       | 2021           | 2020           | Change | 2021            | 2020            | Change |\n| US$/Cdn$                 | 1.2597         | 1.3029         | (3%)   | 1.2535          | 1.3412          | (7%)   |\n| Euro/US$                 | 1.1437         | 1.1927         | 4%     | 1.1833          | 1.1409          | (4%)   |\n| US$/ZAR                  | 15.4203        | 15.6114        | (1%)   | 14.7756         | 16.4508         | (10%)  |\n\nIn 2021, approximately 91% Namibian dollar operating expenses were hedged with option contracts providing a weighted average floor price of 15.69 and a weighted average ceiling price of 18.38.

In December 2020, the Company completed its final delivery of gold under this arrangement.\n\nFor a detailed discussion on the factors affecting cash provided from operating activities, refer to the 'Liquidity and Capital Resources' section contained in this MD&A.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2021 of $65.8 million was $26.5 million higher than the corresponding period in 2020 and higher than the $7.7 million increase in earnings before taxes, due primarily to the fulfillment of the prepaid forward gold sales agreement at Ada Tepe in December 2020 and lower income taxes paid.\n\nFree cash flow in 2021 of $252.4 million was $41.0 million higher than 2020 and higher than the $11.5 million increase in earnings before income taxes, due primarily to the fulfillment of the prepaid forward gold sales agreement at Ada Tepe in December 2020, partially offset by higher cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 were $19.7 million and $69.6 million, respectively, compared to $15.7 million and $49.3 million in the corresponding periods in 2020.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 were $12.3 million and $52.5 million, respectively, compared to $12.3 million and $40.8 million in the corresponding periods in 2020. The year-over-year increase was due primarily to the planned maintenance shutdown at Tsumeb in the first quarter of 2021 and accelerated grade control drilling at Ada Tepe initiated in September 2020. Growth capital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 were $7.4 million and $17.1 million, respectively, compared to $3.4 million and $8.5 million in the corresponding periods in 2020 due primarily to work related to the development of the Timok and Loma Larga gold projects.",

Cash cost per tonne of ore processed at Chelopech and Ada Tepe were within the updated guidance, which were revised as a result of recent price increases for electricity and direct materials.\n\nComplex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb was slightly below the updated guidance, which was revised as a result of the longer than anticipated shutdown during the first quarter of 2021, as well as unplanned maintenance downtime due to water leaks in the off-gas system during the second half of 2021. Cash cost per tonne of concentrate smelted in 2021 was within 2021 guidance due primarily to higher by-product credits reflecting higher sulphuric acid prices, partially offset by the fixed cost nature of the facility and the impact of lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted, combined with a stronger ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold in 2021 of $657 was within the original guidance of $625 to $695 due primarily to higher by-product credits reflecting higher realized copper prices, higher volumes of gold sold and lower cash outlays for sustaining capital expenditures, partially offset by higher local currency operating expenses reflecting higher prices for electricity and direct materials and higher labour costs in Bulgaria, and higher treatment charges at Chelopech.",

        "page_content": "DPM continues to focus on increasing the profitability of its business by optimizing existing operating assets, which are expected to maintain high levels of gold production as highlighted in the 2022 to 2024 outlook and supplemental detailed 2022 guidance below.\n\n## 2022 to 2024 Outlook\n\nThe outlook is based on historical performance and experience at DPM's operations and is consistent with the production schedules outlined in the technical report for Chelopech entitled 'NI 43-101 Technical Report - Mineral Resource and Reserve Update, Chelopech Mine, Chelopech, Bulgaria' dated March 30, 2020 (the 'Chelopech Technical Report'), and the technical report for Ada Tepe entitled 'NI 43-101 Technical Report - Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource Update for the Ada Tepe Mine, Krumovgrad, Bulgaria' dated November 23, 2020 (the 'Ada Tepe Technical Report'). For 2023 and 2024, all production and cost estimates do not yet incorporate operating performance improvements in respect of mine and smelter throughput and potential improvements to mine grades and recoveries. The Chelopech  Technical Report and the Ada Tepe Technical Report have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are posted on the Company's website (www.dundeeprecious.com). The following outook is forward looking and based on certain estimates and assumptions which involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may vary materially from management's expectations. See the 'Cautionary Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements' and 'Risks and Uncertainties' sections later in this MD&A for further information.\n\nHighlights of the three-year outlook include:\n\n- x Continued solid gold production : Over the next three years, gold production is expected to average approximately 270,000 ounces per year based on current mine plans. Gold production is expected to range between 250,000 and 290,000 ounces in 2022, between 265,000 and 310,000 ounces in 2023, and between 230,000 and 265,000 ounces in 2024.\n- x Stable copper production : Copper production between 2022 and 2024 is expected to average approximately 35 million pounds per year, based on current mine plans.\n- x Attractive all-in sustaining cost: All-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold is expected to range between $750 and $890 in 2022, between $630 and $760 in 2023, and between $720 and $850 in 2024. The year over year variations in all-in sustaining cost reflect expected gold grades in concentrate produced and volumes of gold-copper concentrate delivered to third party smelters, with an overall increase reflecting higher ocean freight and higher prices for electricity and direct materials.\n- x Stable smelter performance: Annual estimates for complex concentrate smelted vary due to the timing of scheduled furnace maintenance shutdowns, with the next shutdown scheduled to occur during the second quarter of 2022. Based on an expected 18-month operating cycle, complex concentrate smelted is expected to be between 210,000 and 240,000 tonnes in each of 2022 and 2023, and between 220,000 and 250,000 tonnes in 2024. Cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted is expected to be between $380 and $460 in 2022, between $350 and $450 in 2023, and between $340 and $440 in 2024, reflecting the impact of increased throughput, as well as estimated cost savings from a comprehensive initiative directed at optimizing the cost structure of the smelter.\n- x Sustaining capital expenditures: Sustaining capital expenditures vary due to the timing of certain projects and are expected to be between $57 million and $66 million for 2022, between $46 million and $54 million for 2023, and between $42 million and $49 million for 2024.",

        "page_content": "concentrate sold and volumes of complex concentrate smelted are expected to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the areas being mined, the timing of concentrate deliveries and planned outages, including furnace maintenance shutdowns at Tsumeb. The rate of capital expenditures is also expected to vary from quarter to quarter based on the schedule for, and execution of, each capital project.\n\nAdditional detail on the Company's three-year outlook is set out below:\n\n## Chelopech\n\nGold contained in concentrate produced in 2022 is expected to be between 169,000 and 191,000 ounces, which has improved relative to the previous 2022 outlook of 145,000 to 165,000 ounces as a result of higher recoveries. Gold contained in concentrate produced is expected to range between 150,000 and 170,000 ounces in 2023, and between 161,000 and 182,000 ounces in 2024.\n\nCopper contained in concentrate produced in 2022 is expected to be between 32 and 37 million pounds declining slightly from the previous 2022 outlook of 32 to 39 million pounds reflecting mining in lower grade zones. Copper contained in concentrate produced is expected to be between 32 and 39 million pounds in 2023, and between 30 and 35 million pounds in 2024.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed is expected to be between $48 and $53 in 2022 primarily reflecting recent price increases for electricity and direct materials.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be between $24 million and $27 million, including approximately $6 million for the next phase of work to continue the upgrade of Chelopech's tailings management  facility, a  portion  of  which  represents  2021  capital  deferred  to  2022. Growth  capital expenditures related to resource development drilling and margin improvement projects are expected to be between $2 million and $4 million in 2022. Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to trend lower in 2023, ranging between $20 million and $22 million, including approximately $4 million to complete the upgrade of the tailings management facility. In 2024, sustaining capital expenditures are expected to decline further to between $16 million and $17 million.\n\n## Ada Tepe\n\nGold contained in concentrate produced in 2022 is expected to be between 81,000 and 99,000 ounces, which is approximately 14% below the previous 2022 outlook of 95,000 to 115,000 ounces reflecting the results  from  the  accelerated  grade  control  drilling  program conducted  in  2021.  Gold  contained  in concentrate produced is expected to be between 115,000 and 140,000 ounces in 2023, and between 69,000 and 83,000 ounces in 2024, which will be reviewed and updated, if necessary, following the completion of the assessment of  the accelerated grade control drilling program in the third quarter of 2022.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed is expected to be between $54 and $60 in 2022 primarily reflecting recent price increases for electricity and direct materials.\n\nSustaining capital expenditures in 2022 are expected to be between $11 million and $13 million, up relative to previous 2022 outlook, including approximately $7 million related to Ada Tepe's integrated waste management facility. Sustaining capital expenditures are expected to decline to between $9 million and $10 million in 2023 and remain at this level in 2024.\n\n## Tsumeb\n\nComplex concentrate smelted is expected to be between 210,000 and 240,000 tonnes in each of 2022 and 2023, down from the previous 2022 outlook of 220,000 to 250,000 tonnes and 2023 outlook of 230,000 to 265,000 tonnes, reflecting scheduled furnace maintenance shutdowns in the second quarter of 2022 and at the end of 2023 based on an expected 18-month operating cycle, as well as the recent operating performance at the smelter. In 2024, complex concentrate smelted is expected to be between 220,000 and 250,000 tonnes reflecting no scheduled furnace maintenance shutdown in 2024. Over 90% of concentrate feed is currently contracted through to the end of 2023, with the remaining feed in 2022 and 2023 and additional feed thereafter expected to be contracted in the normal course.\n\nCash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted is expected to range between $380 and $460 in 2022, between $350 and $450 in 2023, and between $340 and $440 in 2024, reflecting the impact of increased throughput, as well as estimated cost savings from a comprehensive initiative directed at optimizing the cost structure of the smelter.",

The cost associated with these activities in 2022 is expected to be between $21 million and $31 million and is included in growth capital expenditures.\n\n## Timok gold project\n\nThe Company is progressing FS work in respect of the Timok gold project which is expected to cost between $8 million and $12 million in 2022 and is included in growth capital expenditures.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation expenditures\n\nExpenditures related to exploration in 2022 are expected to be between $16 million and $19 million and will be  directed  primarily  toward  a  60,000  metre  brownfield  drilling  program  on  mine  concessions  and exploration licences at, or around, the Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines in Bulgaria and the Timok project in Serbia.\n\nAt Chelopech, exploration efforts will concentrate on near mine exploration drilling related to the Sveta Petka commercial discovery application, with 35,000 metres of drilling planned in 2022.\n\nAt Ada Tepe, where 20,000 metres of drilling is planned, almost half of which is dedicated to near-mine target delineation and drilling within the mining concession and the surrounding Krumovitza exploration licence. The rest of the budget will be allocated to scout and target delineation drilling on the other regional licences in the Krumovgrad district, with a focus on the Chiriite exploration licence, where several new vein targets were identified in 2021.\n\nAt Timok, studies to progress Bigar Hill to a mining concession are underway, with exploration activities focusing on the nearby Umka exploration licence as well as other early-stage licences in Serbia.\n\nAt Loma Larga, all geological data will be integrated and reviewed to develop a drilling program focused on extending the  existing  mineral  resources,  which  are  open  in  all  directions.  The  Tierras  Coloradas concessions will be transferred to an advanced exploration phase, and a 2,000 metre scout drilling program will be completed in 2022.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nTo date, with the proactive measures taken by each of the Company's operations, the COVID-19 pandemic has had minimal impact on DPM's production. DPM is closely monitoring the COVID-19 situation and has put measures in place to safeguard the health of its workforce and support the continuity of its operations. Given the highly uncertain and evolving nature of this situation, the Company is not able to reliably estimate the likelihood, timing, duration, severity and scope of this pandemic and the potential impact it could have on the Company's future operating and financial results. As a result, the three-year outlook provided is predicated on the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to be effectively managed with minimal impact on DPM's operations.\n\nFor additional details on COVID-19, including the related risks faced by the Company, refer to the 'Overview - Operational and Financial Highlights' and 'Risk and Uncertainties' sections contained in this MD&A.",

Gold-copper concentrate produced during 2021 of 109,915 tonnes was 4% higher than 2020 due primarily to higher copper recoveries, partially offset by lower copper grades.\n\nPyrite concentrate produced during the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 of 70,900 tonnes and 269,084 tonnes, respectively, was 38% and 3% higher than the corresponding periods in 2020 due primarily to higher gold recoveries.\n\nIn the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021, gold contained in gold-copper and pyrite concentrate produced was 49,050 ounces and 177,001 ounces, respectively, compared to 38,020 ounces and 179,562 ounces in the corresponding periods in 2020.\n\nRelative to the fourth quarter of 2020, gold contained in gold-copper concentrate produced in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased by 19% to 33,149 ounces and gold contained in pyrite concentrate produced increased by 56% to 15,901 ounces. These increases were due primarily to higher gold recoveries and mining in higher grade zones. Relative to 2020, gold contained in gold-copper concentrate produced in 2021 decreased by 6% to 116,433 ounces due primarily to mining in lower grade zones in the third quarter of 2021, and gold contained in pyrite concentrate produced of 60,568 ounces was 9% higher due primarily to higher gold recoveries, partially offset by lower grades.\n\nCopper  production  of  9.2 million  pounds  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021  was  19%  higher than  the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher copper grades and recoveries, and higher volumes of ore processed. Copper production of 34.7 million pounds in 2021 was 3% lower than 2020 due primarily to mining in lower grade zones, partially offset by higher copper recoveries.\n\n## Concentrate deliveries and metals sold\n\nDeliveries of gold-copper concentrate in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 of 26,994 tonnes and 112,342 tonnes, respectively, were 10% and 6% higher than the corresponding periods in 2020 due primarily to higher gold-copper concentrate production, partially offset by the timing of shipments.\n\nDeliveries  of  pyrite  concentrate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021  of 79,788 were  6% higher than  the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher pyrite concentrate production and the timing of shipments. Deliveries of pyrite concentrate in 2021 of 267,569 tonnes were comparable to 2020.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, payable gold in gold-copper concentrate sold increased by 4% to 29,207 ounces  and  payable  copper  increased  by  5%  to  8.2  million  pounds,  respectively,  relative  to  the corresponding period in 2020. The increase in payable gold was due primarily to higher gold recoveries and mining in higher grade zones, partially offset by the timing of deliveries, and the increase in payable copper was due primarily to higher copper grades and recoveries, and the timing of deliveries. Payable gold in pyrite concentrate sold in the fourth quarter of 2021 of 11,331 ounces was 21% higher than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher gold recoveries and mining in higher grade zones, partially offset by the timing of deliveries.\n\nIn 2021, payable gold in gold-copper concentrate sold decreased by 3% to 111,550 ounces and payable copper decreased by 2% to 32.7 million pounds, respectively, relative to 2020. These decreases were consistent with lower volumes of metal in concentrate produced, partially offset by the timing of shipments. Payable gold in pyrite concentrate sold in 2021 of 37,747 ounces was 5% higher than 2020 and consistent with higher production.",

Complex concentrate smelted during 2021 of 189,705 tonnes was 18% lower than 2020 due primarily to the planned Ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown, which was completed during the first quarter of 2021, as well as unplanned maintenance downtime due to water leaks in the offgas system during the second half of 2021. Originally planned for 30 days, the maintenance shutdown was extended to 45 days. This was primarily a result of COVID-19 related safety protocols, travel restrictions and the use of remote commissioning support, as well as an increase in the scope of the maintenance work around the Ausmelt lining replacement and additional converter maintenance.\n\nSulphuric acid production during the fourth quarter of 2021 of 56,586 tonnes was 5% higher than the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to the mix of concentrate smelted, as a greater proportion of third  party  concentrate  with  higher  sulphur content  was  smelted  during  the  quarter.  Sulphuric  acid production during 2021 of 201,483 tonnes was 19% lower than 2020 in line with lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted.\n\nSulphuric acid deliveries during the fourth quarter of 2021 of 57,516 tonnes were 9% higher than the corresponding period in 2020 reflecting the timing of shipments which were temporarily delayed as a result of transportation constraints in the third quarter of 2021. Sulphuric acid deliveries during 2021 of 202,054 tonnes were 22% lower than 2020 reflecting lower production and the impact of temporary transportation constraints.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\nCost  of  sales  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021  of  $33.6  million  was  $5.4  million  higher  than  the corresponding period in 2020 due primarily to higher local currency operating expenses as a result of higher maintenance costs and depreciation, partially offset by a weaker ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar.

The MineRP Disposition closed on May 3, 2021.\n\nThe Company received a total cash consideration of $45.2 million for the repayment of DPM shareholder loans and disposition of its equity interest in MineRP, resulting in a gain on MineRP Disposition of $20.0 million in net earnings from discontinued operations in 2021. Net cash consideration received includes $3.5 million held in escrow on closing to secure against certain representations and warranties for a period up to 2 years, which was recognized as restricted cash and included in other long-term assets in the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2021.

        "page_content": "certain revenue targets by MineRP in 2021 and 2022, for which no value has been recognized as at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Financial highlights\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 was $nil and $4.5 million, respectively, compared to $2.6 million and $11.5 million in the corresponding periods in 2020.\n\nNet earnings from discontinued operations attributable to common shareholders in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 were $nil and $19.4 million, respectively, compared to net losses of $nil and $3.1 million in the corresponding periods in 2020 driven primarily by the gain on MineRP Disposition of $20.0 million.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had cash of $334.4 million, investments valued at $48.0 million primarily related to its 8.9% interest in Sabina, and $150.0 million of undrawn capacity under its RCF.\n\nThe Company's liquidity is impacted by several factors which include, but are not limited to, gold, copper and sulphuric acid market prices, production levels, capital expenditures, operating cash costs, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. These factors are monitored by the Company on a regular basis.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company's cash resources and available capital under its RCF continue to provide sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its current operating and capital expenditure requirements, all contractual commitments, as well as a number of margin improvement and growth related expenditures. The Company may, from time to time, raise additional capital or amend its RCF to ensure it maintains its financial strength and has sufficient liquidity to support the funding requirements associated with one or more of its growth capital projects, such as the Loma Larga and Timok gold projects, and the overall needs of the business.\n\nAs part of the Company's assessment of the potential implications associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company assessed its financial resources as at December 31, 2021 and concluded that it has sufficient available cash resources to manage the potential impacts that could reasonably be expected to arise.\n\n## Capital Allocation - INV Acquisition, Share Repurchases and Declaration of Dividend\n\nAs part of its strategy, the Company adheres to a disciplined capital allocation framework that is based on three fundamental considerations - balance sheet strength, reinvestment in the business, and the return of capital to shareholders. Maintaining a strong balance sheet includes ensuring adequate liquidity, managing within  prudent  financial  metrics,  and  building  a  strong  cash  position  to  support  accretive  growth. Reinvestment  in  the  business  includes  investing  in  its  operating  assets  to  sustain  and  optimize performance; investing in resource development to extend the life of its mines and to identify new gold resources; further advancing existing resources towards production; as well as investing in new projects to grow beyond its existing asset base. Returning capital to shareholders includes dividends, and under certain circumstances, opportunistic share repurchases. These alternatives are not mutually exclusive and are assessed in a balanced manner with a view to maximizing total shareholder returns over the long-term.\n\n## INV acquisition\n\nOn July 26, 2021, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares it did not already own of INV, now renamed DPM Ecuador Holdings Inc., which owns DPM Ecuador, the principal assets of which are comprised of the Loma Larga gold project and certain other exploration licences. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the total consideration for the acquisition consisted of: i) 0.0910 of a DPM common share for each INV common share acquired for a total of 10,664,501 DPM common shares at a market price of $5.72 (Cdn$7.19) per share with an aggregate value of $61.0 million; ii) 1,119,728  DPM  stock  options  with  a  fair  market  value  of  $2.4  million  in  exchange  for  12,304,700 outstanding INV stock options which vested immediately as at the date of acquisition; and iii) transaction costs of $2.5 million. The total consideration was allocated primarily to the exploration and evaluation assets related to the Loma Larga gold project. This acquisition leverages DPM's proven strengths in developing",

The number of shares that can be purchased during the period of the NCIB will not exceed 9,000,000 common shares, being approximately 5% of the outstanding shares as of February 23, 2021. Pursuant to the terms of the NCIB, the Company will not acquire on any given trading day more than 182,760 shares, representing 25% of the average daily volume of shares for the six months ended January 31, 2021. The price that the Company will pay for shares in open market transactions will be the market price at the time of purchase and any shares that are purchased under the NCIB will be cancelled. The NCIB will expire on February 28, 2022. In December 2021, the Company initiated an automatic purchase program under the NCIB to facilitate share repurchases.\n\nIn 2021, the Company purchased a total of 1,723,800 shares, of which 1,694,200 shares were cancelled as at December 31, 2021 with the remaining shares cancelled in January 2022. The total cost of these purchases was $10.4 million (Cdn$13.2 million) at an average price of $6.02 (Cdn$7.64) per share, $5.3 million of which was recognized as a reduction in share capital and $5.1 million as a reduction in contributed surplus in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company paid an aggregate of $10.2 million which was included in cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 and recognized an obligation of $0.2 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2021.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved the renewal of the NCIB (the 'New Bid'), however, the renewal is subject to acceptance by the TSX. If accepted, the New Bid will be made in accordance with the applicable rules and policies of the TSX and applicable Canadian securities laws. Pursuant to the New Bid, it is expected that the Company will be able to purchase up to 9,000,000 common shares, representing approximately 5% of the total issued and outstanding common shares as of February 17, 2022, over a period of twelve months commencing after the TSX approval. The New Bid will also allow the Company to implement an Issuer Repurchase Agreement and automatic share repurchase plan with its designated broker in order to facilitate the purchase of its shares.\n\nA copy of the TSX Form 12 for the NCIB can be obtained, without charge, by contacting the Company at info@dundeeprecious.com.\n\nThe actual timing and number of shares that may be purchased pursuant to the NCIB will be subject to DPM's ongoing capital requirements and management's view that, from time to time, DPM's shares may trade at prices well below the underlying value of the Company and during these periods the repurchase of shares represents an excellent opportunity to enhance shareholder value.\n\n## Declaration of dividend\n\nIn 2021, the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.03 per common share to its shareholders of record, resulting in total dividend distributions of $22.4 million (2020 - $16.3 million) recognized against its retained earnings in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity. The Company paid an aggregate of $22.1 million (2020 - $10.9 million) of dividends which were included in cash used in financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 and recognized a dividend payable of $5.7 million (December 31, 2020 - $5.4 million) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position as at December 31, 2021.\n\nOn February 17, 2022, the Company declared a dividend of $0.04 per common share payable on April 18, 2022 to shareholders of record on March 31, 2022, representing a 33% increase over the previous quarterly dividend.",

Cash outlays for capital expenditures in 2021 of $64.1 million were $26.6 million higher than 2020 due primarily to the planned Ausmelt furnace maintenance shutdown at Tsumeb completed in the first quarter of 2021, the planned accelerated life of mine grade control drilling program at Ada Tepe initiated in September 2020, and increased cash outlays for growth capital expenditures related to the Loma Larga project.\n\nOther factors impacting investing activities period over period are summarized below:\n\n- x Proceeds from short-term investments in the fourth quarter of 2021 of $49.7 million compared to $nil in the corresponding period of 2020; and\n- x Proceeds of $45.2 million from the MineRP Disposition in 2021.\n\n## Financing activities\n\nCash used in financing activities in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 was $7.8 million and $36.2 million, respectively, compared to $5.1 million and $26.2 million in the corresponding periods in 2020.\n\nThe primary factors impacting financing activities period over period are summarized below:\n\n- x Dividends paid in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 of $5.7 million and $22.1 million, respectively, compared to $3.6 million and $10.9 million in the corresponding periods in 2020;\n- x Payments for shares purchased under the NCIB in the fourth quarter and twelve months of 2021 of $1.3  million and $10.2 million; and\n- x Net repayments under the RCF of $10.0 million in 2020.\n\n## Financial Position\n\n| $ thousands As at                                         | December  31, 2021   | December  31, 2020   | Increase/ (Decrease)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|\n| Cash                                                      | 334,377              | 149,532              | 184,845                |\n| Accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets | 179,416              | 138,787              | 40,629                 |\n| Assets held for sale                                      | -                    | 30,713               | (30,713)               |\n| Investments at fair value                                 | 47,983               | 106,595              | (58,612)               |\n| Non-current assets, excluding investments at fair value   | 606,634              | 549,233              | 57,401                 |\n| Total assets (1)                                          | 1,168,410            | 974,860              | 193,550                |\n| Current liabilities                                       | 85,799               | 79,073               | 6,726                  |\n| Liabilities held for sale                                 | -                    | 6,003                | (6,003)                |\n| Non-current liabilities                                   | 78,198               | 84,500               | (6,302)                |\n| Equity attributable to common shareholders (1)            | 1,004,413            | 798,669              | 205,744                |\n| Non-controlling interests (1)                             | -                    | 6,615                | (6,615)                |\n\nCash increased by $184.9 million to $334.4 million during 2021 due primarily to higher realized metal prices, continued steady operating performance at Chelopech and Ada Tepe, and proceeds from the sale of MineRP, partially offset by lower volumes of complex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb and an increase in dividend paid and shares repurchased. Accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets increased by $40.6 million to $179.4 million due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of the timing of customer receipts and higher metal prices.

Investments at fair value decreased during 2021 due primarily to a decrease in Sabina's share price and the Company acquiring 100% of INV on July 26, 2021, resulting in INV no longer being reported as an investment at fair value.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, DPM held: (i) 31,050,566 common shares of Sabina and (ii) 5,000,000 Series B special warrants, which will be automatically exercised upon a positive production decision with respect to the Back River project or upon the occurrence of certain other events.

        "page_content": "For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized unrealized losses on publicly traded securities of $0.7 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $22.8 million) and $42.6 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $36.5 million), respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss.\n\n## Commodity Swap Contracts\n\nThe Company enters into cash settled commodity swap contracts from time to time to swap future contracted monthly average metal prices for fixed metal prices to eliminate or substantially reduce the metal price exposure associated with the time lag between the provisional and final determination of concentrate sales ('QP Hedges').\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company's outstanding QP Hedges, all of which mature within six months from the reporting date, are summarized in the table below:\n\n| Commodity hedged   | Volume hedged    | Weighted average fixed price  of QP Hedges   |\n|--------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Payable gold       | 18,040 ounces    | $1,803.46/ounce                              |\n| Payable copper     | 6,194,982 pounds | $4.16/pound                                  |\n\nThe Company also enters into cash settled commodity swap contracts from time to time to swap future contracted monthly average prices for fixed metal prices to reduce its future metal price exposure in respect of its projected production ('Production Hedges'). As at December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding Production Hedges.\n\nThe Company designates the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of Production Hedges as cash flow hedges and the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of QP Hedges as fair value hedges.\n\nThe fair value gain or loss on commodity swap contracts is calculated based on the corresponding LME forward copper prices and New York Commodity Exchange forward gold prices, as applicable. As at December 31, 2021, the net fair value loss on all outstanding commodity swap contracts was $1.9 million (December 31, 2020 - $5.7 million), of which $0.02 million (December 31, 2020 - $0.1 million) was included in other current assets and $1.9 million (December 31, 2020 - $5.8 million) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized net gains of $6.4 million (2020 - net losses of $5.5 million) and net losses of $3.5 million (2020 - $11.1 million), respectively, on commodity swap contracts in respect of QP Hedges and realized losses of $4.5 million (2020 - $nil) and $15.7 million (2020 - $nil), respectively, on commodity swap contracts in respect of Production Hedges.\n\n## Foreign Exchange Option Contracts\n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange option contracts from time to time to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nForeign exchange option contracts are entered to provide price protection below a specified 'floor' rate and participation up to a specified 'ceiling' rate. The option contracts comprise a series of call options and put options (which when combined create a price 'collar') that are structured so as to provide for a zero upfront cash cost.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange option contracts in respect of a portion of its projected Namibian dollar denominated operating expenses, which is linked to the ZAR, as summarized in the table below:\n\n| Year of projected  operating   | Amount hedged   | Call options sold  weighted average  ceiling rate US$/ZAR   | Put options purchased  weighted average  floor rate US$/ZAR   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| expenses                       | in ZAR          |                                                             |                                                               |\n| 2022                           | 1,464,090,000   | 17.05                                                       | 15.14                                                         |\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, approximately 83% of the Company's projected Namibian dollar operating expenses for 2022, respectively, have been hedged.",

        "page_content": "The Company designates the intrinsic value of foreign exchange option contracts as cash flow hedges. The time value component of foreign exchange option contracts is treated as a separate cost of hedging.\n\nThe fair value gain or loss on these outstanding contracts was calculated based on foreign exchange forward rates quoted in the market. As at December 31, 2021, the net fair value loss on all outstanding foreign exchange option contracts was $1.5 million (December 31, 2020 - net fair value gain of $6.4 million), of which $nil was included in other current assets (December 31, 2020 - $6.4 million) and $1.5 million was in accounts payable and accrued liabilities (December 31, 2020 - $nil). All foreign exchange option contracts are subject to master netting agreements. As at December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no setoff of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nThe Company recognized realized gains of $0.5 million (2020 - realized losses of $0.1 million) and $6.5 million (2020 - realized losses of $3.5 million), respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021 in cost of sales on the spot component of settled contracts.\n\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized unrealized losses of $2.4 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $6.4 million) and $5.4 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $3.4 million), respectively, in other comprehensive income (loss) on the spot component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company also recognized unrealized losses of $0.1 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $2.5 million) and $2.5 million (2020 - unrealized losses of $0.9 million), respectively, on the time value component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts in other comprehensive income (loss) as a deferred cost of hedging.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to credit and liquidity risks in the event of non-performance by counterparties in connection with its commodity swap contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. These risks, which are monitored on a regular basis, are mitigated, in part, by entering into transactions with financially sound counterparties  and,  where  possible, ensuring  contracts  are  governed  by  legally  enforceable  master agreements.\n\n## EXPLORATION\n\n## Chelopech Mine\n\nIn 2021, a total of 45,585 metres of resource development diamond drilling was completed within the Chelopech mine, of which 32,393 metres were extensional drilling, which was designed to explore for new mineralization along modelled trends.\n\nExtensional diamond drilling was concentrated on the upper levels of the Chelopech mine, to test for possible extensions to Blocks 8, 10 and 700, as well as 'Target North', located in the northwestern part of the deposit and Block 148. A review of the extensional drilling program is discussed below.\n\nBlocks 8, 10 and 700\n\nA total of 12,653 metres were drilled during 2021 from two separate underground drill locations to test the area  between  Blocks  8,  18  and  700  and  to  test  the  southeastern  flank  of  Block  10  for  additional mineralization. Drilling was also designed to check the lowest part and to define the shape and size of Block 700 and to explore the southwestern part of Block 8.\n\nDrill hole EXT700\\_505\\_08 (shown in the table below) returned positive results with high-grade gold intersections. The first significant interval is presented as discrete barite-quartz-sphalerite and quartzsphalerite veins, located within a sericitic alteration zone between 336 metres to 356 metres. The second intercept is presented as a barite-sphalerite-galena stockwork hosted within an advanced argillic alteration envelope. The results from this hole extended the interpreted lower limits of Block 700 at depth, by approximately 20 metres.\n\nFrom this same program, drill hole EXT700\\_505\\_14 (shown in the table below) returned positive results from the upper levels of Block 18, extending the extents of the prospective silica envelope to the south by approximately 30 metres, while the remaining holes did not intersect significant mineralization.",

        "page_content": "Assay results from another program, designed to test Block 700 from location ND-730-440-BP10 returned generally grades below the reporting criteria. However, there was one intercept above the reporting criteria that extended the Block 700 high grade domain contours by 20 metres to the east, which is reported in the table below (see drill hole EXT700\\_680\\_15).\n\n## Target North (NNW of 147 and Wedge Zone Target)\n\nThe Target North zone is in the northern section of the mine concession and manifested as isolated, structurally and lithologically controlled intervals of high-sulphidation type of mineralization. Mineralization typically appears to be hosted within narrow (10 to 20 metres wide) breccia pipe zones and appears to predominantly align in a NW-SE strike orientation of mineralization. As part of the Target North exploration program, 7,476 metres were completed to test for a continuation to mineralization in an area to the northwest of Blocks 146, 147 and towards Block 148. Sporadic mineralization was observed hosted within advanced  argillic  zones,  comprised  of  individual  veins  of  pyrite-tennantite-barite  mineralization  and disseminated pyrite-tennantite and minor chalcopyrite.\n\nFrom this program, EXT148W\\_210\\_18 returned positive results, with the mineralization presented as disseminated  pyrite-tennantite-chalcopyrite  hosted  within  an  advanced  argillic  alteration  zone.  The updated interpretation based on this result expanded Target 184 up-dip by approximately 50 metres above the  last  drill  intercept.  A  second  hole,  EXT148W\\_210\\_04,  intercepted  narrow  structurally  controlled mineralization approximately 90 metres along strike from the western flank of Block 146, however further infill drilling is needed to determine the continuity of this mineralization.\n\n## Block 148\n\nDuring 2021, an extensional drilling program from level 135 was completed to test the Block 148 zone. The program aimed to test for new mineralization at depth (between levels 130 mRL and -40 mRL) below Block 148 and to test gaps in drilling between Blocks 148 and 151. Drilling extended the outline of prospective advanced argillic alteration, but the majority of assay results returned values below the reporting criteria outlined below. In total two holes, EXT151\\_135\\_01 and EXT151\\_135\\_09 (presented in table below) returned significant intersections from the western and eastern flanks, respectively, of Block 144. Both intercepts extended the current modelled mineralization extents by approximately 15 metres.\n\nFurthermore, holes from location 149S-210-EXP were designed to explore along strike of Block 148. Drilling during 2021 extended the envelope of prospective advanced argillic alteration, but assay results returned narrow, low-continuity mineralization that is below the reporting criteria. Only two holes from the program, EXT148\\_210\\_03 and EXT148\\_210\\_05, returned significant intercepts from Block 148 (presented in table below).\n\n## Outlook\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, the Mineral Resource development strategy for Chelopech will be focused on:\n\n- x Continued drilling to test the shallower level of Blocks 144 and 149;\n- x Continued resource development drilling towards Target North; and\n- x Drilling planned on level 480, aiming to test the gap between Blocks 25 and 19 near to the boundary between pre-mineral dacitic volcanic and post mineral sandstone units.",

The dimensions of the mineralized zones far exceed the standard sample length. All holes are drilled with NQ diamond core. NQ core is cut by diamond saw, where one half of the core sample is submitted for assaying and the remaining half is retained in steel core trays. All drill cores are photographed prior to cutting and/or sampling.\n\nFollowing DPM exploration standard procedures and internationally accredited standards, a full suite of certified reference materials, blanks and field duplicates are submitted to the laboratory with each batch of samples. The overall quality control sample insertion rate is approximately 5% for reference materials, 2% for blanks, and 5% for field duplicates.\n\nSample tickets are entered into the bags with a numbering system, which reconciles sample and assayed results in the acQuire database. The average core recovery within the modelled Mineral Resource constraints is 99.6% and the various phases of drill data show no issues with regards to recoveries. No relationship was evident between core recoveries and the copper assay data, or the gold assay data. The weight of a core sample varies between three and seven kilograms.\n\nDiamond drill core is prepared and assayed at the SGS Minerals ('SGS') managed laboratory at Chelopech in Bulgaria, which is independent of the Company. Samples are routinely assayed for copper, gold, silver, sulphur  and arsenic.  Gold  analyses  are  done  using  a  25-gram  fire  assay  and  atomic  absorption spectrometry ('AAS') finish. Assay values over 20 ppm gold are re-analysed using gravimetric finish. Copper, silver and arsenic analyses are completed using a two-acid digestion and AAS finish. Samples returning over 100 ppm for silver and 3% for copper are re-analyzed using high grade methods with AAS finish. Sulphur is analyzed using an Eltra Analyzer equipped with an induction furnace.\n\nThe Company's QP has verified that all results reported in this disclosure have passed QAQC protocols. Further verification of results included comparison of assay data with geology, alteration and mineralization logging data.",

        "page_content": "## Chelopech Brownfield Exploration\n\nDuring 2021, a total of 41 drill holes (37,925 metres) were completed as part of the brownfield exploration program at Chelopech, focused on:\n\n- x Target delineation drilling at the Wedge and West Shaft prospects within the Sveta Petka exploration licence;\n- x Drill testing of conceptual targets within the Brevene exploration licence (Bridge, Kazana, Aramu South, Chapel, and Murgana) as well as grade/model evaluation drilling at the Vozdol prospect;\n- x Scout drill testing of the Petrovden gold-copper-molybdenum porphyry prospect, aiming to delineate higher grade zones that may potentially be amenable to underground mining; and\n- x Exploration drilling to re-evaluate the high-sulphidation type copper-gold mineralization defined historically at the Sharlo Dere prospect within the mine concession area.\n\nWithin the Sveta Petka exploration licence, following completion of drilling activities at West Shaft and Wedge prospects early in 2021, a detailed drill core and data review was completed to support an updated geologic model which will be used to optimize infill and Mineral Resource delineation drilling, planned to start in the first quarter of 2022. The permitting process, that commenced with a Geologic Discovery Certificate being issued by the Bulgarian Ministry of Energy in January 2021, is close to completion. The one-year extension of the exploration program, required for the further assessment and application for a Commercial Discovery, was received in November 2021 and site access and permitting for drilling pads is underway.\n\nA t the Sharlo Dere prospect in the mine concession, 17 holes totalling nearly 13,000 metres were drilled to confirm historical intercepts and to better assess the continuity and upside potential of the high sulphidation copper-gold mineralization. The drilling to date returned a series of advanced argillic intervals with discrete to semi-massive zones of sulphide/sulphosalt mineralization (significant intercepts reported in the table below). Dependent on the evaluation of the remaining results, the program will continue in early 2022.\n\nAt the Vozdol prospect within the Brevene exploration licence, six holes were completed for a total of 6,066 metres. The program aimed to evaluate the continuity of mineralization as inferred by historical drilling programs and provide a better understanding of the metallogenetic controls. While assay results are partially still pending, re-assessment of the geological model is ongoing and expected to be completed in early 2022.\n\nDrill testing is ongoing at the Petrovden porphyry prospect, located immediately north of the Chelopech mine. The prospect is a large area of low-grade porphyry style mineralization in the footwall of the Petrovden fault. It has an alteration footprint of over 1,000 metres in length, over 500 metres wide and over 1,500 metres vertical extension which remains open at depth. A total of 3,693 metres have been completed as part of two deep drill holes (EX\\_VD\\_07 and EX\\_VD\\_08). Current observations suggest that the causative intrusion consists of series of narrow granodiorite dykes that intrude the high-grade metamorphic basement rocks, following the steeply-dipping and ENE-striking trend of the Petrovden Fault system. More consistent gold-copper-molybdenum mineralization, with elevated silver and rhenium, is closely correlated with higher stockwork intensities and pervasive phyllic alteration overprinting potassic alteration. Mineralization has been intercepted from an elevation of -160 metres and traced to a depth of -700 metres (significant intervals of available assays from EX\\_VD\\_07 are showed below).\n\nPlans for the first quarter of 2022 include completion of the drilling programs at the Sharlo Dere and Petrovden porphyry prospects, as well as operational and technical preparation for the intensive drilling program to support the Commercial Discovery application at Sveta Petka exploration licence, expected to begin in March 2022.",

concession area, as well as the Lada prospect and on the newly granted Krumovitsa exploration licence. This included systematic geological mapping, rock sampling and trenching, as well as ground electrical, radiometric and seismic surveys.\n\nRock samples taken during detailed mapping returned up to 6.64 g/t gold south of the Surnak main zone and  up  to  6.35  g/t  gold along  its  north-western  extension.

Elevated gold grades are associated with sulphide mineralization hosted in structurally controlled tectonic zones overprinted by silica and argillic alteration.\n\n## Significant drill intercepts from the Elhovo exploration licence received in the fourth quarter of 2021:\n\n| Hole ID   |   East |   North |   RL |   AZ |   DIP |   From (m) |   To (m) |   Length (m) |   Au  (g/t) |\n|-----------|--------|---------|------|------|-------|------------|----------|--------------|-------------|\n| ELHDD010  | 376197 | 4583253 |  584 |   43 |   -61 |        228 |      233 |            5 |        0.65 |\n| ELHDD011  | 376346 | 4583081 |  571 |  342 |   -52 |          0 |        5 |            5 |        1.13 |\n| ELHDD015  | 374205 | 4583655 |  515 |  343 |   -44 |         16 |       20 |            4 |        0.78 |\n\n- Coordinates are in UTM grid.\n- Cut-off grade of 0.6 g/t Au, 4 metres minimum length, 4 metres maximum internal dilution.\n- The true width has not been reported due to the disseminated style and variable geometry of mineralization.\n\nAt Chiriite exploration licence, detail geological mapping (1:1000 scale) with rock sampling and trenching was conducted at the Golden Creek, Chernichino and Kara Tepe prospects. A total of 27 trenches (634 metres) were completed with the best intercept from trench CHETR013, returning six metres at 1.65 g/t gold (including one metre at 5.94 g/t gold). Additionally, rock sampling at the Kara Tepe prospect delineated a footprint of more than one kilometre of anomalous gold values with rock samples returning up to 11.9 g/t gold.\n\nThe permitting process for a total of 50 drill sites is ongoing and scout drilling is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022, aiming to confirm the continuity of the veins and mineralized breccias at depth and evaluate the potential connection with the near-by Chatal Kaya prospect.\n\n## Ecuador Exploration\n\nAfter the acquisition of the Loma Larga project, a drilling program has been prepared to support various studies complementary to the refinement of the feasibility study. The drilling program will consist of 15,800 metres of hydrogeological, geotechnical, metallurgical, condemnation and extension drilling. The drilling commenced in the first quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022. All the geological data will be integrated and reviewed to develop an exploration program on the Loma Larga concessions during the second half of 2022.\n\nProspecting, mapping and sampling have been undertaken on the Tierras Coloradas license in 2021 and a 450-kilometre line HD Magnetic helicopter-borne survey was completed in January 2022. A magnetic survey of 475 kilometres has also been planned on the Rubescada property during the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Timok Gold Project Brownfield Exploration\n\nIn 2021, DPM continued to advance exploration activities at the Timok gold project with a focus on adding resources to extend the project mine life. Early in the year the exploration drilling was focused on shallow oxide resource delineation at the Chocolate and Chocolate south targets, proximal to Bigar Hill, as well as target delineation drilling for high-grade Au-Cu manto-skarn mineraliza WLRQglyph<c=3,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT> RQglyph<c=3,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT> \u00fdRNDglyph<c=3,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT> 5DNLWDglyph<c=15,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT>glyph<c=3,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT> )UDVHQglyph<c=3,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT> DQGglyph<c=3,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT> other targets within Umka and Potaj\u00fdXND -Tisnica exploration licences.",

Initial metallurgical testing has been completed for the \u00fdRNDglyph<c=3,font=/AADCOG+ArialMT> Rakita prospect and the results on five orientation samples show that the mineralization encountered is amenable to both flotation and leaching.\n\nOn the Umka exploration licence, a high-resolution ground magnetic survey of 26 square kilometres at 100 metre line spacing was undertaken in late 2021, and a scout drilling program commenced with 5 drill holes with a total of 5,279 metres completed. Drilling revealed large areas with calc-silicate altered sedimentary host rocks and weakly mineralized porphyry stocks. Existing intersects include only narrow gold mineralized intervals and assays are still pending for multiple holes.\n\nPlans for 2022 include follow-up target delineation and drilling at Umka, based on the results to date and additionally a ground-based gravity survey is planned to commence late in the first quarter of 2022, as well as regional field activities on other early-stage licences.\n\n## Sampling, Analysis and QAQC of Exploration Core and Channel Samples\n\nMost exploration diamond drill holes are collared with PQ size, continued with HQ, and are sometimes finished with NQ. Triple tube core barrels are used whenever possible to improve recovery. All drill core is cut lengthwise into two halves using a diamond saw; one half is sampled for assaying and the other half is retained in core trays. All drill core is sampled in intervals ranging up to three metres, however, the common length for sample intervals within mineralized zones is one metre. Weights of drill core samples range from three to eight kilograms, depending on the size of core, rock type, and recovery. A numbered tag is placed into each sample bag, and the samples are grouped into batches for laboratory submissions.\n\nCore and channel samples from exploration programs at Chelopech, Ada Tepe and the Timok gold project are shipped to the Company's own exploration laboratory in Bor, Serbia, which is managed by SGS.\n\nQuality control samples, comprising certified reference materials, blanks and field duplicates, are inserted into each batch of samples and locations for crushed duplicates are specified. All drill core and quality control samples are tabulated on sample submission forms that specify sample preparation procedures and codes for analytical methods. For internal quality control, the laboratory includes its own quality control samples comprising certified reference materials, blanks and pulp duplicates. All QAQC monitoring data are reviewed and signed off by an independent QAQC geologist. Chain of custody records are maintained from sample shipments to the laboratory until analyses are completed and remaining sample materials are returned to the Company. The chain of custody is transferred from the Company to SGS at the laboratory door.\n\nDrill core samples submitted to the laboratory are dried at 105\u00b0C for a minimum of 12 hours, and then jaw crushed to about 80% passing 4 millimetres. Sample preparation duplicates are created by riffle splitting crushed samples on a 1 in 20 basis. Larger samples are riffle split prior to pulverizing, whereas smaller samples are pulverized entirely. Pulverizing specifications are 90% passing 75 microns. Gold analyses are done using a conventional 50-gram fire assay and AAS finish. Multi-element analyses for 49 elements, including Ag, Cu, Mo, As, Bi, Pb, Sb, and Zn, are done using a four-acid digestion and an ICP-MS finish. Samples returning over 10 ppm for Ag and 1% for Cu, Pb and Zn are re-analyzed using high grade methods with AAS finish. Sulphur is analyzed using an Eltra Analyzer equipped with an induction furnace.\n\nThe Company's QP has verified that all results reported in this disclosure have passed QAQC protocols. Further verification of results included comparison of assay data with geology, alteration and mineralization logging data.",

        "page_content": "## Loma Larga Gold Project\n\nIn the third quarter of 2021, DPM completed the acquisition of the high-quality, advanced stage Loma Larga gold project in Ecuador. The project adds approximately 2.6 million gold equivalent ounces (gold equivalent based on a gold price of $1,250 per ounce, silver price of $18 per ounce and copper price of $3 per pound and assumes 100% metallurgical recovery). These gold equivalent ounces of high-grade mineral reserves for an initial 12-year mine life and has the potential to produce an annual average of approximately 200,000 gold ounces in the first five years. Life of mine production is estimated to be approximately 170,000 gold ounces per year at an attractive all-in sustaining cost of approximately $630 per ounce of gold, which continues to support DPM's peer-leading cost profile.\n\nFor more information, including key assumptions, risks and parameters relating to the FS, refer to the Technical Report entitled 'NI 43-101 Feasibility Study Technical Report, Loma Larga Project, Azuay Province, Ecuador' dated April 8, 2020 and re-issued by DPM on November 29, 2021, which has been posted  on  the  Company's  website  at  www.dundeeprecious.com  and  has  been  filed  on  SEDAR  at www.sedar.com.\n\nLocated in the Azuay province of Ecuador, the project has similar geology, mining method and processing flow sheet to our Chelopech underground mine. Loma Larga is expected to produce a pyrite gold concentrate that can be sold to various copper and gold smelting operations, as well as a small quantity of complex concentrate, which DPM could process at its Tsumeb smelter.\n\nFollowing closing of the acquisition, the Company has been focused on integration activities, stakeholder engagement and a review of the technical studies and permitting schedule. DPM mobilized its Enterprise Project Management Office to provide support for the initial integration phase and is now implementing its well-established project development methodology. A comprehensive stakeholder and social  engagement strategy is being developed and a review is underway to assess the alignment of the environmental and social studies against leading international practices. The permitting schedule has also been reviewed and is now being optimized. DPM is targeting completion of a revised FS in 2022 and has commenced scoping the FS optimization work as well as the design of a metallurgical test program, the results of which will be incorporated  into  the  revised  FS.  A 15,800 metre  drill  program  that  will  consist  of  metallurgical, geotechnical, hydrogeological and condemnation drilling is planned to optimize specific aspects of the previous FS and has commenced in the first quarter of 2022. Based on the revised permitting schedule, DPM is targeting to receive the major environmental permits by the end of 2022, followed by finalization of the exploitation agreement and construction permits. DPM is engaging with local communities, government authorities and other stakeholders, utilizing leading international practices, while concurrently adhering to a disciplined approach to project development in order to minimize up-front spend during the permitting process. The Company is also progressing discussions that are expected to result in the execution of an investor protection agreement with the government of Ecuador prior to making any significant capital commitments.\n\n## Timok Gold Project\n\nThe Timok gold project is a sediment hosted gold deposit located in the central-eastern region of the Republic of Serbia.\n\nOn February 23, 2021, DPM announced the results of the PFS for the Timok gold project which focused on the development of the oxide and transitional portions of the Mineral Resource. The PFS was based on the updated Mineral Resource Estimate, dated May 29, 2020, which considered primarily oxide and transitional material types.\n\nThe PFS included the following highlights:\n\n- x After-tax NPV 5% of $135 million and internal rate of return of 21% assuming a gold price of $1,500 per ounce;",

The Company completed the planned FS fieldwork activities in the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThe three-year retention of mineral rights was received during the third quarter of 2021. Other permitting activities associated with the spatial planning continued during the third quarter of 2021 with the objective of securing the mining rights for the project. The terms of reference for the spatial plan were released during the fourth quarter of 2021 for public review.\n\nFor additional details, including key assumptions, risks and parameters relating to the PFS, refer to the news release entitled 'Dundee Precious Metals Announces Positive Pre-Feasibility Study and Encouraging New Exploration Results for the Timok Gold Project in Serbia' dated February 23, 2021 and the Technical Report entitled 'NI 43-101 Technical Report, Timok Project, Pre-Feasibility Study, Zagubica, Serbia' effective March 30, 2021, which have been posted on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com and have been filed on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.\n\n## Tsumeb Rotary Holding Furnace\n\nThe Company continues to assess opportunities to further optimize the inherent value of the Tsumeb smelter operation. Am assessment was completed in respect of the installation of a rotary holding furnace. The estimated upfront cost is expected to range between $47 million and $55 million, up from the prior estimate of $39 million due primarily to a change in scope and updated cost estimates. This furnace is expected to provide surge capacity between the Ausmelt furnace and the converters, increase smelter recoveries as well as potentially bring in additional third party feed and increase the proportion of third party volumes. These opportunities have the potential to generate additional value, with the rotary furnace installation being a potentially high return project that would debottleneck and increase the annual throughput of complex concentrate by over 50% up to 370,000 tonnes and, in turn, generate significant incremental margins, given the fixed cost nature of the facility. As a result, the Company continues to monitor and pursue potential opportunities to secure additional long-term supply of complex concentrate on acceptable terms that would support this expansion.\n\nUntil  such  supply  is  secured,  DPM  will  seek  to  process  additional  volumes  of  third  party  complex concentrates at Tsumeb, in lieu of Chelopech concentrate, when third party concentrates are available on acceptable  terms  and  the  Company  can,  in  turn,  capitalize  on  market  demand  for  the  Chelopech concentrate. While this has the potential to generate a net overall value for the Company, this would be realized through lower treatment charges and higher margins at Chelopech, offset partially by lower revenue at Tsumeb. This could, in turn, result in the proposed expansion of the smelter being further delayed and possibly deferred indefinitely if an acceptable long term contract cannot be secured to support the expansion.\n\nOn December 13, 2019, the Government of Namibia issued an Environmental Clearance Certificate to Tsumeb, approving its proposed expansion to 370,000 tonnes per year, which remains valid until December 2022 with an option to renew.",

        "page_content": "## (i) Mineral exploration and evaluation expenditures\n\nExploration and evaluation activities involve the search for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, the assessment of technical and operational feasibility and the determination of an identified Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve's commercial viability. Once the legal right to explore has been acquired, exploration and evaluation expenditures are expensed as incurred until economic production is probable. Exploration expenditures in areas where there is a reasonable expectation to convert existing estimated Mineral Resources to estimated Mineral Reserves or to add additional Mineral Resources with additional drilling and evaluations in areas near existing Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves and existing or planned production facilities, are capitalized.\n\nExploration properties that contain Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, but for which a development decision has not yet been made, are subject to periodic review for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the project's carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nExploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Mines under construction' when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves are demonstrable and construction has commenced or a decision to construct has been made. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment before reclassification to 'Mines under construction', and the impairment charge, if any, is recognized through net earnings (loss).\n\nThe application of the Company's accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditures requires judgment in determining whether it is probable that future economic benefits will be generated from the exploitation of an exploration and evaluation asset when activities have not yet reached a stage where a reasonable assessment of the existence of Mineral Reserves can be determined. The estimation of Mineral Resources is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates regarding economic and geological data and these assumptions and estimates impact the decision to either expense or capitalize exploration and evaluation expenditures. Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events and circumstances in order to determine if an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any revision to any of these assumptions and estimates could result in the impairment of the capitalized exploration and evaluation costs. If new information becomes available after expenditures have been capitalized that the recovery of these expenditures is no longer probable, the expenditures capitalized are written down to the recoverable amount and charged to net earnings (loss) in the period the new information becomes available.\n\n## (ii) Mine properties\n\n## Mine Properties - Mines under construction\n\nAll expenditures undertaken in the development, construction, installation and/or completion of mine production facilities are capitalized and initially classified as 'Mines under construction'. All expenditures related to the construction of mine declines and orebody access, including mine shafts and ventilation raises, are considered to be capital development and are capitalized. Expenses incurred after reaching the orebody are regarded as operating development costs and are included in the cost of ore hoisted.\n\nUpon  the  commencement  of  commercial  production,  all  related  assets  included  in  'Mines  under construction' are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Producing mines' or 'Property, plant and equipment'. Determination of commencement of commercial production is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The commencement of commercial production is defined as the date when the mine is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The Company considers primarily the following factors, among others, when determining the commencement of commercial production:\n\n- x All major capital expenditures to achieve a consistent level of production and desired capacity have been incurred;\n- x A reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment has been completed;\n- x A predetermined percentage of design capacity of the mine and mill has been reached; and\n- x Required production levels, grades and recoveries have been achieved.",

Costs incurred for the acquisition of land are stated at cost.\n\nThe initial cost of a producing mine comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation costs, and for qualifying assets, applicable borrowing costs during construction. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nWhen a mine construction project moves into production, the capitalization of certain mine construction costs ceases, and from that point on, costs are either regarded as inventory costs or expensed as cost of sales, except for costs related to mine additions or improvements, mine development or mineable reserve development, which qualify for capitalization.\n\n## Depletion\n\nThe depletion of a producing mine asset is based on the unit-of-production method over the estimated economic life of the related deposit.\n\n## Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates\n\nThe estimation of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, as defined under NI 43-101 is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The Company prepares its Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates based on information related to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the orebody which is compiled by appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are based upon factors such as metal prices, capital requirements, production costs, foreign exchange rates, geotechnical and geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade of the orebody. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, together with forecast production, determine the life of mine estimates and therefore changes in the Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates may impact the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment, depletion and depreciation charges, rehabilitation provisions and deferred income tax assets.\n\n## (iii) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment charges.\n\nThe initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation costs, and for qualifying assets, applicable borrowing costs during construction. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Where an item of property, plant and equipment is comprised of significant components with different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. The capitalized value of a lease is also included in property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nThe depreciation of property, plant and equipment related to a mine is based on the unit-of-production method over the estimated economic life of the related deposit, except in the case of an asset whose estimated useful life is less than the life of the deposit, in which case the asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life based on the straight-line method. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is based on the estimated useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in a capitalized exploration or development project is capitalized to the project.",

        "page_content": "Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, is as follows:\n\n| Asset Category          | Estimated useful life (Years)   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Buildings               | 15 - 20                         |\n| Machinery and Equipment | 3 - 20                          |\n| Vehicles                | 5                               |\n| Computer Hardware       | 3                               |\n| Office Equipment        | 3 - 6                           |\n\nConstruction work-in-progress includes property, plant and equipment in the course of construction and is carried at cost less any recognized impairment charge. These assets are reclassified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment and depreciation of these assets commences when they are completed and ready for their intended use.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment, including any significant part initially recognized, is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of all assets are reviewed at each financial year end and are adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of estimated residual values and useful lives. The actual residual values and useful lives may differ from current estimates.\n\nDepreciation of mine specific assets is based on the unit-of-production method. The life of these assets is assessed annually with regard to both their anticipated useful life and the present assessments of the economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine property where these assets are located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves and resources. Any changes to these calculations based on new information are accounted for prospectively.\n\nRates of depreciation and, in turn, the annual depreciation expense could therefore be materially affected by changes in underlying estimates. Changes in estimates can be the result of differences in actual production or changes in forecast future production, changes in Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves through exploration activities, differences between estimated and actual costs of mining and differences in metal prices used in the estimation of Mineral Reserves.\n\nExploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets balances could be materially impacted if other assumptions and estimates had been used. In addition, future operating results could be impacted if different assumptions and estimates are applied in future periods.\n\n## (iv) Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nAt each reporting date, the carrying values of mine properties, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment are assessed for impairment if indicators of potential impairment exist. If any indication of potential impairment exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') and its value in use based on discounted cash flows. This is determined on an asset-by-asset basis, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, individual assets are grouped together into a Cash Generating Unit ('CGU') for impairment purposes. Such CGUs represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Management has assessed the Company's CGUs as being an individual operating site.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount with the corresponding impairment being charged to",

Impairment charges are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.\n\nAn assessment is also made at each reporting date as to whether there is any change in events or circumstances relating to a previously recognized impairment. If a change has occurred, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount for the previously impaired asset or CGU. A previously recognized impairment charge, other than a charge in respect of goodwill, is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment charge was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its newly determined recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortization, had no impairment charge been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years.\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Any impairment in goodwill is recognized immediately and cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\nThe assessment of impairment is based on a number of external and internal factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control, and requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to these factors for each CGU. External factors include market considerations ranging from overall economic activity and the supply of and demand for the materials used in and products produced by the Company to changes in commodity prices, toll rates, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and regulatory requirements. Internal factors include considerations such as production volume, ability to convert resources into reserves, capital and operating expenditures, and future development and expansion plans.\n\nThese significant estimates and assumptions, some of which may be subjective, require that management make decisions based on the best available information at each reporting period. It is possible that the actual recoverable amount could be significantly different than those estimates. A significant decline in the asset's market value, reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of recoverable reserves, resources and exploration potential, and/or adverse market conditions can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts of the Company's assets. Judgment is also required when considering whether significant changes in any of these items indicate a previous impairment may have reversed.\n\n## (v) Rehabilitation provisions\n\nMining, processing, development and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. The Company recognizes a liability for its rehabilitation obligations in the period when a legal and/or constructive obligation is identified. The liability is measured at the present value of the estimated costs required to rehabilitate operating locations based on the risk free nominal discount rates that are specific to the countries in which the operations are located. A corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated in the same manner as the related asset.\n\nThe nature of these restoration and rehabilitation activities includes: i) dismantling and removing structures; ii) rehabilitating mines and tailing dams; iii) dismantling operating facilities; iv) closure of plant and waste sites; and v) restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas. Other environmental costs incurred  at  the  operating  sites,  such  as  environmental  monitoring,  water  management  and  waste management costs, are charged to profit or loss when incurred.\n\nThe liability is accreted over time to its expected future settlement value. The accretion expense is recognized in finance cost in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nThe Company assesses its rehabilitation provisions at each reporting date. The rehabilitation liability and related assets are adjusted at each reporting date for changes in the discount rates and in the estimated amount, timing and cost of the work to be carried out. Any reduction in the rehabilitation liability and therefore any deduction in the related rehabilitation asset may not exceed the carrying amount of that asset. If it does, any excess over the carrying value is immediately credited to profit or loss.",

The estimates and assumptions required include estimates of the timing, extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technology changes, regulatory changes, and changes in the discount and inflation rates. These uncertainties may result in future expenditures being different from the amounts currently provided.\n\nChanges in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the rehabilitation liability as well as changes to environmental laws and regulations could cause material changes in the expected cost and expected future settlement value.\n\nAt as December 31, 2021, the undiscounted future cost for estimated mine closure and rehabilitation costs before inflation was estimated to be $77.6 million. The carrying value of the estimated mine closure and rehabilitation cost was $51.6 million at December 31, 2021 and $52.5 million at December 31, 2020.\n\n## (vi) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of concentrates containing gold, copper and silver is recognized when control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when products have been delivered and the significant risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract.\n\nRevenue from the sale of concentrates is initially recorded based on a provisional value which is a function of prevailing market prices, estimated weights and grades less smelter and other commercial deductions. Under the terms of the concentrate sales contracts, the final metal price (\"settlement price\") for the payable metal is based on a predetermined quotational period of London Metal Exchange and London Bullion Market daily prices. The price of the concentrate is the sum of the metal payments less the sum of specified deductions, including treatment and refining charges, penalties for deleterious elements, and freight. The terms of these contracts result in embedded derivatives because of the timing difference between the prevailing metal prices for provisional payments and the actual contractual metal prices used for final settlement. These embedded derivatives are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through to the date of final price determination with any adjustments recognized in revenue.\n\nAny adjustments to the amount receivable for each shipment on the settlement date, caused by final assay results, are adjusted through revenue at the time of determination.\n\nRevenue from processing concentrate is recognized when concentrate has been smelted and is based on the toll rate specified in the toll agreement, which can vary based on the composition of the concentrate processed and prevailing market conditions at the time the agreement was entered. Under each toll agreement, Tsumeb incurs a carrying charge in respect of the concentrate it processes until blister copper is delivered. This charge is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n\nRevenue from processing concentrate is also adjusted for any over or under recoveries of metals delivered relative to contracted rates under the tolling agreement between Tsumeb and IXM. These adjustments represent metal exposure and are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate received and processed by Tsumeb multiplied by the percentage accountable in the IXM contract to (ii) the accountable copper, gold and silver in the blister delivered to IXM and in the in-circuit material still being processed by Tsumeb. Many aspects of the metal exposure are subject to estimation, including the amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered where final assays have not been completed. These significant estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge, joint surveys with IXM and multiple assay results, the final results of which could differ from initial estimates.\n\nRevenue from the sale of sulphuric acid, a by-product from processing concentrate at the Tsumeb smelter, is measured at the price specified in the sales contract and is recognized when the control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when the products have been delivered to the location specified in the sales contract and the risk of loss has been transferred to the buyer.\n\nRevenue from MineRP's software services is recognized over time when the services are rendered. This is measured based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided.

The fair value of each element is determined based on the market price of each element when sold separately. Revenue relating to the software element is recognized when the control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs on delivery. Revenue relating to the service element is recognized over time when the services are rendered.\n\n## (vii) Deferred revenue\n\nDeferred  revenue  is  recognized  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  financial  position  when  a  cash prepayment is received from one or more customers prior to the sale of product or delivery of service. Revenue is subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) when the sale occurs, which generally occurs when control has been transferred or in the case of services, when the services have been rendered.\n\nThe Company recognizes the time value of money, where there is a significant financing component and the period between the payment by the customer and the transfer of the contracted goods or services exceeds one year.\n\n## (viii) Income taxes\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities on the taxable loss or income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nCurrent income tax assets and current income tax liabilities are only offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet method on temporary differences on the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize these deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe following temporary differences do not result in deferred income tax assets or liabilities:\n\n- x The initial recognition of assets or liabilities, not arising from a business combination, that does not affect accounting or taxable profit;\n- x Initial recognition of goodwill, if any; and\n- x Investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities where the timing of the reversal of temporary differences can be controlled and reversal in the foreseeable future is not probable.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized deferred income tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable income will be generated to allow the deferred income tax asset to be recovered.",

Deferred income tax assets, including those arising from unutilized tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate future taxable income in order to utilize the deferred income tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations or other activities and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred income tax assets recorded on the reporting date could be impacted.\n\nAdditionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could impact tax deductions in future periods and the value of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities\n\n## NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nCertain financial measures referred to in this MD&A are not measures recognized under IFRS and are referred to as Non-GAAP financial measures or ratios. These measures have no standardized meanings under IFRS and may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The definitions established and calculations performed by DPM are based on management's reasonable judgment and are consistently applied. These measures are used by management and investors to assist with assessing the Company's performance, including its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its return objectives and support its investing activities and debt service obligations. In addition, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses certain of these measures, together with other measures, to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance. These measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios, together with other financial measures calculated in accordance with IFRS, are considered to be important factors that assist investors in assessing the Company's performance.\n\n## Non-GAAP Cash Cost and All-in Sustaining Cost Measures\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed, cash cost per pound of copper in gold-copper concentrate produced, cash cost per ounce of gold in gold-copper concentrate produced, cash cost per ounce of gold in gold concentrate produced, cash cost per ounce of gold sold, all-in sustaining cost per ounce of gold and cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted are Non-GAAP ratios. These measures capture the important components of the Company's production and related costs. Management and investors utilize these metrics as an important tool to monitor cost performance at the Company's operations. In addition, the Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors uses certain of these measures, together with other measures, to set incentive compensation goals and assess performance.\n\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the Company's cash cost per tonne of ore processed, cash cost per pound of copper produced, cash cost per ounce of gold produced and cash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted to its cost of sales:",

The operating results and financial condition are also subject to numerous external factors, which include economic, social, geo-political, environmental, regulatory, health, legal, tax and market risks impacting, among other things, precious metals and copper prices, sulphuric acid prices, toll rates, foreign exchange rates, inflation, the availability and cost of capital to fund the capital requirements of the business and the supply chain related to the business. Each of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future business, results of operations and financial condition, and could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in any Forward Looking Statements contained in this MD&A.

        "page_content": "a view to mitigating risk while maximizing total shareholder returns. The Company continually strives to identify and to effectively manage the risks of each of its business units. This includes developing appropriate risk management strategies, policies, processes and systems. There can be no assurance that the Company has been or will be successful in identifying all risks or that any risk-mitigating strategies adopted to reduce or eliminate risk will be successful.\n\nA description of the more significant business risks and uncertainties affecting the Company are set out below. These risks, along with other potential risks not specifically discussed in this MD&A, should be considered when evaluating the Company and its guidance. Additional risks not identified below may affect the Company.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of multiple COVID-19 variants has had an adverse impact on global economic conditions. Any future emergence and spread of similar or other pathogens could have a similar adverse impact. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue or worsen which may adversely impact the Company's operations, and the operations of its suppliers, contractors and service providers, the ability to obtain financing and maintain necessary liquidity, the demand for and ability to transport the Company's products and its ability to advance its projects and other growth initiatives.\n\nThe outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 continues to significantly impact global economies and the global upheavals have caused significant volatility in commodity prices. The outbreak and its declaration as  a  global  pandemic  caused  companies  and  governments  around  the  world  to  impose  sweeping restrictions on the movement of people and goods, including social distancing measures and restrictions on group gatherings, isolation and quarantine requirements, closure of business and government offices, travel advisories and travel restrictions. The duration of the various disruptions to businesses locally and internationally and the related financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Furthermore, governments in relevant jurisdictions may introduce new, or modify existing, laws, regulations, orders or other measures that could impact the Company's ability to operate or affect the actions of its suppliers, contractors and service providers.\n\nAuthorities in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates mandated restrictions and additional measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. While there is some easing of restrictions, should these measures and ongoing vaccination efforts be insufficient to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19, this may lead to further economic downturn that may adversely impact the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The outbreak and resurgence of COVID-19 may also continue to affect financial markets, may adversely affect the Company's ability to raise capital, if required, and may cause continued interest rate volatility and movements that may make obtaining financing or extending existing credit facilities, if required, more challenging or more expensive or unavailable on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, if any number of employees, contractors or consultants of the Company or any key supplier become infected with COVID-19 or similar pathogens and/or the Company is unable to source necessary replacements, consumables or supplies or transport its products, due to government restrictions or otherwise, it could have a material negative impact on the Company's operations and prospects, including the partial or complete shutdown, delays in planned activities, including maintenance, or other disruption of one or more of its operations. Furthermore, an outbreak of COVID-19 at the Company's operations could cause reputational harm and negatively impact the Company's social licence to operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has also increased cybersecurity and information technology risks due to the rise in fraudulent activity and increased number of employees working remotely.\n\nAlthough the Company has not experienced any material disruptions to its operations to date, as a result of measures it has taken, there is no assurance the Company will not be adversely affected by the current COVID-19 pandemic or other potential future health crises. The Company will continue to work actively to monitor the situation and implement further measures as required to mitigate and/or deal with any repercussions that may occur as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n## Metal Prices\n\nThe fluctuation in the price of a metal sold by the Company can significantly impact revenues as well as allin sustaining cost per ounce of gold and other cost measures that are reported net of by-product credits.",

        "page_content": "Accordingly, the price of gold and copper are major factors influencing the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition, and, in turn, the price for its common shares.\n\nMetal prices can fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond the Company's control, including overall global market conditions; the sale or purchase of gold and silver by various central banks, financial institutions and Exchange Traded Funds; interest rates; foreign exchange rates; inflation or deflation; global and regional supply and demand; and the political and economic conditions of major gold, silver and copper producing and consuming countries throughout the world. If gold and/or copper prices were to decline significantly from current levels, there can be no assurance that cash flow from operations, together with cash on hand and available lines of credit under the Company's RCF, will be sufficient to meet the Company's operating and capital requirements, including its contractual commitments and mandatory debt repayments, and the Company could be forced to discontinue production, reassess the feasibility of a particular project, and/or could lose its interest in, or be forced to sell, some of its properties. In addition, a significant commodity price decline could result in significant reductions in Mineral Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of one or more of the Company's cash generating units and result in an impairment of the carrying value of certain assets, including exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, and property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn accordance with established board approved risk management policies, from time to time, the Company enters into cash settled commodity swap contracts to swap future contracted monthly average metal prices for fixed metal prices in order to reduce the metal price exposure associated with the time lag between the provisional and final determination of concentrate sales. The Company also selectively enters into cash settled commodity swap and option contracts from time to time to reduce its price exposure on future sales and in respect of certain cost measures that are impacted by variability in by-product metal credits. These contracts are entered primarily to provide price protection below a specified 'floor' price and, to reduce the upfront cost of these contracts, are typically accompanied by option contracts that provide price participation up to a specified 'ceiling' price. The Company sells and hedges gold and copper metal contained in concentrates produced at prices that are effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on major commodity exchanges, including the LME and the LBMA. The Company currently has no hedges in place its expected payable copper to be sold in 2022.\n\n## Smelter Toll Rates, Sulphuric Acid Prices, Metal Recoveries and Feed\n\nThe availability of sufficient volumes of high value complex concentrate, at suitable toll rates, is critical to the ongoing viability and profitability of the Tsumeb smelter, given the fixed cost nature of the operation. To facilitate the procurement of complex concentrates, the Company entered into an agreement with IXM that currently matures on December 31, 2023. There is no assurance that this agreement will be renewed with IXM upon its expiry on December 31, 2023.\n\nUnder this agreement, the Company typically secures complex concentrate volumes at specified toll rates covering the next 12-24 months. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has contracted high value complex concentrate covering over 90% of its expected concentrate requirements through to the end of 2023. There can be no assurance that such concentrate will be available to the smelter in future or that the parties will agree on contracted toll rates that will be sufficient to generate an adequate return. From time to time the Company may increase the amount of third party concentrate and reduce the amount of Chelopech concentrate processed at Tsumeb. To the extent the volume of complex concentrate from Chelopech is reduced at Tsumeb, it can affect the profitability of the Tsumeb smelter. Failure to find sufficient quantities of suitable high value complex concentrate to be processed at acceptable toll rates could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nUnder the agreement with IXM, Tsumeb must return specified quantities of copper, gold and silver, and maintain specified maximum levels of in-process metal. Metal over and under recoveries at the smelter are subject to smelter processing capabilities, contracted terms, and various estimates, including the quantities of metal contained in concentrate received, material in-process and blister delivered. These estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge and multiple assay results. Actual metal deliveries could differ materially from initial estimates and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations as any over or under recovery of metals is recorded in revenue. In the event that in-process metals at the smelter exceed specified maximum contractual levels, Tsumeb",

        "page_content": "may be required to purchase such excess in-process metal. IXM may agree to waive such purchase requirement, and has done so in 2020 and 2021, when in-process metal exceeded maximum contractual levels.\n\nTsumeb produces sulphuric acid as a by-product of the smelting operation. Historically, the vast majority of this sulphuric acid has been sold to customers in Namibia, with the balance exported to other countries in Africa. In 2021, no sulphuric acid was exported out of Namibia. The revenue from the sales of sulphuric acid make up approximately 15% to 20% of Tsumeb's revenue and changes in the market price of and demand for sulphuric acid can have a material impact on Tsumeb's financial results. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 74 % of Tsumeb's forecast sulphuric acid production over the next 4 years is expected to be sold domestically under a reference price contract which includes floor and ceiling prices. The remainder of Tsumeb's sulphuric acid production is expected to be sold at market terms under spot or longer-term agreements. An inability to sell or deliver sufficient acid production whereby Tsumeb's sulphuric acid storage capacity is exceeded would result in a reduction of smelter operating levels up to and including a full stoppage.\n\n## Foreign Exchange\n\nBy virtue of its international operations, the Company incurs costs and expenses in a number of foreign currencies. The revenue from its mining and smelting operations received by the Company is denominated in U.S. dollars since the prices of the metals that it produces are referenced in U.S. dollars, while the majority of operating and capital expenditures of its mining and smelter operations are denominated in Bulgarian leva, which is pegged to the Euro, the Namibian dollar, which is tied to the South African rand, and the Canadian dollar. Fluctuations in these foreign exchange rates give rise to foreign exchange exposures, either favourable or unfavourable, which could have a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain currencies can also have an impact on commodity prices quoted in U.S. dollars, such that a stronger U.S. dollar tends to have a negative impact on U.S. quoted prices while a weaker U.S. dollar tends to have a favourable impact. As a result, this relationship is considered in conjunction with the Company's risk assessment.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into forward and option foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce  the  foreign  exchange  exposures  associated  with  projected  operating  expenses  and  capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies. Approximately 83 %of projected Namibian dollar operating expenses for 2022 have been hedged with a series of call and put options with a weighted average floor and ceiling rates of 15.14 and 17.05, respectively.\n\n## Counterparty Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to counterparty risk, including market pricing and credit-related risk, in the event any counterparty, whether a customer, debtor or financial intermediary, is unable or unwilling to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company or where such agreements are otherwise terminated and not replaced with agreements on substantially the same terms.\n\nUnder the terms of the Company's existing concentrate sale contracts, the risk to counterparties is mitigated, in part, through required provisional payments that range between 70% and 95% of the provisional value of each lot at the time title of the concentrate transfers. A final adjusting payment, reflecting the actual metal prices and volumes for the specified quotation period, is made when final weights and assays are determined. During 2021, the Company had contracts with 14 customers in connection with its mining and smelting operations, one of whom accounted for approximately 40% (2020 - 57%) of the Company's  revenue. All  contractual  commitments  are  subject  to  force  majeure  clauses  which,  if implemented, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWhile there can be no assurance that the Company will not experience a material loss for non-performance by any counterparty with whom it has a commercial relationship, the Company has established policies to manage its credit exposure that include assessing financial strength, limiting aggregate exposure to new and existing counterparties, and using contractual arrangements, including provisional payments and letters of credit. Should any such losses arise, they could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.",

        "page_content": "## Operations\n\nMining operations and related processing and infrastructure facilities are subject to a number of risks, including risks related specifically to the mining and metals industry. Such risks include, without limitation, environmental hazards, industrial accidents, disruptions in the supply of critical materials and supplies, disruptions due to pandemic conditions, delays in obtaining work visas or other authorizations, labour disputes, changes in laws, technical difficulties or failures, equipment failure, failure of retaining dams around tailings disposal areas which may result in environmental pollution and consequent liability, unusual and unexpected geologic formations, seismic activity, rock bursts, cave-ins, flooding and other conditions involved in the drilling and removal of material. Such risks could result in damage to, or destruction of, mines and other processing facilities, damage to life or property, environmental damage, delays in mining and processing, delays in scheduled maintenance, losses and possible legal liability. Any prolonged downtime or shutdowns at the Company's mining and processing facilities could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nSuccess of the Company's operations also depends on adequate public infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources and water supplies are important determinants which affect capital and operating costs. Natural events, such as seismic events and severe climatic conditions, as well as sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Dependence on a Restricted Portfolio of Assets\n\nThe Company's operations at the Chelopech mine and Ada Tepe mine accounted for all of the Company's gold, silver and copper production in 2021. Any adverse condition affecting the Chelopech mine or Ada Tepe mine could have an adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Until such time as the Company acquires or develops other significant producing assets, the Company will continue to be dependent on its operations at the Chelopech mine and Ada Tepe mine for all of its cash flow provided by mining activities.\n\n## Production, Operating and Shipping Costs\n\nThe Company prepares estimates of future production, operating costs and other costs for its operations. Despite the Company's best efforts to budget and estimate such costs, many unforeseen factors can impact the Company's future production and total cash costs of production, such as the cost of inputs used in mining and processing operations, including the cost of fuel, energy, consumables, labour and equipment; availability of suitable high value complex concentrates to be processed at the smelter; regulatory factors; adequate offtake arrangements for sulphuric acid produced; grades and recoveries; royalties and taxes; foreign exchange rates; adverse climatic conditions and natural phenomena; and industrial accidents can impact the accuracy of these projections. As such, there can be no assurance that production and production cost estimates will be achieved. Failure to achieve production or total cash cost estimates could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company contracts for the shipment of its concentrates to its customers on varying terms and conditions, all subject to the prevailing rates, availability and general circumstances surrounding this market. Any material changes to the shipping markets and/or the terms and conditions of shipping contracts could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves\n\nThe Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves disclosed by the Company are estimates and no assurance can be given that the anticipated tonnages and grades will be achieved or that the indicated level of recovery will be realized. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, including many factors beyond the Company's control. Such estimation is a subjective process and the accuracy of any Mineral Resource estimate is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation. Shortterm operating factors, such as the need for orderly development of the ore bodies or the processing of",

        "page_content": "new or different ore grades, may cause the mining operation to be unprofitable in any particular accounting period. In addition, there can be no assurance that gold, silver or copper recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in larger scale tests under on-site conditions or during production.\n\nFluctuations in gold, silver and copper prices, results of drilling, change in cut-off grades, metallurgical testing, production and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimates may require revision of such Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates. The volume and grade of Mineral Reserves mined and processed, and the recovery rates achieved may not be the same as currently anticipated. Any material reduction in the estimated Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant decrease in the Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates could have a material adverse impact on the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets, mine properties, property, plant and equipment, depletion and depreciation charges, and estimated mine closure and rehabilitation costs, and could result in an impairment of the carrying value.\n\n## Inferred Mineral Resources\n\nInferred Mineral Resources cannot be converted to Mineral Reserves unless they are first converted into Measured and Indicated Resources as a result of continued exploration. Due to the uncertainty which may be attached to Inferred Mineral Resources, there can be no assurance that Inferred Mineral Resources will be upgraded to Measured and Indicated Resources. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\n\n## Need for Mineral Reserves\n\nAs mines have limited lives based on Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, the Company must continually develop, replace and expand its Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources as its mines produce gold, copper and silver concentrates. The Company's ability to maintain or increase its annual production of gold, copper and silver and its aggregate Mineral Reserves will be significantly dependent on its ability to expand its Mineral Resource base both at its existing mines and new mines it intends to bring into production in the future.\n\n## Exploration\n\nExploration is speculative and involves many risks that even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge utilized by the Company may not eliminate. Once a site with mineralization is discovered, it may take several years from the initial phases of drilling until production is possible. Substantial expenditures are normally required to locate and establish Mineral Reserves and to permit and construct mining and processing facilities. While the discovery of mineralization may result in substantial rewards if an orebody is proven, few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.\n\n## Financing, Interest Rate and Liquidity\n\nThe Company relies on the cash flows generated from its mining and smelting operations, including provisional payments received from its customers, cash on hand, available lines of credits under its RCF, and its ability to raise debt and equity from the capital markets to fund its operating, investment and liquidity needs. The cyclical nature of the Company's businesses, general economic conditions and the volatility of capital markets are such that conditions could change dramatically, affecting the Company's cash flow generating capability, its ability to maintain, or draw upon, its RCF or the existing terms under its concentrate sales or toll agreements, as well as its liquidity, cost of capital and its ability to access additional capital, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's earnings and cash flows and, in turn, could affect total shareholder returns. To reduce these risks, the Company: (i) prepares regular cash flow forecasts to monitor its capital requirements, available liquidity and compliance with its debt covenants; (ii) strives to maintain a prudent capital structure that is comprised primarily of equity financing and a long-term committed RCF; and (iii) targets a minimum level of liquidity comprised of surplus cash balances and/or available committed lines of credit to avoid being placed into a situation where it is required to raise additional capital at times when the costs or terms would be regarded as unfavourable.",

        "page_content": "The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the interest earned on the Company's cash and short-term investments and potential interest paid on future drawdowns under its RCF, which is based on a floating reference rate.\n\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company's operations will be profitable or that the Company will be able to raise capital on terms that it considers reasonable. Adverse commodity market, general economic conditions and adverse capital market conditions could result in a delay or the indefinite postponement of development or construction projects and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe declaration amount and payment of future dividends will be subject to the sole discretion of the Board after taking into account, among other things, the Company's financial position, current and forecast operating results, overall market conditions, its outlook for sustainable free cash flow and capital and any restrictions contained in any debt instrument and/or credit agreement to which the Company may be party to from time to time. Despite the implementation of a regular dividend policy, there is no guarantee of the amount, timing and sustainability of the dividend.\n\n## Foreign Country and Political\n\nThe majority of the Company's operations and business are outside of Canada, primarily in Eastern Europe, southern Africa and Ecuador, and as such, the Company's operations are exposed to various political and other risks and uncertainties.\n\nThese risks and uncertainties vary from country to country and include, but are not limited to, corruption; crime; extreme fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; high rates of inflation; labour unrest; expropriation and nationalization; renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licences, permits and  contracts;  absence  of  reliable  rule  of  law,  regulatory  and  judiciary  processes;  illegal  mining; environmental policies; extreme weather conditions; changes in taxation or royalty policies; restrictions on foreign  exchange  and  movements  of  capital;  changing  political  conditions;  inappropriate  laws  and regulations;  and  governmental  regulations  that  favour  or  require  the  awarding  of  contracts  to  local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction; the risks of war or civil unrest; terrorism; hostage taking or detainment of personnel; and military repression.\n\nAny changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in the countries in which the Company conducts its business and operations may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. It is difficult to predict the future political, social and economic direction of the countries in which the Company operates, and the impact government decisions could have on its business. Any political or economic instability in the countries in which the Company currently operates could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the consequences of factors such as pandemics and climate change may result in further political or economic instability in the countries in which the Company currently operates as scarce resources may be redistributed.\n\nIn addition, authorities and court systems in the countries in which the Company conducts its business and operations may be unpredictable. Challenges to foreign asset ownership, operations and regulatory compliance may be brought by government authorities for reasons that cannot be predicted and that may not be motivated by substantive law. It is also not unusual, in the context of a dispute resolution, for a party in these foreign jurisdictions to use the uncertainty of the legal environment as leverage in its business negotiations.\n\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements.",

        "page_content": "## Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption\n\nThe Company's operations are governed by, and involve interactions with, public officials and many levels of government in numerous countries. The Company's operations take place in jurisdictions ranked unfavourably under Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index. These jurisdictions may be vulnerable to the possibility of bribery, corruption, collusion, kickbacks, theft, improper commissions, facilitation payments, conflicts of interest and related party transactions. The Company is required to comply with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, including the Canadian Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act ('CFPOA'), as well as similar laws in the countries in which the Company conducts its business (together, the 'Anti-Corruption Laws'). In recent years, there has been a general increase in both the frequency of enforcement and the severity of penalties under such laws, resulting in greater scrutiny and punishment to companies convicted of violating anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws. Furthermore, a company may be found liable for violations by not only its employees, but also by third parties, with whom the Company has a business relationship, such as, but not limited to, contractors, suppliers, consultants, agents and customers. Although the Company has adopted a number of steps to mitigate bribery and corruption risks, which include, among other things, developing policies and procedures, establishing a robust third party due diligence process, implementing training programs and performing regular internal monitoring activities and audits, such measures may not always be effective in ensuring the strict compliance with AntiCorruption Laws by the Company, its employees or third parties. If the Company finds itself subject to an enforcement action or is found to be in violation of such laws, this may result in significant penalties, fines and/or sanctions imposed on the Company resulting in a material adverse impact on the Company's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Environmental, Health and Safety\n\nMining and smelting operations, including exploration, development and production of mineral deposits and disposal of tailings and hazardous materials, generally involve a high degree of risk and are subject to conditions and events beyond the Company's control. The Company's operations are subject to all of the hazards  and  risks  normally  encountered  in  the  mining  and  smelting  sectors  including:  adverse environmental conditions; industrial and environmental accidents; metallurgical and other processing problems; unusual or unexpected rock formations; ground or slope failures; structural cave-ins or slides; flooding or fires; seismic activity; rock bursts; equipment failures; failures to contain hazardous materials (including arsenic) within the designated areas, and periodic interruptions due to weather conditions, as well as intentional acts by individuals or groups who intend to harm or disrupt the Company's operations. These  risks  could  result  in  the  destruction  of  mines  or  processing  facilities,  the  failure  of  tailings management facilities and damage to infrastructure, causing partial or complete shutdowns, personal injury or death, environmental or other damage to the Company's properties or the properties of others, monetary losses and potential legal liability. Although the Company conducts extensive maintenance and monitoring and incurs significant costs to maintain its operations, equipment and infrastructure, including tailings management facilities, unanticipated failures or damage may occur that could cause injuries, production loss or environmental pollution resulting in significant legal and/or economic liability.\n\nThe Company's mining and smelting operations are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety regulations in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations address, among other things, emissions; air and water quality standards; land use; rehabilitation and reclamation; and safety and work environment  standards,  including  human  rights.  They  also  set  forth  limitations  on  the  generation, transportation, storage and disposal of various wastes, including hazardous wastes. Environmental, health and safety legislation continues to evolve and, while the Company takes active steps to monitor this legislation, it could result in stricter standards and enforcement, increased capital and operating costs and burdens  to  achieve  compliance,  increased  fines  and  penalties  for  non-compliance,  more  stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. Amendments to current laws and regulations governing the Company's mining, processing, development and exploration activities, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations, and cause increases in exploration expenses, capital expenditures, production costs or future rehabilitation costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties and/or expansion of existing properties.\n\nEnvironmental hazards may exist on the properties in which the Company holds interests, which are unknown to the Company at present, and which have been caused by previous or existing owners or",

        "page_content": "operators of the properties. The Company may also acquire properties with known or undiscovered environmental risk. Any indemnifications by the previous owners or others may not be adequate to pay all the fines, penalties and costs incurred related to such properties. Some of the Company's properties have also been used for mining, processing, smelting and related operations for many years before the Company acquired them and were acquired 'as is' or with assumed environmental liabilities from previous owners or operators. The Company has been required to address contamination at its properties in the past and may need to do so in the future, either for existing environmental conditions or for leaks, discharges or contamination that may arise from its ongoing operations or other contingencies. The cost of addressing environmental conditions or risks, and liabilities associated with environmental damage may be significant, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. Production at the Company's mines and processing facilities involves the use of various chemicals, including certain chemicals that are designated as hazardous substances. Contamination from hazardous substances, either at the Company's own properties or other locations for which it may be responsible, may subject the Company to liability for the investigation or remediation of contamination, as well as for claims seeking to recover costs for related property damage, personal injury or damage to natural resources. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn 2016, the Company completed a major multi-year capital program at its smelter in Namibia directed at modernizing the environmental equipment being utilized and debottlenecking its processing capacity. This included the completion of a sulphuric acid plant, which has reduced the plant's SO2 emissions. The Company  is  committed  to  making  further  improvements  to  the  health,  safety  and  environmental performance of the smelter and is continuously assessing the scope of any capital expenditures required to support these further improvements. The Company's environmental and occupational health and safety performance will be subject to continued monitoring by the Namibian authorities and deviation from expected environmental and occupational health and safety outcomes could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future production, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nGlobal  climate  change  continues  to  attract  considerable  public,  scientific  and  regulatory  attention. Governments and regulatory bodies at the international, national, regional and local levels have introduced or may introduce legislative changes to respond to the potential impacts of climate change. Additional government action to regulate climate change, including regulations on carbon emissions and energy use, could increase direct and indirect costs to the Company's operations and may have a material adverse impact on the Company. The Company's primary operations are located in Bulgaria and Namibia, both of which are signatories to the Paris Agreement Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the 'Paris Agreement'). Additional requirements from the Paris Agreement or other climate change regulations could lead to increased costs for the Company. For example, the European Green Deal, which is an ambitious set of policy initiatives brought forward by the European Commission with the overarching aim of making Europe climate neutral by 2050, will likely have significant effects which are not yet fully quantifiable.\n\nIn addition, the Company's operations are subject to the physical risks of climate change, which may include increased extreme weather events, rising sea levels and significantly restricted water availability. In the long term, the Company may be required to respond to the physical effects of climate change which could have a material adverse impact on the Company and cause increases in expenditures and costs or require abandonment or delays in developing new mining properties.\n\nManagement completed a focused climate change assessment and issued a report in December 2020, following the TCFD recommendations that highlights DPM's efforts to achieve reductions in energy and water use, emissions and its consumption of raw materials, and outlines the major identified risks and opportunities for DPM related to climate change. Based on the results of the assessment, existing management and governance practices will be supplemented to ensure climate change effects are, among other things, minimized, adequately included in the ongoing assessment of the risk and opportunities for the Company, and disclosed based on the requirements of the TCFD recommendations. Based on this assessment and other factors, management does not view climate change as an immediate material risk faced by the Company. However, as time goes on, it may have an impact on how the Company conducts its business. The Company's report on the impact of climate change has been posted on the Company's website at www.dundeeprecious.com.",

        "page_content": "## Reclamation and Mine Closure Costs\n\nAlthough variable depending on location and the governing authority, land reclamation and mine closure requirements are generally imposed on mining companies in order to minimize long-term effects of land disturbance. The Company is required by governments in the jurisdictions where it operates to provide financial assurances to cover any reclamation and mine closure obligations that it may have at its mine sites. The amount and nature of the Company's financial assurance obligations depend on a number of factors, including the Company's financial condition and reclamation and mine closure cost estimates. Reclamation and mine closure cost estimates can escalate because of new regulatory requirements, changes in site conditions, conditions in the receiving environment, or changes in analytical methods or scientific understanding of the impacts of various constituents in the environment. Changes to the form or amount of the Company's financial assurance obligations in respect of reclamation and mine closure obligations could significantly increase the Company's costs, making the maintenance and development of existing or new mines less economically feasible. Increases in financial assurance requirements could severely  impact  the  Company's  credit  capacity  and  its  ability  to  raise  capital  for  other  projects  or acquisitions. The Company may be unable to obtain letters of credit or surety bonds to satisfy these requirements, in which case it may be required to deposit cash as financial assurance. If the Company is unable to satisfy these requirements, it may face loss of permits, fines and other material and negative consequences, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company recognizes a liability for its rehabilitation expenses when a legal and/or constructive obligation is identified. The liability is measured at the present value of estimated costs required to rehabilitate the operating locations based on the risk-free nominal discount rates applicable to the countries in which the operations are located. The carrying value of the rehabilitation provision was $51.6 million and $52.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Changes in the underlying assumptions used to estimate the mine closure and rehabilitation costs as well as changes to environmental laws and regulations could cause material changes in the expected cost and the fair value of the estimated mine closure and rehabilitation costs and these changes could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Inadequate Controls over Financial Reporting\n\nThe Company assessed and tested its internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of National Instrument 52-109, Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings ('NI 52-109'), which require an annual assessment by management of the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company's failure to satisfy the requirements of NI 52-109 on an ongoing and timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of its financial statements, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business and common share  price.  In  addition,  any  failure  to  implement  required  new  or  improved  controls,  or  difficulties encountered in their implementation, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and share price.\n\nNo evaluation can provide absolute assurance that the Company's internal control over financial reporting will detect or uncover all material information required to be reported. Furthermore, there can be no certainty that the Company's internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. In addition, with ever increasing regulations and changes in the Company's business it is expected that the Company's internal control over financial reporting will continue to evolve and improve over time.\n\n## Stakeholder Relations and Licence to Operate\n\nThe Company's relationships with stakeholders are critical to ensure the future success of its existing operations and the construction and development of its projects. There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining and smelter activities on the environment and on communities impacted by such activities. Non-governmental organizations ('NGOs') and civil society groups, some of which oppose globalization and resource development, are often vocal critics of the mining industry and its practices, including the use of hazardous substances and the handling, transportation and storage of various waste, including hazardous waste. Adverse publicity generated by such NGOs and civil society groups or others related to the extractive industries generally, or the Company's operations",

Reputation loss may result in decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and an impediment to the Company's overall ability to advance its projects, obtain permits and licences and/or continue its operations, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Development Projects\n\nAs part of the Company's growth strategy, it invests in the development, design, construction, operation and optimization of existing and new facilities to enhance operations and increase future production. In developing these new projects, the Company may be required to incur significant preliminary engineering, environmental,  permitting  and  legal-related  expenditures  prior  to  determining  whether  a  project  is technically feasible and economically viable. The commercial viability of development projects is based on many factors, including: in the case of a mine, the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; metal recoveries, metal prices and, in the case of the smelter, toll rates, each of which are highly cyclical; availability of complex concentrate; government regulations; capital and operating costs of such projects; and foreign currency exchange rates. Development projects are also subject to the successful completion of feasibility studies, issuance of necessary governmental permits, subsequent appeals of such permits, including favourable EIA decisions, the acquisition of satisfactory surface or other land rights and having adequate funding arrangements in place.\n\nAll projects are approved for development on a project-by-project basis after considering strategic fit, inherent  risks,  and  expected  financial  returns.  This  approach,  which  incorporates  a  gated  project governance model, and combined with an experienced management team, staff and contract personnel, mitigates some of the risk associated with development projects. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be delays in obtaining the necessary permits or that the development or construction of any one or more projects will be completed on time, on budget or at all, or that the ultimate operating cost of the operation will not be higher than originally envisaged. In addition, to secure long lead times required for ordering equipment, the Company may place orders for equipment and make deposits thereon or advance projects before obtaining all requisite permits and licences. Such actions are taken only when the Company reasonably believes such licences or permits will be forthcoming prior to the requirement to expend the full amount of the purchase price. In the event a project, which was deemed economically viable, is not completed or does not operate at anticipated performance levels, the Company may be unable to fully recover its investment and be required to record a write-down. This, in turn, may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIt is not unusual in the mining industry, especially in jurisdictions like Bulgaria, Serbia, Ecuador and Namibia, for operations to experience construction challenges or delays and unexpected problems during the startup phase, resulting in delays and requiring more capital than anticipated. Given the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with any major capital project, there can be no assurance that construction will proceed in accordance with current expectations or at all, or that construction costs will be consistent with the budget, or that the operation will operate as planned.\n\n## Opposition to Mining\n\nThe Company's ability to advance its exploration and development activities, particularly in respect of its Loma Larga and Timok projects, may be affected to varying degrees by opposition to mining activities causing delays in obtaining or the inability to obtain necessary permits and/or resulting in government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, restrictions on future exploitation and production. Any shifts in political attitudes or changes in laws that may result in, among other things, significant changes to mining laws or any other national or local regulations or policies are beyond the Company's control and there is the risk that governments may adopt policies, which may extend to the deemed or actual expropriation of assets or revocation or cancellation of mining concession rights, that could adversely affect DPM's business.",

        "page_content": "## Information Technology Systems and Information Technology Systems Security Threats\n\nDPM has entered into agreements with third parties for hardware, software, telecommunications and other technology  services/systems  in  connection  with  its  operations  (including  information  technology, operational  technology  and  digital).  The  Company's  operations  depend,  in  part,  on  technology services/systems and how well the Company and its suppliers protect networks, equipment, technology systems and software against damage from a number of threats, including, but not limited to, cable cuts; damage to physical plants; natural disasters; terrorism; fire; power loss; hacking; computer viruses; vandalism and theft. The Company's operations also depend on the timely maintenance, upgrade and replacement of networks, equipment, technology systems and software as well as specific cybersecurity systems and governance to mitigate the risk of failures. Any of these and other events could result in data leakage, information loss, system failures, business interruptions and/or increases in capital expenses, which could have a material adverse impact the Company's reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nAlthough to date the Company and its operations have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that DPM will not incur such losses in the future. The Company's risk and exposure to these matters cannot be fully mitigated because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats. As a result, cyber security and the continued  development  and  enhancement  of  controls,  processes  and  practices  designed  to  protect systems,  computers,  software,  company  and  personal  data  and  networks  from  attack,  damage  or unauthorized access remain a priority. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\n\n## Personal Data Security\n\nThe Company is or will be subject to privacy and data security regulations in several of the jurisdictions that it operates in, such as Canada, Namibia and the European Union. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation , or GDPR, took effect in May 2018 and introduced increased regulations relating to personal data security. The GDPR requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal and sensitive data, including its use, protection and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. The Company could incur substantial costs in complying with various national privacy regulations as a result of having to make changes to prior business practices. Such developments may also require the Company to make system changes and develop new processes, further  affecting  its  compliance  costs.  Emerging  legislation  to  address  privacy  issues  could  impose additional obligations on the Company. In addition, violations of privacy-related regulations can result in significant penalties and reputational harm, which in turn could adversely impact the Company's business and results of operations.\n\n## Competition\n\nThe Company faces competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing, or capable of producing and processing, precious and base metals, as well as the ultimate sale of its production. Many of these companies may have greater financial resources, operational experience and technical capabilities than the Company. As a result of this competition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to acquire or maintain cost competitive operations or sell its production or process complex concentrate on economically acceptable terms, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company's Tsumeb operation also faces competition from other smelting companies as well as trading companies, notably those with blending operations, to secure complex feed. These competitive forces, together with changes in regulations for complex concentrate could affect the supply-demand dynamics of this market and could negatively affect Tsumeb's ability to secure complex copper concentrate on terms that are economic for Tsumeb to smelt this material and therefore have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment\n\nThe Company is required to undertake regular assessments to determine whether an impairment is required for any of its assets. The assessment of impairment requires significant judgments over a number of external and internal factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control, and requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to these factors for each CGU. External factors include considerations ranging from overall economic activity and the supply of and demand of the materials used in and products produced by the Company, to changes in commodity prices, toll rates, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and regulatory requirements. Internal factors include considerations such as production volume, ability to convert resources into reserves, capital and operating expenditures, and future development and expansion plans. There can be no assurance that management's estimate of the future will reflect actual events, further impairment charges may materialize and the timing and amount of such impairment charges are difficult to predict and may have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Enforcement of Legal Rights\n\nThe Company's material subsidiaries are organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions. Given that the Company's material assets are located outside of Canada, investors may have difficulty in effecting service of process within Canada and collecting from or enforcing against the Company, any judgments obtained by the Canadian courts or Canadian securities regulatory authorities and predicated on the civil liability provisions of Canadian securities legislation or otherwise. Similarly, in the event a dispute arises from the Company's foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdictions of courts in Canada.\n\n## Insurance and Uninsured Risks\n\nThe Company's business is subject to numerous risks and hazards, including severe climatic conditions, industrial accidents, equipment failures, labour disputes, unusual or unexpected geological conditions, ground or slope failures, cave-ins, changes in the regulatory environment and other natural events such as earthquakes. Such occurrences could result in damage to mineral properties or processing facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage to the Company's properties or the properties of others, delays in mining and processing, monetary losses and possible legal liability.\n\nIn order to eliminate or reduce certain risks, the Company purchases and maintains insurance coverage, subject to limits and deductibles that are considered reasonable and prudent. This insurance coverage does not cover all potential risks because of customary exclusions and/or limited availability, and in some instances, the Company's view that the cost of certain insurance coverage is excessive in relation to the risk or risks being covered. Further, there can be no assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, that such coverage will ultimately be sufficient, or that insurers will be able to fulfill their obligations should a claim be made.\n\nDue to recent dam failures, there has been increased scrutiny by insurance underwriters on tailings management facilities and insurance underwriters' tolerance for writing risk in the pollution liability market has been reduced due to the elevated level of risk. As a result, the Company opted not to acquire pollution liability insurance in 2021 relating to liquefaction results from tailings management facilities failures due to its view that the cost is excessive in relation to the limited risk or risks being covered. Furthermore, material losses that may arise from the COVID-19 outbreak are not covered by the Company's insurance. Losses arising from any events that are not fully insured may cause the Company to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Value of Investment Portfolio\n\nThe value of the Company's investment portfolio of securities will vary based on the underlying value of the securities acquired by the Company. The business activities of issuers in the resource industry ('Resource Issuers') are speculative and may be adversely affected by factors outside the control of those issuers. Resource Issuers may not hold or discover commercial quantities of precious metals or minerals, have limited access to capital, and profitability may be affected by adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, demand for commodities, general economic conditions and cycles, unanticipated depletion of reserves or resources, native land claims, liability for environmental damage, competition, imposition of tariffs, duties",

Since the Company has and may continue to invest primarily in securities issued by Resource Issuers engaged in the mining industry or related resource businesses (including junior issuers), the value of the Company's investment portfolio of securities may be more volatile than portfolios with a more diversified investment focus. In some cases, the value of securities owned by the Company may also be affected by such factors as investor demand, specified rights or restrictions associated with the security, general market trends or regulatory restrictions. Fluctuations in the market values of such securities may occur for a number of reasons beyond the control of the Company, and there can be no assurance that an adequate liquid market will exist for securities or that quoted market prices at any given time will properly reflect the value at which the Company could monetize these securities.\n\n## Laws, Regulations and Permitting\n\nThe  activities  of  the  Company  are  subject  to  various  laws  and  regulations  governing  prospecting, exploration, development, production, taxes, labour commercial standards and occupational health, mine safety, toxic substances, land use, water use, land claims of local people, archaeological discovery and other matters. Although the Company currently carries out its operations and business in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, no assurance can be given that new laws, rules and regulations will not be enacted or that existing laws, rules and regulations will not be changed or be applied in a manner which could limit or curtail production or development. Furthermore, amendments to current laws and regulations  governing  operations  and  activities  of  mining,  milling  and  processing  or  more  stringent implementation thereof could cause costs and delays that could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company's current and future operations and development activities are subject to receiving and maintaining permits from appropriate governmental authorities. Although the Company currently has the required permits for its current operations, there can be no assurance that delays will not occur in connection with obtaining all necessary renewals of such permits for the existing operations or additional permits for planned new operations or changes to existing operations that could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nFailure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining and processing operations or in the exploration or development of mineral properties may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining and processing activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations, including environmental laws.\n\n## Labour Relations\n\nWhile the Company has good relations with both its unionized and non-unionized employees, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain positive relationships with its employees or that new collective agreements will be entered into without work interruptions. In addition, relations between the Company and its employees may be impacted by regulatory or governmental changes introduced by the relevant authorities in whose jurisdictions that the Company operates. Adverse changes in such legislations or in the relationship between the Company and its employees could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe Company has entered into a collective agreement with its employees in Bulgaria, for Chelopech and Ada Tepe, that is in effect until July 2023. Tsumeb entered into a new collective agreement with its employees as of March 2021 which will continue to be in effect until February 2023.\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe Company operates in Canada and several foreign jurisdictions, through a number of subsidiary intermediary entities. As a result, it is subject to potential changes in tax laws, judicial interpretations in respect thereof, and the administrative and/or assessing practices of tax authorities in each jurisdiction. While these tax risks are proactively managed and monitored by senior management and outside tax",

        "page_content": "experts, there can be no assurance that there will not be changes to these laws or interpretations that could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In December 2020, the Namibian Ministry of Finance announced that tax incentives under the EPZ Act would no longer be granted, effective December 31, 2020, and that companies with EPZ status, such as Tsumeb, would continue to benefit from these incentives up to December 31, 2025. The EPZ regime is expected to be replaced by a new regime known as the SSEZ, which is expected to be implemented in 2022.\n\nThe Company believes that it is not currently a passive foreign investment company ('PFIC') for U.S. Federal income tax purposes and it does not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future. However, the PFIC rules are complex, and, as a Canadian company publicly listed on the TSX, the Company does not operate its business in a manner specifically intended to avoid being classified as a PFIC. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the Company will not be considered a PFIC. The Company also has not and does not expect to provide any shareholder with information that will enable a U.S. shareholder to make a qualified electing fund election in respect of the Company. To the extent that the Company is a PFIC in respect of any taxable year, its status as such would have adverse tax consequences for taxable U.S. investors. U.S. investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the PFIC rules and the potential adverse U.S. Federal income tax consequences to which they may be subject to in respect of an investment in the Company's common shares.\n\n## Future Plans\n\nAs part of its overall business strategy, the Company examines, from time to time, opportunities to acquire and/or develop new mineral projects and businesses. A number of risks and uncertainties are associated with these potential transactions and DPM may not realize all of the anticipated benefits. The acquisition and the development of new projects and businesses are subject to numerous risks, including the particular attributes  of  the  deposit,  political,  regulatory,  design,  construction,  labour,  operating,  technical,  and technological risks, as well as uncertainties relating to the availability and cost of capital, future metal prices, foreign currency rates and toll rates, in the case of the smelter. Failure to successfully realize the anticipated benefits associated with one or more of these initiatives successfully could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Business Development, Acquisitions and Integration\n\nFrom time to time the Company examines opportunities to acquire and/or develop new mineral projects, additional mining assets and businesses. Any acquisition and/or development that the Company may choose to complete may be of a significant size, may change the scale of the Company's business and operations, and may expose the Company to new geographic, political, operating, financial and geological risks. The Company's success in its acquisition and/or development activities depends on its ability to identify  suitable  acquisition  candidates,  negotiate  acceptable  terms  for  any  such  acquisition  or development,  and  integrate  the  acquired  operations  successfully  with  those  of  the  Company.  Any acquisitions and/or developments would be accompanied by risks, including the particular attributes of the deposit, political, regulatory, design, construction, labour, operating, technical, and technological risks, as well as uncertainties relating to the availability and cost of capital, future metal prices, foreign currency rates, and toll rates, in the case of a smelter. Furthermore, there may be a significant change in commodity prices after the Company has committed to complete the transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio; a material ore body may prove to be below expectations; the Company may have difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise, and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; the integration of the acquired business or assets may disrupt the Company's ongoing business and its relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and contractors; and the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. In the event that the Company chooses to raise debt capital to finance any such acquisition or development, the Company's leverage will be increased. If the Company chooses to use equity as consideration  for  such  acquisition  or  development,  existing  shareholders  may  experience  dilution. Alternatively, the Company may choose to finance any such acquisition or development with its existing resources. There can be no assurance that the Company would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions or developments. Failure to successfully realize the anticipated benefits associated with one or more of these initiatives successfully",

        "page_content": "could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Land Title\n\nAlthough the title to the properties owned by the Company were reviewed by, or on behalf of, the Company, there can be no assurances that there are no title defects affecting such properties or the shares of subsidiaries that hold such properties. Title insurance generally is not available, and the Company's ability to ensure that it has obtained a secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. The Company has not conducted surveys of the claims in which it holds direct or indirect interests and, therefore, the precise area and location of such claims may be in doubt. Accordingly, the Company's interest in mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered liens, agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. In addition, the Company may be unable to operate its properties as permitted or to enforce its rights with respect to its properties.\n\n## Market Price of Common Shares\n\nThe common shares of the Company are listed on the TSX. The price of these and other shares making up the mining sector have historically experienced substantial volatility, often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved. These factors include macroeconomic developments in North America and globally, including those impacting the price of commodities, interest rates, market perceptions concerning equity securities generally and the precious and base metal sectors in particular, and factors that may be specific to the Company, including daily traded volumes of the common shares.\n\nAs a result of any of these factors, the market price of the common shares at any given point in time may not accurately reflect the Company's long-term value, which in turn could impact the ability of the Company to raise equity or raise equity on terms considered to be acceptable. Securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. The Company may in the future be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management's attention and resources and have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Dilution to Common Shares\n\nDuring the life of the Company's outstanding stock options granted under its share-based compensation plans, the holders are given an opportunity to profit from an increase in the market price of the Company's common shares with a resulting dilution in the interest of shareholders. The holders of stock options may exercise such securities at a time when the Company may have been able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favourable than those provided by the outstanding rights. The increase in the number of common shares in the market, if all or part of these outstanding rights were exercised, and the possibility of sales of these additional shares may have a negative effect on the price of the Company's common shares.\n\nThe Company may need to raise additional financing in the future through the issuance of additional equity securities. If the Company raises additional funding by issuing additional equity securities, such financings may substantially dilute the interests of shareholders of the Company and reduce the value of their investment in the Company's securities.\n\n## Reputational Risk\n\nAs a result of the increased usage and the speed and the global reach of social media and other web-based applications used to generate, publish and discuss user-generated content and to connect with others, the Company is at a much greater risk of losing control over how it is perceived by the public. Damage to the Company's reputation can be the result of the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events (for example, with respect to the handling of environmental matters, community relations or litigation), and could include any negative publicity, whether credible, factual, true or not. While the Company places a great emphasis on protecting and nurturing its reputation, it does not ultimately have direct control over how it is",

Reputation loss may lead to increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations, decreased investor confidence and an impediment to the Company's overall ability to advance its projects, thereby having a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Foreign Subsidiaries and Repatriation of Funds\n\nThe Company conducts its operations through foreign subsidiaries and substantially all of its assets are held in such entities. Accordingly, any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between or among DPM and such entities, could restrict or impact the Company's ability to fund or receive cash from its operations. Any such limitations, or the perception that such limitations may exist now or in the future, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the corporate law and other laws governing the Company's foreign subsidiaries differ materially from Canadian corporate and other laws. Challenges to the Company's ownership or title to the shares of such subsidiaries or the subsidiaries' title or ownership of their assets may occur based on alleged formalistic defects or other grounds that are based on form rather than in substance. Any such challenges may cost time and resources for the Company or cause other adverse effects.\n\n## Key Executives and Key Personnel\n\nThe Company is dependent on the services of key executives, including its President and CEO and a number of highly skilled and experienced executives and key personnel. The loss of these persons or the Company's inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have a material adverse impact on the Company's future operations and business.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nCertain of the directors and officers of the Company also serve as directors and/or officers of other companies involved in natural resource exploration and development or investment in or provide services to natural resource companies, including Dundee Corporation, and other companies in which the Company has investments, and consequently there exists the possibility for such directors and officers to be in a position of conflict. The Board is aware of these potential conflicts and these individuals recuse themselves from the Board deliberations and voting when necessary. The Company expects that any decision made by any of such directors and officers will be made in accordance with their duties and obligations to deal fairly and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, but there can be no assurance in this regard. In addition, each of the directors is required to declare and refrain from voting on any matter in which such directors may have a conflict of interest in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Canadian Business Corporations Act and other applicable laws.\n\n## Litigation Risk\n\nLegal proceedings may be brought against the Company, for example, litigation based on its business activities, environmental laws, tax matters, volatility in its stock price or failure to comply with its disclosure obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or prospects. Regulatory and government agencies may bring legal proceedings in connection with the enforcement of applicable laws and regulations, and as a result the Company may be subject to expenses of investigations and defense, fines or penalties for violations if proven, and potentially cost and expense to remediate, increased operating costs or changes to operations, and cessation of operations if ordered to do so or required in order to resolve such proceedings. The Company may also become party to disputes governed by the rules of international arbitration. In the event of a dispute arising at its foreign operations, the Company may be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of foreign courts or may not be successful in subjecting foreign persons to the jurisdiction of courts in Canada. The Company's inability to enforce its rights could have an adverse effect on its future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Shareholder Activism\n\nIn recent years, publicly-traded companies have been increasingly subject to demands from activist shareholders advocating for changes to corporate governance practices, such as executive compensation",

There can be no assurances that activist shareholders will not publicly advocate for the Company to make certain corporate governance changes or engage in certain corporate actions. Responding to challenges from activist shareholders, such as proxy contests, media campaigns or other activities, could be costly and time consuming and could have an adverse effect on the Company reputation and divert the attention and resources of the Company management and the Company's board of directors, which could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. Even if the Company does undertake such corporate governance changes or corporate actions, activist shareholders may continue to promote or attempt to effect further changes and may attempt to acquire control of the Company to implement such changes. If shareholder activists seeking to increase short-term shareholder value are elected to the Company's board of directors, this could adversely affect the Company's business and future operations. Additionally, shareholder activism could create uncertainty about the Company's future strategic direction, resulting in loss of future business  opportunities,  which  could  adversely  affect  the  Company's  business,  future  operations, profitability and ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\n\n## Public Company Obligations\n\nThe Company's business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both the Company's compliance costs and the risk of non-compliance, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's share price.\n\nThe Company is subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulated  organizations,  including  the Canadian  Securities  Administrators,  the  TSX,  and  the International Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity creating many new requirements. The Company's efforts to comply with rules and obligations could result in increased general and administration expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities.\n\n## DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThe Company's management, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer ('CEO') and the Chief Financial Officer ('CFO'), has designed disclosure controls and procedures ('DC&P') and internal control over financial reporting ('ICFR'), as defined in NI 52-109, based on the Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013)  developed  by  COSO  (Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway Commission).\n\nThe CEO and CFO evaluated or caused to be evaluated under their supervision the design and operating effectiveness of the DC&P and ICFR as defined by NI 52-109 as of December 31, 2021. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that the Company's DC&P and ICFR were designed and operating effectively as of December 31, 2021.\n\nNI 52-109 also requires Canadian public companies to disclose in their MD&A any change in ICFR that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, ICFR. No material changes were made to the ICFR in the year ended December 31, 2021. Only reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance that misstatements are prevented or detected on a timely basis by ICFR can be provided due to the inherent limitations of the ICFR system. Such limitations also apply to the effectiveness of ICFR as it is also possible that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in compliance with policies and procedures.\n\n## CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nCertain statements and other information included in this MD&A and our other disclosure documents constitute 'forward looking information' or 'forward looking statements' within the meaning of applicable securities legislation, which we refer to collectively hereinafter as 'Forward Looking Statements'.\n\nForward Looking Statements are statements that are not historical facts and are generally, but not always, identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as 'plans', 'expects', 'is expected', 'budget', 'scheduled', 'estimates', 'forecasts', 'guidance', 'outlook', 'intends', 'anticipates', 'believes', or variations",

This list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of the Company's Forward Looking Statements.\n\nThe Forward Looking Statements are based on what the Company's management considers to be reasonable assumptions, beliefs, expectations and opinions based on the information currently available to it. Without limitation to the foregoing, the following section outlines certain specific Forward Looking Statements contained in the 'Three-Year Outlook' section of this MD&A, unless otherwise noted, and provides certain material assumptions used to develop such Forward Looking Statements and material risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Forward Looking Statements (which are provided without limitation to the additional general risk factors discussed herein):\n\nOre processed: assumes Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines perform at planned levels. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which is failure of plant, equipment or processes to operate as anticipated.\n\nCash cost per tonne of ore processed: assumes Chelopech and Ada Tepe ore mined/milled are in line with the guidance provided; foreign exchange rates remain at or around current levels; and operating expenses at Chelopech and Ada Tepe are at planned levels. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated ore mined/milled; a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Euro; and unexpected increases in labour and other operating costs.\n\nMetals contained in concentrate produced: assumes grades and recoveries are consistent with current estimates  of  Mineral  Resources  and  Mineral  Reserves  and  DPM's  current  expectations;  and  ore mined/milled is consistent with guidance. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated ore grades, recovery rates and ore mined/milled.\n\nAll-in sustaining costs: assumes that metals contained in concentrate produced and cash cost per tonne of ore processed at Chelopech and Ada Tepe are each in line with the guidance provided; copper and silver prices remain at or around current levels; the timing, destination and commercial terms in respect of concentrate deliveries are consistent with DPM's current expectations; payable metals in concentrate sold are consistent with the guidance provided, and general and administrative expenses, sustaining capital expenditures and leases are consistent with the guidance provided. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: lower than anticipated metals contained in concentrate produced, concentrate deliveries and metal prices; a higher than anticipated cash cost per tonne of ore processed; and higher than anticipated sustaining capital expenditures, leases and general and administrative expenses.\n\nComplex concentrate smelted at Tsumeb: assumes no significant disruption in equipment availability, planned maintenance activities or concentrate supply. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: unanticipated operational issues; delays in maintenance activities; lower than anticipated equipment availability; and disruptions to or changes in the supply of complex concentrate, including changes in the proportion of third party and Chelopech feed.\n\nCash cost per tonne of complex concentrate smelted: assumes complex concentrate smelted is consistent with the guidance provided; no delays in planned maintenance activities; sulphuric acid prices are at or around current levels; sulphuric acid production and operating expenses are at planned levels; and foreign exchange rates remain at or around current levels. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: complex concentrate smelted and sulphuric acid production are lower than anticipated; sulphuric acid prices are lower than anticipated; strengthening of the ZAR relative to the U.S. dollar; and higher than anticipated operating and transportation costs due to a variety of factors, including higher than anticipated inflation, labour and other operating costs.\n\nSustaining and growth capital expenditures: assumes foreign exchange rates remain at or around current levels, and all capital projects proceed as planned and at a cost that is consistent with the budget established for each project. Subject to a number of risks, the more significant of which are: technical challenges, delays related to securing necessary permits and approvals, equipment deliveries, equipment performance, and the speed with which work is performed; availability of qualified labour; and changes in project parameters and estimated costs, including foreign exchange impacts.",

Canadian  reporting  requirements  for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by NI 43-101. Subject to the SEC Modernization Rules described below, the United States reporting requirements are currently governed by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') Industry Guide 7 ('SEC Industry Guide 7') under the Securities Act of 1933. The definitions used in NI 43-101 are incorporated by reference from the CIM Definition Standards. For example, the terms 'mineral reserve', 'proven mineral reserve' and 'probable mineral reserve' are Canadian mining terms as defined in NI 43-101, and these definitions differ from the definitions in SEC Industry Guide 7. Furthermore, while the terms 'mineral resource', 'measured mineral resource', 'indicated mineral resource' and 'inferred mineral resource' are defined in NI 43-101, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7. Under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a 'final' or 'bankable' feasibility study is required to report reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must  be  filed  with  the  appropriate  governmental  authority.  Further,  under  SEC  Industry  Guide  7, mineralization may not be classified as a 'reserve' unless the determination has been made that the mineralization  could  be  economically  and  legally  produced  or  extracted  at  the  time  the  reserve determination is made. Any reserves reported by the Company in the future and in compliance with NI 43101 may not qualify as 'reserves' under SEC Industry Guide 7. Further, until recently, the SEC has not recognized the reporting of mineral deposits which do not meet the SEC Industry Guide 7 definition of 'reserve'. The SEC adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These amendments became effective February 25, 2019 (the 'SEC Modernization Rules') with compliance required for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The SEC Modernization Rules replace the historical disclosure requirements for mining issuers that were included in SEC Industry Guide 7, which will be rescinded from and after the required compliance date of the SEC Modernization Rules. As a result of the adoption of the SEC Modernization Rules, the SEC now recognizes estimates of 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' and 'inferred",

In addition, the SEC has amended its definitions of 'proven mineral reserves' and 'probable mineral reserves' to be 'substantially similar' to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards, incorporated by reference in NI 43-101. Readers are cautioned that while the above terms are 'substantially similar' to the corresponding CIM Definition Standards, there are differences in the definitions under the SEC Modernization Rules and the CIM Definition Standards. Accordingly, there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the Company may report as 'proven mineral reserves', 'probable mineral reserves', 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' and 'inferred mineral resources' under NI 43-101 would be the same had the Company prepared the reserve or resource estimates under the standards adopted under the SEC Modernization Rules. Readers are also cautioned that while the SEC will now recognize 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' and 'inferred mineral resources', it should not be assumed that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves. Mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to assume that any 'measured mineral resources', 'indicated mineral resources' or 'inferred mineral resources' that the Company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable. Further, 'inferred mineral resources' have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically. Therefore, readers are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the 'inferred mineral resources' exist. In accordance with Canadian securities laws, estimates of 'inferred mineral resources' cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies, except in limited circumstances where permitted under NI 43-101. For the above reasons, information contained in this MD&A containing descriptions of the Company's mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by United States companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.",

(the 'Company') and all information in this financial report are the responsibility of management. The consolidated financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with International  Financial  Reporting Standards  and,  where  appropriate,  include  management's  best  estimates  and  judgments. Management has reviewed the financial information presented throughout this report and has ensured it is consistent with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nManagement maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded from loss or unauthorized use, and that financial information is timely and reliable. However, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed and implemented, has inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect all misstatements.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that management fulfils its responsibilities for financial reporting and is ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving the consolidated financial statements. The Board carries out this responsibility principally through its Audit Committee.\n\nThe Board of Directors appoints the Audit Committee, and all of its members are independent directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management and the auditors to review internal controls, audit results, accounting principles and related matters. The Board of Directors approves the consolidated financial statements on the recommendation from the Audit Committee.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent firm of Chartered Professional Accountants, was appointed by the shareholders at the last annual meeting to examine the consolidated financial statements and provide an independent professional opinion.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\nAssessment of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of property, plant and equipment related to the Tsumeb CGU\n\nRefer to note 2.2 -Significant accounting policies and note 10 -Property, plant and equipment to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Company's property, plant and equipment (PP&E) net book value amounted to $335.3 million as at December 31, 2021, which includes a portion related to the Tsumeb Cash Generating Unit (CGU). Management assesses at each reporting date whether indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist. If any indication of impairment or impairment reversal exists, an estimate of the CGU's recoverable amount is calculated.\n\nManagement uses significant judgment in assessing whether indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist that would necessitate impairment testing, including external and internal factors related to changes in forecasted toll rates, the foreign exchange rate, production volumes, capital and operating expenditures, and the discount rate.\n\nWe considered this a key audit matter due to (i) the significant judgment by management in assessing whether indicators of impairment or impairment reversal exist that would necessitate impairment testing of the PP&E related to the Tsumeb CGU; (ii) the significant audit effort and subjectivity in performing procedures related to management's assessment; and (iii) the assistance of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of valuation.\n\nOur approach to addressing the matter included the following procedures, among others:\n\n- \u0194 Evaluated the reasonableness of management's assessment of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of the PP&E related to the Tsumeb CGU:\n- glyph<c=16,font=/AACOPH+SymbolMT> Assessed the completeness of external and internal factors that could be considered as indicators of impairment or impairment reversal of the PP&E by considering evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n- glyph<c=16,font=/AACOPH+SymbolMT> Assessed the external and internal factors related to changes in forecasted toll rates, the foreign exchange rate, production volumes and capital and operating expenditures by comparing to historical and current toll rates in tolling agreements, analyst consensus data and considering the current and past performance of the Tsumeb CGU. glyph<c=3,font=/AADKMD+Calibri>\n- glyph<c=16,font=/AACOPH+SymbolMT> Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge in the field of valuation assisted us in assessing the reasonableness of the discount rate determined by management. glyph<c=3,font=/AADKMD+Calibri>",

These metal exposure adjustments are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver (together, metal) content in the concentrate received and processed by Tsumeb multiplied by the percentage payable in the agreement to (ii) the metal in the blister delivered to the customer and in the in-circuit material still being processed.\n\nThe metal exposure adjustment is subject to estimation, including the amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered where final assays have not been completed.\n\nWe considered this a key audit matter due to (i) the significant judgment by management in estimating the Tsumeb metal exposure adjustment, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty and (ii) the significant audit effort and subjectivity in performing procedures related to management's assumptions.\n\n## Other information\n\nManagement is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Management's Discussion and Analysis, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report and the information, other than the consolidated financial statements and our auditor's report thereon, included in the annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur approach to addressing the matter included the following procedures, among others:\n\n- \u0194 Tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to the metal exposure process, including management's estimate of the metal exposure adjustment.\n- \u0194 Observed the metal stockpile survey performed near year-end.\n- \u0194 Obtained a customer confirmation in respect of the quantities of concentrate treated, blister returned and metal in-circuit at year-end.\n- \u0194 Tested how management estimated the Tsumeb metal exposure adjustment at year-end and evaluated the reasonableness of the estimated amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered, where final assays have not been completed at year-end, by comparing to historical recovery rates and historical adjustments to provisional assays.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed includes any contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred. At the date of acquisition, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values. The Company also recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value.\n\nThe excess, if any, of the consideration paid and the amount of any non-controlling interest recognized over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. In the case of a bargain purchase, where the total consideration paid and the non-controlling interest recognized are less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nSubsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is acquired by the Company and they are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company using consistent accounting policies. All inter-company balances, revenues and expenses and earnings and losses resulting from inter-company transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are a separate component of the Company's equity. Non-controlling interests consist of the non-controlling interests on the date of the original business combination plus the non-controlling interests' share of changes in equity since the date of acquisition.\n\n## (b) Critical accounting estimates and judgments\n\nThe preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities on the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amounts of revenues and expenses during the period reported. Estimates and assumptions are evaluated and are based on management's experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.\n\nThe significant  areas  of  estimation and/or  judgment considered  by  management  in  preparing  the consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to:\n\n- x commencement of commercial production (note 2.2(l)) ;\n- x Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates (note 2.2(l)) ;\n- x impairment of non-financial assets (note 2.2(p)) ;\n- x rehabilitation provisions and contingencies (note 2.2(q)) ;\n- x revenue recognition related to toll smelting arrangements (note 2.2(t)) ;and\n- x deferred income tax assets and liabilities (note 2.2(x)) .",

Non-monetary  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rates on the dates that their fair values are determined. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at historical cost are translated at the exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Income and expense items are translated at the exchange rate on the dates of the transactions. Exchange gains or losses resulting from the translation of these amounts are included in net earnings (loss), except those arising on the translation of equity instruments that are fair valued through other comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Foreign operations\n\nForeign operations are comprised of subsidiaries of the Company that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates on the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates on the dates of the transactions. Foreign currency differences are recognized as currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive  income  (loss).  Accumulated  currency  translation  adjustments  are  reclassified  to  net earnings (loss) upon the disposal of the associated foreign operation when the gain or loss on disposal is recognized. Prior to the sale of MineRP in May 2021, MineRP was the only foreign operation of the Company with a functional currency being South African Rand ('ZAR') and its subsidiaries with functional currencies denominated in the currencies of the primary economic environments in which each of the subsidiaries operated.\n\n## (e) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash deposits, guaranteed investment certificates and/or other highly rated and liquid securities with an original maturity of less than three months.\n\n## (f) Inventories\n\nInventories of ore and concentrates are measured and valued at the lower of average production cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price of the concentrates in the ordinary course of business based on the prevailing metal prices on the reporting date, less estimated costs to complete production and to bring the concentrates to sale. Production costs that are inventoried include the costs directly related to bringing the inventory to its current condition and location, such as materials, labour, other direct costs (including external services and depreciation, depletion and amortization), production related overheads and royalties.\n\nInventories of sulphuric acid, arsenic calcines, spare parts, supplies and other materials are valued at the lower of average cost and net realizable value. Obsolete, redundant and slow moving inventories are identified at each reporting date and written down to their net realizable values. Arsenic calcines not expected to be processed in the next 12 months are classified as long-term inventory and included in other long-term assets.",

The Company determines the classification of financial assets at the time of initial recognition based on the Company's business model and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nAll financial assets are recognized initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not at FVPL, directly attributable transaction costs on the trade date at which the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.\n\nFinancial  assets  with  embedded  derivatives  are  considered  in  their  entirety  when  determining  their classification  at  FVPL  or  at  amortized  cost.  The  Company  has  classified  accounts  receivable  on provisionally priced sales as financial assets measured at FVPL. Other accounts receivable held for collection of contractual cash flows are measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Subsequent measurement - Financial assets at FVPL\n\nFinancial assets measured at FVPL include financial assets management intends to sell in the short term and any derivative financial instrument that is not designated as a hedging instrument in a hedge relationship. Financial assets measured at FVPL are carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position with changes in fair value recognized in other (income) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The Company's investment in Sabina special warrants and its accounts receivable on provisionally priced sales are classified as financial assets at FVPL.\n\n## Subsequent measurement - Financial assets at FVOCI\n\nFinancial assets measured at FVOCI are non-derivative financial assets that are not held for trading and the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to measure the assets at FVOCI. The Company's investments in publicly traded equity securities are classified as financial assets at FVOCI.\n\nAfter initial measurement, investments measured at FVOCI are subsequently measured at fair value with unrealized gains or losses recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n\n## Subsequent measurement - Financial assets at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost are non-derivative financial assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows, where those cash flows represent repayments of principal and interest. The Company's other accounts receivable is classified as financial assets at amortized cost.\n\nDividends from all financial assets are recognized in other (income) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) when the right to receive the dividend is established.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial asset is derecognized when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or are transferred, or the Company no longer retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.",

The Company has elected to apply the simplified approach to impairment as permitted by IFRS 9, Financial Instruments , which requires the expected lifetime loss to be recognized at the time of initial recognition of the receivable. To measure estimated credit losses, accounts receivable have been grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics, including the number of days past due. An impairment loss is reversed in subsequent periods if the amount of the expected loss decreases and the decrease can be objectively related to an event occurring after the initial impairment was recognized.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nFinancial liabilities are measured at amortized cost, unless they are required to be measured at FVPL as is the case for held for trading or derivative instruments, or the Company has opted to measure the financial liability at FVPL. The Company's financial liabilities include accounts payable and accrued liabilities and long-term debt, which are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nA financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires with any associated gain or loss recognized in other (income) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (h) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value on the dates they are entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nFor a derivative instrument to qualify for hedge accounting, the Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between a hedging instrument and hedged item, as well as its risk management objectives and  strategy  for  undertaking  the  hedging  transaction.  The  Company  also  documents  its assessment, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative used to hedge an underlying exposure is highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item.\n\nThe full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity is more than 12 months.\n\n## Foreign exchange option contracts designated as cash flow hedges\n\nThe Company designates the intrinsic value of foreign exchange option contracts entered to hedge a portion of its projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies as cash flow hedges.",

Such techniques may include using recent arm's length transactions; reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same; discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. These valuation models require the use of assumptions, including future stock price volatility and probability of exercise.\n\nChanges in the underlying assumptions could materially impact the Company's investments at FVPL. Further details on measurement of the fair values of financial instruments are provided in note 7 .\n\n## (k) Mineral exploration and evaluation expenditures\n\nExploration and evaluation activities involve the search for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, the assessment of technical and operational feasibility and the determination of an identified Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve's commercial viability. Once the legal right to explore has been acquired, exploration and evaluation expenditures are expensed as incurred until economic production is probable. Exploration expenditures in areas where there is a reasonable expectation to convert existing estimated Mineral Resources to estimated Mineral Reserves or to add additional Mineral Resources with additional drilling and evaluations in areas near existing Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves and existing or planned production facilities, are capitalized.\n\nExploration properties that contain Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves, but for which a development decision has not yet been made, are subject to periodic review for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the project's carrying value may not be recoverable.\n\nExploration and evaluation assets are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Mines under construction' when the technical feasibility and commercial viability of extracting the Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves are demonstrable and construction has commenced or a decision to construct has been made. Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment before reclassification to 'Mines under construction', and the impairment charge, if any, is recognized through net earnings (loss).",

The estimation of Mineral Resources is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates regarding economic and geological data and these assumptions and estimates impact the decision to either expense or capitalize exploration and evaluation expenditures. Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events and circumstances in order to determine if an economically viable extraction operation can be established. Any revision to any of these assumptions and estimates could result in the impairment of the capitalized exploration and evaluation costs. If new information becomes available after expenditures have been capitalized that the recovery of these expenditures is no longer probable, the expenditures capitalized are written down to the recoverable amount and charged to net earnings (loss) in the period the new information becomes available.\n\n## (l) Mine properties\n\n## Mine Properties - Mines under construction\n\nAll expenditures undertaken in the development, construction, installation and/or completion of mine production facilities are capitalized and initially classified as 'Mines under construction'. All expenditures related to the construction of mine declines and orebody access, including mine shafts and ventilation raises, are considered to be capital development and are capitalized. Expenses incurred after reaching the orebody are regarded as operating development costs and are included in the cost of ore hoisted.\n\nUpon  the  commencement  of  commercial  production,  all  related  assets  included  in  'Mines  under construction' are reclassified to 'Mine Properties - Producing mines' or 'Property, plant and equipment'. Determination of commencement of commercial production is a complex process and requires significant assumptions and estimates. The commencement of commercial production is defined as the date when the mine is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. The Company considers primarily the following factors, among others, when determining the commencement of commercial production:\n\n- x All major capital expenditures to achieve a consistent level of production and desired capacity have been incurred;\n- x A reasonable period of testing of the mine plant and equipment has been completed;\n- x A predetermined percentage of design capacity of the mine and mill has been reached; and\n- x Required production levels, grades and recoveries have been achieved.\n\n## Mine Properties - Producing mines\n\nAll assets reclassified from 'Mines under construction' to 'Producing mines' are stated at cost less accumulated depletion and accumulated impairment charges. Costs incurred for the acquisition of land are stated at cost.\n\nThe initial cost of a producing mine comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation costs, and for qualifying assets, applicable borrowing costs during construction. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nWhen a mine construction project moves into production, the capitalization of certain mine construction costs ceases, and from that point on, costs are either regarded as inventory costs or expensed as cost of sales, except for costs related to mine additions or improvements, mine development or mineable reserve development, which qualify for capitalization.",

The Company prepares its Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates based on information related to the geological data on the size, depth and shape of the orebody which is compiled by appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates are based upon  factors  such  as  metal  prices,  capital  requirements,  production  costs,  foreign  exchange  rates, geotechnical and geological assumptions and judgments made in estimating the size and grade of the orebody. Mineral Resource and Mineral Reserve estimates, together with forecast production, determine the life of mine estimates and therefore changes in the Mineral Resource or Mineral Reserve estimates may impact the carrying value of exploration and evaluation assets (note 2.2(k)) , mine properties, property, plant  and  equipment (note  2.2(m)), depletion  and  depreciation  charges (note  2.2(m)), rehabilitation provisions (note 2.2(q)), and deferred income tax assets (note 2.2(x)).\n\n## (m) Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  stated  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated impairment charges.\n\nThe initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing it to a working condition for its intended use, the initial estimate of the rehabilitation costs, and for qualifying assets, applicable borrowing costs during construction. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount of cash consideration paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Where an item of property, plant and equipment is comprised of significant components with different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment. The capitalized value of a lease is also included in property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nThe depreciation of property, plant and equipment related to a mine is based on the unit-of-production method over the estimated economic life of the related deposit, except in the case of an asset whose estimated useful life is less than the life of the deposit, in which case the asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life based on the straight-line method. For all other property, plant and equipment, depreciation is based on the estimated useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in a capitalized exploration or development project is capitalized to the project.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment, which are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, is as follows:\n\n| Asset Category          | Estimated useful life (Years)   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Buildings               | 15 - 20                         |\n| Machinery and Equipment | 3 - 20                          |\n| Vehicles                | 5                               |\n| Computer Hardware       | 3                               |\n| Office Equipment        | 3 - 6                           |",

These assets are reclassified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment and depreciation of these assets commences when they are completed and ready for their intended use.\n\nAn item of property, plant and equipment, including any significant part initially recognized, is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset, calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset, is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\nThe residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of all assets are reviewed at each financial year end and are adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in the determination of estimated residual values and useful lives. The actual residual values and useful lives may differ from current estimates.\n\nDepreciation of mine specific assets is based on the unit-of-production method. The life of these assets is assessed annually with regard to both their anticipated useful life and the present assessments of the economically recoverable reserves and resources of the mine property where these assets are located. These calculations require the use of estimates and assumptions, including the amount of recoverable reserves and resources. Any changes to these calculations based on new information are accounted for prospectively.\n\nRates of depreciation and, in turn, the annual depreciation expense could therefore be materially affected by changes in underlying estimates. Changes in estimates can be the result of differences in actual production or changes in forecast future production, changes in Mineral Resources or Mineral Reserves through exploration activities, differences between estimated and actual costs of mining and differences in metal prices used in the estimation of Mineral Reserves.\n\n## Major maintenance and repairs\n\nExpenditures on major maintenance include the cost of replacing part of an asset and overhaul costs. When part of an asset is being replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the replacement or overhauled item will flow to the Company through an extended life, the expenditure is capitalized as a separate asset and the carrying amount of the replaced part is written off.\n\n## (n) Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets include software, exploration and software licenses, intellectual properties, customer relationships, long-term customer contracts and goodwill.\n\nIntangible assets acquired are measured upon initial recognition at cost, which comprises the purchase price plus any costs directly attributable to the preparation of the asset for its intended use. Identifiable intangible assets acquired through business combinations are initially recognized at fair value as at the date  of  acquisition. Goodwill  is  initially  measured  as  described  in note  2.2(a) through  business combinations.\n\nResearch expenditures are recognized as an expense as incurred. Development costs that are directly attributable to the design and testing of an identifiable software product are capitalized and recognized as an intangible asset.\n\nGoodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and is not subject to amortization. All other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment charges. Other intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.",

The amortization expense attributable to an intangible asset is recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in the applicable expense category to which the intangible asset relates.\n\nThe gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset is measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in profit or loss when the asset is derecognized.\n\n## (o) Assets and liabilities held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets or assets in a disposal group that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as assets held for sale. A disposal group is a group of assets which the Company intends to dispose of in a single transaction. These assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Impairment charges on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on re-measurement are recognized in net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations. The reversal of any previously recognized impairment charge cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment charge been recognized for the asset held for sale.\n\nAssets and liabilities in a disposal group are classified as held for sale and are presented separately in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nThe measurement of assets held for sale requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to the carrying value and its recoverability through sale. Actual sale proceeds may differ materially from the carrying value.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of the Company that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a separate line of business or geographical area of operations. The operating results and cash flows of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and cash flows.",

If any indication of potential impairment exists, an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount is calculated. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal ('FVLCD') and its value in use based on discounted cash flows. This is determined on an asset-by-asset basis, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. If this is the case, individual assets are grouped together into a Cash Generating Unit ('CGU') for impairment purposes. Such CGUs represent the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash flows from other assets or groups of assets. Management has assessed the Company's CGUs as being an individual operating site.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount with the corresponding impairment being charged to earnings (loss) in the period of impairment. Impairment charges are recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.\n\nAn assessment is also made at each reporting date as to whether there is any change in events or circumstances relating to a previously recognized impairment. If a change has occurred, the Company makes an estimate of the recoverable amount for the previously impaired asset or CGU. A previously recognized impairment charge, other than a charge in respect of goodwill, is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment charge was recognized. If this is the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its newly determined recoverable amount. The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation and amortization, had no impairment charge been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years.\n\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the CGU that is expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. Any impairment in goodwill is recognized immediately and cannot be subsequently reversed.\n\nThe assessment of impairment is based on a number of external and internal factors, some of which are outside of the Company's control, and requires the use of estimates and assumptions related to these factors for each CGU. External factors include market considerations ranging from overall economic activity and the supply of and demand for the materials used in and products produced by the Company to changes in commodity prices, toll rates, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and regulatory requirements. Internal factors include considerations such as production volume, ability to convert resources into reserves, capital and operating expenditures, and future development and expansion plans.\n\nThese significant estimates and assumptions, some of which may be subjective, require that management make decisions based on the best available information at each reporting period. It is possible that the actual recoverable amount could be significantly different than those estimates. A significant decline in the asset's market value, reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, reductions in the amount of recoverable reserves, resources and exploration potential, and/or adverse market conditions can result in a write-down of the carrying amounts of the Company's assets. Judgment is also required when considering whether significant changes in any of these items indicate a previous impairment may have reversed.",

Where some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision is expected to be reimbursed by another party, the reimbursement shall be recognized when it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received if the Company settles the obligation. The reimbursement shall be treated as a separate asset. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax discount rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision as a result of the passage of time is recognized in finance cost in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nA contingent liability is not recognized in the case where no reliable estimate can be made; however, disclosure is required unless the possibility of an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits is remote. By its nature, a contingent liability will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of a contingent liability inherently involves the exercise of significant judgment and estimates of the outcome of future events.\n\n## Rehabilitation provisions\n\nMining, processing, development and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. The Company recognizes a liability for its rehabilitation obligations in the period when a legal and/or constructive obligation is identified. The liability is measured at the present value of the estimated costs required to rehabilitate operating locations based on the risk free nominal discount rates that are specific to the countries in which the operations are located. A corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related asset is recorded and depreciated in the same manner as the related asset.\n\nThe nature of these restoration and rehabilitation activities includes: i) dismantling and removing structures; ii) rehabilitating mines and tailing dams; iii) dismantling operating facilities; iv) closure of plant and waste sites; and v) restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas. Other environmental costs incurred  at  the  operating  sites,  such  as  environmental  monitoring,  water  management  and  waste management costs, are charged to profit or loss when incurred.\n\nThe liability is accreted over time to its expected future settlement value. The accretion expense is recognized in finance cost in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nThe Company assesses its rehabilitation provisions at each reporting date. The rehabilitation liability and related assets are adjusted at each reporting date for changes in the discount rates and in the estimated amount, timing and cost of the work to be carried out. Any reduction in the rehabilitation liability and therefore any deduction in the related rehabilitation asset may not exceed the carrying amount of that asset. If it does, any excess over the carrying value is immediately credited to profit or loss.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made by management in determining the nature and costs associated with the rehabilitation liability. The estimates and assumptions required include estimates of the timing, extent and costs of rehabilitation activities, technology changes, regulatory changes, and changes in the discount and inflation rates. These uncertainties may result in future expenditures being different from the amounts currently provided.",

Each lease payment is apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the lease obligation. Finance charges are recognized in finance cost in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The rightof-use asset is included in property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the shorter of its estimated useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nLease obligations are initially measured at the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- x fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;\n- x variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;\n- x amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees;\n- x the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- x payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.\n\nLease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, or if this rate cannot be determined, the Company's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- x the amount of the initial measurement of the lease obligation;\n- x any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- x any initial direct costs; and\n- x rehabilitation costs.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized on a straightline basis as an expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise primarily small equipment.\n\n## (s) Share capital\n\nCommon shares issued by DPM are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issuance of new shares are recognized in equity as a deduction from the share proceeds. Costs to repurchase and cancel the Company's shares are recognized as a reduction in share capital to the extent of its book value and the excess of the purchase price over the book value is recognized as a reduction in contributed surplus in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity.\n\n## (t) Revenue recognition\n\nRevenue from the sale of concentrates containing gold, copper and silver is recognized when control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when products have been delivered and the significant risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer. Revenue is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract.",

Under the terms of the concentrate sales contracts, the final metal price (\"settlement price\") for the payable metal is based on a predetermined quotational period of London Metal Exchange and London Bullion Market daily prices. The price of the concentrate is the sum of the metal payments less the sum of specified deductions, including treatment and refining charges, penalties for deleterious elements, and freight. The terms of these contracts result in embedded derivatives because of the timing difference between the prevailing metal prices for provisional payments and the actual contractual metal prices used for final settlement. These embedded derivatives are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period through to the date of final price determination with any adjustments recognized in revenue.\n\nAny adjustments to the amount receivable for each shipment on the settlement date, caused by final assay results, are adjusted through revenue at the time of determination.\n\nRevenue from processing concentrate is recognized when concentrate has been smelted and is based on the toll rate specified in the toll agreement, which can vary based on the composition of the concentrate processed and prevailing market conditions at the time the agreement was entered. Under each toll agreement, Tsumeb incurs a carrying charge in respect of the concentrate it processes until blister copper is delivered. This charge is recorded as a reduction of revenue.\n\nRevenue from processing concentrate is also adjusted for any over or under recoveries of metals delivered relative to contracted rates under the tolling agreement between Tsumeb and IXM S.A. ('IXM'). These adjustments represent metal exposure and are calculated by comparing (i) the copper, gold and silver content in the concentrate received and processed by Tsumeb multiplied by the percentage accountable in the IXM contract to (ii) the accountable copper, gold and silver in the blister delivered to IXM and in the incircuit material still being processed by Tsumeb. Many aspects of the metal exposure are subject to estimation, including the amount of metal contained in concentrate received, in-circuit material and blister delivered where final assays have not been completed. These significant estimates are based on the Company's process knowledge, joint surveys with IXM and multiple assay results, the final results of which could differ from initial estimates.\n\nRevenue from the sale of sulphuric acid, a by-product from processing concentrate at the Tsumeb smelter, is measured at the price specified in the sales contract and is recognized when the control has been transferred, which is considered to occur when the products have been delivered to the location specified in the sales contract and the risk of loss has been transferred to the buyer.\n\nRevenue from MineRP's software services is recognized over time when the services are rendered. This is measured based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting period as a proportion of the total services to be provided. The estimated revenue or extent of progress toward percentage of completion is revised if changes occur or circumstances arise that indicate a revision is warranted. Any resulting increase or decrease in estimated revenue is reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) in the period in which such determination is made.\n\nRevenue  from  licenses  entered  by  MineRP  containing  software  and  ongoing  services  elements  is recognized based on the estimated fair value of each element. The fair value of each element is determined based on the market price of each element when sold separately. Revenue relating to the software element is recognized when the control has been transferred to the customer, which occurs on delivery. Revenue relating to the service element is recognized over time when the services are rendered.",

Revenue is subsequently recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) when the sale occurs, which generally occurs when control has been transferred or in the case of services, when the services have been rendered.\n\nThe Company recognizes the time value of money, where there is a significant financing component and the period between the payment by the customer and the transfer of the contracted goods or services exceeds one year.\n\n## (v) Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly related to the acquisition and the construction of a qualifying capital asset are capitalized and added to the cost of the asset until such time as the asset is considered substantially ready for its intended use. Where funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalized represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalized is calculated using the weighted average cost applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Company during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## (w) Share-based compensation transactions\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nStock options are granted to directors and selected employees to buy common shares of the Company. Options vest equally over a three-year period and expire five years from the date of grant. Grants of stock options are based on the closing price of the common shares on the TSX the day before the effective grant date and reflect the Company's estimate of the number of awards that will ultimately vest. The stock options are measured on the date of grant by reference to the fair value determined using a Black-Scholes valuation model, further details of which are given in note 18 . The value is recognized as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) and an increase to contributed surplus in the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders' equity over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled.\n\nThe dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share.",

The Director DSUs are paid in cash following separation of a director from the Company based on the closing price of DPM's common shares on the applicable redemption date as elected by the director. The Employee DSUs are paid in cash based on (i) the five-day volume weighted average price ('Market Price') of DPM's common shares on the date the employee ceases to be employed by DPM or a subsidiary thereof ('Separation Date'); or (ii) if a deferred redemption date has been elected by the employee ('Deferred Redemption Date'), a cash payment by the Company to the employee based on the Market Price or the closing price of DPM's common shares on the day preceding the Deferred Redemption Date; or (iii) the Market Price of DPM's common shares if the Deferred Redemption Date is December 15 of the calendar year commencing after the Separation Date. The cost of the DSUs is measured initially at fair value based on the closing price of DPM's common shares preceding the day the DSUs are granted. The cost of the DSUs is recognized as a liability under share based compensation plans in the consolidated statements of financial position and as a general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss). The liability is remeasured to fair value based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\nA Restricted Share Unit ('RSU') Plan was established for directors, certain employees and eligible contractors ('Participant') of DPM and its wholly-owned subsidiaries in consideration of past services to the Company.\n\nUnder this plan, the Board of Directors may, at its sole discretion, (i) grant non-performance based RSUs and RSUs with a performance-based component, referred to as performance share units ('PSUs'), subject to performance conditions to be achieved by the Company; and (ii) determine the entitlement date or dates of such RSUs and PSUs. The non-performance based RSUs vest equally over a three-year period and are paid in cash based on the Market Price of DPM's publicly traded common shares on the entitlement date or dates. The PSUs vest after three years from the grant date and are paid in cash based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares, subject to performance criteria established by the Board of Directors on the entitlement date or dates.\n\nThe cost of the RSUs and PSUs is measured initially at fair value on the authorization date based on the closing price of DPM's common shares preceding the day the RSUs and PSUs are granted. The cost of RSUs and PSUs is recognized as a liability under share based compensation plans, with the current portion recognized in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, in the consolidated statements of financial position and as an expense in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss) over the vesting period. The liability is remeasured to fair value based on the Market Price of DPM's common shares and, in the case of PSUs, subject to performance criteria, at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (x) Income taxes\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities on the taxable loss or income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nCurrent income tax assets and current income tax liabilities are only offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset the amounts and the Company intends to settle on a net basis or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.",

Deferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred income tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable income will be generated in future periods to utilize these deductible temporary differences.\n\nThe following temporary differences do not result in deferred income tax assets or liabilities:\n\n- x The initial recognition of assets or liabilities, not arising from a business combination, that does not affect accounting or taxable profit;\n- x Initial recognition of goodwill, if any; and\n- x Investments in subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities where the timing of the reversal of temporary differences can be controlled and reversal in the foreseeable future is not probable.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilized.

Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate.\n\nJudgment  is  required  in  determining  whether  deferred  income  tax  assets  are  recognized  on  the consolidated statements of financial position. Deferred income tax assets, including those arising from unutilized tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate future taxable income in order to utilize the deferred income tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations or other activities and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred income tax assets recorded on the reporting date could be impacted.\n\nAdditionally, future changes in tax laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates could impact tax deductions in future periods and the value of its deferred income tax assets and liabilities.",

As at December 31, 2021, DPM held: (i) 31,050,566 common  shares  of  Sabina;  and  (ii)  5,000,000 Series  B  special  warrants,  which  will  be automatically exercised upon a positive production decision with respect to the Back River project or upon the occurrence of certain other events. Each of the special warrants is exercisable into one common share until 2044.\n\nThe fair value of the special warrants was based on the fair value of the Sabina common shares, which was determined based on the closing bid prices as at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe fair value of the Sabina special warrants was included in investments at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized unrealized losses on the Sabina special warrants of $6.3 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $5.7 million) in other (income) expense (note 21) in the consolidated statements of earnings (loss).\n\n## (b) Publicly traded securities\n\nPublicly traded securities include a portfolio of equity investments in publicly traded mining and exploration companies, comprised primarily of Sabina. As a result of the Company acquiring 100% of INV on July 26, 2021, INV is no longer reported under investments at fair value (note 4) .\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized unrealized losses on these publicly traded securities of $42.6 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $36.5 million) in other comprehensive income (loss) that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss.\n\n## (c) Commodity swap contracts\n\nThe Company enters into QP Hedges, being cash settled commodity swap contracts from time to time to swap future contracted monthly average metal prices for fixed metal prices to eliminate or substantially reduce  the  metal  price  exposure  associated  with  the  time  lag  between  the  provisional  and  final determination of concentrate sales.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company's outstanding QP Hedges, all of which mature within six months from the reporting date, are summarized in the table below:\n\n| Commodity hedged   | Volume hedged    | Weighted average fixed price of QP Hedges   |\n|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Payable gold       | 18,040 ounces    | 1,803.46/ounce                              |\n| Payable copper     | 6,194,982 pounds | 4.16/pound                                  |\n\nThe Company also enters into Production Hedges, being cash settled commodity swap contracts from time to time to swap future contracted monthly average prices for fixed metal prices to reduce its future metal price exposure in respect of its projected production. As at December 31, 2021, the Company had no outstanding Production Hedges.\n\nThe Company designates the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of Production Hedges as cash flow hedges and the spot component of commodity swap contracts in respect of QP Hedges as fair value hedges.",

As at December 31, 2021, the net fair value loss on all outstanding commodity swap contracts was $1.9 million (December 31, 2020 - $5.7 million), of which $0.02 million (December 31, 2020 - $0.1 million) was included in other current assets and $1.9 million (December 31, 2020 - $5.8 million) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\nAll commodity swap contracts are subject to master netting agreements. As at December 31, 2021, there was no set-off of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position. As at December 31, 2020, $0.1 million of commodity swap assets were set-off against commodity swap liabilities of $5.8 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized, in revenue, net losses of $3.5 million (2020 - $11.1 million) on commodity swap contracts in respect of QP Hedges and realized losses of $15.7 million (2020 - $nil) on commodity swap contracts in respect of Production Hedges.\n\n## (d) Foreign exchange option contracts\n\nThe Company enters into foreign exchange option contracts from time to time to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nForeign exchange option contracts provide price protection below a specified 'floor' rate and participation up to a specified 'ceiling' rate. The option contracts comprise a series of call options and put options (which when combined create a price 'collar') that are structured so as to provide for a zero upfront cash cost.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange option contracts in respect of a portion of its projected ZAR denominated operating expenses as summarized in the table below:\n\n| Year of projected   | Amount hedged                                                                            | Call options sold  Weighted average   | Put options purchased  Weighted average   |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| operating expenses  | in ZAR  (i)                                                                              | ceiling rate US$/ZAR                  | floor rate US$/ZAR                        |\n| 2022                | 1,464,090,000                                17.05                                 15.14 |                                       |                                           |\n\nThe Company designates the intrinsic value of option contracts as cash flow hedges. The time value component of foreign exchange option contracts is treated as a separate cost of hedging.\n\nThe fair value gain or loss on these outstanding contracts is calculated based on foreign exchange forward rates quoted in the market. As at December 31, 2021, the net fair value loss on all outstanding foreign exchange option contracts was $1.5 million (December 31, 2020 - net fair value gain of $6.4 million), of which $nil was included in other current assets (December 31, 2020 - $6.4 million) and $1.5 million (December 31, 2020 - $nil) in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. All foreign exchange option contracts are subject to master netting agreements. As at December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no setoff of assets and liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial position.\n\nThe Company recognized realized gains of $6.5 million (2020 - realized losses of $3.5 million) for the year ended December 31, 2021 in cost of sales on the spot component of settled contracts.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized unrealized losses of $5.4 million (2020 - unrealized gains of $3.4 million) in other comprehensive income (loss) on the spot component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company also recognized unrealized losses of $2.5 million (2020 - $0.9 million) on the time value component of the outstanding foreign exchange option contracts in other comprehensive income (loss) as a deferred cost of hedging.",

The hedges are effective when the critical terms of the hedging instrument match with the critical terms of the hedged item.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness can arise from:\n\n- x Differences in the timing and/or amount of the cash flows of the hedged item and the hedging instrument; and\n- x Fair value movements related to counterparty credit risk, which impact the hedging instrument and the hedged item differently.\n\nThe Company's hedging relationships are such that the ratio between the underlying hedged item and the hedging instrument is 1:1. To measure for potential hedge ineffectiveness, the Company compares change in the fair value of the hedging instrument to change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item.\n\nSet out below is a summary of effects of hedge accounting on the Company's consolidated statements of financial position by risk category for its fair value and cash flow hedges:\n\n|                                                                  | 2021      | 2020      |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Commodity swap contracts                                         |           |           |\n| designated as fair value hedges  (i)                             |           |           |\n| Carrying amount                                                  |           |           |\n| Assets included in other current assets                          | 21        | 104       |\n| Liabilities included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities | (1,946)   | (5,836)   |\n|                                                                  | (1,925)   | (5,732)   |\n| Notional amount                                                  | 58,281    | 135,513   |\n| Changes in fair value used for measuring ineffectiveness         |           |           |\n| Hedging instruments                                              | (1,892)   | (5,666)   |\n| Hedged items                                                     | 1,914     | 5,444     |\n| Commodity swap contracts                                         |           |           |\n| designated as cash flow hedges                                   |           |           |\n| Carrying amount                                                  |           |           |\n| Assets included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities      | -         | 67        |\n| Notional amount                                                  | -         | 21,883    |\n| Changes in fair value used for measuring ineffectiveness         |           |           |\n| Hedging instruments                                              | -         | 87        |\n| Hedged items                                                     | -         | (87)      |\n| Foreign exchange option contracts                                |           |           |\n| designated as cash flow hedges                                   |           |           |\n| Carrying amount                                                  |           |           |\n| Assets included in other current assets                          | -         | 6,364     |\n| Liability included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities   | (1,489)   | -         |\n| Notional amount ZAR (in 000's)                                   | 1,464,090 | 1,426,200 |\n| Changes in fair value used for measuring ineffectiveness         |           |           |\n| Hedging instruments                                              | -         | 5,350     |\n| Hedged items                                                     | -         | (5,350)   |",

DEBT\n\n## (a) DPM Revolving Credit Facility ('RCF')\n\nDPM has a committed RCF of $150.0 million with a consortium of banks. In February 2021, the Company extended the RCF's maturity date from February 2023 to February 2024. The Company's borrowing spread above LIBOR is 2.5%, and can range between 2.5% and 3.5% depending upon the Company's funded net debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ('Debt Leverage Ratio'), as defined in the RCF agreement. The RCF is secured by pledges of the Company's investments in Ada Tepe, Chelopech and Tsumeb and by guarantees from each of these subsidiaries.\n\nThe RCF contains financial covenants that require DPM to maintain: (i) a Debt Leverage Ratio below 3.75:1, (ii) a current ratio (including the addition of any unutilized credit within tranche B to current assets) of greater than 1.5:1, and (iii) a minimum net worth of $500.0 million plus (minus) 50% of ongoing annual net earnings (loss).\n\nAs at December 31, 2021 and 2020, DPM was in compliance with all financial covenants and $nil was drawn under the RCF.\n\n## (b) Tsumeb overdraft facility\n\nTsumeb has a Namibian $100.0 million ($6.3 million) demand overdraft facility. This facility is guaranteed by DPM and bears interest at a rate equal to the Namibian Prime Lending Rate minus 0.5%. As at December 31, 2021 and 2020, $nil was drawn from this facility.\n\n## (c)   Other credit agreements and guarantees\n\nIn February 2021, Chelopech and Ada Tepe increased its multi-purpose credit facility from $16.0 million to $21.0 million.

This credit facility matures on November 30, 2022 and is guaranteed by DPM. As at December 31, 2021, $23.8 million (December 31, 2020 - $25.8 million) had been utilized in the form of letters of guarantee.\n\nIn February 2021, Ada Tepe increased its multi-purpose credit facility from $5.3 million to $10.3 million.

DEFERRED REVENUE\n\nIn September 2016, the Company entered into a prepaid forward gold sales arrangement with several of DPM's existing lenders whereby the Company undertook to deliver specified quantities of gold on specified dates in exchange for an upfront cash prepayment of $50.0 million. Deliveries in the form of unallocated gold credits sourced from the Company's existing mines occurred over a 15-month period from October 2019 to December 2020.\n\nThe cash prepayment of $50.0 million, together with a total deemed financing expense of $13.2 million, was  recorded  as  deferred  revenue  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  financial  position,  which  was subsequently recognized as revenue when deliveries were made under the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, 34,087 ounces of gold were delivered pursuant to the prepaid forward gold sales arrangement and as a result, $46.7 million was transferred from deferred revenue to revenue.

The Company has various financial assets, such as cash and accounts receivable, which arise directly from its operations.\n\nThe main risks that could adversely affect the Company's financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are market risk (which includes commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk), liquidity risk and credit risk. Management reviews each of these risks and establishes policies for managing them as summarized below.\n\nThe following discussion also includes a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables on the Company's financial instruments and the impact on net earnings (loss) and shareholders' equity, where applicable. Financial instruments affected by market risk include cash, accounts receivable, investments at fair value, commodity swap contracts, foreign exchange option contracts, long-term debt, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The sensitivity has been prepared using financial assets and liabilities held as at the reporting dates.",

Financial risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees involved in financial risk management activities understand their roles and obligations.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that the future cash flows or the fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Market risk is comprised of three types of risks: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. The impact of each of these components is discussed below.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe Company is subject to price risk associated with fluctuations in the market prices for metals. The Company sells its products at prices that are effectively determined by reference to the traded prices on the London Metal Exchange and London Bullion Market. The prices of gold and copper are major factors influencing the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company regularly enters into commodity swap contracts to reduce the price exposure associated with the time lag between the provisional and final determination of its concentrate sales. In addition, the Company periodically enters into commodity swap contracts to reduce the price exposure associated with projected payable copper production. The Company also selectively enters into commodity swap contracts to reduce its price exposure applicable to projected payable gold contained in Chelopech's pyrite concentrate production.\n\nThe  Company's  risk  management  policy,  which  was  approved  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  requires provisional concentrate sales to be fully hedged and permits hedging up to 90%, 85% and 80% of its projected payable copper production in the subsequent 1, 2, and 3 year reporting periods, respectively.\n\nAs at December 31, 2021, the impact of a 5% increase or decrease in metal prices impacting the Company's accounts receivable and outstanding commodity swap contracts, with all other variables held constant, would decrease or increase earnings before income taxes by $2.0 million (2020 - $3.8 million) and would decrease or increase equity by $2.0 million (2020 - $4.9 million).\n\nThe following table demonstrates the effect on 2021 and 2020 earnings before income taxes of a 5% increase in commodity prices on its sales, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant. The impact on equity is the same as the impact on net earnings.\n\n## Effect of a 5% increase in metal prices on earnings before income taxes\n\n|                                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gold                                           | 25,129 | 23,146 |\n| Copper                                         | 6,883  | 4,580  |\n| Total increase on earnings before income taxes | 32,012 | 27,726 |\n\nThe effect of a 5% decrease in metal prices, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant, would decrease earnings before income taxes by an equivalent amount.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows or fair value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Company's cash and floating rate denominated debt. As at December 31, 2021, the Company had no debt. For the year ended December 31, 2021, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates across the yield curve, with all other variables held constant, would increase or decrease earnings before income taxes by $3.4 million (2020 - $1.5 million). The impact on equity is the same as the impact on net earnings.",

The  Company  periodically  undertakes  to  purchase,  in  advance,  a  portion  of  its  foreign denominated cash flow requirements on a spot or forward basis to reduce this exposure. The Company also enters into foreign exchange option contracts in order to reduce the foreign exchange exposure associated with projected operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nThe Company's risk management policy, which was approved by the Board of Directors, permits up to 85%, 80% and 75% of its projected operating expenses denominated in foreign currency to be hedged in the subsequent 1, 2, and 3 year reporting periods, respectively. The policy also permits projected capital expenditures denominated in foreign currency to be fully hedged.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the ZAR on the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts, with all other variables held constant, would decrease equity by $1.9 million (2020 - $6.9 million). The effect of a 5% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to ZAR on the Company's outstanding foreign exchange option contracts, with all other variables held constant, would be to increase equity by equivalent amounts.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the effect on 2021 and 2020 earnings before income taxes and equity of a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the Company's key foreign currencies on the Company's outstanding financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant.\n\nEffect of a 5% appreciation of the U.S. dollar on\n\n|                 | Earnings before income taxes   | Earnings before income taxes   | Equity   | Equity   |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------|----------|\n|                 | 2021                           | 2020                           | 2021     | 2020     |\n| Euro            | 1,731                          | 2,120                          | 1,521    | 1,919    |\n| Namibian Dollar | (353)                          | (74)                           | (353)    | (74)     |\n| Canadian Dollar | (773)                          | (771)                          | 1,335    | 3,952    |\n| Total increase  | 605                            | 1,275                          | 2,504    | 5,797    |\n\nThe effect of a 5% depreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to these foreign currencies on the Company's outstanding foreign denominated financial assets and liabilities, excluding the impact of any hedges and with all other variables held constant, would be to decrease earnings before income taxes and equity by equivalent amounts.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe exposure to credit risk arises through the potential failure of a customer or another third party to meet its contractual obligations to the Company. During 2021, the Company had contracts with 14 customers in connection with its mining and smelting operations, one of whom accounted for approximately 40% (2020 - 57%) of the Company's revenue. Under the terms of the Company's concentrate sales contracts, the purchasers make an initial advance payment equal to 70% to 95% of the provisional value of each lot at the time title transfers. This serves to mitigate a portion of the Company's credit risk.\n\nWith respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Company, which comprise cash, equity investments and derivative financial assets, the Company's maximum exposure is equal to the carrying amount of these instruments. The Company limits its counterparty credit risk on these assets by dealing with highly rated counterparties, issuers that are subject to minimum credit ratings, and/or maximum prescribed exposures.",

The cyclical nature of the Company's businesses and the volatility of capital markets are such that conditions could change dramatically, affecting the Company's cash flow generating capability, its ability to maintain, or draw upon, its RCF or the existing terms under its concentrate sales and/or smelting agreements, as well as its liquidity, cost of capital and its ability to access new capital, which could adversely affect the Company's earnings and cash flows and, in turn, could affect total shareholder returns. To reduce these risks, the Company: (i) prepares regular cash flow forecasts to monitor its capital requirements, available liquidity and compliance to debt covenants; (ii) strives to maintain a prudent capital structure that is comprised primarily of equity financing and long-term debt, currently in the form of a committed RCF; and (iii) targets a minimum level of liquidity comprised of surplus cash balances and/or undrawn committed lines of credit to avoid having to raise additional capital at times when the costs or terms would be regarded as unfavourable.\n\nThe table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Company's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n|                                          |              | As at December 31, 2021   | As at December 31, 2021   | As at December 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                          | up to 1 year |                           | 1 - 5 years over 5 years  | Total                     |\n| Accounts payable and accrued liabilities | 73,735       | -                         | -                         | 73,735                    |\n| Commodity swap contracts                 | 1,946        | -                         | -                         | 1,946                     |\n| Foreign exchange option contracts        | 1,489        | -                         | -                         | 1,489                     |\n| Lease obligations                        | 5,407        | 10,305                    | 1,791                     | 17,503                    |\n| Other obligations                        | 700          | 840                       | 125                       | 1,665                     |\n|                                          | 83,277       | 11,145                    | 1,916                     | 96,338                    |\n\n|                                          | up to 1 year   | 1 - 5 years   | over 5 years   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------|\n| Accounts payable and accrued liabilities | 66,465         | -             | -              | 66,465  |\n| Commodity swap contracts                 | 5,769          | -             | -              | 5,769   |\n| Lease obligations                        | 5,350          | 14,000        | 871            | 20,221  |\n| Other obligations                        | 648            | 510           | 58             | 1,216   |\n|                                          | 78,232         | 14,510        | 929            | 93,671  |\n\n## Capital management\n\nThe Company's objective for capital management is to: (i) maintain sufficient levels of liquidity to fund and support its exploration, evaluation, development and operating activities; (ii) maintain a strong financial position to ensure it has ready access to debt and equity markets to supplement its existing cash balance and free cash flow being used to fund its growth activities; and (iii) comply with all financial covenants set out in its credit agreements and guarantees. See note 13 for discussion on the Company's compliance with these requirements. The Company monitors its financial position and the potential impact of adverse market conditions on an ongoing basis. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it based on prevailing market conditions and according to its business strategy. The Company's long term funding strategy is to maintain a capital structure comprised primarily of equity sourced from equity offerings and net earnings generated from its businesses and, as a result, the targeted level of debt making up the Company's capital base is relatively low. Given the long term nature of the assets being funded and the U.S. dollar denominated revenue stream generated therefrom, the Company's general strategy around any debt financing is to raise long-term U.S. dollar denominated debt to supplement these equity financings.",

As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all loan covenants and its net debt as a percentage of total capital was negative 50% (December 31, 2020 - negative 23%).\n\n## Financial Risk Management in response to Coronavirus ('COVID-19')\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 epidemic as a worldwide pandemic and governments across the globe undertook extensive measures to combat the spread of this virus. To date, as a result of the proactive actions being taken within the regions in which we operate and by personnel at each of our sites, the Company has not experienced any material disruptions to its operations as a result of COVID-19. The Company's Chelopech and Ada Tepe mines in Bulgaria continue to operate at full capacity and have not experienced any disruptions to their operations.\n\nAs previously reported, the Tsumeb smelter in Namibia curtailed its operations by shutting down ancillary plants for 30 days in April 2020 in response to a government directive to the natural resources sector aimed at limiting staffing levels. Full operations resumed in May 2020 with ongoing management of the number of employees and contractors working at site and continued observance of the COVID-19 controls that have been established across all sites. During the first quarter of 2021, Tsumeb's maintenance shutdown, which was originally planned for 30 days, was extended to 45 days in part as a result of COVID-19 related safety protocols, travel restrictions and the use of remote commissioning support.\n\nThe Company continues to closely assess and monitor the COVID-19 situation. The Company is continuing with a number of measures to mitigate the associated risks, including procedures and contingency plans that were established at each operating location directed at safeguarding employees, managing potential supply chain disruptions, and maintaining production at each of its operations. Management of the situation is being overseen by an experienced cross-functional team that includes members of senior management and leaders at each of the Company's operations.\n\nThe Company has experienced several positive cases of COVID-19 within its workforce. Positive cases are being effectively managed with testing, contact tracing and isolation measures and, to date, the vast majority of employees have recovered with the remaining employees isolating offsite in accordance with the Company's procedures. Given the relatively low number of COVID-19 cases and the management protocols in effect, the impact on the Company's operations has been minimal.\n\nAt present, there do not appear to be any imminent COVID-19 related circumstances that are expected to disrupt the Company's operations, however, given the highly uncertain and evolving nature of this situation, the Company is not able to reliably estimate the likelihood, timing, duration, severity and scope of this pandemic and the potential impact it could have on the Company's operating and financial results.\n\n## 29. OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nOperating segments are components of an entity whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance and for which separate financial information is available.\n\nThe Company has three reportable operating segments - Chelopech and Ada Tepe in Bulgaria and Tsumeb in Namibia. The nature of their operations, products and services are described in note 1 , Corporate  Information .  These  segments  are  organized  predominantly  by  the  products  and  services provided to customers and geography of the businesses. The Corporate and Other segment includes corporate, exploration and evaluation and other income and cost items that do not pertain directly to an operating segment. There are no significant inter-segment transactions that have not been eliminated on consolidation.",
