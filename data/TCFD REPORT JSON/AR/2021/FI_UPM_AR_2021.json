From 2019 to 2020, sustainable activewear in the US and the UK grew by 45-65%, depending on the category. We innovate unique and responsible biochemicals from wood-based biomass that can be used in polyester textiles and training shoes, for example.\n\nRead more about our positive impact on UPM's website (Source: Statista)",

        "page_content": "## CREATING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE\n\n2021 was a strong year for UPM. We successfully managed to navigate an exceptionally fast changing operating environment, delivering performance that exceeded UPM's financial targets.\n\nThe world economy recovered quickly from the previous year's deep slowdown. Demand for our products was strong in all business areas. Our earnings returned to strong pre-pandemic levels, and five out of our six business areas surpassed their long-term financial targets. We improved our margins, despite significant raw material and energy cost increases. The year ended with a solid Q4.\n\nIn February 2021, we joined the Climate Pledge, which aims for climate-neutrality by 2040 and to reach the targets of the Paris Agreement 10 years in advance. In 2021, our energy-related CO 2 emissions decreased by 8%. As part of our journey towards carbon neutrality, our goal is stop using coal energy by 2030.\n\nOverall, the year was excellent. Our sales increased by 14% and our comparable EBIT by 55% from the previous year. Delivery volumes increased in all business areas. Sales prices also increased in all of our business areas except for graphic papers. Operating cash flow strengthened further.\n\nIn 2021, we again received several recognitions for our sustainability work. Our ambitious responsibility targets will continue to steer us in the right direction.\n\n## Progress in strategic growth projects\n\nThe year 2021 was significant in our strategic growth projects, which was reflected in investments of nearly EUR 1.5 billion. Our investment projects have taken place in an exceptional period when the pandemic and disturbances in the global supply chains have caused unpredictable challenges. Given the circumstances, the projects have\n\nprogressed well.\n\nBusiness preparation at UPM Biochemicals is proceeding at good pace and the long-term business opportunities for the project are excellent. There is keen interest in wood-based biochemicals. However, the pandemic and disruptions to global supply chains have a/ffected the progress of the project. We estimate that the start-up will take place by the end of 2023.\n\nThe construction of the Paso de los Toros pulp mill is now at a point where the most material uncertainties have been resolved and we can fine-tune the project's completion plan. The mill will start production by the end of Q1 2023, with a 10% increase in the updated investment estimate. Most importantly, the investment case remains strong because of the cash cost level of approximately USD 280 per delivered tonne of pulp.\n\nAt the beginning of 2021, we started the basic engineering phase of a next generation biofuels biorefinery. The potential investment would take place in Rotterdam. The current investment environment is very challenging for new major projects so we are not planning to make further decisions before the end of 2022.\n\nThese strategic investments remain our focus area also this year. We will do our best to ensure that they proceed successfully and safely.\n\n## Biofore strategy unchanged\n\nGlobal megatrends are increasing demand for many of our products. The drive for more sustainable consumption a/ffects\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncustomer and consumer behaviour. More and more people want to make responsible purchasing decisions.\n\nOur strategy remains unchanged. We seek sustainable growth in businesses with strong long-term market fundamentals. We have defined our spearheads for growth loud and clear: fibre products, specialty packaging materials and biorefining. Performance, innovation and responsibility continue to be the cornerstones we build on.\n\nOur purpose is to create a future beyond fossils. We o/ffer our customers and consumers sustainable choices: renewable and recyclable materials and low-emission energy.\n\nResponsibility is an integral part of our Biofore strategy. We source our raw materials from sustainably managed forests and we foster biodiversity. We develop climate-positive products that replace fossil-based products. We also have ambitious and science-based emission reduction targets.\n\n## Strong financial position\n\nIncreasing shareholder value continues to be our long-term goal. We believe that this also benefits other stakeholders and society in the long term. UPM's Board of Directors is proposing an unchanged dividend of EUR 1.30 per share for 2021. The proposal reflects UPM's strong financial position and confidence in UPM's future success.\n\nI warmly thank all UPM employees, stakeholders and shareholders for an excellent year 2021! I also look to the future with confidence. The world needs responsible solutions. Together, we will create a future beyond fossils.\n\nI believe that 2022 will be another good year for UPM. Good demand is expected to continue for most products and sales prices for many products are expected to develop favourably. There are uncertainties in the operating environment also in 2022. However, we have demonstrated our ability to perform in a volatile environment and our long-term strategy is solid.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have selected six goals and, thereunder, 12 targets that are the most relevant for us based on where we can have the greatest effect, either by minimising our negative impacts or by increasing our positive impacts on people, societies and the environment. There are others that are also relevant to us, but to a lesser extent. In 2021, we reviewed and renewed our social responsibility targets (see pages 30, 74, 77). We also replaced the earlier target on business benefits from GHG claims with a new target on ending the use of coal and peat.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Goal 6:\n\nClean water and sanitation (Target: 6.3)\n\n## Goal 7:\n\nAffordable and clean energy (Targets: 7.2 and 7.3)\n\n## Goal 8:\n\nDecent work and economic growth (Targets: 8.2, 8.5 and 8.8)\n\nGoal 12\n\n:\n\nResponsible consumption and production (Targets: 12.2, 12.4 and 12.5)\n\n## Goal 13:\n\nClimate action (Target: 13.1)\n\n## Goal 15:\n\nLife on land\n\n(Targets: 15.2 and 15.5)\n\n- 1) Covers all raw material spend including wood and wood-based biomass sourcing and excluding energy\n- 2) From 2018 level\n- 3) Forest management certification\n- 4) Covers UPM own forests in Finland\n- 5) From 2015 level\n- 6) From 2008 level, relevant for pulp and paper production",

        "page_content": "## RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nThe operating environment exposes UPM to a number of risks and opportunities. Many of them arise from general economic activity and global megatrends.\n\n- Risks in the report of Board of Directors on page 131\n- Sensitivity to carbon pricing is presented on page 138\n- Main earnings sensitivities are presented on page 165\n- UPM's cost structure is presented on page 166\n- Main currency exposures are presented on page 196\n\n## CYCLICAL AND COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM's current product offering competes in markets where there are competing alternatives for customers and where the shifts in supply and demand continuously influence prices. Changes in production capacity, new product development and competitor and consumer behaviour may impact the price levels for our products and cause demand fluctuations. Rapid acceleration in digitalisation and e-commerce may expedite the decline in demand for graphic papers and simultaneously increase demand for sustainable packaging products.\n\nManagement: Industry-leading balance sheet. Continuous improvement in competitiveness, resource efficiency and customer offering. Responsible operations. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Growing need and consumer preference for renewable and recyclable solutions create business opportunities and drive demand growth.\n\nGEOPOLITICAL AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe rising protectionism in Europe, global trade tensions between major economies, e.g. the US and China, as well as political uncertainties in several countries continue to cause uncertainty in trade policies, economic growth, rule of law and challenge competitiveness and predictability for companies with international value chains and operations in several countries. The testing relationships between businesses, governments and society, and the changing pandemic containment measures may continue to stress the economic and political environment and cause local challenges to our operations or influence demand for our products.\n\nManagement: Monitoring through international trade associations. Compliance. Continuous improvement in competitiveness. Disciplined planning and selection of investments. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Diverse business portfolio, geographical presence and responsible business practices may present opportunities for supply chain optimisation or strategic opportunities (incl. M&A) in an economic downturn.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy can cause policy changes and shifts in market preferences, standards, and technologies, which in turn may result in changes to cost structures or the commercial opportunities of biomass and change the competitiveness of products, raw materials, industries, and countries. The physical impacts of climate change include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions, which can increase droughts and forest fires and cause uncertainties in business operations. Damage caused by insects and tree diseases can become increasingly common.\n\nManagement: Long-term targets and science-based measures to mitigate global warming through sustainable forestry, emissions reductions and innovating novel products. Enhancing biodiversity.\n\nOpportunity: Transition opportunities include those driven by resource efficiency and the development of new technologies, products and services that could bring new markets, customers, sources of funding and competitive advantage for us. Longer forest growing season in northern hemisphere.\n\nCHANGES IN POLICIES, LEGISLATION AND STAKEHOLDER EXPECTATIONS\n\nThe rising social inequality and strain on our natural ecosystem have intensified the expectations for companies to deliver economic, social and environmental benefits and complement the actions being taken by governments. Changes in regulation, taxation or subsidies could have an effect on our performance, competitiveness and the costs and availability of raw materials. Environmental regulations may continue to become more stringent. As policies, legislation or stakeholder expectations, or the application of them, change, additional costs in complying with more stringent requirements may be imposed on us.\n\nManagement: Responsible operations in the value chain enhance the ability to operate and influence long-term business success, including environmental management systems, sustainable forestry and compliance.\n\nOpportunity: Creating value for society, as a company and through our renewable and responsible solutions, is an integral part of our strategy. The bioeconomy offers new opportunities for value creation and business growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEXECUTION OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENT PROJECTS\n\nWe invest in selective strategic projects to enable profitable growth. Investment projects are often large and may take several years to complete. They may also involve strategic, technical and operational risks. Our large pulp mill project in Uruguay consists of several subprojects. The biochemical refinery project in Germany involves new technology and opens new markets for us. The OL3 power plant project may impact energy costs or the fair value of our energy shareholdings. The COVID-19 pandemic and the required additional health and safety measures as well as bottlenecks in the global logistics and supply chains have added new challenges to large investment projects.\n\nManagement: Stringent and continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Environmental, health, safety and social impact assessments and protocols. Stakeholder engagement.\n\nOpportunity: Carefully selected and implemented growth projects improve our earnings and returns, and change the positioning of the company.\n\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AVAILABILITY AND INCREASING CYBERCRIME ACTIVITY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in critical information system services can cause disruptions to the continuity of operations. The information systems may be exposed to a cyber-intrusion that could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, production outages or damage to reputation.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our measures for cybersecurity protection.\n\nOpportunity: Sophisticated IT systems enable efficient operations and optimised performance, as well as new customer services and data security.\n\n## FINANCIAL RISKS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INPUT PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE MAIN RAW MATERIALS AND SERVICES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe main production inputs required in the manufacturing of our products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these inputs have been volatile in recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future. Governmental protection, trade protection measures, climate change, local and global environmental policies, possibly impacted by COVID-19 related governmental actions or restrictions, could continue to cause further uncertainty around the prices and availability of these inputs as well as logistics services.\n\nManagement: Continuously improving resource efficiency and supply chain optimisation. New technologies. Long-term supply contracts and relying on alternative suppliers. Selected ownership of forest land and long-term forest management contracts.\n\nOpportunity: Circular economy and continuous improvement in resource efficiency and resilience to withstand price fluctuations offer competitive advantage.\n\n## OPERATIONAL HAZARDS, HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AND BUSINESS INTERRUPTION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur operations are exposed to risks arising from the environment, fires, natural events, site security and occupational health and safety. A major incident at a UPM site or at a critical part of the supply chain could cause a shutdown or curtail production. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness or liability to employees, contractors or third parties.\n\nManagement: We systematically maintain and further develop our management, safety, security and loss prevention programmes as well as insurance protection and business continuity.\n\nOpportunity: Industry-leading environmental performance provides competitive advantage. Health and safety performance strengthens engagement, efficiency and productivity.\n\nFinancial risks include foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, challenges in refinancing, counterparty or credit risks or changes in taxes. Changes to the monetary policies of major central banks may significantly impact interest rates and consequently various currencies that directly or indirectly affect UPM. Our foreign exchange rate risk primarily relates to the US dollar, British pound sterling and Japanese yen.\n\nManagement: Continuous hedging of net currency exposure. Hedging the balance sheet. Continuous improvement in competitiveness. Disciplined planning and selection of investments. Business portfolio development.\n\nOpportunity: Diverse business portfolio and geographical presence, focus on competitiveness and strong balance sheet may present strategic opportunities in a changing currency environment.\n\nDecisive carbon removal policies may require a rapid growth in carbon removal technology solutions, but could accelerate the tendency to optimise short-term actions and lead to restrictions on wood-use.\n\nManagement and opportunity : Sustainable forest management and expansion of forested areas.\n\nA widening digital gap and unbalanced economic development can worsen societal fractures and recovery from the pandemic.\n\nManagement and opportunity : Economic activities and creating incremental value in remote areas especially related to forests.",

To provide the most versatile pulp range, advanced technical service and a reliable long-term supply with undisputed commitment to sustainability. To maintain cost-competitiveness through continuous operational improvement.\n- \u00b7 For timber: to enhance profitability through efficient wood supply, integrated full-production and focused commercial strategy. To have a streamlined business model that secures our position in chosen key markets and end-use segments.\n\n## OUR STRENGTHS\n\n- \u00b7 Broad selection of sustainably produced pulp grades for a wide range of end uses\n- \u00b7 Modern, efficient pulp mills and expert teams committed to grow with customers\n- \u00b7 Industry-leading forest management and sustainable eucalyptus plantations\n- \u00b7 Fossil-free timber production with a dedicated global sales and logistics network\n\nPulp is a material that perfectly matches the growing global demand for responsible and renewable products. We serve our customers with sustainably produced eucalyptus, birch and softwood pulp grades for a wide range of end uses such as tissue, specialty papers, graphic papers, board and packaging. In addition to high-quality pulp, our modern pulp mills produce renewable energy, and by-products and residues, which are used for innovative bioproducts.\n\nIn our timber business, we serve our industrial customers in the furniture, joinery, planing, construction and packaging sectors.\n\n## Capturing benefits from efficient operations\n\nIn 2021, the strong demand for tissue and hygiene products as well as for packaging\n\nand specialty paper products supported the global pulp demand. Pulp consumption in graphic paper end-use segment recovered from 2020. In China, pulp demand growth slowed down due to lower economic activity, customers' temporary capacity curtailments and inventory reduction in the customer value chain. In Europe, the overall markets remained strong with high demand and a tight demand and supply balance. Pulp sales prices increased to record levels in the first half of the year until the summer in both main markets, after which sales prices decreased in China while remaining at high level in Europe.\n\n| KEY FIGURES                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Sales, EURm                      | 2,945  | 2,183  |\n| Comparable EBIT, EURm            | 817    | 166    |\n| Capital employed (average), EURm | 4,437  | 3,620  |\n| Comparable ROCE, %               | 18.4   | 4.6    |\n| Personnel on 31 Dec.             | 2,692  | 2,695  |\n\nComparable EBIT increased due to significantly higher pulp and timber sales prices.

The growing Chinese middle-class and the increasing use of paper packaging materials, tissue paper and specialty paper push the demand for pulp.\n\nWe have gained a strong foothold in the Chinese and European pulp markets and have a good reputation, especially in sustainability. The importance of the Chinese market will continue to grow for years to come as the new pulp mill in Paso de los Toros will be completed  by the end of Q1 2023.\n\nUPM Pulp's Asia-Pacific (APAC) sales team has been operating in China for 10 years and has broken many sales volume records. Currently the team employs 15 professionals. Our\n\npulp production capacity will grow by more than 50%, which means a significant increase in delivery volumes and the strengthening of the Asian sales team.\n\nAlong with the growth we will take a more leading role as a pulp supplier in the market. The prerequisites for success include the right sales strategy and solid customer relationships. This means trust in the products, delivery reliability, sustainability promises and trust in the organisation and the people in it.\n\nCo-operation with customers especially in technical and sustainability projects has also contributed to the sustainable development of the paper industry in China.\n\nwww.upmpulp.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM Timber benefitted from improved economic activity and a high demand of wood-based construction materials.

The traffic has been distributed and differentiated taking into account bus capacity, air conditioning and seating arrangements. Cleaning of accommodation has been intensified and accommodation capacity has been limited. Those who test positive have been accommodated in separate buildings.\n\nContractors have assigned separate COVID coordinators to facilitate communication. External experts assess the functionality and timeliness of the measures. Close co-operation, testing and timely communication have reduced the number of infections.\n\nThe screening capacity has been developed so that initially all employees were provided with external testing services. Soon after we received our own testing equipment and rapid test kits and most recently our own PCR laboratory.\n\nThe testing strategy covers all workers, suppliers, drivers and others who move around the sites. There are clear criteria for access. During the peak of the pandemic, the entire site was tested every two weeks and a 24-hour health service was set up. Returning from holiday requires sampling before starting work. During 2021, around 40,000 coronavirus tests were carried out in Paso de los Toros.\n\nWe have also participated in a vaccination campaign with the national health authorities to increase the number of vaccinated workers.\n\nwww.upmpasodelostoros.com\n\nin the use of paper packaging materials, tissue and hygiene papers, and specialty papers is pushing the demand for pulp.\n\nIn terms of timber, the demand for responsible construction material is driving future growth. We are continuously seeking to improve our customer value creation. We are also working to develop our customers' businesses within our long-term co-operations and to improve our environmental footprint throughout the value chain. Our operating model has been revamped since 2020 to improve our internal operations so that they are even more effective.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to implement our growth strategy for pulp. Construction of our new pulp mill in Uruguay proceeded intensively in all main areas (page 42). Our commercial strategy focused on further strengthening our commercial capability and scaling our business processes to profitably serve the current and future markets with six million tonnes of pulp in 2023. At the same time, continuous improvement and the efficiency measures implemented in Finnish operations yielded results in productivity.\n\nThe growth and competitiveness of our business is enabled by the strong forestry operations in Finland and Uruguay (page 84). Efforts in operational excellence and productivity continued in 2021, with a specific focus on the plantation expansion in Uruguay and cost efficiency and sustainability in Finland.\n\n## Replacing fossil-based products\n\nAs a sustainable, renewable, recyclable, and biodegradable raw material, pulp responds to the growing need for responsible alternatives to replace fossil-based materials. Pulp is already being used as an alternative to plastic packaging and its uses as a textile fibre, composite material and material for the chemical industry is currently being researched.\n\nPulp is produced in energy-efficient mills. Sustainability and circular economy are integrated in all our operations from the sustainably managed commercial forests and eucalyptus plantations to the use of residues and side streams as well as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\nthe recyclability of most end products in the paper and board segments.\n\n## COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT RENEWED IN COLLABORATION WITH ALL PARTIES\n\nUPM Timber and the Finnish Industrial Union signed a business-specific three-year collective agreement in December 2021. The new agreement enables increased flexibility to meet the needs of both employees and production. It also creates better conditions for sawmills to increase production and hire new labour on more flexible terms.\n\nThe agreement also allows a faster, cost-effective response to market fluctuations with a working time range instead of a fixed number of hours, which was the case previously. UPM Timber's payroll structures were also renewed, creating more incentives for individuals and teams.\n\nUPM Timber's business management, sawmill directors, employee representatives from each sawmill and representatives of the Industrial Union were involved in the negotiations. This allowed diverse points of view to be expressed during the discussions and made it possible to take into account the wishes of the personnel as well as the specific needs of the sawmill business.\n\nAll parties will see benefits from the new agreement. The solution will ensure that employees' purchasing power is strengthened and the collective agreement will continue to determine the minimum working conditions for employees. In turn, UPM Timber can develop its business well into the future.\n\nwww.upmtimber.com\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe global construction industry is estimated to account for nearly 40% of energy-related CO 2 emissions. Replacing non-renewable raw materials in construction with responsibly produced timber is an effective solution for emission reduction. All of our sawmills run with 100% renewable energy and our timber products sequester carbon throughout their lifespan. We can offer wood products with the lowest possible carbon footprint to our customers. We also have a long track record on responsible business practices.",

During 2021, we implemented an upgraded biodiversity strategy for biodiversity conservation management. At present, the network of formal conservation areas covers nearly 16,000 hectares. The aim is to increase these protected areas under UPM's clearly defined conservation categories and to continue with the long term biodiversity programme (right).\n\nUruguay's native forests are all protected. The country is located within a temperate climate zone so there are no rain forests. Plantations are established on former grazing lands classified for commercial forests. The Forestry Act sets strict rules for plantation design and structure. This includes location, tree types and identifying suitable forestry soils for plantation development, as well as safe zones around roads, native forests and waterways.\n\nwww.upmpasodelostoros.com www.upmpulp.com\n\n- \u00b7  Construction of a state-of-the-art eucalyptus tree nursery, scheduled to begin operations in March 2022, progressed in Sarand\u00ed del Y\u00ed.\n- \u00b7  Ramping up all operations related to wood supply, contracting required services for forestry and mill operations, and recruiting and training new resources advanced.\n- \u00b7  Preparing commercial readiness continued to proceed.\n- \u00b7  Mitigating actions to ensure the progress of the project were implemented due to the pandemic and tight global supply chains.\n- \u00b7  The project's completion plan was finetuned in January 2022.\n\n## Role of plantations\n\nEucalyptus availability for the mill is secured through our own and leased plantations, as well as through wood sourcing agreements with private partners. Our plantation areas in Uruguay cover 466,000 hectares of UPM's own and leased land.\n\nSustainably managed plantations are highly productive, acting as a carbon sink while taking care of biodiversity. Eucalyptus' fast growth rate and rotation time of 10 years make it the preferred plantation tree. We have created a permanent carbon storage of 55 million tonnes of CO 2 -equivalent in 30 years.

Our plan is to have 20% or more of our own land holding designated as under conservation management. We continually work with external experts to have an up-to-date list of total species, flora and fauna, and endangered species. Of the native flora species in Uruguay recorded by the end of 2021, 70% of those species were also present on land owned by UPM, for example.\n\nA new native flower species was also discovered on our conservation land for the first time in Uruguay. The white flower, Antiphytum charruasorum, shows how important it is to have conservation areas growing around the eucalyptus plantations.\n\nwww.upm.com/biodiversity",

The CO 2 -free electricity we produce contributes to achieving the 1.5\u00ba C climate commitment signed by UPM.\n\nThe electricity generated is sold to the Nordic Nord Pool power exchange. We trade directly in physical electricity and electricity derivatives. We also provide optimisation and consumption flexibility services to industrial electricity users and other energy companies.\n\nUPM Energy's hydropower plants meet the growing demand for renewable energy. Hydropower o/ffers rapid adjustment to an electricity system in which weather dependent solar and wind power are becoming increasingly important. Flexible hydropower balances the system in an increasingly volatile market, while nuclear power ensures reliable baseload capacity for the system.\n\n## Creating value in a volatile market\n\nThe price of electricity rose to a record level in Finland and in Europe in 2021. Prices of natural gas and emission allowances and the droughts in Sweden and Norway pushed up electricity prices in the Nordic countries.

The largest ongoing investment project is the construction of the Olkiluoto nuclear power plant unit 3 by Teollisuuden Voima (TVO). The Olkiluoto 3 project is in the final stretch and is scheduled to start regular electricity production in July 2022. UPM's share of the new unit's production will be approximately 500 MW generated through Pohjolan Voima's ownership. The Olkiluoto 3 will significantly increase the supply of CO 2 -free electricity in Finland.\n\nIn August, we announced an investment in an ultracapacitor for hydropower plants in Kuhmo's Ontojoki River. This investment will increase our ability to produce more and faster reserve power from hydropower plants. The industrial-scale project will pilot innovative technology to meet the changing needs of the electricity market and enable more renewable energy in the grid. (right)\n\nMarket-oriented solutions are contributing to the transformation of the energy market, and new transmission connections will increasingly link the Nordic electricity market to the continental European market. Electrification will play an important role in moving society away from fossil-based energy sources.

We are working closely with authorities and other stakeholders to minimise these impacts. In addition to the regulatory fishery fees required by the permit conditions, we protect and restore migratory fish stocks through our own migratory fish programme. The programme involves dismantling migratory barriers and testing new ways to rebuild fish stocks in different parts of Finland.\n\nThe migratory fish programme was also promoted in 2021. UPM submitted an application for a permit to dismantle the dam structures of a disused water intake in Arvajankoski, J\u00e4ms\u00e4, and to carry out a fisheries rehabilitation in Arvajankoski. We are actively looking for new potential sites for the removal of migration barriers and new innovative ways to promote fish migration in co-operation with stakeholders.\n\nwww.upmenergy.com\n\n## MORE BALANCING POWER FROM AN ULTRACAPACITOR\n\nUPM is now the first energy company to pilot energy storage with an ultracapacitor in a system comprising two hydropower plants. The power plants are Katerma in Kuhmo and Kallioinen in Sotkamo, both located along the Ontojoki River in Finland.\n\nUltracapacitors are electrostatic devices that can quickly discharge or charge large amounts of electrical power. Combined with a hydropower plant, an ultracapacitor can react in milliseconds to meet the rapid demand for power. It acts as the fast-responding part of the system, responding to the power demand first minutes, after which hydropower takes the lead and continues to balance the electricity system.\n\nAs the amount of renewable energy is predicted to grow in the future, more balancing power capability will be needed to quickly rebalance the grid when needed. Innovations like this are a prerequisite for adding renewable energy to the system. We are using it as a system to bring new reserves to the market and to enable more renewable energy in the grid. The addition of an ultracapacitor to a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhydropower plant will reduce the need for rapid response control of the plant and allows smooth power generation control. It will have no impact on dam safety, water use or the aquatic environment.\n\nConstruction started in autumn 2021, and the ultracapacitor is expected to be connected to the power plants in the second quarter of 2022.\n\nWe continued the extensive renovation and modernisation of the Kuusankoski hydropower plant. The phased project will be fully completed during the first quarter of 2023. The plant's average annual energy production is expected to increase from the current 180 GWh to 195 GWh. Modern hydropower technologies are not only more e/fficient but also better for the environment.",

On the other hand, in the second half of the year, the APAC fine paper supply-demand balance proved challenging, and sales prices decreased.\n\nHigher input costs and the exceptional circumstances surrounding the energy market also impacted our performance.\n\n| KEY FIGURES                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Sales, EURm                      | 1,482  | 1,324  |\n| Comparable EBIT, EURm            | 135    | 199    |\n| Capital employed (average), EURm | 864    | 897    |\n| Comparable ROCE, %               | 15.6   | 22.2   |\n| Personnel on 31 Dec.             | 1, 918 | 1,932  |\n\nComparable EBIT decreased due to higher input costs. Sales prices increased and delivery volumes were higher. Global demand for label, release and packaging paper was good in 2021. Demand was driven by fast moving consumer goods and e-commerce.\n\nHowever, in China for example, we managed the challenging situation very well, with the help of our own on-site power plant. The availability of raw materials was secured successfully, and we were able to run our operations without interruption, despite global logistical challenges.\n\nSales continued to grow in line with our strategy. Over the past few years, commercialisation of our specialty grades has been a success and in 2021, we launched a new, enhanced barrier paper that o/ffers a fibre-based alternative for dry, greasy and frozen foods. We also launched new packaging grades for the Asian market. Our packaging grades are certified as fit for food contact. The new barrier paper and our kraft paper for packaging received an award in China for being an innovative and sustainable solution for reducing fossil-based packaging.\n\n## Megatrends drive demand\n\nMegatrends support our business and healthy market demand is expected to continue. Certain trends driven by consumer behaviour have even grown during the COVID-19 pandemic, but volatility and unpredictability have also increased (right).\n\nThe co-creation of our packaging papers and services continues to be one of the cornerstones of our strategy. We aim to strengthen value chain synergy through co-operation and innovation. We o/ffer recyclable fibre-based alternatives to nonrenewable materials. We have several new product development projects ongoing with our customers and we are also continuously developing our understanding of end uses with growth potential.\n\nAs the global market leader in release base papers and label papers, and as a well-positioned player in the growing packaging and Asian fine paper markets, we are well prepared for growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\n## Customer value from sustainability\n\nMany megatrends that are driving the market demand for our products are strongly linked to sustainability. Global brand owners have set ambitious targets to increase the share of packaging that is both recyclable and made using renewable raw materials. Our flexible packaging papers can help meet these targets, providing us with co-creation opportunities to develop new solutions for fibre-based packaging.\n\nIn China, we have a proven track record for being leaders in sustainable operations. In 2021, the UPM Changshu paper mill was recognised as a frontrunner in sustainable development within the Jiangsu province. The mill's water management and pollution control were the particular processes for which this recognition was received.\n\nwww.upmspecialtypapers.com\n\n## CONSUMER CHOICES HAVE A BIG IMPACT\n\nChanges in consumer behaviour, such as the growth of e-commerce and growing awareness of sustainability, have a positive impact on the demand for specialty papers, also after the pandemic.\n\nIn 2020, 1.3 billion e-commerce parcels shipped worldwide but forecasts estimate that this number will exceed 2.7 billion by 2026. E-commerce was a popular way to shop in China even before the pandemic, but COVID-19 has boosted e-commerce growth even more, especially in Europe and in the USA. E-commerce accounted for 18% of global retail sales in 2020, really outlining the growth potential. The growth of e-commerce has an impact on the need for both packaging material and logistics labels.\n\nThe packaging business is mainly driven by the growth of the middle class, and urbanisation resulting in smaller households and growing consumer spending power. It is particularly a trend in strong developing markets, such as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmany Asian countries. The Chinese consumer market alone is expected to double by 2030.\n\nWhen people move to cities, their consumption habits also change. In China, for example, it is estimated that more than 60% of food is sold at markets, mostly without packaging. This is rapidly changing. Packaged food increases the need for packaging material and labels. As the demand for packaging grows, fibre-based materials offer easy-to-recycle packaging based on renewable raw materials.\n\nOur focused growth investments over the past five years have strengthened our operational excellence and flexible operating platform. In 2021, our ROCE was 15.6%, which was above our long-term return target.",

We o/ffer an extensive product range of graphic papers for advertising and publishing, as well as for home and o/ffice use.\n\n## Good market demand and significant cost increases\n\nIn 2021, consumers spent more time with magazines, books and newspapers, and subscribed to a higher number of printed publications. Consequently, paper demand recovered well from the previous year when the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown measures caused, although temporary, an unexpected and severe disruption to demand.\n\nDespite good demand and successful price increases, our profitability was weak due to significant cost increases in pulp, recycled fibre and logistics. Furthermore, despite hedging, the energy crisis in Europe resulted in unforeseen cost increases.\n\nThe demand and supply balance in Europe was tight and our ability to serve our customers reliably was highly prioritised. Our operating rates were good. However, global bottlenecks in the supply chain and challenges in raw material availability somewhat impacted our operations and supply security.\n\nOur focus on active capacity management and cost competitiveness continued. The UPM Kaipola paper mill was permanently closed in January and the UPM Shotton newsprint mill was sold in September. We also took further action to streamline our organisation.\n\n## Ensuring performance\n\nToday, the global market for graphic papers exceeds 70 million tonnes, with approximately 19 million tonnes in Europe alone. Even when in decline, these markets continue to o/ffer profitable business and good cash flow for mills with a competitive cost position and high e/fficiency.

Another key area is that of strengthening our customer focus. We're constantly aiming to renew our product o/ffering, as well as increase the e/ffectiveness of our planning, supply and delivery processes (right).\n\n## Reducing our carbon footprint\n\nWe have set high sustainability standards for our products, safety and environmental performance. Paper is a renewable material and can be recycled e/fficiently.\n\nUPM's new tool for reporting our energy\n\nWe are committed to reducing our CO 2 emissions by 65% by 2030 and aim to lower the carbon footprint of our products and supply chain activities. In 2021, we added carbon-neutral paper to our portfolio so that our customers can reduce carbon emissions in their supply chains. We also established a carbon o/ffset service, certified by Gold Standard, to compensate for the remaining carbon footprint generated by our paper products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\nconsumption and CO 2 emissions provides a consistent, more transparent, and simpleto-use reporting system for us. The data is of added value to our customers due to the customer-specific carbon footprint reporting (page 95).\n\nBased on our long-term wind power purchase agreement, the use of renewable wind power will reduce UPM's total annual CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 5% as of 2022. We are also evaluating further sustainable power purchase agreements in Europe. At the UPM Nordland mill, we are currently constructing a natural gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant, and at the UPM H\u00fcrth mill we are building a new biomass-fired plant.\n\n## THE NEW PAPER PORTFOLIO IS A WIN/uniF6BAWIN FOR EVERYONE\n\nUPM is committed to maintaining competitive operations. Long-term success in graphic paper production is much more than merely adapting capacity to customer demand. Even if declining in the long term, the markets offer profitable business for products with a competitive cost structure.\n\nWe offer an extensive product range for all major printing methods. In 2021, we renewed our offering of coated mechanical papers with a non-glossy finish and reduced the number of paper grades to five. This way, we can meet our customers' needs and ensure a high level of service capability and supply chain security. These coated mechanical papers are mostly used in magazines, catalogues and advertisements.\n\nThe main advantage for our customers is that we can supply our paper grades from multiple mills. All of these papers are also large volume products, which presents a cost benefit to customers. For UPM, this improved\n\n<!-- image -->\n\noffering aligns with our asset capabilities, which results in increased operational efficiency.\n\nThe renewal project was carried out in close collaboration with customers. The feedback has been so positive that the same assessment will also be carried out on improved newsprint and SC papers in 2022. Our target is also to secure the cost competitive graphic paper offering in the future.\n\nwww.upmpaper.com\n\nProduction-related CO 2 emissions are our chief means of reducing our overall carbon footprint. Our emissions reduction plan includes modern power generation, environmentally sound power purchasing and innovative energy management solutions.",

The capital expenditure estimate will also be updated.\n\noperations personnel for the biorefinery. The innovative digital twin of our biorefinery supports the establishment of robust production processes and a competent, well-trained team.\n\n## Market demand and customer interest confirmed\n\nConsumers are pushing for sustainable products globally. Global brands have embraced ambitious CO 2 reduction targets and are innovating their portfolio to o/ffer sustainable choices for consumers.\n\nThis distinct sustainability value add is reflected in the positive feedback we have received throughout our commercial engagement in 2021. We have made strong progress in opening sales channels in various glycol end-use industries, mainly in packaging, automotive and textile applications.\n\nWhile recycled materials have become the mainstream choice for sustainable materials, UPM's biochemicals made from renewable raw materials will offer a missing link to achieve a sustainable circular bioeconomy: rubber and plastics based on renewable chemicals. Our glycols and Renewable Functional Fillers (RFF) work well in existing production and recycling processes, and will support the transition away from oil-, gas- and coal-based materials (right).\n\nWe have started joint product development with potential customers in various rubber applications to validate the technical performance of our RFFs and bring sustainable alternatives to CO 2 -heavy rubbers to the market. We also launched UPM BioMotion\u2122, the renewable functional fillers set to significantly reduce the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\ncarbon footprint and weight of rubber and plastic applications.\n\nOur biorefinery project has also received positive external recognition. We were among the seven finalists of the prestigious German Sustainability Award and our contribution to the sustainability transformation was recognised by the jury. We were selected as a finalist in the Chemical Week's Sustainability Awards 2021 and climbed up to 3rd place in the European Rubber Journal's top 10 elastomers for sustainability ranking.\n\nThe possibilities of our new biochemical products are endless. This was demonstrated by a co-operation announcement with the Coca-Cola Company, who have unveiled their new 100% plant-based recyclable bottle, highlighting UPM's industrial-scale biorefinery as a breakthrough for the production of a new generation of biochemicals that will help produce the sustainable packaging of the future.\n\nwww.upmbiochemicals.com\n\n## RENEWABLE FUNCTIONAL FILLERS WILL BE A REAL GAME/uniF6BACHANGER\n\nToday, about 15 million tons of oil-based carbon black and silica are used annually to reinforce rubbers and plastics in tyres, hoses, sealing systems and other rubber and plastic products. Industries are intensively looking for more sustainable business alternatives.\n\nThe wood-based renewable functional fillers to be produced in the future biorefinery will have the same performance level as fossil-based fillers. When they enter the market, they will significantly reduce the carbon footprint of various rubber and plastic products. According to our calculations, RFFs have an over 90% lower CO 2 -footprint than industrial carbon black. When used in combination with bio-based rubbers and plasticisers, they enable final compounds to contain up to 85% renewable substances.\n\nWood-based fillers are also much lighter. Lightness in the automotive industry means better mileage, lower costs and a reduction of CO 2 emissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe market size for RFF is huge - carbon black is one of the top 10 petro-based products in the world. Industrial carbon black used in tires constitutes around one third of their component materials and profiles can account for up to half.\n\nFor industrial use, the composition of each rubber compound must be carefully optimised. We aim to perfect our new customised product quickly and effectively through close customer collaboration.\n\nAt the same time, the business platform was further strengthened. We have continued building a team of international experts with a strong chemical industry background to further advance our research and development, build strong commercial operations, and then establish the service and supply infrastructure to meet our customers' specific needs.

The instrument, software and cell culture matrices advance research and accelerate the drug development process in which thousands of molecules are screened, to eventually introduce a new drug onto the market.\n\nPerkinElmer's automated high-content screening system using GrowDex hydrogels has been successfully used in a number of research projects, including automated drug sensitivity and resistance testing of patient-derived cells for personalised cancer treatment research.\n\nUPM Biomedicals develops and supplies innovative and sustainable wood-based biomedical products for medical and life science applications. The main component in our products is high-quality nanocellulose, extracted from birch wood.\n\nIn life science , our main products are GrowDex\u00ae, a range of hydrogels for 3D cell culturing, and GrowDase\u2122, an enzyme to release the cells from the gel. The nanocellulose ensures excellent compatibility with even the most demanding cells, such as stem cells and patient-derived cells. Our gels are animal free and do not introduce animal DNA into the test results. In 2021,\n\nwe entered into a global distribution agreement with PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. for the UPM GrowDex\u00ae and GrowDase\u2122 products (left).\n\nIn the clinical field , FibDex\u00ae wound dressings were marketed and sold to healthcare professionals and hospitals in Finland, and work is ongoing to expand into other European markets.\n\nGrowInk\u2122 is a range of bioinks for 3D bioprinting, used in areas like cancer research, where models of tumours can be printed to test their response to di/fferent treatments. Launched in 2021, our collaboration with CELLINK will allow us to develop the technology to print organs or tissue that, in the future, could be transplanted into patients.\n\nwww.upmbiomedicals.com\n\nUPM BIOCOMPOSITES\n\n## A YEAR OF GROWTH\n\nUPM Biocomposites is mitigating climate change and creating circular economy solutions through the manufacture of innovative composite materials and decking products.\n\nUPM ProFi utilises post-consumer plastic waste and post-industrial label waste to manufacture high-quality composite decking. The label production side streams from UPM Raflatac and its customers are collected and delivered to Germany, where the composite decking is manufactured. Recycled plastic from European post-consumer waste is also utilised in the manufacturing process. UPM ProFi's latest product launches in the UPM ProFi Piazza product range consist of up to 75% recycled materials. UPM ProFi is a member of the EU Circular Plastics Alliance, which aims to boost the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nUPM Formi creates and manufactures wood-based biocomposites, which enables up to an 80% reduction in the carbon footprint of the end product, compared to similar products made from fossil-based materials. The composite materials are suitable for various end uses, including kitchenware, personal care and acoustic devices. The materials meet the highest quality standards, allowing the products to pass food standards or similar quality requirements.\n\nIn 2021, UPM Formi, in conjunction with key business development partners, experienced volume growth among new and existing customers as a result of new enduse areas. Strong demand for UPM Formi EcoAce continued. UPM Formi's customers were recognised with prestigious awards for using sustainable materials, such as the Red Dot Design Award and the iF Gold Award.\n\nwww.upmprofi.com www.upmformi.com\n\n## CASE\n\n## THE LIMITLESS OPPORTUNITIES OF SUSTAINABLE DESIGN\n\nReform Design Lab's Reform Lounge Chair, introduced at the Stockholm Creative Edition design week, was created using 3D printing. Using this cellulose-reinforced biocomposite material, UPM Formi 3D can reduce the product's carbon footprint by up to 80%, compared to its similar fossil-based counterparts.\n\nThe carbon footprint is further reduced by the zero waste production process and the fact that transportation costs can be kept to a minimum by printing the furniture in close proximity to the end users.\n\nwww.reformlab.se/black/\n\nWe actively collaborate with universities, research centres and key industrial partners in the fields of high-throughput drug screening, personalised medicine, advanced cell therapies, 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering and advanced wound care. More than 520 patents and patent applications protect our existing and future products.\n\nIn 2021, UPM ProFi achieved significant sales growth across many European markets with its renewed product portfolio. Thanks to its local European operations, operating e/fficiency and marketing capabilities, it also benefitted from the increase in home renovations during the COVID-19 lockdowns.",

We aim to provide a fact-based, balanced view of the economic, environmental and social aspects of our business activities. Active and open dialogue with our stakeholders provides valuable input for our development e/fforts.\n\n## Continuous dialogue with stakeholders\n\nOur goal is to provide our stakeholders with a clear picture of what our future course is, how we implement our Biofore strategy and how we create long term value for our stakeholders. We disclose relevant and accurate information in accordance with market regulations.\n\nStakeholder mapping, active dialogue and the systematic gathering of feedback play an essential role in our stakeholder relations work. We analyse the feedback carefully to understand the expectations of our stakeholders. Then, we take these expectations into consideration during our development work and decision-making. We received approximately 400 (350) enquiries or concerns from general public in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, many stakeholder events were organised virtually. As many of our stakeholders view UPM primarily as an economic operator, financial success, stability, good governance, future outlook and growth were the key themes discussed.\n\nEvery year, we conduct a materiality analysis (page 66) that highlights the most important responsibility issues for us and our stakeholders. The analysis is based on several surveys, customer enquiries and stakeholders' concerns.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder engagement provides predictability and a competitive advantage\n- \u00b7 Continuous dialogue improves the understanding of key risks, challenges and opportunities in the operating environment\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 We understand the stakeholders' needs for information and expectations for UPM, and consider them in strategic development and decision-making processes\n\n## Green recovery high on the policy agenda\n\nThrough public a/ffairs work, we aim to foster the necessary prerequisites for our operations, particularly in Finland, Uruguay, Germany and China. Active influencing at the EU level is also important.\n\nWe co-operate with a number of trade associations, the most important being the Finnish Forest Industries Federation (FFIF) and the Confederation of European Paper Industries (CEPI). As we enter new businesses, we also need to find new ways and forums for co-operation. For example, UPM is a founding member of the Advanced Biofuels Coalition in the EU and also a member of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC).\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 We engage in active dialogue with our stakeholders to discuss our operations and targets\n- \u00b7 The UPM Code of Conduct sets the standards for responsible behaviour and collaboration\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder engagement is measured by several indicators\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder relations are coordinated globally at Group level, while businesses are responsible for continuous dialogue with customers and business partners, as well as the local communities\n\nFor decision-makers and politicians, 2021 continued to be challenging because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns. Despite the need to prioritise measures related to the global pandemic, there was significant progress in several policy fields with impacts for UPM. We were active in discussions on the Finnish operating environment. We emphasised competitiveness, predictability, innovations and climate change solutions.\n\nClimate change mitigation and our commitment to the UN's 1.5-degree agenda garnered a lot of interest among our stakeholders. Discussions were carried out with environmental organisations, certification bodies, authorities and decision-makers. The climate impact of forests is linked to\n\n## OUR MOST IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDERS\n\nOur Biofore strategy forms the foundation of our/uni00A0stakeholder dialogue.

They also ensure safety in varying life situations. As of 2022, the salaried employees' terms of employment will be organised in the same way as for senior salaried employees.\n\nUPM Plywood and UPM Timber signed a business-specific collective labour agreement in December 2021. The Paperworkers' Union is the contractual party for five businesses. Since spring the businesses sought to enter business-specific collective bargaining with the union on terms of employment. The Paperworkers' Union has required one company-specific collective labour agreement. On 1 January 2022, the union began a strike in the businesses where it is the contracting party.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npolicies on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). We have highlighted the importance of sustainable forest management and manufacturing products from renewable raw materials that replace fossils as e/ffective ways to mitigate climate change.\n\nWe actively promote the cost-competitive and consistent implementation of climate change policies. UPM calls for predictable regulation that enables green growth investments and further transformation beyond fossils. Therefore, EU policies, as well as the upcoming negotiations between the European Parliament and the EU member states, must ensure sustainable forest use and the availability of wood as a key resource for the circular bioeconomy and green growth.\n\nIn July the EU Commission published the Fit for 55 package, which includes several initiatives to update the EU climate and energy legislation to be in line with EU's climate targets. The process for finalising the proposals in EU institutions is expected to take a few years.\n\nDecarbonising tra/ffic through renewable energy and biofuel policies continued. For us, it is very important to get recognition for advanced and residue-based biofuels with high GHG reduction.\n\n## CASE\n\n## TOWARDS BUSINESS/uniF6BASPECIFIC COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS IN FINLAND\n\nAfter the Finnish Forest Industries Federation resigned from collective bargaining, the terms of employment are agreed between forest products companies and trade unions. Our aim was to sign new business-specific agreements for the shopfloor employees before the previous agreements ended on 31 December 2021.\n\nFor each UPM business, the products, markets and operating environment differ significantly. The best result can be achieved for everyone by agreeing on ways of organising work, working hours and salaries, as well as competence development within businesses. We offer benefits that surpass the standards set in law and collective labour agreements",

The results highlight the sustainability topics UPM has a significant impact on, or which have a significant impact on the company. The analysis covers both positive and negative impacts on the economy, the environment and people.\n\nThe current sustainability impacts are assessed based on a follow up of the interests and concerns of various stakeholder groups; communities, employees, NGOs, customers, suppliers, government and regulators, investors, researchers and the media.

We also conduct specific stakeholder surveys regularly.\n\nMost of the material economic, environmental and social responsibility topics identified in the analysis are presented below. UPM's responsibility focus areas and targets (pages 32-33) reflect these material aspects. We do not distinguish between topics within the section and consider them all equally material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\n## LEGISLATION PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BIOFUELS BUSINESS\n\nAdvocacy co-operation is an important means to promote the development of advanced biofuels regulatory frameworks in the EU. Influence comes from dialogue with policy makers, public authorities, organisations and the media as well as understanding the factors that influence business regulation.\n\nIn 2021, the EU Commission presented Fit for 55, a major package of climate legislation proposals. It sets new targets for the use of advanced biofuels.\n\nWe want to promote investments and market entry of advanced biofuels. Our message in the discussions is that advanced biofuels are needed to meet the emission reduction targets for transport. We also explain what should be done to increase investments in reducing emissions. The EU's energy independence will increase when advanced biofuels are produced from industrial and agricultural and forestry side streams, waste and residues.\n\nUPM's biofuel business is based on the EU-wide biofuel blending obligation. In the past, regulation focused on the Renewable Energy Directive. With the proposals in the Fit for 55 package, the business will be affected by a number of different directives. The industry-wide Advanced Biofuels Coalition takes position on the issues related to the EU-wide mandate for advanced biofuels in aviation, maritime and transport sectors. UPM also wants sufficiently clear criteria on how sustainability is defined.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\n## The Biofore Share and Care programme continues\n\nUPM's Biofore Share and Care programme demonstrates our dedication to responsibility and local community involvement through sponsorships, donations and employee voluntary work. We share our resources with causes that respect sustainable development and work in line with our purpose and values.\n\nIn 2021, we supported projects with a focus on reading and learning, Beyond Fossils initiatives and community engagement. For example, we collaborated closely with the Guides and Scouts of Finland to increase the dialogue and understanding between young people, companies and policy makers on topics such as climate change and responsibility. The collaboration will continue in 2022. UPM does not financially support political parties or individual candidates.\n\nOur new 2030 social responsibility targets highlight our local commitment and positive impact on communities. We assess and measure the quality of community relationships and define business specific long-term initiatives in line with our programme.\n\nEmployee volunteering strengthens local commitment and impact. However, the number of employee volunteering hours was limited due to prevailing COVID-19 situation in 2021.\n\nIn addition, EUR 498,700 (EUR 499,500) was donated to charities or other non-profit causes such as Aalto University, the University of Helsinki, Economy and youth TAT, the Children and Youth Foundation, UNICEF, the Association of Forest Kindergartens in Bayern and the China Green Foundation.\n\nThe local sponsorships and other contributions amounted to approximately EUR 0.8 million (EUR 1.3 million) within the Biofore Share and Care Programme. The figure includes support for the Uruguayan UPM Foundation, which continued with a contribution of USD 400,000 (USD 465,000). The foundation supports and encourages training, entrepreneurship, employment, healthy living and entertainment in local communities in the Uruguayan countryside.\n\naim to promote sustainable forest management globally. In Finland, we participated in updating the forest management standards in both the FSC\u2122 (Forest Stewardship Council\u2122, FSC N003385) and the PEFC schemes. We also collaborated with the Finnish Osprey Foundation and Vida Silvestre in Uruguay.\n\nTogether with the Natural Resources Institute Finland, we studied the impact of actions to improve biodiversity in commercial forests. Responsibility issues were also raised in customer enquiries, with product safety, sustainable forest management and climate change as key themes. Globally, we continued active co-operation with local permit authorities. In 2021, we continued our collaboration with di/fferent parties to integrate our responsibility targets into the company's long term financing.\n\n## Emphasis on local communities and impacts\n\nOur mills in Europe, China and Uruguay can be among the biggest employers and taxpayers in the locations where they operate. In Uruguay, we have been building a second pulp mill since 2019. Stakeholder engagement around the project has been active.\n\nOur EMAS (EU Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) statements cover societal impacts in addition to environmental performance, providing more detailed information on the local impacts of our pulp and paper mills. The EMAS statements also include information on co-operation with local stakeholders, such as sponsorship of local organisations or co-operation with educational institutions. These mill-specific statements complement UPM's corporate EMAS reporting. They are compiled annually and published on the UPM website www. upm.com/responsibility.\n\nWe aim for engagement and open dialogue with local communities. For example, our Kymi, Kaukas and Steyrerm\u00fchl mills have their own forums for local dialogue. We also co-operate with local schools and education networks, organising virtual events, for example. In addition, it is crucial for us to have active dialogue with local forest owners, neighbours of harvesting sites and other individuals involved in forest management.",

Our values-Trust and be trusted, Achieve together and Renew with courage-guide us along the way.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are determined to be a responsible and attractive employer now and in the future. Developing UPM Experience is an important focus area for the future. We want to make an impact that strengthens employees' sense of belonging and the feeling that they are doing meaningful work; promotes productivity; increases engagement and wellbeing; and enables meaningful collaboration as well as diversity and inclusion.\n\nOur values remain the foundation of who we are. Building a culture of Aiming Higher is essential to our success in today's rapidly changing world. We are accountable and performance driven, and we want to maintain these strengths while developing new ones. We have set the additional goal of becoming more human-centric and eager to learn and grow.\n\nAccording to the OHI (Organizational Health Index) survey, which measures overall organisational health, we are in the top decile of this global benchmark. The fact that our organisational health has been strengthened further since the last survey in 2017 is a sign of a job well done across the company. The OHI results also show that e/fforts put into people performance management have paid o/ff.\n\nOur aim is to increase employee motivation to drive performance. We want to have fair compensation while di/fferentiating and rewarding high performance. Our Enabling Performance approach encompasses frequent and forward-looking manager-employee discussions, agile goal setting and regular feedback from relevant stakeholders.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Improved performance, engagement and professional growth\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Aim higher in performance\n- \u00b7 Lead with passion\n- \u00b7 Create the future beyond fossils\n- \u00b7 Raise the bar in our safety performance\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Lead according to our values and with integrity\n- \u00b7 Develop an inclusive and diverse working environment\n- \u00b7 Engage employees to create active dialogue and a future beyond fossils\n- \u00b7 Enable performance with agile goal setting and feedback\n- \u00b7 Invest in the growth of our people and develop new capabilities\n- \u00b7 Provide a safe and healthy working environment and foster the wellbeing of employees and contractors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEmployee engagement clearly above benchmark by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\naverage score achieved, which is 9 points below global benchmark\n\nGoal setting discussions and development plans for employees, 100% completion rate by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n88%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n70%\n\nof employees had completed individual goal setting or annual discussion\n\nof employees had a development plan documented\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\n## DIALOGUE ON PURPOSE AND VALUES ACROSS UPM\n\nIn early 2021, we redefined our visionary purpose to We create a future beyond fossils. It describes why we do our work and how we can create a unique, positive impact. All UPMers play an important role in making our purpose and values come to life. To ensure that everyone has a chance to make a personal connection with the company purpose and values, and to discuss these topics with colleagues, we launched a company-wide process to initiate a dialogue on the subject.\n\nEvery UPMer has received a printed guide on UPM's purpose and values. To ensure inclusivity across UPM units and locations, the materials were produced in 18 languages. Team discussions started in late 2021 and will continue in 2022. Team leaders received training and support materials, including a digital workbook for running the team dialogue, to help promote an inspiring and meaningful conversation. Furthermore, dozens of facilitators were trained in 2021.\n\nThe aim of the dialogue on company purpose and values is to create internal cohesion and a feeling of belonging by creating a stronger sense of meaningful work and value-based behaviours. In addition, we aim to strengthen the UPM community and the joy of working together. During 2022, we will share and highlight the experiences of both teams and individuals around the world. Progress will also be tracked in the 2022 employee engagement survey.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\n## Engaging employees\n\nWe are committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations. We o/ffer various forums to facilitate continuous dialogue between employees and business management, and there are new communication tools and channels that ease and enhance dialogue within and across teams.\n\nWe measure our progress regularly. The annual Employee Engagement Survey (EES) has invited all employees across the company to evaluate di/fferent aspects of their work every year since 2007. The survey was renewed in 2021.\n\nOur co-operative body, the UPM European Forum, focuses on issues related to our business environment and changes within the company. The forum organises regular meetings for employee representatives from business units in Europe. There are also co-operative bodies in UPM countries, which operate in accordance with country-specific rules, regulations and company practices. The aim is to promote employee participation and dialogue: dialogue between the business areas and country-level management, and between employee representatives and employees on a national level. After the Finnish Forest Industries Federation resigned from collective bargaining, the terms of employment are agreed between forest products companies and trade unions (page 65).\n\nThe high participation rate of 83% (83%) indicates that UPMers are keen to improve their workplace. The new average engagement score was 68. Aligned with the global trend, engagement decreased compared to the previous year. Outside Finland, it was close to the global benchmark of 77, while in Finland it was significantly lower.\n\n## Encouraging learning\n\nIn a changing and increasingly complex business environment, enhancing employees' capabilities and wellbeing is important for both business success and sustained employability. Our long term goal is to ensure high performance and continuous professional development.\n\nWe invest in the growth of our people and expect individuals to develop. All employees are encouraged to create an individual development plan and keep it up to date. In 2021,",

In the engagement survey, the result on the question about good opportunities to learn and grow at UPM was 62.\n\nDigitalisation is enriching our ways of learning. As the global pandemic has changed our ways of working, we have introduced new e-learning content and programmes on an ongoing basis. These materials provide support to leaders in managing their teams remotely and encourage individuals to strengthen their self-leadership skills and resilience. Employees can share digital learning content flexibly on our learning platform. E-learning content is o/ffered to develop skills in areas such as commerce, finance, compliance, safety and leadership.\n\nWe apply the 70-20-10 learning and development framework: 70% of the learning takes place on the job; 20% comes from sharing with, and learning from, colleagues; and 10% comes from o/ff-the-job training.\n\n## Developing employee experience and enabling renewal\n\nOur apprenticeship programmes are a way to ensure the required level of expertise for future employees. The programmes are typically targeted at shop-floor positions in production or maintenance. We run the programmes with regional vocational\n\nschools. In Finland and Germany, approximately 100 people join the programmes annually. Most of the graduate apprentices have carried on working at UPM.\n\nDeveloping employee experience is a key aspect in developing UPM as a workplace. To strengthen our work community, we have started a dialogue on our purpose and values (page 69). All UPMers are given a chance to create a personal and team-based connection to our purpose, values and Aiming Higher mindset. Managers have been provided with support to facilitate productive and inspiring discussions in their teams.\n\nBeing the employer of choice has become crucial when recruiting new employees, especially younger professionals. We have organised several successful graduate programmes in recent years. We have extended our employer brand to new growth areas.\n\nWe have also launched projects to develop future ways of working and digital capabilities, and to create global health and wellbeing concepts. We have continued to develop our career experiences after employees are hired. We use a design-thinking approach and enable employees to contribute to projects. Based on the targets set for career experience in 2020, we started to redefine our development planning process and tools in 2021.\n\nFollowing our systematic employer branding work, our position among students and professionals was recognised by external parties in Finland and China.\n\n## Leading by example\n\nAchieving our ambitious targets requires committed input from skilled people and teams empowered by inspiring leaders.\n\nIn 2021, leadership development focused on team leaders and middle managers, as they lead most of our employees. We have continued to foster a growth mindset and improve the skills needed to enable performance, such as conversation and feedback skills. By the end of 2021, nearly 40% of managers had participated in the programme on achieving quality conversation skills and improved feedback.\n\nWe continuously invest in developing leadership capabilities and management teams. Our development programmes support the three cornerstones of leadership at UPM: leading oneself, leading people and leading the business. In recent years, the key areas of development have been inspiring leadership, coaching capabilities, self-leadership and resilience. Purposeful leadership was added to these areas in 2021.\n\nkas sawmill. UPM also reorganised activities in several businesses and global functions.\n\nWe provide support for employees who are a/ffected by the redundancies. This includes outplacement services and training opportunities that support the a/ffected employees in finding new jobs.\n\nThe closures, reorganising and streamlining of businesses and functions decreased the number of personnel by 884 in total.\n\nOur From Job to Job programme, run in conjunction with local authorities and partners, mitigates the e/ffects of employee redundancies following the closure of the Kaipola paper mill. In addition to our statutory obligations, we have implemented several voluntary measures, including training, a business start-up allowance, and support for temporary housing and education.\n\nOur renewed social resposibility targets on page 32\n\nincentives for the 2021 plan is EUR 60 million. We recognise significant individual or team success with a separate Achievement Award system. It is designed to support UPM's high-performance culture and recognise individuals and teams for outstanding contribution, significant achievements and exceptional performance.\n\nIn addition to the Short Term Incentive scheme, we provide two long term incentive plans: Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees. Launched annually, the plans cover approximately 400 employees.\n\n## Restructuring to ensure cost competitiveness\n\nIn 2021, UPM closed the Kaipola paper mill in Finland, sold the Shotton paper mill in the UK and closed one log line at the Kau-\n\n| UPM PERSONNEL IN FIGURES   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employees                  | 16,966 | 18,014 | 18,742 |\n| Turnover, %                | 14.5   | 10.4   | 9.2    |\n| Turnover, % (voluntary)    | 5.6    | 3.5    | 4.0    |\n| Average age                | 44.3   | 44.6   | 44.3   |\n\nDuring the audits, we look at their management system, their responsibility issues and how they manage the foreign labour on their payroll.\n\nThe audits have identified some areas for improvement such as the coordination of administrative systems. There is also room for improvement in the transition to local employee negotiation system, in the sharing of information on legislative changes and reforms between different actors, and in finding a common language across the geographical spectrum of the supply chain.\n\nSafety at work is one of the areas for development. In logging and forest logistics, heavy equipment is used and heavy loads are moved. There are risks in the working environment that need to be known and managed.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rewarding and recognising high performance\n\nWe reward and recognise high performance. Our approach to rewarding and recognising employees consists of both tangible and intangible components. Tangible remuneration and recognition consists of base salary, benefits and incentives, which are determined by UPM's global rules, local legislation, general agreements, local market practices, the level of the position and individual performance. Gender, age, ethnic origin and nationality play no role in determining salaries and wages.\n\nEach employee belongs to a unified annual Short Term Incentive (STI) scheme. The scheme covers group- and business-level targets, personal and team performance targets, and individual performance evaluation, to di/fferentiate and reward high performance.\n\nIntangible remuneration and recognition consists of, for instance, a safe and healthy working environment, interesting and meaningful work, and good leadership and career opportunities. We have designed our reward policy to increase employee commitment to, and motivation for, high performance.\n\nThe annual incentives paid in 2021 for the 2020 STI plan amounted to EUR 58 million, and the estimated amount of annual\n\n## CASE\n\n## WORKING CONDITIONS ASSESSED IN THE WOOD SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nUPM Forest's supply chain includes more than 100 logging and transport companies. As the supply chain becomes more international, we aim to gain greater visibility on recruitment, employment contracts, working hours, payment practices, travel and accommodation of employees and to ensure that they comply with the UPM Supplier Code.\n\nA supply chain supplier audit project was launched in 2020 by training auditors and developing audit materials. The actual audits began in 2021 with the aim to audit all contractors over the next four years.\n\nThe companies' seasonal labour comes from abroad, mainly from the Baltic states and Russia.",

We respect the privacy of our employees and promote equal opportunities and objectivity in employment and career development.\n\nDiversity and inclusion is part of our Aiming Higher mindset and thus part of our cultural development plan. We also want to develop our future ways of working.\n\nAll UPM employees are treated as individuals regardless of gender, age, ethnic origin or nationality, and we welcome the talent of people with various skills and backgrounds to our global team. Promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace is not only the right thing to do, but also a prerequisite for our business success. The richness of points of view improves decision-making and business success.\n\n## Three action areas\n\nOur Diversity & Inclusion initiative consists of three action areas: commitment to diversity and inclusion, creating and leading inclusive culture, and regular reviews of our data and processes.\n\nWe carried out a gender pay equity review in 2021, closing the gender pay gap that cannot be explained by the factors that typically determine a person's salary and its development (right). We continue to mon-\n\nWe signed an EU Diversity charter in 2016.

Our Employee Engagement Survey (EES) measures also authenticity, i.e. feeling comfortable being oneself, and fair treatment which are important strengths for us. We continuously follow up on them and the 2021 results are along the lines of the global benchmark.\n\nTo further develop inclusive leadership and culture, we started a dialogue with management teams in 2019, and this work continued in 2020 and 2021 across the company. Over 1,600 people had participated in the dialogue by the end of 2021. Inclusive behaviours are integrated into our leadership development programmes and included in the UPM Code of Conduct training.\n\n## Regular monitoring\n\nWe regularly review our diversity status and data. Our management teams conduct self-assessments that include diversity and inclusion. Managers and HR have dashboards with diversity data. Processes such as rewarding and recruitment are followed up regularly.\n\nWe also regularly report progress to several external indices. We have been included in the Bloomberg GEI (Gender-Equality Index) for a fourth consecutive year. The index awards the publicly traded companies that are most committed to disclosing their e/fforts to support gender equality.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\n## CLOSING THE UNEXPLAINED PAY GAP\n\nOne cornerstone of our Aiming Higher mindset is to ensure a diverse and inclusive working environment. To live that mindset, we need to make sure that our employees are also fairly rewarded.\n\nIn 2021, we carried out a company-wide initiative to close the unexplained gender pay gap. It was triggered by the observation that we have a small pay gap that disadvantages women. This gap persisted after we had adjusted for example by performance, work experience, job and location, the typical drivers of pay. The gap stemmed from minor disparities in starting salaries, and not from how men and women were treated\n\nwithin the company. Very encouragingly, we found that annual salary reviews, promotions and also bonus decisions were free of any gender-related disparities.\n\nApproximately 2.3% or 400 UPMers received a pay adjustment in 10 countries on 1 January 2022. Yet the work continues. We will monitor the situation annually using a rigorous process and take corrective actions if needed. We will also address the root cause by ensuring equitable starting salaries. Our long-standing efforts to balance gender representation and offer equal career opportunities continue.\n\nThis initiative is exceptional among our peer companies. It shows our strong commitment to the fair treatment of all UPM employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nShop-floor\n\n58%\n\nWomen 22%\n\nMen 78% Salaried 42%\n\nAge-diverse teams\n\n54%\n\nMultinational teams\n\n22%\n\nWomen leaders\n\n21%\n\nAuthenticity score\n\n78\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFair Treatment score\n\n75\n\nUPM is among top 10% companies by 2030 on employees' sense of belonging at UPM\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n67\n\naverage score on EES question.

We have addressed both local and global coordination, and our company-wide coronavirus response team has developed global guidelines to be implemented in our businesses and sites. Rapid actions and preventive measures have helped us to guarantee a safe working environment for our employees.\n\nWe have supported our employees' wellbeing with a variety of health and safety measures globally, including support and tools for remote working, such as an info hub on the intranet and an application for taking breaks and boosting wellbeing at work.

The free-of-charge vaccinations were administered by UPM's own doctors, assisted by external medical staff and volunteers. We vaccinated around 1,400 people, including employees and their family members.\n\nIn Finland, we offered the sports hall at the mill in Lappeenranta to the occupational health services for six days for vaccinations. In Rauma and Pietarsaari, the occupational health services provided vaccinations at the health care centre. Following the start of major renovation work at the Lappeenranta biorefinery, an efficient and extensive testing and screening system was set up. The biorefinery used PCR testing for the diagnosis of viral infections by the healthcare system, as well as home testing.\n\nwww.upm.com/responsibility\n\nand UPM Timber businesses received their certifications in addition to the previously certified paper and pulp businesses. As this 2030 target on OHS management system is almost achieved, we replaced it with a new target in 2021.\n\nDue to the pandemic, most of the safety trainings were conducted remotely. More than 150 UPMers attended a machinery safety training session. The trainings also focused on the human factor of safety; the di/fference our daily decisions make and how they contribute to our safety. The same topics were also discussed at the Safety Forum 2021, which involved more than 70 safety personnel from all over the organisation.\n\nWe also developed remote audit concepts and e-learning to improve the quality of internal safety auditing. Most internal safety audits were conducted remotely. A new auditing module was introduced, and training on it was provided in our OneSafety management tool. This module improves audit action follow-up.\n\nIn May, a major incident occurred at the UPM Lappeenranta Biorefinery when the rupture of a process gas line caused an explosion and a fire.

In 2021 we updated our personal data protection training module and launched a new module (association participation) relating to our competition law programme.\n\nAvailable compliance e-learnings with the target group and completion rates at year end are listed in the table on page 79. Our e-learning modules are available on the same HR platform and are easily accessible to our employees. The completion of mandatory e-learnings is as a prerequisite for short-term incentive payments.\n\nIn April, we also launched new digital team discussion materials based on real-life cases to engage teams to discuss our culture of integrity and ethical dilemmas. By the end of the year more than 1,600 employees participated these discussions.\n\nThe e-learning modules are complemented with face-to-face and virtual compliance training with specific target groups, which are determined on the basis of risk assessments. The compliance training sessions are supported by active communication. We launched a microlearning video series concerning key compliance topics in 2021.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nOur monitoring activities are aimed at ensuring compliance at all levels of the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UPM COMPLIANCE SYSTEM\n\n## Company performance\n\nCorporate reputation, financial performance, operational excellence\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Culture of integrity\n\nof active employees completed the UPM Code of Conduct training\n\n<!-- image -->\n\norganisation. The activities are based on a group company risk matrix that considers the country risk and complexity and the extent of our operations in each country. Our compliance team has a three-year monitoring plan for its unit-specific compliance reviews that are based on this matrix. On top of these general reviews covering all business integrity topics, we conduct riskbased reviews around specific topics such as competition law or anti-corruption.\n\nIn 2021, the compliance team conducted compliance reviews in 7 local units in South America, Asia, and Europe. Due to COVID-19 most reviews were conducted remotely. Another example of our compliance team's monitoring activity is the counter-\n\nThe reviews to be performed each year are agreed with the businesses during the annual risk assessment process and coordinated with the Internal Audit. The most important compliance review findings and recommendations are reported to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and businesses. These recommendations are then carried out in collaboration with said businesses.",

If we are worried about anything, we must speak up and act. We do not tolerate retaliation against any person who, in good faith, reports suspected misconduct or participates in an investigation to resolve suspected misconduct.\n\nThe table below summarises the number of cases recorded in our misconduct case management system in 2021 and provides examples of cases handled. The misconduct case management system was renewed in 2020 and the increase in number of reported cases seems to imply that the new system captures potential cases more e/fficiently. 18 cases led to disciplinary action, including warnings and terminations of employment. The misconduct investigations include a root cause analysis that aims to identify whether improvements of compliance programme are necessary.\n\nIn 2021, we published our first internal Integrity Report, the purpose of which is to communicate to our employees examples of misconduct cases and how they have been handled within the company (right).\n\n- The reports related to e.g. alleged discrimination or harassment, inappropriate behaviour, breach of safety rules and alleged breach of labour laws in connection with recruitment or termination of employment.\n- Employee had not declared a conflict relating to a customer that the employee was responsible for and that was owned by a person close to the employee. The employee had caused loss to UPM by approving sales to the customer under market price. Termination of employment.\n- Protect assets and information: Investigation revealed that employee had submitted tens of falsified invoices as business expenses. The employee admitted having bypassed internal controls knowingly. Termination of employment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ALLEGED MISCONDUCT CASES\n\n| UPM Code of Conduct section                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Our commitment on integrity                                | 1      | 1      |\n| Our people and operations                                  |        |        |\n| Respect people and human rights                            | 19     | 4      |\n| Taking care of the environmental impact and product safety | 2      | 1      |\n| Business integrity                                         |        |        |\n| Zero-tolerance for corruption and bribery                  | 0      | 3      |\n| Avoid conflicts of interest                                | 8      | 7      |\n| Compliance with competition laws                           | 5      | 2      |\n| Protect assets and information                             | 23     | 3      |\n| Our stakeholders                                           |        |        |\n| Know with whom you trade                                   | 8      | 2      |\n| Total                                                      | 66     | 23     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CASE\n\n## BUILDING TRUST WITH THE FIRST INTEGRITY REPORT\n\nAlthough we have published the statistics of the misconduct cases, we had not systematically communicated internally about them. Therefore, we published our first Integrity Report for our employees. It builds upon the work of the past and sheds light on misconduct reporting and handling.\n\nCorporate transparency is an important part of our organisational culture and employees should be able to express their concerns, see their concerns being addressed, and trust that we will implement the necessary actions, if required.\n\nWith the Integrity Report, we take a closer look at misconduct statistics and how many cases there were in the previous year, where they occurred, and how they were reported. The report also provides anonymous examples of misconduct cases, and describes the consequences of each case, as well as the lessons learned. Conflict of interest misconduct was the largest reported area in 2020.\n\nCorporate transparency is a critical tool around issues like anti-corruption and corporate governance. The information shared with personnel strengthens the perception of organisational justice and drives the compliance within the company.\n\nOne of the key messages in the UPM Code of Conduct is 'Speak up'. The updated Report Misconduct channel seems to have lowered the threshold of raising concerns.\n\nwww.upm.com/compliance\n\n## COMPLIANCE MONITORING\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COUNTERPARTY SCREENING PROCEDURES\n\n- \u00b7 Business partner screening against public sources\n- \u00b7 Business integrity (trade sanctions, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, competition law, fraud) \u00b7 Human rights\n- \u00b7 Environment\n- \u00b7 Supply chain risk assessments\n\n## Low risks\n\nMitigating identified risks\n\nUPM business partner portfolio\n\n## Avoiding high risks\n\n| PREVENT                                                  | MONITOR                                        | REACT                                  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| \u00b7 Supplier qualification \u00b7 Supplier and Third-Party Code | \u00b7 Supplier audits and corrective  action plans | \u00b7 Incident analysis and  investigation |\n| \u00b7 Specific requirements                                  | \u00b7 Supplier assessments                         | \u00b7 Blocking procedure                   |\n| \u00b7 Enhanced due diligence on  selected business partners  | \u00b7 Supplier assessments                         | \u00b7 Contract termination                 |\n| \u00b7 Onboarding and contracting  process                    | \u00b7 Supplier assessments                         | \u00b7 Contract termination                 |\n\n| COMPLIANCE TRAINING FOR SPECIFIC     | COMPLETION RATES AS   | SIZE OF TARGET   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|\n| TARGET GROUPS IN 2021                | OF 31 DECEMBER 2021   | GROUP            |\n| Code of Conduct e-learning           | 98                    | 16,300           |\n| Personal data protection e-learning  | 97                    | 6,800            |\n| Anti-Corruption e-learning           | 96                    | 6,800            |\n| Confidentiality e-learning           | 98                    | 6,800            |\n| Competition law e-learning           | 95                    | 2,900            |\n| Insider Policy e-learning            | 96                    | 110              |\n| Association participation e-learning | 96                    | 490              |",

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE FOUNDATION OF OUR BUSINESS\n\n## GENERATING TAX REVENUE\n\nThe winds of change are blowing through the global principles of taxation.\n\nThroughout 2021, the OECD, G20 and European Union (EU) introduced solutions to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation and globalisation of economies. For example, these solutions are aiming for a minimum level of taxation of companies in the countries in which they operate (the OECD's Statement on a Two-Pillar Solution), as well as for a standardised public tax reporting by companies (the EU's public country-by-country reporting).\n\nWe have implemented our transparent and responsible Tax Strategy for several years. Therefore, we welcome any initiatives for more standardised global tax reporting by corporations, as well as those for fair and responsible tax payments in the countries where corporations operate. We will modify our tax reporting accordingly, alongside our current GRI-reporting, as soon as the final definitions of these projects are available.\n\n## Corporate income taxes vary by countries\n\nUPM's e/ffective tax rate in 2021 was 15.5% (22.9%) and its cash tax rate was 17.8% (19.8%). Due to the fast recovery of our profitability from the pandemic that hit in 2020, the corporate income tax reported in 2021 was EUR 240 million (EUR 169 million) and the corporate income tax paid in 2021 was EUR 276 million (EUR 146 million). In addition to taxes on income, our various production inputs and outputs are also subject to taxation, which is either paid by us (e.g. energy tax or property tax, such as taxes on real estate) or collected by us (e.g. VAT, payroll tax and social security contributions). UPM paid real estate and similar taxes in various countries to the sum of EUR 30 million (EUR 32 million).\n\nThe table on the right displays the corporate income tax and property tax paid in our main countries of operation. Based on our corporate and operational structure,\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Taxes contribute to society on local, regional and national level.\n\n## TARGET\n\n- \u00b7 We are strongly committed to continuously improving our economic and social performance\n- \u00b7 Our good financial performance also generates higher tax revenues\n- \u00b7 Our businesses also play a leading role in contributing to societal development in the surrounding communities through the tax revenue we generate\n\nUPM mainly reports and pays its corporate income tax in countries where production and innovating activity takes place.\n\nIn Uruguay, the government has granted several free-trade zone permits for domestic and foreign investments. The Uruguay government has granted our pulp mill a permit to operate in a free-trade zone, and therefore taxes in Uruguay mainly consist of property tax and annual tax-like charges paid to the Uruguay government for the development of the zone. The new pulp mill under construction in Uruguay will also be located in a similar free-trade zone.\n\nIn Finland, we have significant production operations across our six business areas, as well as research and development operations. As a result, UPM is one of the major taxpayers in Finland. UPM's corporate income tax in Finland in 2021 is estimated to be EUR 235 million (EUR 88 million), with subsidiaries reporting and paying approximately EUR 122 million (EUR 79 million). The remaining figure of approximately EUR 113 million (EUR 9 million) will be reported and paid by the UPM-Kymmene Corporation.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Based on the standards of the UPM Code of Conduct, the UPM Tax Strategy describes the main principles of and guidelines for our taxation\n- \u00b7 Taxes are paid in accordance with local tax laws and regulations that apply to the country in question\n- \u00b7 We pay corporate income taxes in the countries where added value is created and profit is generated\n\nIn China, as a fine paper producer, UPM qualifies as a high-tech enterprise with a reduced corporate income tax rate of 15%. UPM also pays withholding tax on dividends in China.\n\nIn accordance with UPM's Tax Strategy, the locations of our companies are driven by commercial rationale and business reasoning. We do not transfer any value created, nor have any investments in production or service operations, in jurisdictions defined by the Council of the European Union as non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, or in any similar secrecy jurisdictions. A list of UPM subsidiaries and joint operations, and their country of incorporation, can be found on pages 204-206.\n\nIn countries where our companies are using tax losses from previous years to o/ffset the tax liability of the year in question, such as Germany, limited corporate income tax is paid.\n\nFurthermore, our sites contribute to local employment, income tax and purchasing power, and are engaging in projects with communities. Information can be found in the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nment processes. UPM's internal control and risk management operations review tax risks regularly and update the control framework together with the tax function. A more thorough review of the tax practices of customers and suppliers is a part of our counterparty risk management processes.\n\nWe aim to co-operate transparently and proactively with tax authorities, and value dialogue with other important stakeholders concerning taxation. In Finland, UPM co-operates with the Finnish Tax Administration.\n\nThe UPM Tax Strategy is supported by internal instructions, benchmark analyses of best practice and related internal controls. Tax matters are managed by our tax function, which is complemented by third-party tax services to comply with local tax reporting and filing, as well as other requirements.\n\n## CORPORATE INCOME TAXES PAID AND PROPERTY TAXES BY COUNTRY\n\n| EURm           |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Finland        |    225 |     91 |\n| Germany        |     20 |     14 |\n| Uruguay        |     15 |     13 |\n| China          |     24 |     28 |\n| United States  |      8 |      8 |\n| United Kingdom |      3 |      4 |\n| Austria        |      0 |      6 |\n| Russia         |      4 |      4 |\n| Poland         |      2 |      1 |\n| Estonia        |      1 |      2 |\n| France         |      2 |      3 |\n| Other          |      2 |      4 |\n| Group total    |    306 |    178 |\n\n## DIRECT ECONOMIC VALUE GENERATED AND DISTRIBUTED BY UPM IN 2021 (EUR MILLION)\n\n| Direct economic value created     |        | Economic value distributed                       |         |\n|-----------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|\n|                                   |        | Operating costs                                  | -7,010  |\n| Sales                             | 9,814  | Employee wages and benefits                      | -1,094  |\n| Income from sale of assets        | 181    | Payments to providers of loans                   | -28     |\n| Income from financial investments | 3      | Dividend distribution                            | -693    |\n| Other income                      | 107    | Corporate income taxes paid   and property taxes | -306    |\n| Total                             | 10,105 |                                                  | - 9,131 |\n\n## Economic value retained 974\n\nUPM's economic impact is significant in the surrounding communities.

The majority of our electricity production is CO2 emission-free hydropower and nuclear power.\n\nEnergy taxation is relevant to us, not only as a significant electricity producer but also in the manufacturing processes of our products, in terms of the taxation of end products as well as at various levels of the supply chain. Therefore, we will monitor the implementation of the EU's reform with great interest and welcome all initiatives to create a future beyond fossils in accordance with our values.\n\nAlso our renewable products, UPM BioVerno diesel and naphtha, which are produced from a residue of pulp production, are subject to energy taxation charged by fuel distributors to their customers. However, the energy tax rates for transport fuels from renewable and sustainable sources, like UPM BioVerno, are lower than those from fossil fuels.\n\nWithin the EU, energy taxation laws allow member states to compensate for the taxes paid on, or apply lower tax rates to, energy-intensive industrial production, for example. Many of the main countries in which we have production facilities, such as Finland and Germany, o/ffer such tax relief because the level of energy taxation has increased significantly in recent years.\n\nMost of the energy used in the production processes is subject to energy tax, although there are various tax rates and exemptions, depending on the type of use. We also pay a significant amount of energy tax on fuels for logistics costs, especially for road transportation.\n\n## Our tax governance and tax compliance\n\nThe Board of Directors' Audit Committee is responsible for the supervision of tax risk management as part of our risk manage-",

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE FOUNDATION OF OUR BUSINESS\n\n## RESPONSIBLE SOURCING\n\nAn effective and responsible supply chain guarantees the availability of sustainably produced, cost-competitive and innovative materials and services globally in all market situations.\n\nSuppliers are an essential part of our value chain. We buy products, materials and services from about 20,000 B2B suppliers globally. Our sourcing network includes suppliers from start-up companies to international corporations. We also buy wood from some 23,000 private forest owners.\n\nThe main sourcing categories are fibre, chemicals, other raw materials, indirect purchases, logistics and energy. When selecting suppliers, our most important criteria include reliable long-term deliveries, product and service quality, suppliers' financial stability, social and environmental responsibility and product safety.\n\n## Exceptional circumstances continued\n\nDue to the continued COVID-19 pandemic, we strongly focused on guaranteeing business continuity and the progress of our transformative growth projects in Uruguay and Germany.\n\nWe gave our digital platform a wider use to standardise and simplify sourcing processes. This platform, implemented in 2020, will improve e/fficiency in demand planning, tendering, contracting and purchase transactions. We also carried out trainings to increase our supplier auditing capabilities. The development of the platform and the trainings will continue in 2022.\n\nMany global commodity prices increased in the recovering global economy. The adverse energy market situation in Europe and in China added to our energy costs. However, we were able to protect our business continuity well despite the challenges in logistics and global supply chains.\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Providing more sustainable choices to customers and consumers\n- \u00b7 Enhancing positive brand perception for both UPM and our customers\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 We are a trustworthy and future-oriented partner\n- \u00b7 We ensure the efficiency, compliance and responsibility of the supply chain\n- \u00b7 We create long-term business opportunities in the value chain in collaboration with our partners\n\n## Standards of integrity\n\nWe are committed to responsible sourcing practices, as per our Code of Conduct. All the minimum requirements for suppliers are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third-Party Code. We require suppliers to promote the same requirements in their own supply chains. In 2021, 86% (84%) of our total spend was with suppliers who are committed to the Code.\n\nAll our wood, pulp and recovered paper suppliers are continuously evaluated in regard to environmental issues, social responsibility and their involvement in\n\nAll contractors working at our production sites must comply with UPM's safety requirements. Various additional requirements are applied to wood, chemicals, pulp, packaging materials and logistics.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Focus on long-term, co-operative relationships and promoting methods for responsible sourcing\n- \u00b7 Clear requirements and expectations for our suppliers\n- \u00b7 Continuous monitoring and development of our suppliers' performance\n- \u00b7 Process development with key suppliers\n- \u00b7 Responsible practices in the supply chain\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\nthe local community. These raw materials are either FSC\u2122 (N003385) and PEFC (PEFC/02-44-41) certified or comply with the FSC Controlled Wood standard or Due Diligence requirements for PEFC.\n\n## Strict requirements for wood-based materials\n\nAll the wood we use is legally logged and comes from sustainably managed forests. We don't use wood harvested from tropical rainforests or accept wood from plantations that have been established by converting natural forests. We don't accept wood from regions that do not respect the rights of indigenous peoples.\n\nIn addition to third-party certification, we also verify that the wood supplied to our mills is compliant with the EU Timber Reg-\n\nor the seriousness of UPM's findings. In 2021, we assessed the working conditions of the service providers in the wood procurement value chain (page 71).\n\n## Working together towards more responsible supply chains\n\nIn relation to CO 2 emissions caused by supply chains, our focus is on reducing emissions from logistics and selected raw materials such as chemical pulp, pigments, chemicals and paper. Close co-operation with suppliers is needed to achieve this target.\n\nClimate impacts will become an important factor when selecting suppliers in the future. In 2022, a group-wide programme to manage supply chain emissions will be started (page 94).\n\n## Global co-operation in sustainability\n\nIn 2021, our co-operation with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative continued. TfS promotes responsible practices within the supply chains of its members. The co-operation improves transparency and the e/fficiency of our assessments and audits.\n\nResponsible sourcing is also an important theme in the UN Global Compact. We are an active member of the Action Platform, promoting decent work in global supply chains.\n\nAs a member of TfS, we have access to a wider pool of EcoVadis assessments and TfS audit reports. In 2021, we conducted some 340 (290) environmental and social risk assessments with EcoVadis. The number of on-site audits was limited due to COVID-19 restrictions; however, on-site audits were carried out at logging sites and at some mills. Last year, our own trained auditors and external auditors carried out 124 (117) audits, based on identified risks, including human rights, social and environmental topics. In addition, about 300 contractor reviews with focus on working conditions were carried out.\n\n- Safety culture on page 74\n- Compliance on page 76\n- Sustainable product design on page 86\n- Circular bioeconomy on page 88\n- Reducing energy use and emissions to air on page 92\n- www.upm.com/about-us/for-suppliers/\n\n## Spend covered by UPM Supplier Code\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## UPM'S FIVE LARGEST SUPPLIERS 2021\n\n| 1.

We set further requirements to pulp suppliers for environmental performance, social responsibility, forestry, wood sourcing and reporting.\n\nWe source all wood assortments to ensure optimal utilisation of this valuable raw material. In 2021, we purchased 26.0 (24.9) million cubic metres of wood worldwide.\n\nWe are also one of the world's leading users of recovered paper for the production of graphic paper. In 2021, we used approximately 1.7 (1.8) million tonnes of recovered paper. Recycled fibre accounted 22% (26%) of all fibre raw materials used in UPM's paper production. The decrease is due to the closure of one newsprint mill and the sale of another.\n\n## Know your supplier\n\nWe identify our supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts. Collecting and analysing data on the environmental and social responsibility of our key suppliers is an integral part of our supplier risk and performance management. We create development plans together with our suppliers based on these analyses. We also monitor the performance of our other raw material suppliers through various surveys.\n\nThe responsibility risk assessment is based on the country of origin, sourced material or service and complexity of supply chain. We use EcoVadis and other assessments, supplier audits and joint development plans to carry out more detailed evaluations of suppliers' activities.\n\nWith the counterparty risk management tool, we can better evaluate counterparty-related risks through automated screening and support businesses in ethical and prudent decision-making. E/ffective third-party management plays an essential role in securing business continuity and compliance.\n\nIf any non-conformities are identified, the supplier is required to take corrective measures. We monitor the implementation of these measures and provide support for improving the suppliers' operations if needed.

        "page_content": "## RESPONSIBLE FOUNDATION OF OUR BUSINESS\n\n## SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY\n\nOur business is based on sustainable forest management. We grow and harvest wood to produce renewable and sustainable materials and products.\n\nFinland and Uruguay are UPM's main wood sourcing regions. At the end of 2021, we owned approximately 900,000 hectares of forest land in Finland, Uruguay and the USA. Most of this land is in Finland, totalling around 516,000 hectares. In Uruguay, we have about 305,000 hectares of eucalyptus plantations, grasslands and conservation areas and in the USA 76,000 hectares of forest. We also lease about 160,000 hectares in Uruguay and manage about 1.3 million hectares of private forests in Finland. We apply the same strict sustainability standards everywhere we operate.\n\nUPM has three modern nurseries: one in Finland and two in Uruguay. A fourth nursery is under construction in central Uruguay to ensure su/fficient wood supply for the new Paso de los Toros pulp mill.\n\nAbout 180,000 hectares (20%) of the land we own is protected. Protected areas include valuable habitats, natural forests and other areas of high value.\n\nThere were uncommonly wide fires in Uruguay at the end of 2021, caused by exceptionally high temperatures and drought. The fires a/ffected approximately 10,000 hectares of plantations owned and leased by UPM. We have supported partners in the area and operations continue as usual.\n\nIn 2021, we introduced our new global forest responsibility programme. The programme covers also sustainability criteria related to water, soil, economic and social contribution (page 30).\n\nHigh-quality seedlings will ensure good growing conditions for the forests and provide an important basis for research. In Finland, we also produce hardwood seedlings, which supports our goal of doubling the number of deciduous trees in our forests. Vibrant mixed forests contribute to biodiversity, climate goals and forest well-being.\n\n## Forests and climate\n\nWe are committed to climate-positive forestry and improving biodiversity. Forests and forest diversity are beneficial for the climate. We ensure that our forests continue to act as carbon sinks, remain resilient and diverse in changing climate conditions, and grow well for future generations.\n\nFor our forests to remain carbon sinks, they need to grow more than we use them. We are improving the health, growth and carbon sequestration of our forests. The annual carbon sink from owned and leased forests in Finland and Uruguay has averaged 3.8 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent over the past five years. In 2021, soil carbon accounting models for Uruguayan plantations were developed. Due to the developed calculation method, the published figures are not comparable with previous years. Development of calculation method continues together with scientific community to further improve reliability and accuracy.\n\n## Improving biodiversity\n\nWe are continuously working to improve biodiversity in our forests. We promote biodiversity as part of our everyday forest management and through conservation and collaborative stakeholder projects. Based on indicators developed in co-operation with researchers, we monitor biodiversity development in relation to the target we have set. In Finland, the indicators are:\n\n- \u00b7  Tree species\n- \u00b7  Forest structure\n- \u00b7  Forest age\n- \u00b7  Protected areas\n- \u00b7  Habitat restoration\n- \u00b7  Valuable habitats\n- \u00b7  Species and habitat projects\n- \u00b7  Indicator development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2021, quantitative indicators showed a positive trend, except protected areas and valuable habitats. Total restriction areas decreased due to the changes in external land use plan restrictions, however, strictly protected areas increased by 9% from the previous year. Valuable habitats decreased due to refined calculation method, which made the previous year's results incomparable. We constantly review and develop indicators and their monitoring and calculation processes to provide more accurate and comprehensive information on biodiversity. For example, regular monitoring of the amount of decaying wood in Finnish forests is an important indicator for the future (right).\n\nIn the company-owned land in Uruguay, we implemented an upgraded biodiversity strategy to increase biodiversity in the long term (page 43).\n\n## Co-operation with stakeholders\n\nWe have a long history of working with researchers, academia, environmental organisations and other stakeholders to develop sustainable forest management. Long-term co-operation with the Osprey Foundation in Finland and with Aves Uruguay and Vida Silvestre in Uruguay continued in 2021.\n\nWe continued to participate in forest and environmental stakeholder forums. In Finland, we took part in biodiversity roundtables coordinated by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. Active co-operation with the international FSC and PEFC continued to promote sustainable forest management globally.\n\nIn Finland, together with the Finnish Natural Resources Institute Finland, we investigated the occurrence of endangered species in commercial forests. The aim of the project was to determine the importance of natural management measures in commercial forests for species. We implemented species and habitat projects with stakeholders, such as the development of a network of nesting sites for birds of prey, together with the Ornithological Society of North Karelia and the Osprey Foundation. We also carried out biodiversity-enhancing drainage and removed invasive species.  We carried out management measures in the habitats of endangered species in commercial forests to ensure the presence of endangered species.\n\nResponsible sourcing on page 82 Sustainable product lifecycle on page 86\n\nWe will investigate the effects of nature management measures in commercial forests, such as leaving retention and decaying trees in regeneration fellings, on the structural features and species of forests that are important for biodiversity.\n\nThe study started in autumn 2021 in co-operation with the Natural Resources Institute of Finland. In the first phase, 30-50 regeneration areas harvested in 2000-2018 in Southern Finland will be inventoried. In addition to species and structural inventories, we aim to create\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable forest management is an important means to adapt to climate change\n- \u00b7 Forests and wood-based products play a unique role in climate change mitigation\n- \u00b7 Demand for wood-based products creates a strong economic incentive for good forest management and growth\n- \u00b7 Forestry builds wealth and prosperity for local communities\n- \u00b7 Sustainably managed commercial forests provide well-being and recreation\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Climate-positive forestry and maintenance of carbon sinks\n- \u00b7 Efficient production of quality wood\n- \u00b7 Increasing biodiversity\n- \u00b7 Safeguarding forest ecosystem services\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Third-party verified and certified wood origin monitoring systems to ensure full traceability\n- \u00b7 No wood sourced from tropical rainforests or from forest plantations that have been established by converting natural forests\n- \u00b7 No operations in areas where indigenous peoples' rights are at risk\n- \u00b7 No plantations in areas where water is scarce\n- \u00b7 Strong stakeholder engagement\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\na reliable method for assessing the impact of nature management measures.\n\nThe study seeks to verify how UPM's conservation of retention and decaying trees in its own forests has affected the amount and species distribution of biodiversity important structural features (large decaying trees, coarse decaying wood). We will also develop a list of indicator species based on three species groups to monitor the impact of nature management on species diversity.\n\nwww.upm.com/forests\n\n|                                                                  | UPM FORESTS AND PLANTATIONS   | UPM FORESTS AND PLANTATIONS   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                                  | 2008                          | 2021                          |\n| Forest and plantation land,  own and leased (1,000 ha)           | 1, 012                        | 1,057                         |\n| Forest growth (million m 3 )                                     | 4.3                           | 8.8                           |\n| Wood harvested from UPM  forests and plantations  (million m 3 ) | 2.2                           | 3.6                           |\n| Value of forests and planta- tions, including land (EURm)        | 1,270                         | 3,241                         |\n\n## Third-party verified supply chain\n\nWe always know the origin of our wood. We do not source wood from illegal sources or from areas where human rights or high conservation value forests are threatened. Our wood sourcing does not cause land-use change. We don't use genetically modified trees. Compliance with these requirements is verified by an independent third party.\n\nCDP recognised UPM as a Forest A List company for its significant actions to mitigate climate change and prevent deforestation.\n\nAll UPM-owned forests are certified, or in the process of being certified if the site is new. We also promote forest certification for private forest owners and other customers. We have established the FSC group certification scheme. The forest area covered by UPM's FSC group covered approximately 520,000 hectares in Finland and over 13,000 hectares in Uruguay in 2021.\n\n## CASE\n\n## DECAYING WOOD AS AN INDICATOR OF BIODIVERSITY\n\nOne clear difference between natural and commercial forests is the amount of decaying wood. More than a fifth of Finland's forest species depend on decaying wood at some point in their lives. Different species such as fungi and insects are best adapted to live on a particular type of decaying wood, and the species that live on a tree are influenced by the tree species, the size of the tree, the position of the decaying wood and the stage of decay.",

Actions to mitigate climate change and enhance biodiversity have become more important than ever before.\n\n## New lifecycle approach\n\nWe can contribute to environmental and societal sustainability of our products by use of our new Sustainable Product Design concept. All the elements of the lifecycle need to be considered in the design phase so that the new product or service supports UN SDGs (left). In 2021, we further developed our Sustainable Product Design concept (below).\n\nLife Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are an important part of the sustainable product design toolbox. We use LCAs to provide reliable, documented information on the environmental impacts of our materials and production processes. In 2021, UPM Pulp started a comprehensive project to develop a generic LCA model that will be in line with the EU's Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) method. To further improve the data quality of the model, the aim is to use primary data for used chemicals instead of generic datasets.\n\n## Product safety requirements renewed\n\nThe ISO 9001 Quality and ISO 22000 Food Safety management systems provide a framework for continuously improving our performance. All our production sites are ISO 9001 certified. All our pulp mills, UPM Raflatac sites and UPM Specialty Papers production lines in Europe have a certified ISO 22000 Food Safety management system. UPM Changshu paper machine 3 has both a certified ISO 22000 Food Safety management system and a certified FSSC 22000 Food Safety management system. This allows us to o/ffer a number of products that are designed and produced to meet food packaging requirements.\n\nTogether with a number of paper and chemical companies, we have increased transparency in the supply chain and accelerated the exchange of information. A new questionnaire enables us to pre-assess the chemicals used in products and to ensure the compliance of our products with legal requirements and additional commitments, such as ecolabel criteria.\n\nWe have developed the way in which we communicate our product safety requirements to our chemical and raw material suppliers, as well as to our customers.",

Moist green liquor dregs are one of the trickiest side streams to recycle and UPM has been trying to find a solution to this for a long time. UPM's three pulp mills in Finland generate approximately 60,000 tonnes of waste dregs a year.\n\nIn the project, green liquor dregs are processed into construction materials, such as belite cement, the production of which generates up to 85% fewer CO 2 emissions than conventional cement. Another product under development, low-carbon stabilising cement, can be used to strengthen and reinforce the soil, increasing its bearing capacity.\n\nThe treatment of green liquor dregs requires the proper machinery and this was found at the UPM Tervasaari mill in Valkeakoski, Finland. Extensive industrial-scale trials will be carried out in the spring of 2022 in the decommissioned lime kiln.

We use energy efficiently and increase the share of renewable and low-emission energy.\n\nWe are constantly seeking new solutions to minimise our environmental impact by selecting optimised energy sources and generation methods, as well as by improving energy e/fficiency.\n\nAs the use of weather-dependent energy sources increases around the world, the need for balancing power within energy systems will grow. Hydropower is the most e/ffective and sustainable method of producing balancing power and we have significant hydropower assets in Finland.\n\nWe favour the use of renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources. Biomass-based fuels account for 70% (72%) of our fuel usage.\n\nThe majority of our energy consumption originates from the paper and pulp mills' production where electricity and heat are needed in mechanical pulping, pumping and drying. We generate steam and electricity through combined heat and power (CHP) plants at all of our pulp mills and at almost all of our paper mills. At some mills, all or part of this energy is produced by external or co-owned power plants.\n\n## Continuous improvement in energy efficiency\n\nWe are looking for ways to improve our energy e/fficiency across our operations with audits, innovations and investments. In 2021, we reached our annual target of increasing energy e/fficiency by 1%.\n\nAs a result of the energy-saving investments carried out in 2021, we reduced our energy costs by EUR 1.7 (0.3) million, avoided emitting 5,400 (2,400) tonnes of CO 2 and achieved a 33,000 (13,000) MWh reduction in energy consumption. The annual savings are\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Minimising the use of fossil fuels is the most important way to mitigate climate change\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Significantly cut fossil CO 2 emissions across the whole supply chain and increase energy efficiency\n- \u00b7 Minimise other air emissions in production and transportation\n\nEUR 1.9 (0.8) million, 6,100 (8,600) tonnes of CO 2 and 35,000 (44,000) MWh of energy.\n\n## Reducing emissions to air in production\n\nIn 2021, we decreased our fossil CO 2 emissions from energy generation (Scope 1) and purchased electricity (Scope 2) by 8% compared to the previous year. This was possible due to an increase in electricity purchased from CO 2 free sources and due to a paper mill closure in Finland and the sale of a paper mill in the UK.\n\nAt the UPM Nordland paper mill in Germany, we are building a natural gas-based combined heat and power (CHP) plant. At the UPM H\u00fcrth paper mill in Germany, we have partnered with E.ON to replace the fossil fuel-based steam supply with a biomass-fired boiler that will provide steam for the mill. Both projects are expected to be finalised in 2022. After completion, they will contribute to reaching our fossil CO 2 emission reduction target for 2030.\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Committed to the UN Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C and The Climate Pledge\n- \u00b7 Committed to continuous improvements in energy efficiency and to an increased share of renewable and low-emission energy\n- \u00b7 Scientific verification of our CO 2 emission reduction targets\n- \u00b7 Use of Best Available Techniques (BAT)\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\nUPM Energy is investing in CO 2 free power generation. TVO's Olkiluoto 3 EPR nuclear power plant unit in Finland is scheduled to commence regular electricity production in July 2022. The extensive modernisation project at our hydropower plant in Kuusankoski, Finland will also be finalised in the first quarter of 2023 (page 44).\n\nUPM Timber became the first business to use only renewable energy in production in 2020. In 2021, UPM Plywood decided to gradually shift to only using zero-carbon electricity. Currently, six of UPM Raflatac's ten factories use 100% renewable electricity.\n\nThe UPM Changshu paper mill in China has actively participated in the newly opened green electricity market in China by signing a contract for 14 GWh of solar power for 2021 with the first batch of companies. This is a step forward for the mill in using renewable energy.\n\nIn 2021, we set a new target to stop using coal and peat in on-site energy genera-",

UPM is dependent on shipping to get its products to customers across the world. It also provides shipping services to other companies. The whole sector is scrambling to rapidly reduce emissions by investing in energy-efficient vessels with new technologies and cleaner fuels.\n\nWe have invested in a fleet of seven new vessels built and owned by Bore Ltd and Wijnne Barends BV but operated by UPM. Emissions, mainly NOx, SO 2 and soot particles but also CO 2 , will be reduced thanks to LNG fuel. The new vessels replacing the current ones are more fuel efficient and they can be transformed to use biofuels in the future.\n\nThe vessels will sail from Finland to Poland, Sweden, Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, France and Spain. Cargoes will consist of UPM products such as paper, pulp, timber and plywood, while northbound routes will see raw materials such as china clay, woodchips and pulpwood being carried for use by various businesses. UPM will become the first forest industry company to upgrade its transportation network with environmentally smart vessels. The first vessel is planned to be delivered to UPM in early 2022 and the rest of the fleet during 2022.\n\ntion by 2030. Currently coal is the main fuel at the UPM Changshu mill in China, where alternatives have not been available historically. Peat is used in Finland. On the whole, coal and peat usage decreased by 9% compared to year 2020.\n\nOdour issues have been reported at some of our pulp and paper mills, especially during the summer. Odour is mainly generated by an accumulation of solids in the process and the related sulphur compounds, which is then typically released through cooling towers and aerators. The problem is usually solved by keeping process delays within the operating window, avoiding any accumulation of solids and limiting the usage of sulphur. In some cases, oxidation may be required to improve the situation. In line with our Clean Run approach, we investigated the cases thoroughly and shared best practices across mills.\n\nAt UPM Changshu, the modification of the natural gas boiler was finalised in 2020, resulting in a further reduction of NOx emissions and achieving a very low emission rate of 50 mg/Nm3.\n\n## Collaboration with supply chain to reduce emissions\n\nIn addition to fossil CO 2 emissions from our own energy generation (Scope 1) and purchased electricity (Scope 2), we also evaluate the emissions from other indirect sources (Scope 3), such as purchased materials, transportation and the processing of sold products. Our evaluation shows that 44% of our overall CO 2 emissions are directly related to our energy use and 56% to Scope 3.\n\nWe are collaborating with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative, to create standardised ways of reporting emissions from purchased products, raw materials and transportation. In 2021, we continued to work closely with several suppliers about their CO 2 emission reporting. We aim to receive more actual data from our suppliers instead of using average CO 2 factors from databases. For example, already 64% of our pigment\n\nIn early 2020, we set a target to reduce the fossil CO 2 emission levels of our supply chain by 30% by 2030 (from 2018 levels). Our focus is on reducing emissions from logistics and the most relevant raw materials such as pulp, pigments, chemicals and paper.\n\n## Sources of UPM's fossil CO /uniF63A emissions\n\nOn-site energy generation 24%, 2.7 million t Purchased\n\nelectricity 20%, 2.3 million t\n\nOther indirect sources* 56%\n\n*Other indirect sources such as purchased materials, transportation or processing of sold products 56%, 6.3 million t\n\n## Fossil CO 2 emissions\n\nmio t\n\n8\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCO 2 from purchased electricity\n\nCO 2 from on-site energy generation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n65% reduction of UPM's total CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2) from 2015 levels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 27%\n\nreduction achieved for UPM's total CO 2 emissions (Scope 1 and 2)\n\nNo coal and peat usage in on-site energy generation by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9%\n\nreduction achieved in 2021\n\n20% reduction of acidifying flue gases from 2015 level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n27%\n\nachieved for the UPM average product\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CAPACITY TO GENERATE POWER THROUGH OWN POWER PLANTS AND SHAREHOLDINGS\n\n|                                          | Nominal MW   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Hydropower                               | 726          |\n| Nuclear power                            | 588          |\n| Thermal power                            | 154          |\n| UPM Energy in total                      | 1,468        |\n| Mill site combined heat  and power (CHP) | 1,164        |\n| Mill site hydropower                     | 7            |\n| Mill site power  generation in total     | 1,171        |\n| Total UPM                                | 2,639        |\n\nThe tool helps us with strategic planning, decision making and analysis of the measures taken at our sites.

We aim to use water in a way that is environmentally sustainable, socially equitable and economically beneficial.\n\nCDP recognised UPM an A- score for its significant actions to enhance water stewardship.\n\n## Continuous improvement in water management\n\nThe water we need for our pulp and paper production processes is circulated and reused as much as possible. 88-98% of the water we use in our pulp and paper mill processes is internally recirculated, and thus only a small fraction eventually leaves the process as e/ffluent and needs to be replaced by fresh water. Using less water also means using less electricity, fewer chemicals and less thermal energy.\n\nOne of our 2030 environmental targets\n\nAll e/ffluents from our pulp and paper mills are cleaned in both mechanical and biological e/ffluent treatment processes. We manage a global water specialist network to share best practices to get the best possible treatment results.\n\nis to use 100% nutrients from recycled sources in our e/ffluent treatment. In 2021, we continued testing several side streams from our own or other industries' operations as potential nutrient sources. We also mapped potential collaboration partners for recycled nutrients UPM wide. For example, UPM Changshu paper mill in China has replaced 50% of urea with its boiler desulphurisation process side stream product, ammonia sulphate. Reject waters from the biogas plant were taken into regular use to replace urea at the UPM Tervasaari wastewater treatment. Testing will continue at several mills in 2022 (page 91).\n\non paper machine showers. The work will continue in 2022.\n\nThe UPM Changshu paper mill has decreased its process wastewater volume and COD load significantly during recent years. As a consequence, a too low incoming load has caused some technical challenges at the wastewater treatment plant. These were solved by introducing a new operating model that enables adjusting the process conditions based on incoming COD and nitrogen. As a result, we can expect a further reduction of COD and additional energy savings.\n\n## Collaboration with stakeholders\n\nOur responsible water use highlights the importance of water resources and good water management all over the world.\n\nIn Uruguay, UPM supports the Rio Negro Initiative to improve the status of the river. UPM is also funding the improvement of the municipal wastewater treatment\n\nIn 2021, UPM joined a two-year project 'Circular Economy of Water in Industrial Processes' together with several industrial and academic partners. The project was initiated by the Finnish innovation cluster CLIC.\n\n## Process wastewater volumes\n\n3\n\nm\n\n/t\n\n50\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30% reduction of wastewater volumes from 2008 level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n18%\n\nreduction achieved for the UPM average product\n\n40% reduction in effluent load (COD) from 2008 level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n38%\n\nreduction achieved for the UPM average product\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nplant and sewer systems in Paso de los Toros and neighboring towns where temporary and permanent housing facilities have been installed.\n\n## Minimising the impact of hydropower facilities\n\nUPM Energy is the second-largest electricity producer in Finland and has been a hydropower producer for over a century. While hydropower is a cost-effective, renewable and CO 2 free way to generate electricity, it can also have an adverse impact on watercourses and their surroundings. In order to minimise these impacts, we work closely with authorities and other stakeholders. In addition to the regulatory compensations, we also support and implement voluntary measures to protect and revitalise migratory fish stocks with our migrating fish programme.\n\nThe programme continued in Finland. UPM submitted an application for a permit for dismantling of a decommissioned water intake dam structures in Arvajankoski, J\u00e4ms\u00e4, and for the further fishery rehabilitation of Arvajankoski. UPM's goal is to start the fisheries' rehabilitation in co-operation with local stakeholders. In addition to the ongoing fish migration obstacle removal and rehabilitation projects, UPM is participating in practical local projects and research activities to promote fish migration.\n\nThe risk assessment confirms that our production sites are located in areas with low to medium basin risk. The tool also provides 2030 and 2050 scenarios of water risks, based on climate and socio-economic changes, to enable us to understand and prepare for future water risks and opportunities.\n\nBased on those climate scenarios, our Changshu paper mill near Shanghai is expected to see the greatest rise in water basin risk by 2050. In recent years, however, the mill has made substantial improvements in water efficiency. Besides improving water efficiency, the mill has also reduced its effluent load by 40% since 2008.\n\nAll our pulp and paper mills have a plan to reach their targets for reducing water use and e/ffluent load by 2030. In 2021, further mills started to use advanced process controls or predictive analytic models to optimise the operation of the treatment plant. Exploring new ways of working, new technologies and new partnerships with potential chemical and machinery suppliers continued, and some of these technologies were piloted. For example, some mills have successfully tested a new filtration unit to further treat super clear filtrates with the target to replace warm water used\n\n## IMPACT\n\n- \u00b7 Our measures ensure that the impact of our operations on watercourses are minimised so that clean water is available for surrounding communities\n- \u00b7 Our efforts to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems enhance the quality of watercourses and the natural habitat of species living there\n\n## TARGETS\n\n- \u00b7 Use water responsibly\n- \u00b7 Continuously reduce the effluent load and wastewater volume generated by our operations\n- \u00b7 Use only recycled nutrients in effluent treatment\n\n## OUR WAY\n\n- \u00b7 Water-intensive operations in areas with sufficient water resources\n- \u00b7 Efficient water use with appropriate recycling techniques\n- \u00b7 Treatment of used water according to the Best Available Techniques\n- \u00b7 Returning water to its original watershed when possible\n- \u00b7 Co-operation with local stakeholders to further improve the quality of local waterways\n- \u00b7 Focus on 2030 responsibility targets\n\n## CASE\n\n## ASSESSING WATER RISKS USING WWF WATER RISK FILTER TOOL\n\nWe first evaluated our pulp and paper mills on Water Stress Index maps a decade ago. A few years ago, we used the WWF Water Risk Filter, an online tool to assess water risks. The tool helped us conduct, measure and interpret the results of our water risk assessment and our water work more effectively.\n\nDuring 2021, we updated the water risk analysis and extended scope to all plywood mills, labelstock factories and terminals as well as new projects in Uruguay and Germany, in addition to pulp and paper mills globally.",

Our governance structure supports good management, responsible business operations and compliance at all levels, with clear responsibilities and reporting lines.\n\nUPM complies with all recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code (CG Code) for listed companies, which is issued by the Finnish Securities Market Association. In accordance with the CG Code, we have published our Corporate Governance Statement (CG Statement) for the financial year 2021. It is available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/governance. We can refer to the CG Statement for information on:\n\n- \u00b7  The duties and responsibilities of the Board of Directors and its Committees\n- \u00b7  Our governance structure and management system\n- \u00b7  The duties and responsibilities of our management bodies\n- \u00b7  Our management and control procedures related to internal control, risk management, internal audit, insider administration and related party transactions\n\n## General Meeting of shareholders\n\nOur Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2021 took place in Helsinki on 30 March 2021. The proposals of the Board of Directors and the Nomination and Governance Committee to the AGM were published in January and the notice of the AGM was published in February. In order to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the AGM was arranged under the Finnish temporary legislative act (677/2020) and held without the shareholders' and their proxy representatives' presence at the meeting venue. UPM also o/ffered a proxy authorisation service, whereupon shareholders had the possibility to authorise an independent proxy representative nominated by the Company.\n\nThis exceptional AGM arrangement was necessary to ensure the health and safety of the shareholders, employees and other stakeholders, as well as to organise the meeting in a predictable way, allowing equal means for shareholders to participate while also ensuring compliance with the prevailing restrictions set by the authorities at that time. The shareholders could participate and exercise their shareholder rights at the AGM by voting in advance, and by submitting counterproposals and asking questions in writing in advance. A total of 2,542 (2,524) shareholders were represented at the meeting\n\n## Governance framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe illustration below summarises the basic regulatory framework for our/uni00A0governance.\n\nand they represented 54.2% (52.0%) of the Company's shares and voting rights at the time of the AGM. The AGM supported all the proposals, and all decisions at the meeting were made in accordance with the proposals by the Board of Directors, as well as the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee.\n\nThe AGM adopted the Company's Financial Statements and decided to distribute the same dividend of EUR 1.30 per share, as in the previous year, and released the members of the Board of Directors and the President and CEO from liability for the financial year 2020. The dividends, totalling EUR 693 million, were paid on 12 April 2021 to shareholders who were registered on our list of registered shareholders on\n\nThe shareholders and the public were able to follow the whole meeting, including greetings by the Board Chair and a review by the President and CEO through a webcast. The recorded speeches were further made available after the AGM on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2021.\n\n1 April 2021. UPM's Remuneration Report 2020 for governing bodies was presented to and adopted by the AGM for the first time. Information on other decisions made at the AGM can be found later on in this section and on the corporate website at www.upm.com/ agm2021.\n\nThe AGM 2022 will be held on 29 March. For the year 2021, the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of EUR 1.30 per share. Due to continued COVID-19 pandemic the meeting will be arranged under the Finnish temporary legislative act (375/2021). Shareholders can only participate and exercise their shareholder rights in the AGM by voting in advance via an electornic voting or proxy service provided by the Company as well as by submitting counterproposals and asking questions in writing prior to the meeting. The AGM, as well as speeches by the Chair of the Board and the President and CEO, can be followed through a webcast. Detailed instructions for shareholders are available on the corporate website at www.upm.com/agm2022.",

The Nomination and Governance Committee conducted its annual review of the structure, size, composition, diversity and succession needs of the Board as a whole, including whether the Board reflects an appropriate balance of sound judgement and a diverse range of business expertise, skills, experience, independence, availability of service to the Company and other desired qualities. As a result of a careful selection process, the Nomination and Governance Committee decided to propose nine members be elected to UPM's Board of Directors for a one-year term.\n\nAs proposed by the Nomination and Governance Committee, Berndt Brunow, Henrik Ehrnrooth, Emma FitzGerald, Piia-Noora Kauppi, Marjan Oudeman, Martin \u00e0 Porta, Kim Wahl and Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos were re-elected, whilst Jari Gustafsson was elected as a new director to the Board. All directors are non-executive and their term of o/ffice will end upon the closure of the AGM 2022. The shareholders were asked to vote on a single slate for the Board of Directors, as this has been, unlike in many other countries, a market practice in Finland.

        "page_content": "## Director independence\n\nThe Board of Directors evaluates the independence of its members both annually and on a continuous basis, with the assistance of the Board's Nomination and Governance Committee. Director independence is assessed based on the independence criteria of the Finnish CG Code. The majority of the members of the Board of Directors must be independent of the Company, and at least two of these independent members must be independent of any significant shareholders.\n\nAccording to the evaluation carried out by the Board with the assistance of the Nomination and Governance Committee, all Board members are independent of the Company's significant shareholders, as the Company has no controlling shareholder and none of the Company's shareholders have announced a holding of 10% or more of the Company's shares or votes attached thereto.\n\nThe independence evaluation of director candidates is one of the key factors in the preparation of the Nomination and Governance Committee's annual proposal for the composition of the Board. The Committee assesses the independence of members of the Board of Directors on a continuous basis. It also reviews a report on any changes in professional engagements and other commitments at every meeting to ensure that members are compliant with the independence criteria. The Committee also assesses how such changes may a/ffect the Board members' availability for Board-related work and reports to the Board on the outcome of such assessments. In particular, the Committee assesses Board members' positions in other publicly listed companies to ensure that the members adhere to the best practice related to overboarding. According to the Nomination and Governance Committee's assessment, all directors are independent of both the Company and the significant shareholders. High attendance rates at the Board and Committee meetings prove the Board members' commitment and availability for Board-related work. The attendance rates at the meetings by each member are in the table on the previous page.\n\nAll directors are non-executive, and the Board has also concluded that all directors are independent of the Company, including Berndt Brunow and Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos, who have been non-executive directors of the\n\nCompany for more than ten consecutive years. Based on the Board's overall evaluation of the independence of these directors, their long-standing service does not compromise their independence, and no other factors or circumstances have been identified that could a/ffect their independence.\n\n## Board-related work in 2021\n\nThe Board convened according to its original meeting schedule and held nine meetings in 2021. Its work was not disrupted, even during the continued exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThere is no minimum meeting attendance requirement for Board members. Instead, Board members are expected to attend all meetings unless there is a valid reason for not attending. The average attendance of the Board members at the Board meetings was 98.8% (95.6%), and at the Committee meetings 100% (90.9%). The personal attendance rate of each Board member is presented in the table on page 105. In connection with its meetings, the Board also held non-executive sessions and non-executive sessions with the auditor.\n\n## Strategic focus points in 2021\n\nIn line with its main duties and responsibilities, the Board reviewed and approved strategic plans during its strategy session in May. The main focus points of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be growth, performance, innovation, responsibility and portfolio. Read more about our strategy on pages 22-33. An essential part of the Board's annual strategy-related work is to oversee the assessment and management of risks related to the Company's strategy and operations. These risks and opportunities, and their impact on operations and strategy, are described on pages 34-35.\n\nIn 2021, the Board continued to focus on major strategic investments, the pulp mill project in Uruguay and the biochemicals biorefinery in Germany. The Board has been closely monitoring the status and the feasibility of the project in Uruguay since 2016 and has conducted several status reviews, including risk assessments, in its meetings since then. The investment will raise UPM's pulp production capacity by more than 50% and significantly contribute to future\n\n## COMMITTEE MEMBERS 2021\n\n| AUDIT COMMITTEE                                              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Kim Wahl (Chair as of 30 March)                              |\n| Emma FitzGerald   (member until 30 March and as of 27 April) |\n| Jari Gustafsson (member as of 30 March)                      |\n| Marjan Oudeman                                               |\n| Piia-Noora Kauppi   (Chair and member until 30 March)        |\n\n## REMUNERATION COMMITTEE\n\nHenrik Ehrnrooth (Chair as of 30 March)\n\nEmma FitzGerald (member as of 30 March)\n\nMartin \u00e0 Porta\n\nVeli-Matti Reinikkala\n\n(Chair and member until 30 March)\n\n## NOMINATION AND GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE\n\n| Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos (Chair)                    |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n| Berndt Brunow                             |\n| Piia-Noora Kauppi (member as of 30 March) |\n| Ari Puheloinen (member until 30 March)    |\n\nearnings.

The biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals that enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses.

He joined UPM in 2017, taking responsibility for the UPM Raflatac self-adhesive label business in Europe, Middle East, India and Africa.\n\nBefore joining UPM, he spent 22 years at Kimberly-Clark in various positions. He says that this gave him the opportunity to invest in gathering a very wide set of experience. 'During my career I've moved across multiple roles and worked in different countries. This has taught me to work across businesses and different cultures.'\n\nThe four years of Reynaudo at the helm of the EMEIA Region in UPM Raflatac saw a strong business performance. 'We've streamlined the organisation and made the business more agile. Enabling our teams to make more decisions, the business has been fast to adapt and has performed strongly, also during the turbulent times of the pandemic.'\n\nHe's not only driven by results but by transparency and collaboration as well. The future is built on a strong foundation, coupled with the right ingredients for success.\n\n'The paper business has traditionally performed at a high level. I believe that operational and commercial efficiency, engagement, and the motivation of the people are surely the key ingredients to continue delivering high performance.'\n\nthe Board and its committees in relation to their respective duties and responsibilities, the Board and committee compositions and structure, the Board culture, the e/ffectiveness of the Board and committee meetings, the individual performance of the Board members and the performance of the Chair of the Board.\n\nThe overall results of the 2021 self-evaluation were highly favourable and indicated that the Board, Chair of the Board and the Board committees are performing e/ffectively, and that the Board members are committed to the Board work. Identified areas for improvement are considered when planning the Board-related work, and the Nomination and Governance Committee takes the results into consideration when preparing its proposal for the composition of the Board to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Board committees\n\nThe Board has established the following three committees to further improve the preparation of matters to be decided by the Board:\n\n- \u00b7  The Remuneration Committee\n- \u00b7  The Audit Committee\n- \u00b7  The Nomination and Governance Committee\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee assisted the Board in reviewing the composition, qualification criteria and duties of the Board committees, and made a proposal to the Board for the appointment of committee members and Chairs. The members were appointed to the Board committees in the Board's constitutive meeting on 30 March 2021 and the composition of the Audit Committee was complemented on 27 April 2021. The committee compositions are presented in the table on the left. Neither the President and CEO nor other Company executives may be members of any Board committees.\n\nThe written Committee Charters approved by the Board of Directors set forth the purpose, composition, operations and duties of each committee, as well as the prerequisites of committee membership. Each committee is responsible for performing the duties assigned to it in its Charter. The Committee Charters are presented in\n\nthe CG Statement and are also available at www.upm.com/governance.\n\nThe committees hold their meetings prior to Board meetings in order to prepare matters to be decided by the Board. The chairs of each committee report on matters discussed and actions taken by the committees during the Board meetings. In addition, minutes from the committee meetings are available to the Board members for information purposes.\n\n## Committee-related work in 2021\n\nThe importance and extent of the work of the Committees has increased in recent years and will further increase following the continuous changes in the regulatory framework and the Company's business environment. This is also reflected in the Committee Charters and in the topics and matters the committees were involved with in addition to their regular duties throughout the year.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting processes and financial reporting, internal control, internal audit and risk management, and for monitoring the Company's audit and compliance procedures. In 2021, the Audit Committee held five meetings. In addition to the Audit Committee's assigned matters and regular reports as listed above, it also reviewed reports on and discussed non-financial matters (together with the review of non-financial reporting), ESG, cyber security and the audit tendering process. The Committee also replied to a thematic review of the European audit committees launched by the Committee of European Auditing Oversight Bodies (CEAOB).\n\nThe Audit Committee has prepared the Board's proposal for the election and remuneration of the auditor to be presented at the AGM 2022. In this context, the\n\nThe lead audit partner attended all Committee meetings and reported to the Committee on the interim procedures and findings, as well as quarterly audit and non-audit fees and services.

Kekki's UPM career started in 1994 at the softwood plywood mills as an operating engineer and later as mill manager. During 10 years, the Pellos mill developed into the largest in Europe and one of the largest plywood mills in the world after several investment phases.\n\nLater, the road led to responsibility for the distribution business mill's production, the production of spruce-based mills and the support functions for plywood production. Kekki has been working in the management team of the plywood business since 2011 and has since been responsible for all mills and support functions.\n\n\"These years have been very rewarding, as together with the management team and the whole organisation we turned a weak, even loss-making business into a highly profitable one, with seven consecutive years of profit improvement.\"\n\nA passionate and active sports enthusiast, Kekki describes himself as a team player for whom leadership is all about trust, honesty and openness. \"You win as a team and you lose as a team\", he sums up.\n\n\"I see the plywood business as having a very successful future. It is growing globally at 2-4% per year. My role is to ensure that UPM Plywood keeps pace with this growth.

An assurance engagement involves performing procedures to obtain evidence about the amounts and other information in the CR Reporting, and about the Company's adherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles. The procedures Selected depend on the practitioner's judgment, including an assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the CR Reporting and an assessment of the risks of the Company's material nonadherence to the AA1000 AccountAbility Principles.\n\nIn addition, we have conducted our work in accordance with the AA1000 Assurance Standard 2018.

        "page_content": "## Report of the Board of Directors\n\n## UPM introduction and business model\n\nAs a frontrunner in forest industry, UPM provides sustainable solutions to the growing global consumer demand. Products are made from renewable materials and are recyclable.\n\nUPM invests in sustainable growth and innovates for a future beyond fossils across six business areas: UPM Biorefining, UPM Energy, UPM Raflatac, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Communication Papers and UPM Plywood. The business areas are competitive with strong market positions.\n\nUPM group creates value to its stakeholders by operating separate businesses with a focus on:\n\n- \u00b7 Competitive and sustainable wood sourcing, forestry and plantation operations\n- \u00b7 Value adding, efficient and responsible global functions\n- \u00b7 Continuous improvement (Smart) programmes\n- \u00b7 Technology and intellectual property rights\n- \u00b7 A global platform to build on\n- \u00b7 Disciplined and effective capital allocation\n- \u00b7 Compliance with applicable laws and regulations, UPM Code of Conduct and corporate policies\n\n## Market environment in 2021\n\nThe world economy recovered from the severe global recession of 2020. The year 2021 began with rising optimism about growth driven by an upswing in global output and consumer spending, as well as vaccine rollouts in developed countries. Global recovery continued throughout the year despite disruptions in global supply chains, inflationary pressure and the growing uncertainty caused by weakening pandemic dynamics towards end of the year. Global real GDP growth is projected at 5.6% in 2021.\n\nIn Europe, the economy rebounded from the pandemic recession faster than initially expected. Domestic demand was strong, and the reopening of the economy made good progress. Global supply-chain bottlenecks and disruptions also weighed on activity in Europe, particularly in integrated manufacturing sector. In addition, the sharp increase in energy prices impacted on consumption and investments. Economic growth in Europe is projected at 5.6% in 2021.\n\nIn the US, accumulated savings, federal stimulus and wage growth provided strong support for economic recovery. Nevertheless, expansion faced mounting headwinds as worker shortages, disruptions in the supply of raw materials and container ship backups threatened to slow down recovery. Economic growth in the US is projected at 5.7% in 2021.\n\nChina's economy swiftly rebounded in 2021 with its best growth since 2011. Industrial output, construction and foreign trade surpassed pre-pandemic levels in spite of the power shortages that hit the country's manufacturing and industrial activities during H2. Growth lagged in retail sales and service industries. Private consumption continued to be impacted by the pandemic due to the increase in household saving and lockdowns limiting opportunities to spend. In China, economic growth is projected at 8.1% in 2021.\n\nMultilateral efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change remained a key global focus and priority. The United Nations Climate Change\n\n## Clear roles and responsibilities\n\n| Group                  | Businesses                                 |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Portfolio strategy     | Business area  strategies                  |\n| Capital allocation     |                                            |\n| Business targets       | Commercial excellence                      |\n| Code of Conduct        | Operational excellence Cost efficiency     |\n| Responsibility targets | measures Focused growth project Innovation |\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Outcomes\n\nTop performance Competitive advantage Value creation Stakeholder and societal value License to operate\n\nEach business area is responsible for executing its own strategy and achieving targets. Group direction and support from global functions enable the businesses to capture benefits from UPM's brand, scale and integration, while navigating the complex operating environment. Capital allocation decisions take place at the group level.\n\nCorporate responsibility is an integral part of all of our operations and a source of competitive advantage. UPM is committed to continuous improvement in financial, social and environmental performance. UPM promotes responsible practices throughout the value chain and is active in finding sustainable solutions, in co-operation with its customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nConference (COP26) finalised the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5C. However, that goal will not be reached without further action and collaboration between governments, businesses and civil society to deliver on climate goals more quickly. Over 90% of global GDP is now covered by net zero commitments.\n\nIn terms of global biodiversity preservation, the drivers of change are largely the same as for climate change mitigation. The year 2021 saw key developments in terms of the global post-2020 biodiversity framework and its expected adoption. Large economies have shown strong aspirations to put biodiversity on a path to recovery and companies are increasingly working to incorporate targets to tackle nature loss into their strategies.\n\nInflation increased rapidly in many countries, especially in the United States, Germany and some emerging markets. UPM's input costs were significantly higher in comparison with the previous year, most notably in fibre and energy.\n\nThe US dollar strengthened against the euro and other major world currencies during 2021. The impact of changing currencies on UPM's businesses was moderate in 2021.\n\nMarket demand for UPM's products was good, particularly in Europe and North America, and sales prices increased in most businesses. Demand for graphic papers in Europe increased by 4% from a low comparison period in the previous year. Market prices increased slightly for most paper grades.\n\nThe growth in demand for chemical pulp continued good in Europe but slowed in China. The average market prices for both northern bleached softwood (NBSK) and bleached hardwood kraft pulp (BHKP) increased in Europe.  In China, market prices reached historic highs in H1 and declined in H2, while remaining at a good level.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n120\n\nDemand for advanced renewable diesel and naphtha continued to be strong in 2021, with continuous growth in demand driven by climate targets. Market prices were at a high level.\n\nFinland's electricity consumption was good in 2021. Electricity sales prices in Finland were at a record high, especially toward the end of the year, due to high commodity and emission allowance prices and the dry hydrological situation in the Nordic market.\n\nThe growth of global demand for self-adhesive label materials was healthy, especially in consumer goods and e-commerce-driven labelling. Market prices increased in all main markets.\n\nThe growth in demand for label, release and packaging papers was good and market prices increased. In H1 2021, demand for office paper in the Asia-Pacific region was good but in H2, demand became weaker. Market prices for office paper in China increased sharply in H1 but decreased below the long-term average price levels in H2.\n\nMarket demand for plywood in Europe was strong. Demand for spruce plywood was driven by high levels of activity in the building and construction industry. Demand for birch plywood was good in panel trading, vehicle flooring and construction-related industrial applications. Market prices increased in many end-uses.\n\n## Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, the related containment measures around the world and rapid changes in the global economy continue to represent significant uncertainty.\n\n## Global economy\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the related containment measures resulted in a sharp decline in the global economy in 2020. During the first phase of the recession, the pandemic containment measures and lockdowns around the world severely limited or temporarily stopped significant parts of the economy. In 2021, the global economy has started to recover, but it is uncertain how long-lasting the recovery will be. Despite progress with vaccinations, additional waves of the epidemic in different parts of the world remain possible.\n\nThe recovery in the global economy from the deep downturn in 2020, combined with the ongoing pandemic have created tightness and disruptions globally in many supply chains, including logistics and energy, causing rising costs and uncertainty on price and availability of many raw materials and energy.\n\n## Safety and business continuity\n\nUPM has implemented extensive precautions to protect the health and safety of its employees and to ensure business continuity and the progression of its strategic projects during the pandemic. Despite these efforts, the operation of one or more units or the supply chain and logistics could be temporarily disrupted during the pandemic, the related lockdown measures, or the following economic recovery. In these circumstances some units may need to limit operations or be temporarily shut down.\n\nSo far UPM has been able to protect its employees and business continuity well.\n\n## Demand for UPM products\n\nMany of UPM's products serve essential everyday needs and have therefore seen resilient demand during the crisis. These products include pulp, specialty papers and self-adhesive label materials. However, even in these businesses, demand is influenced by general economic activity.\n\nDemand for graphic papers is more prone to be impacted by the lockdowns and economic cycles. The lockdowns limit a wide range of consumer-driven services and retail, as well as work at the office. This\n\nhas had a negative impact on printed advertising and graphic paper demand during the pandemic.\n\nThe lockdowns and the level of economic activity may also influence demand for electricity, plywood and sawn timber.\n\nIn Q2 2020, graphic paper demand in Europe decreased by 32% from the previous year, as particularly advertising-driven paper consumption and office paper demand being impacted by the lockdowns across Europe. These impacts moderated to some extent as the year progressed, and graphic paper demand decreased by 18% in Q3 2020 and by 14% in Q4 2020 year-on-year. During Q1 2021 the pandemic and the related containment measures continued to impact the business environment, and graphic paper demand decreased by 14% from last year. In Q2 2021, as economies in Europe started to gradually open, graphic paper demand increased by 28% from the low comparison base in previous year. In Q3 2021, demand grew by 6% and in Q4 2021 by 4% from the previous year.\n\nPulp demand has held up relatively well, supported by good demand for tissue and hygiene products as well as for some packaging and specialty paper products. Pulp consumption in graphic paper production decreased in 2020, but improved in 2021.\n\nDemand for self-adhesive label materials and specialty papers has grown during the pandemic, as consumers have shifted some of their spending from away-from-home categories to packaged daily consumer goods. E-commerce has continued to grow, supporting some labelling and specialty paper applications. Demand for self-adhesive labels in Europe grew by 7% in Q1 2020 and 9% in Q2 2020 year-on-year, decreased by 4% in Q3 2020 due to destocking in the customer value chain, and resumed growth at 6% in Q4 2020. Demand for selfadhesive labels in Europe increased in Q1 2021 by 1% and in Q2 2021 by 9%. In Q3 2021, demand grew by 15% from last year and in Q4 by 3%, somewhat impacted by the supply chain constraints.\n\n## Adjusting to different scenarios\n\nThe potential impacts on UPM are likely to differ by business and phase and waves of the pandemic, lockdown measures, changes in consumer behaviour, and the recession and recovery thereof. UPM has used shift arrangements, temporary layoffs, or reduced working hours as required to adjust its operations in different scenarios. During Q3 2020, the company also announced plans to permanently reduce graphic paper production capacity and other plans to improve cost efficiency in different businesses and functions. The UPM Kaipola paper mill was closed in January 2021.\n\n## Projects and maintenance shutdowns\n\nThe pandemic and the required health and safety measures add challenges to large investment projects and maintenance shutdowns. UPM's transformative pulp project in Uruguay and biochemicals project in Germany are proceeding with strict health and safety controls. Despite these efforts, some changes to the detailed timeline and costs of the projects are possible during the pandemic, the related containment measures, or due to the tight global logistics and supply chains.\n\nIn April 2020 TVO announced that fuel loading into the OL3 reactor would not happen as originally planned in June 2020. TVO announced an updated schedule in August 2020, and the fuel loading was completed in April 2021.\n\nUPM rescheduled two pulp mill maintenance shutdowns from Q2 2020 to Q4 2020 due to the pandemic. Both shutdowns were successfully completed in Q4 with strict health and safety controls. For 2021, UPM rescheduled the maintenance shutdown at the UPM Kymi pulp mill from Q2 2021 to Q4 2021.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n121",

Sales increased in all business areas, driven by higher sales prices and delivery volumes.\n\nComparable EBIT increased by 55% to EUR 1,471 million, 15.0% of sales (948 million, 11.1%).\n\nSales prices increased for UPM Biorefining, UPM Energy, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Raflatac and UPM Plywood and decreased for UPM Communication Papers.\n\nVariable costs increased in all business areas, especially in UPM Communication Papers, UPM Specialty Papers and UPM Raflatac. At the\n\ngroup level, the positive impact of higher sales prices more than offset the negative impact of higher variable costs.\n\nDelivery volumes were higher in all business areas. Fixed costs decreased by EUR 2 million. Costs in the comparison period were reduced by temporary measures to adjust to the COVID-19 pandemic. The industry-wide strike in Finland impacted both delivery volumes and fixed costs in Q1 2020.\n\nDepreciation, excluding items affecting comparability, totalled EUR 463 million (471 million) including depreciation of leased assets totalling EUR 74 million (73 million). The change in the fair value of forest assets net of wood harvested was EUR 111 million (-25 million).\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n122\n\nOperating profit totalled EUR 1,562 million (761 million). Items affecting comparability in operating profit totalled EUR 91 million in the period (-187 million), including the EUR 133 million gain on the sale of Shotton Mill Ltd in UPM Communication Papers business area and EUR 50 million impairment charges of newsprint related assets. In 2020, Items affecting comparability in operating profit included EUR 90 million in restructuring charges related to the closure of the UPM Kaipola paper mill, EUR 85 million in restructuring charges related to closure of the UPM Chapelle paper mill, EUR 23 million in restructuring charges related to the closure of the Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 plywood mill, EUR 6 million in charges related to the restructuring of the functions of UPM Communication Papers, EUR 9 million in charges related to restructuring of the functions of UPM Raflatac, earnings of EUR 12 million on the sale of the group's share in Kainuun Voima Oy and earnings of EUR 11 million on the sale of other non-current assets.\n\nNet interest and other finance income and costs were EUR -12 million (-26 million). The exchange rate and fair value gains and losses were EUR -3 million (2 million).

        "page_content": "## State of the art mill design\n\nThe pulp mill has been designed as an efficient single-line operation. The machines, materials, level of automation and standards enable a high operating rate and maintainability, as well as a high energy output. This ensures excellent safety, high environmental performance, and low operating costs during the long lifecycle of the mill.\n\nThe mill is designed to fully meet strict Uruguayan environmental regulations, as well as international standards and recommendations for modern mills, including the use of the latest and best available technology (BAT). The mill's environmental performance will be verified through comprehensive and transparent monitoring.\n\nThe mill's initial annual production capacity is 2.1 million tonnes, and the environmental permits enable further capacity potential. When in operation, the mill generates more than 110 MW surplus of renewable electricity.\n\n## Efficient logistics set-up\n\nAn efficient logistics chain will be secured by the agreed road improvements, extensive railway modernisation and port terminal construction.\n\nThe Public-Private-Partnership agreement between the government and the construction company for the construction of the central railway was signed in May 2019. Works on the central railway are proceeding, but the overall rail project is delayed, and the railway is scheduled to start operations in May 2023. UPM has a contingency plan in place to ensure logistics with truck transportation during this delay.\n\nUPM is proceeding with the construction of a deep-sea pulp terminal at Montevideo port with an investment of approximately USD 280 million. Direct rail access from the mill to a modern deep-sea port terminal creates an efficient supply chain to world markets. The Montevideo deep-sea port also enables synergies in ocean logistics with UPM's existing Uruguay operations.\n\nUPM entered into a port terminal concession agreement in 2019 and signed an agreement on rail logistics services in October 2020. Both agreements are considered in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases. The total amount of such lease payments is expected to be USD 200 million.\n\n## Significant impact on the Uruguayan economy\n\nBased on independent socioeconomic impact studies, the mill is estimated to increase Uruguay's gross national product by about 2% and the annual value of Uruguay's exports by approximately 12% after completion.\n\nIn the most intensive construction phase, more than 6,000 people will be working on the site. When completed, approximately 10,000 permanent jobs are estimated to be created in the Uruguayan economy of which approximately 4,000 would involve direct employment by UPM and its subcontractors. About 600 companies are estimated to be working in the value chain.\n\nThe mill will be located in one of Uruguay's many free trade zones and will pay a fixed annual tax of USD 7 million. The mill's value chain is expected to contribute USD 170 million in annual taxes and social security payments and to contribute USD 200 million annually in wages and salaries.\n\n## Project schedule and capital outflow\n\nThe mill was originally scheduled to start up in the second half of 2022. The successive waves in the pandemic and tight global supply chains have caused some challenges to the project. Hence, the start-up schedule has been updated to take place by the end of Q1 2023, and the total investment estimate has been increased by 10% to USD 3.47 billion.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nMore than 6,000 people are currently working on the project at the various construction sites. Strict COVID-19 protocols have been maintained at all UPM's construction sites.\n\nAt the pulp mill site in Paso de los Toros, the installation phase with mechanical erection continues to progress in all main process areas and EIA erection works have started. Majority of large civil works have been completed. Power boiler pressure test was done successfully in December. Commissioning works will proceed in the coming months.\n\nLarge scale cargo transfers from the UPM Fray Bentos port to the new mill site continue and include the transports of the machinery, equipment, and structures necessary for the construction of the UPM Paso de los Toros mill.\n\nA large part of the pulp terminal area in Montevideo has been completed, including the structure and roofing of the pulp warehouse an area of 50,000 square meters. The unloading lines for the railway were also completed and construction of railway has continued. Piping, pipe bridge, auxiliary machinery and electrical installation work continues on the port basin.\n\nThe total capital expenditure of USD 3.47 billion will take place in 2019-2023, with 2021 and 2022 being the most intensive years. UPM will hold 91% ownership of the project and a local long-term partner which has also been involved in UPM Fray Bentos, owns 9%. UPM's investment will mainly be financed from operating cash flow complemented by regular group financing activities.\n\n## Biochemicals refinery investment\n\nOn 30 January 2020 UPM announced that it would invest EUR 550 million in a 220,000 tonnes next-generation biochemicals refinery in Leuna, Germany. Originally, the biorefinery was scheduled to start up by the end of 2022. However, the pandemic has slowed down the completion of the detailed engineering in Leuna. Disruptions to global supply chains have affected both the availability and costs of critical construction materials. Hence the start-up schedule has been updated to take place by the end of 2023. The capital expenditure estimate will be updated in due course.\n\nThe biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, which will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to sustainable alternatives in various consumer-driven end-uses. The investment opens up totally new markets for UPM, with large growth potential for the future.\n\nThe industrial scale biorefinery will convert solid wood into next generation biochemicals: bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG) and renewable functional fillers. In addition, the biorefinery will produce biomonopropylene glycol (BioMPG) and industrial sugars. Once the facility is fully ramped up and optimized, it is expected to achieve the ROCE target of 14%.\n\nA combination of sustainable wood supply, a unique technology concept, integration into existing infrastructure at Leuna as well as the proximity to customers will ensure the competitiveness of operations. The safety and sustainability of the value chain will be based on UPM's high standards.\n\nInfraLeuna GmbH, in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, offers very competitive conditions for constructing a biorefinery with its  logistics arrangements and infrastructure for various services and utilities. In October 2020, UPM entered into service agreements with InfraLeuna GmbH related to wood handling, wastewater treatment and other utilities, which will be recognised as lease assets and liabilities under IFRS 16 Leases upon the commencement date. The total amount of such lease assets and liabilities is estimated to be EUR 100 million.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n124\n\nConstruction at biorefinery-site in Leuna continues and we have now started erecting the overground structures. Permitting has proceeded in accordance with German legislation.\n\nCommercial activities continue to proceed positively in different product and application areas. After the launch of UPM BioMotion\u2122 Renewable Functional Fillers (RFF) in October, joint product development activities with potential customers in the rubber value chain have progressed further as have discussions with OEMs, especially in the automotive sector, with promising results regarding both technical and commercial viability of our product. We made further progress in taking renewable monoethylene glycols (bMEG) to market, advancing sales capabilities and also in this category extending pre-commercial discussions with potential customers as well as end-users in packaging, textile and automotive end-uses.\n\nThe environmental benefits of the UPM Biorefinery and the UPM Biochemicals portfolio continue being publicly acknowledged with nominations as finalist for the German Sustainability Award and the Chemical Week's sustainability awards and an improved sustainability ranking in the European Rubber Journal.\n\nResearch and development facilities on site in Leuna are being extended and application development centres for rubber and glycols are now operational. The hiring process for the operations teams has progressed and we have started a comprehensive training and simulation programme for our new operations teams based on the Digital Twin solution of biorefinery and its processes.\n\n## Biofuels business development\n\nIn January 2021, UPM announced that it moves forward with biofuels growth plans and starts the basic engineering phase of a next generation biorefinery. The potential biorefinery would have an annual capacity of 500,000 tonnes of high-quality renewable fuels including sustainable jet fuel. The products would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of road transport and aviation, as well as replace fossil raw materials with renewable alternatives in chemicals and bioplastics. In the feedstocks, wood biomass-based residues and side streams play a substantial role. In addition, it would use sustainable liquid waste and residue raw materials.\n\nUPM is proceeding with a detailed commercial and basic engineering study to define the business case, select an innovative technology option and sustainable feedstock mix and estimate the investment need.\n\nDuring the study UPM has completed site assessments in two locations: Kotka, Finland and Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Work continues in Rotterdam, where the operating environment is more favourable for the biofuels business.\n\nIf all preparations are concluded successfully, UPM would initiate the company's standard procedure of analysing and preparing an investment decision. Due to the current challenging investment environment for new major projects like this, further decisions are not planned before the end of 2022.\n\n## OL3 power plant project\n\nTeollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO) is in the process of constructing a third nuclear power plant unit, OL3 EPR, at the Olkiluoto site (OL3). UPM participates in OL3 through its shareholding in Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), which is the majority shareholder in TVO. UPM's indirect share of OL3 is approximately 31%. The OL3 plant supplier, a consortium consisting of AREVA GmbH, AREVA NP SAS and Siemens AG (Supplier), is constructing OL3 as a turnkey project.\n\nThe start of regular electricity production, originally scheduled for April 2009, has been revised several times by the Supplier.\n\nAs announced by TVO, fuel loading of OL3 was completed in early April 2021. On 16 December 2021 TVO announced, that the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland (STUK) had granted the permission for making the OL3's reactor critical and conducting lower power tests. The electricity production of OL3 is scheduled to start at in February 2022, and the regular electricity production in June 2022. On 21 December 2021, TVO announced that OL3's reactor started up, i.e. the first criticality of OL3 was reached.\n\nAs announced by TVO earlier, Areva, the Supplier party, was preparing a financial solution to ensure necessary funding to complete the OL3 project. TVO and the Supplier also negotiated on the terms of completing the OL3 project. On 17 May 2021 TVO announced that TVO and the Supplier reached a consensus in their negotiations regarding the main principles of the OL3 project completion. The agreements regarding the amendments to the Global Settlement Agreement of 2018 entered into force on 13 July 2021.\n\nWhen completed, OL3 will supply electricity to its shareholders on a cost-price principle (Mankala-principle) which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle electricity and/or heat is supplied to shareholders in proportion to ownership, and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned.\n\nOL3 will increase UPM Energy's electricity generation capacity significantly. The new power plant unit is expected to be highly efficient and meet the highest safety standards. Its power generation will be CO2 -free and TVO will have a secure solution for the final disposal of used fuel.\n\n## Events during the year 2021\n\nOn 19 January, UPM announced that it would invest EUR 13 million in UPM Raflatac's new production line in Nowa Wie \u015b , Poland.

Jari Gustafsson was elected as a new director to the Board. The directors' term of office will end upon the closure of the next AGM.\n\nBj\u00f6rn Wahlroos was re-elected as Chair, and Berndt Brunow as Deputy Chair of the Board of Directors of UPM-Kymmene Corporation at the Board of Directors' constitutive meeting that took place following the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors elected the chairs and other members to the Board committees from among its members. Kim Wahl was elected to chair the Audit Committee, and Jari Gustafsson and Marjan Oudeman were elected as other committee members. Henrik Ehrnrooth was elected to chair the Remuneration Committee, and Emma FitzGerald and Martin \u00e0 Porta were elected as other committee members. Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos was re-elected to chair the Nomination and Governance Committee, and Berndt Brunow and Piia-Noora Kauppi were elected as other committee members.\n\nOn 27 April 2021, Emma FitzGerald was appointed as the fourth member of UPM's Audit Committee.\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nComparable EBIT for other operations increased. The change in the fair value of forest assets net of wood harvested was EUR 120 million (-17 million). The increase in the fair value of forest assets was EUR 171 million (63 million). The cost of wood harvested from UPM forests was EUR 51 million (81 million). In 2021, the increase in fair value was impacted by increased forest growth and higher stumpage price estimates used in valuation.\n\n## Shares held by the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team\n\nAt the end of the year, the members of the Board of Directors owned a total of 685,197 (716,348) UPM-Kymmene Corporation shares.

UPM is also exposed to the impacts of certain governmental protection and trade protection measures that safeguard domestic industries and other changes affecting international trade. Restrictions on import and export and other national interests may affect the availability or cost of necessary raw materials, and changes in the international trade agreements. The new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, COVID -19 related containment measures, effectiveness of vaccination programs and the economic downturn or global power struggles continue to cause high uncertainty to global trade, geopolitics or trajectories of economies.\n\nUPM is especially exposed to the economic and political conditions in countries in which UPM has significant production operations and ongoing investment projects, such as Finland, Uruguay and Germany. UPM also has significant production operations in a number of developing markets, such as China and Russia, where the lack of transparency and predictability of the political, economic and legal systems may lead to an increasing uncertainty and risk level when investing in or operating in them.\n\n## Cyclical and highly competitive markets\n\nIn all markets UPM operates in, the price level is determined by a combination of demand and supply and an imbalance between them could cause the prices of UPM's products to fluctuate significantly. Imbalances in demand and supply may be caused by factors such as decreases or increases in the end-use demand, changes in customer preferences or a new production capacity entering the market or an old production capacity being closed, all of which may affect both the volume and price level of UPM's products.\n\nCompetitor behaviour may also influence the market price development. UPM may, from time to time, experience price pressures from competitors in its main business areas and geographic market areas as well as particularly large fluctuations in operating margins due to this competitive environment.\n\nThe majority of UPM's revenue comes from sales of graphic and specialty papers, pulp and label materials, and UPM principally competes with several large multinational paper and forest product companies as well as with numerous regional or more specialised competitors.\n\n## Changes in consumer behaviour\n\nDemand for UPM's products may be affected by the introduction of substitute or alternative products. The demand for graphic papers in the mature markets is forecast to continue to decline. This will likely increase the pressure on UPM's graphic paper deliveries and sales prices as well as the scarcity of recycled fibre. The COVID -19 pandemic may further amplify the speed of changes adopted by consumers in consuming and communicating information. Changes in demand could also cause overcapacity in some of UPM's products, affecting the sales prices and deliveries of such products.\n\nDepending on the product area, the shifts in consumer demand may either have a positive or an adverse effect on the consumption of UPM's products. For example, UPM expects that there will continue to be a growing need for renewable and recyclable solutions, which creates various opportunities for UPM and drive demand growth for most of UPM's products. At the same time digitalisation and e-commerce have changed consumer behaviour and resulted in decline in demand for graphic papers for various end uses.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n131\n\n## Risks\n\n## Risk management\n\nUPM regards risk management as a systematic and proactive means to analyse and manage opportunities and threats related to its business operations. This also includes risks that can be avoided through careful planning and evaluation of future projects and business environments.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of UPM's management system as risk taking is a normal part of business operations. While executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and manufacturing units are exposed to a number of risk and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing of risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management function.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee, chaired by the CFO, is responsible for recommending risk tolerances and profile to the President and CEO and the Strategy Team. The Strategy Team is responsible for aligning risk management priorities, business and risk management strategies and policies.\n\nThe Board of Directors, assisted by the Audit Committee, monitors and assesses the effectiveness of the company's risk management systems and oversees the assessment and management of risks related to the company's strategy and operations. The Audit Committee oversees that risk management activities are aligned with the Risk Management Policy, and that risk assessments are used to guide internal audit activities.\n\nUPM seeks to transfer insurable risks through insurance arrangements for any risks that exceed the defined tolerance.\n\nUPM strives to ensure compliance with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. To enhance compliance and mitigate risks, UPM performs risk assessments, training and monitoring at regular intervals.\n\nUPM has developed and implemented a comprehensive internal control system that covers business and financial reporting processes. Internal control is aimed at ensuring that the company's operations are efficient and reliable, and in compliance with statutory requirements, and that the company's financial reporting is accurate and reliable, and reflects operational results. Internal control pertaining to financial reporting is described in the Corporate Governance Statement available in the corporate website.\n\nThe main risk factors that can materially affect the company's business, financial results and non-financial performance are set out below. They have been classified as strategic risks, operational risks, and financial risks. Risks may also arise from legal proceedings incidental to UPM's operations.\n\n## Strategic risks\n\n## Uncertainties in the economic and political operating environment\n\nThe main short-term uncertainties in UPM's earnings relate to sales prices and delivery volumes of its products, as well as to changes in the main input cost items and currency exchange rates, most of which are affected by uncertainty in the global, regional or local economic and political conditions. Political developments are causing uncertainties to the global economy. Such uncertainties also affect UPM's customers influencing the demand for UPM's products.\n\nExamples of such developments are the trade tensions between the United States, the EU and China, the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK after its exit from the EU as well as increased",

        "page_content": "## Changes in legislation\n\nUPM is exposed to a wide range of laws and regulations globally. The performance of UPM's businesses, for example the paper, energy, and biofuels businesses, are to a high degree dependent on the regulatory framework for these areas. Changes in regulation, direct and indirect taxation or subsidies, aid, grants or allowances could have a direct effect on UPM's performance and its relative competitiveness, and structurally restrict or exacerbate UPM's ability to compete for raw material.\n\nUPM also operates in industries that are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing, among others, emissions, water quality, energy efficiency, as well as waste handling, recycling and disposal. Environmental laws and regulations have become more stringent and may continue to develop to be even more stringent due to various global, regional and national level regulatory initiatives. As these environmental laws and regulations are amended or as their application or enforcement is changed, additional costs in complying with new and more stringent regulations may be imposed on UPM.\n\nUPM's operations require UPM to obtain multiple environmental permits and other licences from relevant authorities and comply with their terms and conditions. These permits and licences may be subject to modification, renewal or, subject to certain conditions, revocation by the issuing authorities. UPM monitors regulatory changes in order to better adapt to the effects of such changes.\n\n## Shareholdings in Pohjolan Voima Oyj\n\nUPM is a shareholder of Pohjolan Voima Oyj (PVO), which is the majority shareholder of Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). TVO is in the process of constructing a third nuclear power plant unit, OL3 EPR, at the Olkiluoto site (OL3). When completed, OL3 will supply electricity to its shareholders on a cost-price principle (so called 'Mankala-principle') that is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala principle, electricity and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective Articles of Association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned. OL3 is expected to increase UPM's electricity generation capacity significantly. UPM's indirect share of OL3 is approximately 31%.\n\nAccording to TVO OL3 was procured as a fixed price turnkey project from a consortium formed by Areva GmbH, Areva NP SAS and Siemens AG (Supplier). Under the plant contract, the consortium companies have joint and several liability for the contractual obligations.\n\nOriginally commercial electricity production at OL3 was scheduled to start in April 2009. However, completion of the project has been delayed. Supplier has updated the schedule for the commissioning of OL3 several times.\n\nIn March 2018 TVO announced that it had signed a Global Settlement Agreement (the 2018 GSA) with Supplier and the Areva Group parent company, Areva SA, a company wholly owned by the French state. The 2018 GSA concerns the completion of the OL3 project and related disputes and entered into force in late March 2018.\n\nAccording to TVO, in the 2018 GSA the Supplier consortium companies committed to ensuring that the funds dedicated to the completion of the OL3 project are sufficient and cover all applicable guarantee periods, including setting up a trust mechanism funded by Areva companies to secure the financing of the costs of completion of the OL3 project.\n\nTVO announced in its Q3 2021 interim report that replenishing the trust was finished according to the terms of the 2018 GSA, but it was\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nreplenished according to the amendment agreement which entered into force in July 2021. The additional compensation in accordance with the 2018 GSA has been recorded as EUR 400 million in total which decreases the historical costs of the property, plant and equipment in TVO's balance sheet.\n\nAs announced by TVO, the fuel loading of OL3 was completed in April 2021. TVO announced on 16 December 2021, that the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority in Finland (STUK) had granted the permission for making the OL3's reactor critical and conducting lower power tests. The electricity production of OL3 is scheduled to start in February 2022, and the regular electricity production in June 2022. On 21 December 2021, TVO announced that OL3's reactor started up, i.e. the first criticality of OL3 was reached.\n\nAs announced by TVO earlier, Areva, the Supplier party, was preparing a financial solution to ensure necessary funding to complete the OL3. TVO and Supplier also negotiated on the terms of completing the OL3 project. On 17 May 2021 TVO announced that TVO and Supplier reached a consensus in their negotiations regarding the main principles of the OL3 project completion, and the key matters are:\n\n- \u00b7 Areva companies' trust mechanism, set up in the GSA 2018, is to be replenished with approximately EUR 600 million as of the beginning of January 2021.\n- \u00b7 Both TVO and Supplier are to cover their own costs as of July 2021 until end of February 2022.\n- \u00b7 In the case that the Supplier consortium companies would not complete the OL3 project until the end of February 2022, they would pay additional compensation for delays, depending on the date of completion.\n\nOn June 3, 2021 TVO announced that it had signed agreements regarding amendments to the GSA 2018 with Supplier consortium companies and Areva Group parent company Areva SA. The agreements regarding the amendments to the GSA 2018 entered into force on 13 July 2021, when all related conditions were fulfilled.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic may have significantly added uncertainty to the progress of the project. According to TVO significant arrangements have been made at the OL3 site preventing the coronavirus infections. Despite of coronavirus restrictions, work has been able to continue under special arrangements.\n\nOn 16 December 2020 TVO announced that the shareholders of TVO have signed an additional shareholder loan commitment, comprising a total of EUR 400 million new subordinated shareholder loan agreements. According to TVO with the new shareholder loan commitment, TVO prepares to maintain a sufficient liquidity buffer and equity ratio in order to complete the OL3.\n\nTVO announced on April 1, 2021 that S&P Global Ratings (S&P) affirmed its long-term corporate credit rating 'BB' on TVO and changed the outlook from negative to positive.\n\nFurther delays to the OL3 project could have an adverse impact on PVO's business and financial position, the fair value of UPM's energy shareholdings in PVO and/or the cost of energy sourced from OL3 when completed. It is possible that the cost of energy sourced from OL3 at the time when it starts regular electricity production may be higher than the market price of electricity at that time.\n\n## Climate change\n\nUPM is exposed to a variety of risks related to climate change. Strategic risks related to climate change include risks concerning competition, markets, customers, products and regulation. For example, unpredictable regulation, subsidies or EU policies and resulting national legislation in EU countries may distort raw material, energy and final product markets and changing costs of greenhouse gas emissions may influence UPM's financial performance. UPM believes that forest, wood-\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n132\n\nbased products and low-carbon energy hold significant value creation potential with respect to renewable and recyclable products.\n\nOther risks related to climate change particularly concern UPM's supply chain as well as the availability and price of major inputs, such as wood and electricity. Climate change may cause exceptional weather events, such as severe storms, floods and draughts, which could, for example, result in unpredictable hydropower availability and wood harvesting conditions. Exceptionally mild winter conditions with a reduced period of frozen soil in the Nordics could affect the harvesting and transport of wood, consequently undermining the stability of raw material supply and potentially increasing the cost of wood. These could also increase the risk of production limitations.\n\n## Loss of major customers and industry consolidation\n\nUPM has several major customers, and the largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 2% of UPM's sales in 2021, and the ten largest customers represented approximately 15% of such sales. Although UPM is not dependent on any specific customer or group of customers, the loss of its major customers, if not replaced on similar terms, could have a material effect on UPM's business. Also, as the size of UPM's customers could increase in connection with industry consolidation, such customers could exert increased bargaining power on all of their suppliers, including UPM. UPM is also exposed to risks related to any deterioration of a major customer group's financial condition.\n\n## Product development, innovation and intellectual property rights\n\nResearch and product development are an important part of UPM's strategy, particularly with regard to new businesses, such as woodbased biofuels, biochemicals and biomedicals. The return on investment of new or enhanced existing products and solutions may not meet targets or improve UPM's competitiveness.\n\nUPM has a broad patent portfolio that provides value creation potential in the future; however, it also exposes UPM to risks related to the protection and management of intellectual property, including patents and trademarks.\n\n## Corporate acquisitions and divestments\n\nUPM's strategy is to grow businesses with strong long-term fundamentals and sustainable competitive advantage. This may result in acquisitions of new businesses or divestments of existing businesses or parts thereof. Carrying out corporate mergers, acquisitions and divestments involves risks relating to the successful implementation of a divestment and the ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses, systems, culture and personnel successfully. In addition, the cost of an acquisition may prove high and/or the anticipated economies of scale or synergies may not materialise. Hidden liabilities of an acquired company (e.g., competition law liabilities) may also constitute a significant risk in relation to potential acquisitions.\n\nUPM may divest operations or assets to focus on strategic areas. Any future divestments may be affected by many factors that are beyond UPM's control, such as the availability of financing to potential buyers, interest rates and acquirers' capacity, and divestments may also expose UPM to indemnity claims. Furthermore, divestments may involve additional costs due to historical and unaccounted liabilities. The profitability of corporate acquisitions and divestments may differ from UPM's expectations.\n\n## Operational risks\n\n## Fluctuations in the prices of major inputs as well as changes in their availability\n\nThe main inputs required in the manufacturing of UPM's products are wood, fibre, chemicals, energy and water. The prices for many of these major production inputs have been volatile in the recent years and are expected to remain volatile for the foreseeable future, which may have an effect on the general profitability of the industries in which UPM operates. Climate change may contribute to the increase of the price volatility of UPM's major production inputs. Also, any changes in the current forestry practices and level of harvesting due to negative public opinion towards harvesting could have an effect on the raw material supply and may increase the cost of wood.\n\nGovernmental protection and trade protection measures could also have an effect on the price and availability of raw materials as countries may, for example, enact export ban policies to protect forests or to bolster their domestic timber industry, which could have a material effect on the cost and availability of wood as a raw material for UPM. It is also uncertain how the EU energy policies may affect the availability and costs of fibre and energy. Significant increases in the prices of UPM's major inputs could increase UPM's operating expenses.\n\n## Supplier and subcontractor network and raw materials procurement\n\nUPM's business operations depend on a large number of suppliers and contractors. The majority of UPM's need of wood is covered by suppliers, and other production inputs, such as chemicals, fillers and recovered paper, are fully obtained from suppliers. Disruptions in the supply of key inputs or transportation services could have a significant effect on manufacturing operations. This could, for example, result in interruption or downscaling of production, change in the product mix or increased costs resulting from price increases for critical inputs or transportation services as well as shifts in the availability and price of wood. Supplier consolidation could also limit the number of suppliers from which UPM would be able to source its production inputs and could materially affect the prices paid by UPM for these inputs.\n\nThe UPM Supplier and Third Party Code defines the minimum level of performance that UPM requires from its suppliers and third-party intermediaries. UPM carries out supplier risk assessments on, for example, operational, financial, quality and responsibility perspectives. Based on the risk assessment, selected suppliers' activities are evaluated in more detail through annual surveys, supplier audits and joint development plans. If any non-conformities are discovered, the supplier is required to take corrective measures, which UPM follows up on. Some contracts may also be discontinued due to the seriousness of the finding or insufficient corrective measures.\n\n## Management and execution of large investment projects\n\nInvestment projects in UPM's businesses are often large and take one or more years to complete. Participation in large projects involves risks, such as cost overruns or delays, as well as non-achievement of the economic targets set for the investment. Currently, UPM's largest ongoing investment project is the construction of a new world-class pulp mill in Uruguay, which includes other related investments as well (port, Free Trade Zone infra and housing). Particular to this project is its size, complexity with a number of interconnected sub-projects as well as the level of cooperation with permit and other authorities. Additionally, the second largest ongoing project is the construction of a biochemicals refinery in Germany. This project involves the development of new business concepts and technologies.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n133",

        "page_content": "UPM is responsible for many projects in several of its countries of operation at any given time. All projects involve technical and operational risks, and projects require continuous operational planning, steering and supervision, quality control, input procurement, scheduling as well as resource and cost monitoring. Managing several projects requires that UPM has sufficient resources and efficient processes. Persistent port congestion issues, transportation bottlenecks, and rising logistics costs, all of which could be resulting from external events or market conditions beyond the control of UPM, may have an effect on the execution or profitability of investment projects. The COVID -19 pandemic and the required additional health and safety measures have also added a new challenge to large investment projects. UPM's transformative pulp project in Uruguay and biochemicals project in Germany are proceeding with strict health and safety controls, but despite these efforts, some changes to the detailed timeline of the projects may occur due to containment measures or infections affecting project workers, suppliers or infrastructure.\n\n## Unavailability of information systems as well as cybersecurity breaches\n\nUPM's production and business operations depend on the availability of supporting information systems and network services. Unplanned interruptions in UPM's or a supplier's critical information system services, loss of critical, financial or personal data due to reasons beyond UPM's or its suppliers' control, such as power cuts, software or telecommunication errors or other major disasters, such as fires or natural disasters, as well as user errors by UPM's own personnel or suppliers, can potentially cause major damage to UPM's businesses and disruptions to the continuity of operations.\n\nUPM's or its suppliers' information systems may be exposed to various cybersecurity risks. Malicious cyber intrusion could cause leakage of sensitive information, violation of data privacy regulations, theft of intellectual property, production outages and damage to UPM's reputation.\n\n## Litigation and compliance\n\nUPM operates globally in a large number of jurisdictions and complex regulatory frameworks. UPM may from time to time be involved in litigation and other similar proceedings or it could become subject to various claims and actions based on various grounds.\n\nOn a global scale, enforcement activities and jurisdictional reach regarding competition issues and anti-corruption have increased. Also, the recent development of Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) related lawsuits in Germany for alleged non-payment of EEG based surcharges may have an adverse impact on UPM, albeit UPM is not currently a party to any such lawsuits. The UPM Code of Conduct sets the standards of responsible behaviour and it covers topics relating to legal compliance and disclosure, anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nUPM's environmental performance and social responsibility play a significant role in UPM's ability to operate and influence the long-term success of its businesses. UPM has significant manufacturing operations or sourcing in several developing countries, some of which are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval. Breaches of applicable laws and regulations or corporate policies by UPM employees may lead to legal processes, sanctions and fines as well as reputational damages effecting UPM's operations. For example, In October 2021 the\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nEuropean Commission conducted an unannounced inspection at UPM's premises. According to the Commission's press release on 12th October, the Commission has concerns that the inspected companies in the wood pulp sector may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. Commission states that the unannounced inspections are a preliminary step in an investigation into suspected anticompetitive practises, and the fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. UPM continues to support the Commission with any investigation activity that may follow.\n\n## Industrial actions\n\nUPM is subject to risk of industrial actions, which could disrupt its business operations or the business operations of its stakeholders. Uncertainty may increase in the Finnish labour market amid the announcement of the Finnish Forest Industries Federation in fall 2020 to transfer collective bargaining to companies. For example, in the beginning of 2022, members of the Paperworkers' Union, the Finnish Electrical Workers' Union and the Trade Union Pro started strikes at UPM mills in J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski, Kouvola, Lappeenranta, Pietarsaari, Rauma, Tampere and Valkeakoski, Finland. These strikes or other industrial actions in UPM's business operations or related sectors could have an effect on UPM's business operations. For example, industrial actions in the transport sector or among other stakeholders important to UPM, may disrupt UPM's operations. Additionally, public dissatisfaction with UPM's labour-related decisions may, in extreme cases, lead to unanticipated boycotts or disruptions at its facilities or construction sites.\n\n## A natural disaster, fire, accident or other calamity at UPM's production facilities\n\nUPM operates a significant number of production facilities globally that are exposed to risks related to environment, fires, natural events, site security and occupational health and safety risks. If UPM's production facilities were to experience a major accident or were forced to shut down or curtail production due to such unforeseen events, such as a leak or spill due to malfunction or human error, this could cause major interruptions in UPM's operations and result in significant costs in order to clean up and repair any potential damages to the production plant and the surrounding areas. Any failure to maintain high levels of safety management could also result in physical injury, sickness (such as a COVID -19 infection) or liability to UPM's employees, contractors or third parties. These risks are managed through established management procedures, health and safety precautions and loss prevention programmes. UPM's insurance programme provides coverage for insurable hazard risks, subject to insurance terms and conditions.\n\n## Forests and plantations\n\nUPM's plantations and forests may be affected by the impacts of climate change, which include more frequent and severe extreme weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, storms, floods and drought. Climate change is expected to have the biggest physical effect on UPM's forest lands in Finland, where temperatures are expected to rise more significantly and rapidly compared with other countries where UPM owns forest. Although forest growth will likely accelerate, particularly in Finland, due to the longer growing season, extreme weather conditions will intensify, presenting new risks. The increase of droughts and fires are estimated to pose the most significant risks for UPM's business. Also, damages caused by insects and tree diseases are becoming increasingly common, which could have an effect on the value of UPM's forest assets. Should these risks materialise, they could harm UPM's forest and plantations resulting in production interruption and additional costs.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n134\n\n## Non-financial information\n\nGlobal megatrends represent many long-term opportunities and challenges for UPM towards 2030 and beyond. They are also driving demand for sustainable solutions and responsible business practices.\n\nTo steer its responsibility activities, UPM has established a set of responsibility focus areas with targets and key performance indicators. They are reviewed every year based on a materiality analysis (page 66). The focus areas cover economic, social and environmental responsibility. Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change is becoming more important all the time, and it is relevant for UPM throughout the whole value chain: land use, sourcing, production and products. Thus, climate-related targets have been established for all of these areas. In 2021, UPM renewed its social responsibility targets to strengthen the social commitment. This is also reflected in corresponding updates of the non-financial key performance indicators.\n\nUPM's Biofore strategy guides the company in achieving its responsibility targets for 2030 and in contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development published by the UN.\n\nConnecting sustainability performance to financing demonstrates the importance of responsible business practices to UPM's long term value creation. In 2020, UPM tied its syndicated revolving credit facility to both biodiversity and climate targets, and also issued a first green bond. In 2021, UPM published its first Green Bond report and issued a second green bond.\n\n## Based on international frameworks and commitments\n\nUPM respects international human rights agreements and agreements concerning labour rights, including the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n\nSince 2003, UPM is a signatory of the UN Global Compact initiative, whose ten universal principles are derived from international agreements in the areas of human rights, labour standards, the environment and anti-corruption. And since 2016, UPM has the LEAD participant status for its commitment to the UN Global Compact. In 2021, UPM was globally one of only 37 companies to receive this recognition, and the only representative of the forest industry and Finland.\n\nRegarding climate change UPM committed to the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative in 2017 and received validation of its tightened CO2 targets in 2020. To further strengthen its climate approach, UPM committed to the UN's Business Ambition for the 1.5\u00b0C pledge. In 2021, UPM joined The Climate Pledge to reach the targets set by the Paris Agreement by 2040.\n\nUPM follows the Finnish Corporate Governance Code issued by the Securities Market Association and complies with all of its recommendations.\n\n## UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies\n\nUPM's decision making, management and operations are guided by UPM values and the UPM Code of Conduct. Legal compliance and responsible practices are the foundation of all of UPM's businesses and create long-term value for both UPM and its stakeholders. The UPM Code of Conduct emphasises UPM's commitment to business integrity and responsible business operations, manifesting the company's guiding principles.\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct is complemented by more detailed policies approved by the Board of Directors and rules or statements approved by the Group Executive Team, business areas or global functions. These policies, rules and statements cover such topics as\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n135\n\n## Strategic partners\n\nUPM collaborates with many partners. For example, product development in the biofuels, bioenergy or biochemicals increases the importance of partnerships in the search for new products and businesses or higher efficiency. Partnerships may, however, create risks to the profitability, for example, through changes occurring within the partner entity or changes in how the partnership operates. UPM is also subject to the risk that its strategic partners do not comply with UPM's Code of Conduct with anti-corruption, competition law, HR practices, human rights, responsible sourcing and environmental matters.\n\nPartnership arrangements may also be too rigid to enable timely changes required, for example, in connection with changes in the market conditions or the economy. UPM's partners may have different targets with respect to the business of the partnerships. As UPM may not have sole control over strategic direction and operational output of these entities, its partners may have the right to make certain decisions on key business matters with which UPM does not agree. In some cases, strategic partners may choose not to continue partnerships that they have with UPM.\n\n## Intellectual property rights of third parties\n\nMolecular bioproducts form one of UPM's three strategic focus areas for growth. Initiatives within this strategic focus area are technologyintensive and require increasing investments in such technologies either through internal development or through third party licences or technological partnerships. In addition to UPM's own IPR portfolio, UPM licences certain technologies developed by third parties. Evaluating the rights related to the third party technologies UPM uses or intends to use is increasingly challenging. Licensing third party technology exposes UPM to such risks as the increase of overall licensing costs, loss of negotiation power, the validity of such licensing arrangements and potential infringement claims, which could restrict UPM's ability to use certain technologies, prevent the delivery of UPM's products and/or result in costly and time-consuming litigation. Risk related to IPR claims and disputes relating to technological partnerships have been assessed to increase.\n\n## Building capabilities to growth areas\n\nThe success of UPM's business largely depends on the ability to build the necessary new capabilities required for future growth. UPM is continuously developing its employee experience, leadership culture, evaluating its recruitment, compensation policies and career development opportunities and taking measures to attract and retain diversely skilled personnel for current and future growth areas.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks are described in consolidated financial statements 2021.\n\n| TYPE OF RISK                                      | CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENT NOTE               |\n|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                                       | 4.6 Working capital                                  |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk Interest rate risk | 5.1 Capital management 6.1 Financial risk management |\n| Foreign exchange risk                             | 6.1 Financial risk management                        |\n| Electricity price risk                            | 6.1 Financial risk management                        |\n| Counterparty risk                                 | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting                 |",

These requirements are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code, latest updates effective as of beginning of 2020.\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct was last updated in 2019, and will be updated in 2022. The preparations for the upcoming update started in 2021.\n\n## Roles of the group management and functions in leading nonfinancial matters\n\nThe Board of Directors, with the assistance of the Audit Committee, is responsible for monitoring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and with the UPM Code of Conduct and other corporate policies. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees procedures for treatment of complaints and concerns received by the company, anonymous or otherwise. As part of the committee's compliance review, the committee is provided with a quarterly report by the company's Chief Compliance Officer, and a report of submissions under the company's Report Misconduct channel by the Head of Internal Audit.\n\nIn line with its main duties and responsibilities, the Board reviewed and approved strategic plans during its strategy session in May 2021. The main focus areas of the UPM Biofore strategy continue to be performance, growth, innovation, responsibility and portfolio development. This strategy is enhanced by the UPM purpose: We create a future beyond fossils (read more on pages 22-23). An essential part of the Board's annual strategy work is to review and assess strategic and operational risks and opportunities (see UPM Governance Statement 2021). These risks and opportunities and their impact on operations and strategy are described on pages 34-35.\n\nThe Board had decided to set environmental, social and governance related (ESG) related measures in the Company's performance share plan (PSP) long-term incentive plan as of January 2022. They decided to set three distinct ESG performance measures and the total weighting of these measures accounted for 20% of all measures.\n\nThe Group Executive Team, headed by the President and CEO, is in charge of the management of corporate responsibility, determining courses of action and guiding development work. In practice, corporate responsibility efforts take place in businesses and functions, and in the group's Responsibility team, which co-ordinates the projects carried out by businesses and functions.\n\nUPM Legal Function and its Compliance team manage legal compliance programmes and arrange related training at regular intervals for specific target groups, which have been defined based on risk assessments. UPM Sourcing organisations follow clearly defined selection and follow-up processes when evaluating suppliers. Reliable long-term deliveries, product and service quality, financial sustainability of suppliers, social and environmental responsibility and product safety are the key factors when selecting and evaluating suppliers.\n\nWhile executing strategies, UPM and its business areas, functions and production units are exposed to a number of financial and nonfinancial risks and opportunities. Each business area, function and unit is responsible for identifying, measuring and managing risks related to its own operations, and for reporting on risk exposures, risk management activities and results to its own management team and to the Risk Management Function.\n\n## Management of non-financial matters\n\nUPM's responsibility thinking starts with anticipating, mitigating and managing risks, and extends to creating a competitive advantage and long-term value.\n\nUPM continually strives to reduce its risk exposure and improve its performance by using tools such as certified management systems. Since 2018, all production sites have a certified ISO 14001 environmental management system. Almost all production sites and wood-sourcing operations implemented integrated management systems for environmental protection, quality management and occupational health and safety in accordance with ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and ISO 45001 standards. All pulp and paper mills in the EU, as well as the UPM Fray Bentos pulp mill in Uruguay and the UPM Changshu paper mill in China, also adhere to the EU's Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS). Many of the sites also have energy management systems certified under ISO 50001 or the Finnish ETJ+ system, and food safety management systems certified under ISO 22000, if relevant.\n\nShould stakeholders have any concerns or suspect misconduct, they are encouraged to contact UPM or to use the UPM Report Misconduct channel. The new service is available on the corporate website for both the company's employees and external stakeholders. Operated by an independent external service provider, the channel is accessible in over 40 languages, 24/7. In 2021, 66 (23) cases were reported either through the UPM Report Misconduct channel or directly to internal audit or compliance team. 9 of these cases related to alleged discrimination or harassment. 18 cases led to disciplinary action including warnings and terminations of employment.\n\n## Reporting framework used\n\nUPM uses the GRI Standards reporting guidelines published by the Global Reporting Initiative to measure and report on corporate responsibility at group level. UPM's corporate responsibility reporting has been compiled in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. UPM also follows the recommendations of  the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) (see page 139).\n\n## Committed to anti-corruption\n\nThe UPM Code of Conduct underlines the company's zero tolerance attitude towards corruption and bribery in any form. UPM AntiCorruption Rules explain prohibited conduct and expected ethical behaviour in further detail.\n\nUPM performs anti-corruption risk assessment on a regular basis. The annual risk-assessment process includes a top-down risk discussion with the management of each business area. All UPM group entities are also assessed on the basis of country risk and complexity of operations. UPM operates globally and has significant manufacturing operations in several emerging market countries. Such operations require a number of permits and other licenses from the relevant authorities. Some of the countries where UPM operates are perceived as highly corrupt or corrupt according to Transparency International. In these countries, there is an increased risk of corruption, for example in relation to interaction with government officials and in the use of intermediaries when applying for permits and licences requiring governmental approval.\n\nDue diligence of suppliers and third parties with whom UPM does business is an essential part of UPM's anti-corruption compliance programme. UPM requires that due diligence is performed before entering into or renewing any contract with a third party that meets specified criteria. UPM requires anti-bribery contract terms to be included in agreements with such third parties outlining the third party's commitment to compliance with applicable anti-bribery laws and UPM's right to audit the third party to verify compliance with these terms. UPM\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n136\n\nalso has corresponding due diligence procedures for joint ventures, including mergers and acquisitions.\n\nUPM has a dedicated anti-corruption e-learning platform. The anticorruption training covers all white-collar employees. In 2021, the company organised tailored anti-corruption training workshops for selected target groups across the company and performed risk-based compliance reviews in selected jurisdictions and operations.\n\n## Respect for human rights\n\nUPM is committed to respect and promote human rights in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. UPM has assessed all its operations and activity and has identified the potential human rights issues and impacts. When considering both the severity and likelihood of these potential issues and impacts, UPM considers the salient human rights issues in the company's sphere of influence to be environmental pollution, occupational health and safety (OHS), working conditions, protection of children, and forced labour.\n\nIn 2021, UPM was announced as one of the leading companies in the SIHTI (Status of Human Rights Performance of Finnish Companies) project initiated by the Government of Finland assessment and research services. In connection, a report of UPM's Human Rights Responsibility was published. UPM reviewed its human rights risks as part of UPM compliance process quarterly. The assessment of salient human rights issues on a business area level as well as the integration of the process to unit specific management systems continued.\n\n## Responsible sourcing\n\nUPM requires its suppliers, third-party intermediaries and joint venture partners to apply the same principles as in the UPM Code of Conduct including commitment to anti-corruption, environmental and social responsibility, safe products, human rights and occupational health and safety practices.\n\nTransparent supplier requirements are the basis for responsible sourcing. These supplier requirements are defined in the UPM Supplier and Third Party Code. A number of additional requirements are in place for the sourcing of wood, chemicals, pulp and packaging materials, as well as for safety and logistics. All contractors working on site go through UPM's safety requirements and a web-based safety induction training.\n\nUPM identifies its supply chains with a high risk of potential negative environmental and social impacts. These responsibility-related risks are determined by the country of origin, sourced material or service, and complexity of supply chain. Based on the risk identification, selected suppliers' activities are evaluated in more detail through EcoVadis and other assessments, supplier audits and joint development plans.\n\nIn 2021, UPM focused on increasing auditing capabilities of its sourcing employees and continued the digital platform implementation. UPM Forest proceeded with their supply chain audit project.\n\nUPM continued its co-operation with Together for Sustainability (TfS), a chemical industry initiative that promotes and improves sustainability practices within the supply chains and its participation to UN Global Compact Action Platform on Decent Work in Global Supply Chains. In 2021, UPM conducted some 340 (290) EcoVadis assessments and 124 (117) supplier audits. In addition, about 300 (350) contractor reviews with focus on working conditions were carried out.\n\n## Social and employee-related matters\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in social and employee-related matters are: learning and development, responsible leadership, diversity and inclusion, fair rewarding as well as safe and healthy working environment.\n\nUPM is committed to active employee participation and consultation, organised in accordance with international and national rules and regulations. After the Finnish Forest Industries Federation resigned from collective bargaining, the terms of employment are agreed between forest products companies and trade unions (see page 65).\n\nUPM aims to empower and engage employees at all levels through responsible leadership. UPM encourages its employees to pursue professional growth, expects development and supports them in learning skills and developing them further.\n\nUPM respects the privacy of employees and promotes equal opportunities and objectivity in employment and career development. In 2021, UPM implemented gender pay equity review process closing the unexplained gender pay gap. All UPM employees are treated as individuals regardless of gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality, etc.\n\nUPM promotes employees' health and wellbeing. Safety is an essential part of UPM's activities and business management system. Equal safety requirements are applied to all employees, visitors and contractors working at UPM's premises.\n\nIn its People Strategy, UPM focused on leadership and to create a safe, inclusive & diverse working environment, as well as aiming higher in performance and ensuring growth of our people. UPM is creating the future by building resilience, developing future ways of working and developing digital capabilities. In 2021, UPM continued the enabling performance approach by strengthening feedback culture, agile goal setting and frequent manager-employee discussions. Development programmes to support growth and performance were continued and implemented virtually. To further develop inclusive leadership and culture, UPM continued the dialogue on diversity and inclusion widely in the organisation.\n\nThe proactive safety of employees and contractors has remained an important focus area in 2021. Safety and wellbeing of our employees during global pandemic has been the key priority.\n\n## Product stewardship\n\nMajority of UPM's products are made from renewable raw materials and are recyclable. UPM products help to mitigate climate change by replacing fossil-based products with bio-based renewable alternatives. Product stewardship covers the entire lifecycle of all UPM products from the development phase to the end-use and beyond.\n\nIn 2021, the new Sustainable Product Design concept was developed further and piloted with few UPM businesses. The approach applies lifecycle thinking and lifecycle assessment data, both integrated in sustainable product design practices. During the process, the whole raw material chain, production and distribution efficiency, sustainable use and circularity are considered.\n\nUPM provides product declarations to provide customers with easy access to information concerning the products' environmental and product safety aspects or the wood origin. Together with a number of paper and chemical companies the exchange of information in the supply chain was improved. This facilitates to pre-assess chemical used and to ensure compliance with legislations and ecolabels.\n\nMost of UPM products are certified with widely recognised ecolabels, such as the EU ecolabel and national ecolabels for graphic paper or ISCC and RSB certification for biofuels, biocomposites and labels. In 2021, UPM Raflatac's label range RAFNXT+ was the world's first CarbonNeutral\u00ae certified label material to help mitigate climate change.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n137\n\nBUSINESSES",

The respective products are designed and produced to meet food packaging requirements.\n\n## Environment\n\nUPM's responsibility focus areas in environmental matters are forests and biodiversity, water, waste and climate. UPM uses raw materials, water, energy and other resources in a responsible manner and continuously improves its energy, resource and cost efficiency.\n\nUPM is committed to sustainable forestry and third-party-verified FSC\u2122 and PEFC chain of custody certification covers all sites using wood raw materials. This ensures that the wood it legally sourced from sustainably managed forests. All UPM owned forests are certified, or in the process of certification if acquired recently.\n\nUPM is continuously working to improve biodiversity in its forests. In 2021, all eight quantitative biodiversity indicators which were developed and are monitored for UPM's forests in Finland showed a positive trend. In Uruguay, UPM implemented a strategy to increase biodiversity in the long-term, and monitors biodiversity with three main indicators. In 2021, we further raised the bar with a new global forest responsibility programme that will be launched in 2022 and reaches until 2030. The new programme covers not only climate and biodiversity targets and commitments but also sustainability criteria related to water, soil and social and economic contribution.\n\nAll of UPM's production plants are located in areas where there is sufficient water available. In 2021, a comprehensive water risk analysis confirmed the earlier results, and provided scenarios for 2030 and 2050. The water used by UPM plants comes from rivers, lakes or groundwater resources. UPM uses water responsibly in terms of the company's water consumption and effluent quality. If the price of raw water were to increase by EUR 0.01 per cubic metre, it would mean additional water costs of approximately EUR 4 million annually. In 2021, wastewater volume decreased by 12% per tonne of paper and remained on the previous year's level per tonne of pulp.\n\nCircular economy thinking is at the core of our operations. We have developed innovative ways to reduce and recover waste and to use side streams, residues and recovered materials. For example, tall oil is used for the production of UPM BioVerno renewable diesel and naphtha and ash is utilised in soil stabilisation, cement industry or as raw material for paper filler production. Regulatory changes may have an impact on the options for waste or residue use, either by restricting the end uses and thus causing higher costs for alternative solutions, or by creating new opportunities. In 2021, 89 (89)% of UPM's process waste was recycled or recovered, of which 21% is energy recovery.\n\nIn 2021, UPM's environmental investments totalled EUR 5 million (6 million). The largest investment was the capacity increase of the electrostatic precipator at UPM Kymi pulp mill's lime kiln to reduce dust emissions. UPM's environmental costs, which were mainly attributable to effluent treatment and waste management, totalled EUR 111 million (110 million), including depreciation.\n\nThe company-wide Clean Run programme, launched in 2012, aims to improve UPM's environmental performance by bringing environmental issues to the forefront of everyday work. All sites systematically follow up any deviations, proactively report observations and near misses, carry out walks and discussions, and compile detailed risk assessments. Despite the global pandemic, approximately 1,400 (1,700) environmental walks were organised and 2,500 (2,700) preventive environmental observations and near misses were reported in 2021.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nUntil 2020 there has been a significant decrease in the number of environmental non-conformances since UPM's internal Clean Run programme was launched in 2012. However, in 2021 the number increased by 8 to a total of 25 (17) temporary deviations from permit, contractual or other obligations. The deviations were minor contraventions of obligations. 12 cases were related to air, 12 to water and one to soil. All deviations were immediately reported to the authorities and, where relevant, to local stakeholders. Appropriate measures were taken to normalise the situation, and will be taken to prevent similar occurrences. No major environmental incidents occurred at UPM production plants in 2021.\n\nAs part of Clean Run development, UPM launched in 2021 a new process to collect, share and improve the implementation of environmental related best practices across our operations. A best practice can be a procedure, instruction, practice or technology, worth sharing with others who could benefit from knowing it and possibly implementing it.\n\n## Climate\n\nThe management of climate change related issues is integrated to management of other non-financial issues and is reported to the Board depending on the context and matter. For example: 1) risks are reported to the Board by CFO, 2) related compliance and regulatory issues are briefed quarterly to Audit Committee (Board) by Compliance Officer, 3) annual progress on 2030 responsibility targets is reported by EVP Stakeholder Relations or 4) if there are specific climate-related topics, then responsible topic owner briefs the Board. Additionally, major climate-related issues such as scenario analyses, commitments and UPM's overall approach of acting through forests, emission reductions in production and supply chain and through climate-positive products are reported directly to UPM management bodies led by CEO.\n\nUPM's position and resilience in different climate scenarios (IPCC RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, IEA B2DS, IEA NPS and IEA CPS) have been evaluated for the businesses and functions from both physical and transitional angles, involving expertise from scientific community. Generally, in low- and medium-emission scenarios the transition impacts play a bigger role and UPM is well positioned as its business portfolio allows for flexibility regarding recognised risks and opportunities. In the high-emission scenario physical impacts dominate with severe consequences not only to UPM but the ecosystems and societies over the globe.\n\nUPM's main target related to climate change is reducing fossil CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 65% from 2015 level by 2030. This target was validated by Science-Based Target initiative to be aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C pathway according to Paris agreement. In 2021, fossil CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) summed up to 5.0 (5.4) million tonnes, which is a decrease of 8% compared to 2020.\n\nFurther targets related to climate change are reducing fossil CO2 emissions from supply chain (Scope 3) by 30% from 2018 level by 2030, climate-positive land use and developing climate-positive product portfolio. Concerning land use, forestry and product portfolio, UPM has engaged with scientific partners in order to gain credible data and approaches.\n\nUPM favours the use of renewable and other carbon-neutral energy sources. Biomass-based fuels make up 70% (72%) of fuels used by UPM worldwide. If UPM needed to buy certificates to cover its whole direct fossil CO2 emissions, and if the price of CO2 certificates were to rise by EUR 10 per tonne, it would mean additional costs of approximately EUR 27 million annually.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n138\n\n## UPM climate related disclosures according to TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) are presented in UPM annual

        "page_content": "## EU Taxonomy\n\nIn 2020, the European Union's Sustainable Finance Classification System (EU Taxonomy Regulation, 2020/852) was published. In 2021, the European Commission adopted the related EU Disclosures Delegated Act, which requires large financial and non-financial companies to provide information to investors about the environmental performance of their assets and economic activities. In annual reports published in 2022, large companies need to start to report the proportion of their economic activities that are considered as Taxonomyeligible. An eligible economic activity is an activity that is included in the scope of delegated acts adopted pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation. In 2023, large companies need to report activities that are considered as Taxonomy-aligned, i.e. which comply with the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities. In the beginning, the focus is on activities contributing to climate objectives, climate change mitigation and adaptation, according to the EU Climate Delegated Act.\n\nBased on the regulation, UPM has carried out an assessment to identify the economic activities which would be eligible i.e. included in the scope of EU Taxonomy. The assessment was carried out with the support of several UPM functions and businesses, and led by UPM's\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nfinance and responsibility teams. EU NACE Classification (Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community) was used as reference in activity identification. In 2022, UPM will continue the assessment with a thorough evaluation of the alignment of activities with the sustainability criteria defined in the regulation.\n\nThe identified eligible activities focus on the climate change mitigation objective. The identified activities are: sustainable forest management, hydropower generation, biofuels and biocomposites businesses, paper production from mostly recycled content, part of renewable energy generation, sales of heat to local communities, part of the ongoing investment in a biochemicals refinery in Germany, some water transportation activities as well as R&D activities towards a future beyond fossils. In addition, water and wastewater related activities have been considered in the assessment. However, as those are not products or services of UPM, thus not directly contributing to UPM turnover, those have not been considered as Taxonomy-eligible activities. UPM's main businesses are not included in the scope of EU Taxonomy.\n\nThe identified eligible activities correspond with following categories of the EU Taxonomy:\n\n|   Activity no | EU Taxonomy activity                                                                           | UPM activity                                                              | Relevant for  turnover   | Relevant for  CapEx   | Relevant for  OpEx   |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|\n|          1.1  | Afforestation                                                                                  | Sustainable forest management                                             | n/a                      | X                     | X                    |\n|          1.3  | Forest management                                                                              | Sustainable forest management                                             | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          3.14 | Manufacture of organic base chemicals                                                          | Part of the current investment in a biochemicals  refinery in Germany     | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          4.5  | Electricity generation from hydropower                                                         | Electricity generation from hydropower                                    | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          4.13 | Manufacture of biogas and biofuels for use in  transport                                       | Biofuels business                                                         | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          4.15 | District heating/cooling distribution                                                          | Sales of heat to local communities                                        | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          4.19 | Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from  renewable non-fossil gaseous and liquid fuels        | Part of renewable energy generation                                       | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          4.2  | Cogeneration of heat/cool and power from  bioenergy                                            | Part of renewable energy generation                                       | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          5.9  | Material recovery from non-hazardous waste                                                     | Paper production from mostly recycled content  and biocomposites business | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          6.1  | Sea and coastal freight water transport, vessels for  port operations and auxiliary activities | Some water transportation activities                                      | X                        | X                     | X                    |\n|          9.1  | Close to market research, development and  innovation                                          | R&D activities towards a future beyond fossils                            | n/a                      | X                     | X                    |\n\nNon-financial undertakings falling under the scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive are required to disclose the KPIs, the turnover, CapEx (capital expenditure) and OpEx (operating expenses) in relation to economic activities which are Taxonomy-eligible as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act as well as such eligibility disclosures in relation to economic activities which are non-eligible under the Taxonomy.\n\nThe eligibility-related financial information to be disclosed pursuant to Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation is presented below.

Costs of day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment include direct salaries of maintenance personnel, maintenance materials and maintenance services outsourced. In addition, as UPM owns a significant amount of forest assets, it considers forest management and support services as day-to-day servicing of assets as defined in EU Disclosures Delegated Act. OpEx is included in consolidated income statement line item Costs and expenses, refer Note 2.3. Operating expenses and other operating income .\n\nResearch and development costs included in Taxonomy-eligible OpEx relate to technologies and products dedicated to the reduction of GHG emissions. These costs include mainly new biochemicals biorefinery and R&D related to the next generation biofuels refinery. Day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment included in Taxonomy-eligible OpEx includes maintenance costs of newsprint paper, hydropower and biofuels production facilities and combined heat power plants. Costs of day-to-day servicing of forest assets included in Taxonomy-eligible OpEx relate to forestry infrastructure maintenance, forest fire fighting, protection and environmental activities whereas forestry renewal costs, e.g., planting, growing of coppice and operation of forest tree nurseries, are included in CapEx.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n141\n\n## Accounting Policy\n\nUPM consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRS as adopted by the EU) and IFRIC Interpretations. UPM has calculated the KPIs using the financial information presented in group consolidated financial statements 2021. The definitions of CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators are based on group interpretation of definitions set out in the Disclosures Delegated Act.\n\n## Turnover\n\nUPM has calculated turnover, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, based on the same accounting principles that apply for revenue in IFRS, i.e., covering all amounts derived from the sale of products and services in the course of ordinary activities. Total turnover corresponds to total sales as reported in group consolidated financial statements. Refer to Accounting policy in consolidated financial statements Note 2.2. Sales . Taxonomy-eligible turnover includes only revenue from sales of products and services generated from activities that are in the scope of the Taxonomy. The majority of UPM's products and services contributing to the turnover are not in the scope of the EU Taxonomy. In determining the eligible turnover any specific fragments of production inputs, such as use of sustainable raw material or energy, have not been included in the eligible turnover if the main activity is not in the scope of the Taxonomy.\n\nUPM's Taxonomy-eligible turnover includes sales of wood and woodbased biomass (logs, pulpwood, forest residues etc.) to third-party customers, forestry services to forestry owners, sales of energy generated from hydropower, sales of wood-based renewable diesel for transport and renewable naphtha for transport and petrochemicals, distribution of district heat, sales of heat and power generated from biomass, gaseous and liquid fuels of renewable origin in combined heat and power plants, sales of biocomposites and sales of newsprint paper from mostly recycled content.\n\n## CapEx\n\nUPM has included in CapEx, as defined in Disclosures Delegated Act, additions to tangible and intangible assets, before any depreciations, impairments, amortisation charges and fair valuations during the financial year, as accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, IAS 38 Intangible assets, IAS 41 Agriculture and IFRS 16 Leases. CapEx corresponds to cash payments to acquire fixed assets in the Consolidated cash flow statement adjusted with amounts accrued but not paid at the end of reporting period, and additions to leased assets. Refer to line items Capital expenditure and Additions to forest assets in Consolidated cash flow statement and Note 5.2. Leases in UPM consolidated financial statements 2021.\n\nTaxonomy-eligible CapEx includes purchased and leased land for afforestation, purchased growing trees, capitalised forestry renewal costs during the growth cycle, part of capitalised investments in new biochemicals refinery, capitalised investments in hydropower plants, capitalised investments in biofuels biorefinery and other capitalised development costs of Taxonomy-eligible activities towards a future beyond fossils. Capital expenditure presented in the UPM Annual report within Other financial information differs from Taxonomy-CapEx as it does not include additions to forest assets and leased assets.",

More information about performance related non-financial topics is available in the general section of the Annual Report and on the UPM website upm.com .\n\n## Research and development\n\n## Innovating for the future\n\nInnovation and R&D programmes are essential in the development of new products and technologies. Research and development expenses cover the development of new technologies, businesses and processes. Our 2030 responsibility targets and our contribution to the UN SDGs are integrated into our R&D activities and product development (page 32).\n\nIn 2021, UPM spent EUR 266 (189) million on research and development, making up 21.3% (18.8%) of UPM's operating cash flow. In addition to direct R&D expenditure of EUR 46 (41) million, the figure includes negative operating cash flow and capital expenditure in developing businesses, transformative business prospects and digitalisation projects.\n\n## Expanding the infrastructure\n\nUPM's Biofore Base research centres in Lappeenranta, Finland and Changshu, China are accelerating the development of new bio-based products and their launch to the markets. The Leuna Biofore Base in Germany was established at the end of the year. It works in connection with the upcoming biochemicals refinery and specialises in developing new biomolecular products.\n\nThe Biofore Base research centres unite UPM's various technologies with globally accumulated experience and expertise in the new and existing businesses. The centres also focus on piloting and analytics enabling seamless collaboration with customers, value chain partners and research organisations such as universities. The research centres work closely with mills, UPM businesses and their research centres in various countries.\n\n## Innovating climate-positive products\n\nOur products offer solutions to mitigating climate change as they replace fossil raw materials with bio-based renewable alternatives. The products store carbon for the entire duration of their lifecycle, especially when recycled multiple times. New solutions are developed in collaboration with our businesses, technology partners and customers.\n\nMolecular bioproducts form one of UPM's three strategic focus areas for growth. Our first-of-its-kind biochemicals biorefinery in Leuna, Germany, will enable a switch from fossil raw materials to wood-based sustainable alternatives in textiles, plastics, PET bottles, packaging and pharma or cosmetics products.\n\nThe commercialisation of biochemicals is taking significant steps forward. In 2021, UPM started a collaboration with The Coca-Cola Company to develop wood-based plastic materials for PET bottles. We also launched UPM BioMotion\u2122 renewable functional fillers to\n\nsignificantly reduce the CO \u2082 footprint and weight of rubber and plastics in various end-uses (page 57).\n\nThe basic engineering phase of a next-generation biofuels biorefinery, announced in January 2021, is proceeding at full speed. The potential biorefinery would produce high-quality renewable fuels, including sustainable jet fuel. The products would significantly reduce the carbon footprint of road transport and aviation, as well as replace fossil raw materials with chemical and plastic alternatives from renewable sources.\n\nUPM Biomedicals develops and supplies innovative and sustainable wood-based biomedical products for high-throughput drug screening, personalised medicine, advanced cell therapies, 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering and advanced wound care.

Our development work in data utilisation focuses on high-quality, compliant, secure and modern common data platforms and services. We use agile methods in defining and implementing new business-driven data and digital solutions together with our partners. As a result, we aim for data products and digital services that have identified business value.\n\nWe finalised our Digi and Data strategy in 2021 based on a solid operating model created in cooperation with businesses. Our target is to achieve greater impact from the digital and data-driven solutions both on a corporate and a business level. The development projects common to several businesses include digital customer experience and pricing, digital supply chain and intelligent operations. The implementation of the strategy and development projects will start in 2022.\n\n## Extensive partner network\n\nOur close-knit global partner network is comprised of customers, universities, research organisations, suppliers and start-up companies. Collaboration speeds up the development and launch of new business solutions.\n\nThe partnership with the European Joint Undertaking on Bio-Based Industries (BBI) focuses on strengthening the competitiveness of biobased products in Europe. As a shareholder in the Finnish company CLIC Innovation Ltd, we aim to propel breakthrough solutions in the circular economy and cleantech. We collaborate with the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) and Renewable Carbon Initiative (RCI) to promote making chemicals more sustainable and more climate smart. UPM Specialty Papers and UPM Raflatac actively collaborate with 4evergreen Alliance, an initiative by CEPI to raise the overall recycling rate of fibre-based packaging to 90% by 2030 (page 88).\n\nUPM wants to be proactive in the developments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, UPM joined the EU's Clean Hydrogen Alliance and became a member of the Roundtable on Clean Hydrogen for industrial users. UPM also joined the newly established Finnish Hydrogen Cluster to accelerate investments in the hydrogen economy.\n\n## Sustainable product design\n\nWe want our products to create value for our stakeholders during the whole product lifecycle. We offer suitable solutions for the customers' sustainability challenges and ensure that the new product or service has a proven sustainability value proposition and supports UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nIn 2021, we further developed our Sustainable Product Design concept, the methodology of which is based on design thinking and aims to steer our product development projects. Our approach applies lifecycle thinking and lifecycle assessment data, both incorporated in sustainable product design practices. We consider product development in six lifecycle steps.\n\nThe process starts with a holistic overview of the design, e. g. what purpose and use is the product developed for and considers all circularity and technology aspects. During the process, the whole raw material chain, production and distribution efficiency, sustainable use and circularity are considered. In 2021, we piloted the new concept with some of our businesses. Testing will continue in 2022 and the new concept will be gradually adopted in all businesses.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## Market demand and customer interest confirmed in UPM Biochemicals\n\nThe EUR 550 million investment will open completely new markets for us, with large growth potential for the future. The biorefinery will produce a range of 100% wood-based biochemicals, the main products being bio-monoethylene glycol (BioMEG), bio-monopropylene glycol (BioMPG) and lignin-based renewable functional fillers, with a total annual capacity of approximately 220,000 tonnes.\n\nThe first-of-its-kind biorefinery in Leuna is taking shape, while a robust business platform is being built and customer engagement points to a promising commercial future for UPM Biochemicals.\n\nIn 2021, detailed engineering, procurement and permit processes continued progressing well, and building at the site took off. However, the pandemic materially slowed down the completion of the detailed engineering. Disruptions to global supply chains affected both the availability and cost of critical construction materials. As a result, the start-up is estimated to take place by end of 2023. The capital expenditure estimate will also be updated.\n\nAt the same time, the business platform was strengthened.We have continued building a team of international experts with a strong chemical industry background to further advance our research and development, build strong commercial operations, and then establish the service and supply infrastructure to meet our customers' specific needs. We also started hiring and training the operations personnel for the biorefinery. The innovative digital twin of our biorefinery supports the establishment of robust production processes and a competent, welltrained team.\n\nUPM's biochemicals made from renewable raw materials will offer a missing link to achieve a truly sustainable circular economy: rubber and plastics based on renewable chemicals. Our glycols and Renewable Functional Fillers (RFF) are made from renewable resources, work well in existing production and recycling processes, and will support the transition away from oil-, gas- and coal-based materials.\n\nWe have made strong progress in opening sales channels in various glycol end-use industries, mainly in packaging, automotive and textile applications.\n\nWe have started joint product development with potential customers in various rubber applications to validate the technical performance of our RFFs and bring sustainable alternatives to CO2-heavy rubbers to the market. We also launched UPM BioMotion\u2122, the renewable functional fillers set to significantly reduce the carbon footprint and weight of rubber and plastic applications.\n\nThe possibilities of our new biochemical products are endless. This was demonstrated by a co-operation announcement with the Coca-Cola Company, who have unveiled their new 100% plant-based recyclable bottle, highlighting UPM's industrial-scale biorefinery as a breakthrough for the production of a new generation of biochemicals that will help produce the sustainable packaging of the future.\n\nOur biorefinery project has also received positive external recognition. We were among the seven finalists of the prestigious German Sustainability Award and our contribution to the sustainability transformation was recognised by the jury. We climbed up to 3rd place in the European Rubber Journal's top 10 elastomers for sustainability ranking.\n\n## Opening new markets for UPM Biomedicals\n\nUPM Biomedicals develops and supplies innovative and sustainable wood-based biomedical products for medical and life science applications. The main component in our products is high-quality nanocellulose, extracted from birch wood.\n\nUPM Biomedicals is at the forefront of innovation and commercialisation, with a particular focus on personalised medicine.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n144\n\nWe actively collaborate with universities, research centres and key industrial partners in the fields of high-throughput drug screening, personalised medicine, advanced cell therapies, 3D bioprinting, tissue engineering and advanced wound care. More than 520 patents and patent applications protect our existing and future products.\n\nIn life science, our main products are GrowDex\u00ae, a range of hydrogels for 3D cell culturing, and GrowDase\u2122, an enzyme to release the cells from the gel. The nanocellulose ensures excellent compatibility with even the most demanding cells, such as stem cells and patientderived cells. Our gels are animal free and do not introduce animal DNA into the test results. In 2021, we entered into a global distribution agreement with PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. for the UPM GrowDex\u00ae and Grow- Dase\u2122 products.\n\nThe collaboration offers researchers a solution for high-throughput screening (HTS) of 3D cell cultures in the early stages of the drug discovery process, combining the cell imaging solutions and knowledge of PerkinElmer and the animal-free 3D reagents of UPM. The instrument, software and cell culture matrices advance research and accelerate the drug development process in which thousands of molecules are screened, to eventually introduce a new drug onto the market.\n\nPerkinElmer's automated high-content screening system using GrowDex hydrogels has been successfully used in a number of research projects, including automated drug sensitivity and resistance testing of patient-derived cells for personalised cancer treatment research.\n\nGrowInk\u2122 is a range of bioinks for 3D bioprinting, used in areas like cancer research, where models of tumours can be printed to test their response to different treatments. Launched in 2021, our collaboration with CELLINK will allow us to develop the technology to print organs or tissue that, in the future, could be transplanted into patients.\n\nIn the clinical field, FibDex\u00ae wound dressings were marketed and sold to healthcare professionals and hospitals in Finland, and work is ongoing to expand into other European markets.\n\n## A year of growth for UPM Biocomposites\n\nUPM ProFi utilises post-consumer plastic waste and post-industrial label waste to manufacture high-quality composite decking. The label production side streams from UPM Raflatac and its customers are collected and delivered to Germany, where the composite decking is manufactured. Recycled plastic from European post-consumer waste is also utilised in the manufacturing process. UPM ProFi's latest product launches in the UPM ProFi Piazza product range consist of up to 75% recycled materials. UPM ProFi is a member of the EU Circular Plastics Alliance, which aims to boost the EU market for recycled plastics to 10 million tonnes by 2025.\n\nUPM Biocomposites is mitigating climate change and creating circular economy solutions through the manufacture of innovative composite materials and decking products.\n\nIn 2021, UPM ProFi achieved significant sales growth across many European markets with its renewed product portfolio. Thanks to its local European operations, operating efficiency and marketing capabilities, it also benefitted from the increase in home renovations during the COVID-19 lockdowns.\n\nUPM Formi creates and manufactures wood-based biocomposites, which enables up to an 80% reduction in the carbon footprint of the end product, compared to similar products made from fossil-based materials. The composite materials are suitable for various end uses, including kitchenware, personal care and acoustic devices. The materials meet the highest quality standards, allowing the products to pass food standards or similar quality requirements.\n\nIn 2021, UPM Formi, in conjunction with key business development partners, experienced volume growth among new and existing customers as a result of new end-use areas. Strong demand for UPM Formi EcoAce continued. UPM Formi's customers were recognised with prestigious awards for using sustainable materials, such as the Red Dot Design Award and the iF Gold Award.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n145",

The Board of Directors proposes that the dividend will be paid on 7 April 2022.\n\nOn the date of the dividend proposal, 27 January 2022, the Company's registered number of shares is 533,735,699. The aforementioned number of shares includes 411,653 treasury shares which are not entitled to dividend. As a result, the proposed dividend would total EUR 693.3 million.\n\nOn 31 December 2021, the distributable funds of the parent company were EUR 3,299,180,167.25 including EUR 469,282,175.70 profit for the period. No material changes have taken place in respect of the Company's financial position after the balance sheet date. In the opinion of the Board Of Directors, the proposed distribution of profits does not risk the solvency of the Company.\n\nSignatures of the annual accounts and the report of the Board of Directors for the year 2021\n\nHelsinki, 27 January 2022\n\n| Bj\u00f6rn Wahlroos Chair   | Berndt Brunow   | Henrik Ehrnrooth   |\n|------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n| Emma FitzGerald        | Jari Gustafsson | Piia-Noora Kauppi  |\n| Marjan Oudeman         | Martin \u00e0 Porta  | Kim Wahl           |\n\nJussi Pesonen President and CEO\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n150\n\n## Financial Statements 2021\n\n| Consolidated income statement and statement of comprehensive income   |   152 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Consolidated balance sheet                                            |   153 |\n| Consolidated statement of changes in equity                           |   154 |\n| Consolidated cash flow statement                                      |   155 |\n| Notes to the consolidated financial statements                        |   157 |\n\n## 1.

Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge, actual results and timing may ultimately differ from previously made estimates.

Risk management related to financial activities is carried out by UPM's central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management, under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Financial risks are described in the relevant notes as described below.\n\n| FINANCIAL RISK                 | NOTE                                 |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Credit risk                    | 4.6 Working capital                  |\n| Liquidity and refinancing risk | 5.1 Capital management               |\n| Interest rate risk             | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Foreign exchange risk          | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Electricity price risk         | 6.1 Financial risk management        |\n| Financial counterparty risk    | 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting |\n\n## Impact of COVID-19 on the financial statements\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on UPM financial statements has so far been relatively limited. The group uses estimates and makes significant judgements when valuating certain assets and liabilities, including energy shareholdings, forest assets, retirement benefit obligations and provisions. The group has assessed the impact of COVID-19 to balance sheet items by considering indicators of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, recoverability of deferred tax assets, valuation of inventories, and collectability of trade receivables. The expectations of future cash flows, discount rates and other significant valuation inputs were revised to reflect changed economic environment. Based on these assessments, no significant adjustments to the carrying amounts of said assets were made due to COVID-19. However, the increased uncertainty in the economic environment can lead to significant adjustments to the carrying amount of assets.\n\nThe group expects that it will continue to operate and meet its liabilities as they fall due. UPM has a strong financial position. Net debt in the balance sheet amounted to EUR 647 million on\n\n31 December 2021. Cash, investment funds, and unused committed credit facilities amounted to EUR 2.5 billion. The facilities and UPM's outstanding debt have no financial covenants.\n\n## 1.3  Consolidation principles\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nUPM's consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the parent company, UPM-Kymmene Corporation, and subsidiaries controlled by UPM. All group entities apply consistently UPM's accounting policies. All intercompany transactions, receivables, liabilities and unrealised profits, as well as intragroup profit distributions, are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset.\n\n## Joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nobligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is a contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nUPM's share in joint operations is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet through recognition of the group's own assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses in the arrangement together with UPM's proportionate share in the joint assets, liabilities and joint income and expenses. The proportionate share of realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions between UPM and its joint operations is eliminated.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are entities over which the group has significant influence but no control. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions without the power to control or jointly control those policies. Joint ventures are joint arrangements where the group has joint control with other parties and the parties have rights to the arrangement's net assets.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost. Associates and joint ventures follow the group accounting policies for consolidation purpose.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe profit or loss attributable to owners of the parent company and noncontrolling interests is presented on the face of the income statement. Non-controlling interests are presented in the consolidated balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent company.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests are treated as transactions with equity owners of the group. For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between consideration paid and the acquired share of the carrying value of the subsidiary's net assets is recorded in equity. Gains or losses of disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity, net of transaction costs.\n\n## 1.4  Foreign currency translation\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction. Receivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date are translated into the functional currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when recognised in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.\n\nUPM records foreign exchange differences relating to ordinary business operations within the appropriate line items above operating profit and those relating to financial items are presented separately as a net amount in finance costs.\n\nIncome and expenses of subsidiaries that have a functional currency different from euro are translated into euros at quarterly average exchange rates. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries are translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date. All resulting translation differences are recognised as a separate component in other comprehensive income. On consolidation, exchange differences arising\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n158\n\nfrom the translation of net investment in foreign operations and other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income. When a foreign entity is partially disposed of, sold or liquidated, translation differences accrued in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale/liquidation.\n\n## 1.5  Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe group has reviewed IFRS standard amendments effective on periods starting 1 January 2021. The amendments effective as of 1 January 2021 did not have any impact on the group's financial statements.\n\n## 2. Business performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2.1  Business areas\n\nUPM business portfolio consist of six competitive businesses with strong market positions. UPM reports financial information for the following business areas (segments): UPM Biorefining, UPM Energy, UPM Raflatac, UPM Specialty Papers, UPM Communication Papers, UPM Plywood and Other operations. UPM has production plants in 12 countries. The group's most important markets are Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nUPM business areas are reported consistently with the internal reporting provided to UPM's President and CEO who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the business areas. Internal reporting is prepared under the same basis as the consolidated accounts. Costs, revenues, assets and liabilities are allocated to business areas on a consistent basis. The sales transactions between business areas are based on market prices, and they are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nComparable ROCE, %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\nComparable EBIT, EURmCapital employed 31 Dec 2021 EUR 13,759 million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther operations 15%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n159",

The group has a portfolio of five businesses that operate on growing markets and one business that faces declining demand. All of UPM businesses are competitive and have strong market positions. Financial target setting, follow up and allocation of resources in the group's performance management process is mainly based on the business area comparable EBIT and comparable ROCE.\n\nUPM presents comparable performance measures to reflect the underlying business performance and to enhance comparability from period to period. However, the comparable performance measures used by management should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with IFRS.

The revenue comprises also sales of energy, biofuels, sawn timber and plywood products and a very limited amount of services not related to sale of goods.\n\nUPM sells a proportion of its products to several major customers. The largest customer in terms of sales represented approximately 2% (2%) of UPM's sales and the ten largest customers represented approximately 15% (14%) of such sales.\n\nThe group disaggregates its external sales by business area, because this depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Sales by UPM business areas are reported consistently with the internal reporting provided to UPM's President and CEO who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the business areas. The goods and services included in sales revenue of each business area are presented in below tables.\n\n- \u00bb Refer Note 2.1 Business areas for information on UPM products.\n\n## External sales by major products\n\n| BUSINESS AREA                    | BUSINESS                                                         | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| EUR million                      |                                                                  |        |        |\n| UPM Biorefining                  | UPM Pulp, UPM Biofuels, UPM Timber                               | 2,289  | 1,720  |\n| UPM Energy                       | UPM Energy                                                       | 290    | 252    |\n| UPM Raflatac                     | UPM Raflatac                                                     | 1,671  | 1,560  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers             | UPM Specialty Papers                                             | 1,275  | 1,148  |\n| UPM Communication Papers         | UPM Communication Papers                                         | 3,536  | 3,296  |\n| UPM Plywood                      | UPM Plywood                                                      | 471    | 385    |\n| Other operations                 | UPM Forest, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals, UPM Biocomposites | 277    | 221    |\n| Eliminations and reconciliations | Eliminations and reconciliations                                 | 5      | -1     |\n| Total                            | Total                                                            | 9,814  | 8,580  |\n\n| BUSINESS                 | PRODUCT RANGE                                                                                             |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| UPM Pulp                 | Softwood, birch and eucalyptus pulp                                                                       |\n| UPM Biofuels             | Wood-based renewable diesel for transport and renewable naphtha for transport and petrochemicals          |\n| UPM Timber               | Standard and special sawn timber                                                                          |\n| UPM Energy               | Electricity and related services                                                                          |\n| UPM Raflatac             | Self-adhesive paper and film label stock                                                                  |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | Labelling materials, release base papers, flexible packaging materials, office papers, graphic papers     |\n| UPM Communication Papers | Graphic papers for various end uses                                                                       |\n| UPM Plywood              | Plywood and veneer products                                                                               |\n| UPM Forest               | Wood and wood-based biomass (logs, pulpwood, chips, forest residues etc.), full forestry service offering |\n| UPM Biochemicals         | Lignin products for industrial use                                                                        |\n| UPM Biomedicals          | Wood-based products for biomedical applications                                                           |\n| UPM Biocomposites        | UPM ProFi decking products and UPM Formi granules                                                         |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n164\n\n## Sales by business area\n\n| EURm                     | 2021   | 2020   | CHANGE   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| UPM Biorefining          | 2,945  | 2,183  | 35  %    |\n| UPM Energy               | 526    | 379    | 39  %    |\n| UPM Raflatac             | 1,671  | 1,560  | 7    %   |\n| UPM Specialty Papers     | 1,482  | 1,324  | 12  %    |\n| UPM Communication Papers | 3,577  | 3,333  | 7    %   |\n| UPM Plywood              | 492    | 405    | 21  %    |\n| Other operations         | 280    | 225    | 25  %    |\n| Eliminations             | -1,157 | -828   | -

Revenue from UPM's product sales is recognised when performance obligation is satisfied, which takes place at point in time when control of the good has been transferred to the customer. In UPM's customer contracts the transfer of control and thus timing of revenue recognition is largely dependent on delivery terms. Group terms of delivery are based on Incoterms 2020, the official rules for interpretation of trade terms issued by the International Chamber of Commerce. Major part of the sales contracts is on delivery terms basis, whereby delivery is not a promised service to the customer, as the control of a good does not transfer to the customer before shipment. Revenue and the corresponding receivable are recorded at the point in time when the product is delivered to the destination point for terms designated Delivered Duty Paid ('DDP') or Delivered at Place ('DAP'). For sales transactions designated free of carriage (FCA), revenue is recorded at the time of shipment. For sales transactions designated as Carriage paid to (CPT) or Carriage and Insurance Paid to (CIP), the portion of revenue relating to goods is recorded at the time of loading and the portion of revenue relating to delivery services over time when the service has been performed.\n\nUPM sells energy to NordPool electricity market. Revenue is recognised when electricity is transmissed over time.\n\n## Sales of services\n\nUPM provides forest expertise and contracting services to woodland and forestry owners and freight services (free space on group's vessels sold as freight services). Revenues from services are recorded over time when the service has been performed. Sales of services is very limited and thus the group does not report it separately.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nThe group recognises revenue as an amount equal to the price specified in the customer contract net of any sales taxes, cash flow hedging results of sales in foreign currency, hedges of energy sales and variable consideration, when applicable. Variable consideration is defined as any variability that may occur between the sales price and the amount UPM expects to receive. The variable consideration includes mainly cash discounts and volume rebates that encourage the customer to take specific volumes in a given timescale. In addition, the group gives the customers the right for purchase price refund in case the products do not\n\nmeet the quality as specified in the agreement. The amount of variable consideration is recognised as a refund liability when some of the amount received is expected to be refunded to the customer. Customer rebates payable to customers in relation to sales made until the end of the reporting period and expected quality claims are estimated using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A refund liability is included in trade and other payables.\n\nReceivables are recognised when the goods are delivered, and the consideration is unconditional except for the passage of time. For most of UPM's customer contracts the period between the transfer of goods or services to customers and the receipt of payment is less than 12 months. For these contracts the group has elected to use the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of financing components.\n\nAdvance payments received from customers are recognised as contract liability. UPM does not have any contract assets arising from contracts with customers.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 4.6 Working capital for information on contract liabilities and refund liabilities.\n\n## 2.3  Operating expenses and other operating income\n\n## Operating expenses\n\nOperating expenses excluding forest assets fair value change, wood harvested and share of results of associates and joint ventures are presented below.\n\n| EURm                                      | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Costs and expenses                        |        |        |\n| Raw materials, consumables and goods      | 5,446  | 4,551  |\n| Employee costs  1)                        | 1,094  | 1,188  |\n| Other operating costs and expenses  2)    | 670    | 852    |\n| Delivery costs and other external charges | 894    | 781    |\n| Total                                     | 8,104  | 7,371  |\n\n- 1) \u00bb Refer Note 3 Employee rewards, for further information.\n\n## 2) Distribution of other operating costs and expense\n\n| EURm                                         |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rents and lease expenses                     |     25 |     15 |\n| Emission expenses  1)                        |   -106 |     10 |\n| Losses on sale of non-current assets         |      0 |      0 |\n| Credit losses                                |     -5 |      9 |\n| Maintenance and other operating expenses  2) |    756 |    818 |\n| Total                                        |    670 |    852 |\n\n- 1) Emission expenses include gains on sales of emission rights EUR 144 (13) million.\n- 2) Other operating expenses include, among others, energy as well as expenses related to services and group's administration.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n165\n\nBUSINESSES",

Capitalised development costs are amortised on a systematic basis over their expected useful lives, usually not exceeding five years.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised at fair value where there is a reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the group will comply with the attached conditions. Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the acquisition cost of the asset and accordingly directly reduce the annual depreciation of the underlying asset. Other government grants are recognised in the income statement in the period necessary to match them with the costs they are intended to compensate.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n166\n\n## Earnings per share\n\n| EURm                                                       | 2021    | 2020    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit attributable to owners of the parent  company, EURm | 1,286   | 560     |\n| Weighted average no. of shares (1,000)                     | 533,324 | 533,324 |\n| Basic earnings per share, EUR                              | 2.41    | 1.05    |\n| Diluted earnings per share, EUR                            | 2.41    | 1.05    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is the amount of profit for the period attributable to each ordinary share. The basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period plus the dilutive effect of share options. The group did not have shareoption schemes at the end of 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Dividend\n\nDividend distribution to the owners of the parent company is recognised as a liability in the group's consolidated financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the parent company's shareholders.\n\nEarnings and dividend per share\n\nR\n\nEU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n167\n\n## Other operating income\n\nOther operating income mainly includes gains on the disposal of noncurrent assets and rental income. Further, other operating income includes foreign exchange gains and losses in respect of UPM's normal business activities. Gains and losses on derivatives not qualifying hedge accounting are also recognised in other operating income.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nThe group participates in the European Emissions Trading Scheme aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Emission rights received from governments free of charge to emit a fixed tonnage of carbon dioxide in a fixed period of time give rise to an intangible asset for the emission rights, a government grant and a liability for the obligation to deliver emission rights equal to the emissions that have been made during the compliance period.\n\nEmission rights are initially recognised as intangible assets based on market value at the date of initial recognition. Emission rights are not amortised. If the market price of emissions rights at the balance sheet date is less than the recognised costs, any surplus emission rights that are not required to cover actual and estimated emissions during the financial year, are impaired to the market price.\n\nGovernment grants are recognised as deferred income in the balance sheet at the same time as emission rights and are recognised in other operating income in the income statement, systematically, over the compliance period to which the corresponding emission rights relate.\n\nThe liability to deliver emission rights is recognised based on actual emissions. The emissions realised are expensed under other operating costs and expenses in the income statement and presented as a provision in the balance sheet. The liability is settled using emission rights on hand, measured at the carrying amount of those emission rights. Emission rights and associated provisions are derecognised when disposed. Any profit or loss represents the costs of purchasing additional rights to cover excess emissions, the sale of unused rights in the case realised emission are under emission rights received free of charge or the impairment of unused emission rights.\n\n## 2.4  Earnings per share and dividend\n\nAccording to UPM dividend policy, the company aims to pay an attractive dividend amounting to 30-40% of the group annual operating cash flow per share.\n\nThe dividend paid in 2021 were EUR 693 million (EUR 1.30 per share) which is 69% of the operating cash flow per share and in 2020 EUR 693 million (EUR 1.30 per share). The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 693 million, EUR 1.30 per share, will be paid in respect of 2021. The proposed dividend represents 55% of UPM's operating cash flow per share for the year 2021.",

The amount of the incentive is linked to the executive's position and achievement of annually set targets. The maximum incentives amount to a total of 100% of the annual base salary to the Business Area Executives and to a total of 70% of annual base salary to the other members of the Group Executive Team. For the President and CEO, the maximum annual incentive amounts to 150% of the annual base salary.\n\nThe expenses recognised in income statement in respect of sharebased payments for the Group Executive Team were EUR 3.8 million (3.4 million).\n\nAccording to the service agreement, the President and CEO would have been entitled to retire in November 2020 at the age of 60 but at the request of the company's Board of Directors, the President and CEO has decided to continue in his position.\n\nThe President and CEO has a voluntary pension benefit in addition to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The President and CEO's\n\n## 3.3  Share-based payments\n\nUPM offers rewards and recognition with an emphasis on high performance. All UPM's employees belong to a unified annual Short Term Incentive (STI) scheme. In addition, UPM has two long-term incentive schemes: the Performance Share Plan (PSP) for senior executives and the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) for other key employees.\n\nvoluntary pension benefit was arranged through a defined benefit plan until the end of November 2020. The last contribution to the defined benefit plan was made in 2020. Under the defined benefit plan, the target pension was 60% of the average indexed earnings from the last ten full calendar years of employment calculated according to the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The income of the President and CEO's defined benefit pension plan in 2021 was EUR 1.3 million (1.6 million in 2020). The plan assets amounted to EUR 15.0 million (17.3 million) and the obligation amounted to EUR 12.8 million (14.9 million).\n\nAs of December 2020, the voluntary pension benefit is arranged through a defined contribution plan. First contribution to the defined contribution plan took place in 2021.\n\nThe retirement age of other members of the Group Executive Team is 63. Other Group Executive Team members are under defined contribution plans.\n\nShould the company or the President and CEO give notice of termination of the service agreement, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the 12-month notice period. For GET members, the period for severance pay is 12 months, in addition to the six months' salary for the notice period, unless notice is given for reasons that are solely attributable to the executive. Should a GET member give notice of termination to the company, no severance pay will be paid in addition to the salary for the notice period.\n\nIf there is a change of control in the company, the President and CEO may terminate his service agreement within three months and each GET member within one month from closing the takeover and shall receive compensation equivalent to 24 months' base salary.\n\n## Performance Share Plan\n\nThe Performance Share Plan (PSP) is targeted at the President and CEO and other Group Executive Team (GET) members as well as other selected members of the management. Under the ongoing plans UPM shares are awarded based on total shareholder return during a threeyear earning period. The earned shares are delivered after the earning period has ended. Total shareholder return takes into account share price appreciation and paid dividends.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n169\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n168",

The group classifies the transactions with net settlement features for tax obligations as equity-settled in its entirety. Shares are valued using the market rate on the grant date. The settlement is a combination of shares and cash. The group may obtain the necessary shares by using its treasury shares or may purchase shares from the market. PSP and DBP share deliveries are executed by using already existing shares and the plans, therefore, have no dilutive effect.\n\n## 3.4  Retirement benefit obligations\n\nThe group operates various pension schemes in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries of operations. Retirement benefits are employee benefits that are payable usually after the termination of employment, such as pensions and post-employment medical care.\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\nThe pension plans are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or to trustee-administered funds or foundations and classified as defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans.\n\nDefined benefit assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet are presented below:\n\n| EURm                                                       | FINLAND   | UK GERMANY   |     | OTHER  COUN- TRIES   | TOTAL FINLAND   | TOTAL FINLAND   | UK GERMANY   |     | OTHER  COUN- TRIES   | TOTAL 1,180   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|--------------|-----|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|-----|----------------------|---------------|\n| Present value of funded obligations                        | 577       | 542          | 39  | 15                   | 1,174           | 581             | 539          | 43  | 16                   |               |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                  | -632      | -565         | -2  | -15                  | -1,214          | -606            | -515         | -3  | -16                  | -1,140        |\n| Deficit (+)/surplus (-)                                    | -55       | -23          | 36  | -                    | -40             | -25             | 24           | 40  | -                    | 39            |\n| Present value of unfunded  obligations                     | -         | -            | 548 | 68                   | 616             | -               | -            | 606 | 74                   | 679           |\n| Net defined benefit liability (+)/ asset (-)               | -55       | -23          | 585 | 68                   | 576             | -25             | 24           | 646 | 74                   | 719           |\n| Net retirement benefit asset in the  balance sheet         | -56       | -23          | -   | -                    | -79             | -26             | -            | -   | -                    | -26           |\n| Net retirement benefit liability in the  balance sheet  1) | 2         | -            | 585 | 68                   | 655             | 1               | 24           | 646 | 74                   | 745           |\n\nAbout 95% of the group's defined benefit arrangements exist in Finland, in the UK and in Germany. The group has defined benefit obligations also in Austria, Holland, France, Canada and in the US. Approximately a quarter of UPM's employees are active members of defined benefit arrangement plans.\n\n## Finland\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). TyEL provides the employee with insurance protection for old age, disability and death. The benefits can be insured with an insurance company or the employer can establish a fund or a foundation to manage the statutory benefits.\n\nApproximately 79% (81%) of group's Finnish employees are insured with an insurance company and these arrangements qualify as defined contribution plans. Approximately 21% (19%) of employees are insured with TyEL foundation (UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6). The TyEL foundation is administered by the representatives of both the employer and the employees. The foundation has named an authorised representative to take care of its regular operations. The plan is supervised by Financial Supervisory Authority. The foundation is\n\nclassified as a defined benefit plan for the benefits that must be funded nationally and is the most significant defined benefit pension plan in Finland for UPM.\n\n## UK\n\nIn the UK, the group operates a legacy defined benefit scheme providing benefits that are linked to the salary level near retirement age or an earlier date of leaving service. The scheme is closed both for new members and future accrual for old members. Part of the scheme is a defined contribution plan and is open to all current employees. The UK pension scheme operates under a single trust which is independent from the group.\n\n## Germany\n\nIn Germany employees within defined benefit arrangements are entitled to annual pensions on retirement based on their service and final salary. All significant defined benefit plans are closed for new employees.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n171\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n170",

The asset values of these arrangements constitute 99% of total asset values in defined benefit plans within group.\n\n## Interest risk\n\nDiscount rates used in calculations are based on high-quality corporate bond yield curves in currency in which the benefits are paid. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan liabilities. The maturities of yields are reflecting the durations of the underlying obligations. The weighted average duration of group's defined benefit obligation is 18 years (17 years) at the end of 2021.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nIn the Finnish plan, the inflation risk is not significant as changes in the inflation assumption are mainly covered by the TyEL pooling system. In the UK, the pensions in payment are tied to Retail Price Index whilst being tied to Consumer Price Index during deferment. An increase of 0.5% in indexes will increase the liabilities by some EUR 39 million. In Germany the pensions have to be adjusted in accordance with the Consumer Price Index.\n\nchanging market and economic conditions, or changes in service period of plan participants. Significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may affect the future amounts of the defined benefit obligation and future expense.\n\n## Salary risk\n\nThe present value of the net retirement benefit assets and liabilities is calculated by reference to the expected future salaries of plan participants. An increase in the salary of the plan participants would increase the plan liabilities. In Finland, the salary risk is minor as well as in the UK, where the changes in salary levels have no impact on the funding position as all defined benefit arrangements in the UK are closed to future accrual. In Germany, an increase of 0.5% in expected future salaries would increase the obligation by EUR 11 million.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nAdjustments in mortality assumption have an impact on group's defined benefit obligation. An increase in life expectancy by one year will increase the obligation in Finland by EUR 25 million, in the UK by EUR 26 million and in Germany by EUR 26 million.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n172\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nSeveral actuarial assumptions are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the defined benefit plans.

The defined benefit obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the term of the related pension liability. The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets. The cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement as employee costs so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees. Changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments are charged or credited in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs and gains or losses on settlement are recognised immediately in income when they occur.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, contributions are paid to pension insurance companies. Once the contributions have been paid, there are no further payment obligations. Contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.\n\n## Other post-employment obligations\n\nSome group companies provide post-employment medical and other benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to healthcare benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans. Valuations of these obligations are carried out by independent qualified actuaries.\n\n## 4.

UPM aims to capture growth opportunities in its existing business portfolio and invest in projects with attractive and sustainable returns.\n\n## Capital employed\n\n|                                               | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Property, plant and equipment                 | 5,569  | 4,316  |\n| Leased assets                                 | 608    | 561    |\n| Forest assets                                 | 2,328  | 2,077  |\n| Energy shareholdings                          | 2,579  | 1,936  |\n| Goodwill and other intangible assets          | 603    | 592    |\n| Operating working capital                     | 1,204  | 1,247  |\n| Provisions                                    | -155   | -222   |\n| Net retirement benefit assets and liabilities | -597   | -744   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                     | 1,460  | 1,720  |\n| Other assets and liabilities                  | 290    | 215    |\n| Net deferred tax assets and liabilities       | -130   | -143   |\n| Total                                         | 13,759 | 11,555 |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n174\n\n## 4.1  Property, plant and equipment\n\n| EURm                                      | LAND AND  WATER  AREAS   | BUILDINGS   | MACHINERY  AND  EQUIPMENT   | OTHER  TANGIBLE  ASSETS   | CONSTRUC- TION IN  PROGRESS   | TOTAL   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|---------|\n| 2021                                      |                          |             |                             |                           |                               |         |\n| Accumulated costs                         | 859                      | 3,452       | 13,136                      | 834                       | 2,069                         | 20,349  |\n| Accumulated depreciation and impairments  | -2                       | -2,604      | -11,462                     | -712                      | -

The investment will be completed by the end of 2022.\n\nIn July 2019 UPM announced that it would invest USD 2.7 billion in a 2.1 million tonne greenfield eucalyptus pulp mill near Paso de los Toros in central Uruguay. Additionally, UPM will invest approximately USD 280 million in port operations in Montevideo and USD 70 million in local investments outside the mill fence, including a new residential area in Paso de los Toros. The start-up schedule has been updated to take place by the end of Q1 2023, and the total investment estimate has been increased to USD 3.47 billion\n\nIn October 2019 UPM announced that it would invest EUR 95 million in a Combined-Heat-Power (CHP) plant at the UPM Nordland paper mill in Germany. The plant is planned to go on grid in Q3 2022. The annual cost savings of more than EUR 10 million will start as of 2023. The investment is estimated to decrease UPM's CO2-footprint by 300,000 tonnes.\n\n## Capitalised borrowing costs\n\nIn 2021, the borrowing costs capitalised as part of non-current assets amounted to EUR 9 million (4 million). Amortisation of capitalised borrowing costs was EUR 2 million (3 million) and the average interest rate used 0.73% (1.31%), which represents the average costs to finance the projects. In 2021, capitalised borrowing costs were mainly related to the construction of the new pulp mill in Uruguay.\n\n## Government grants\n\nIn 2021, government grants recognised as deduction of non-current assets totalled to EUR 0 million (5 million).\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n175\n\nBUSINESSES",

The costs of pulp, recycled fibre, logistics and energy increased significantly in 2021 and high production costs continue to challenge the operations in the foreseeable future. Fair value less cost to sell method was used in the calculation with an inflation rate of 2.0%, negative sales growth rate of 5.4% in real terms, and a post-tax discount rate of 6.7%. As a result of the test calculation, UPM recognised impairment charges of EUR 50 million related to newsprint property, plant and equipment.\n\nIn June 2020, UPM announced the plan that it has started a consultation process for the potential closure of the UPM Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 plywood mill in Finland. With the plan to permanently close the mill, UPM recognised impairment charges of EUR 8 million in the Plywood business area.\n\nIn August 2020, UPM announced the plans for the permanent closure of the UPM Kaipola paper mill in Finland. The mill was permanently closed in early January 2021. With the permanent closure of the mill, UPM recognised impairment charges of EUR 53 million in the Communication Papers business area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost. Costs of assets of acquired in business combinations are determined at fair value at the acquisition date. Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis and the carrying value is adjusted for impairment charges, if any. The carrying value of property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet represents the cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment charges.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use. Other borrowing costs are expensed.\n\nMajor renovations are capitalised and depreciated over the useful lives of the related asset. Ordinary expenses for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nGains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in other operating income and other operating expenses, respectively.\n\n| ASSESSED USEFUL LIVES             | NUMBER OF YEARS   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Land, not subject to depreciation | -                 |\n| Buildings                         | 20-50             |\n| Power plants                      | 20-30             |\n| Heavy machinery                   | 15-20             |\n| Light machinery                   | 10-15             |\n| Equipment                         | 5                 |\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nCarrying values of individual items included in property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each closing date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. The carrying value is written down immediately to the asset's recoverable amount if the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amount. Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Value in use is determined by discounting future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).\n\nNon-financial assets, other than goodwill, that have suffered impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date. Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but the increased carrying amount will not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe estimations of useful lives, residual value as well as depreciation and amortisation methods require significant management judgement and are reviewed annually. Management makes estimates on the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal. While management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect valuations.\n\nThe long useful lives of assets, changes in estimated future sales prices of products, changes in product costs and changes in the discount rates used could lead to significant impairment charges.\n\nEstimates are also made in an acquisition when determining the fair values and remaining useful lives of acquired intangible and tangible assets.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n176\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation\n\nThe valuation process of forest assets is complex and requires management estimates and judgement on assumptions that have a significant impact on the valuation of the group's forest assets.\n\nMain factors used in the fair valuation of forest assets are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates. Stumpage price forecasts are based on the current prices adjusted by the management's estimates for the full remaining productive lives of the trees, up to 100 years for forests in Finland and in the US and up to 10 years for plantations in Uruguay. The cash flows are adjusted by selling costs and costs related to future risks. Felling revenues and maintenance costs are estimated on the basis of actual costs and prices, taking into account the group's projection of future price and costs development. In addition, calculations take into account future forest growth and environmental restrictions.\n\nThe pre-tax discount rate used to determine the fair value of the Finnish forests in 2021 was 7.0% (7.0%) and for Uruguayan plantations 9.9% (9.9%). A decrease (increase) of one percentage point in discount rate would increase (decrease) the fair value of forest assets by approximately EUR 270 million (260 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.3 Energy shareholdings\n\nUPM is both a significant purchaser and producer of energy. The majority of electrical and thermal energy is consumed at the group's pulp and paper production. The production is mainly carried out by energy companies in which UPM has energy shareholdings. Energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments. UPM does not have control or joint control of or significant influence in the said energy companies.\n\nThe value of energy shareholdings amounted to EUR 2,579 million (1,936 million) at the end of 2021. These energy companies supply energy or both energy and heat to their shareholders on a cost-price principle (Mankala-principle) which is widely applied in the Finnish energy industry. Under the Mankala-principle energy and/or heat is supplied to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership and each shareholder is, pursuant to the specific stipulations of the respective articles of association, severally responsible for its respective share of the production costs of the energy company concerned.\n\nIn 2020, UPM issued a shareholder loan of EUR 47 million without a maturity date to PVO. Embedded into the loan terms is a right to issue new shares in the PVO B2 series against the remaining, unpaid nominal of the loan starting from 2021. The loan is valued at fair value and is taken into account as a part of the total fair valuation of the PVO B2 series valuation. In addition, in 2020 UPM issued a similar loan commitment of EUR 123 million to PVO, where also a right to issue new PVO B2 shares is embedded starting from 2023.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n177\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2  Forest assets\n\nUPM is both a major forest owner and a purchaser of wood. The value of forest assets, i.e. standing trees, amounted to EUR 2,328 million (2,077 million) at the end of 2021. UPM's own and leased forest land areas are summarised in below table.\n\n|                              | PRO-    | PRO-            | PRO-     |\n|------------------------------|---------|-----------------|----------|\n|                              | FOREST  | DUCTIVE  FOREST | FORESTED |\n| 1,000 ha                     | LAND    | LAND            | LAND     |\n| Finland                      | 515     | 426             | 420      |\n| Uruguay Uruguay, leased land | 305 161 | 182 130         | 173 124  |\n| United States                | 76      | 55              | 55       |\n| Total                        | 1,057   | 793             | 772      |\n\nAt the end of 2021, carrying value of own forest land amounted to EUR 694 million (EUR 594 million) and leased forest land EUR 219 million (EUR 183 million).\n\n## Forest assets\n\n| EURm                           | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January   | 2,077  | 2,097  |\n| Additions                      | 104    | 53     |\n| Disposals                      | -6     | -      |\n| Wood harvested                 | -98    | -129   |\n| Net change in fair value       | 206    | 100    |\n| Translation differences        | 44     | -45    |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December | 2,328  | 2,077  |\n\nChange in fair value, change due to harvesting and gains or losses on sale of forest assets are recognised in the income statement as a net amount amounting to EUR 111 million (-25 million) in 2021. In 2021, the increase in fair value was impacted by increased forest growth and higher stumpage price estimates used in valuation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group divides all its forest assets for accounting purposes into growing forests, which are recognised as forest assets at fair value less costs to sell, and land. Own land is stated at cost whereas leased land is valued at cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nAny changes in the fair value of the growing forests are recognised in the operating profit in the income statement. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows as there is a lack of a liquid market. The fair value of forest assets is a level 3 measure in terms of the fair value measurement hierarchy.",

The B and B2 series relate to PVO's shareholdings in Teollisuuden Voima Oyj (TVO). UPM has no direct shareholdings in TVO. TVO operates two nuclear power plants (Olkiluoto 1 and Olkiluoto 2) and is constructing one new nuclear power plant in Olkiluoto (Olkiluoto 3), Finland. The operation of a nuclear power plant is governed by international, European Union and local nuclear regulatory regimes. Pursuant to the Finnish Nuclear Liability Act, the operator of a nuclear facility has a strict third-party liability in relation to nuclear accidents. Shareholders of power companies that own and operate nuclear power plants are not subject to the liability under the Nuclear Liability Act. In Finland, the future costs of conditioning, storage and final disposal of spent fuel, management of low and intermediate level radioactive waste as well as nuclear power plant decommissioning are provided for by a state established fund (the Finnish State Nuclear Waste Management Fund). The contributions to the Fund are intended to be sufficient to cover estimated future costs. These contributions have been taken into consideration in the fair value of the related energy shareholdings.\n\n## Changes in energy shareholdings\n\n| EURm                                                            | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                                    | 1,936  | 2,145  |\n| Disposals                                                       | -1     | -2     |\n| Changes in fair value recognised in other  comprehensive income | 643    | -207   |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                                  | 2,579  | 1,936  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group has made an irrevocable election to designate its energy shareholdings as equity instruments where changes in fair value are recognised through OCI. The shareholdings are not held for trading as the group has an intention to hold the investments for the long term. Purchases of energy shareholdings are initially and subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable, with only dividend income recognised through profit and loss. Initial fair value is acquisition cost including transaction costs. Upon disposal of the investment, the accumulated fair value changes in equity are not recycled to the income statement but instead, are reclassified from the fair value reserve to retained earnings.\n\nThe fair value of energy shareholdings is a level 3 measure in the fair value measurement hierarchy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Fair valuation and sensitivity\n\nValuation of energy shareholdings requires management's assumptions and estimates of a number of factors that may differ from the actual outcome which could lead to significant adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset. Fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis and the main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends and discount rates.\n\nThe electricity price estimate is based on a simulation of the Finnish area electricity price. A change of 5% in the electricity price used in the model would change the total value of the assets by EUR 370 million. The discount rate of 5.08% used in the valuation model is determined using the weighted average cost of capital method. A change of 0.5% percentage points in the discount rate would change the estimated fair value of the assets by approximately EUR 330 million.\n\nOther uncertainties and risk factors in the value of the assets relate to start-up schedule of the fixed price turn-key Olkiluoto 3 EPR nuclear power plant project. UPM's indirect share of the capacity of Olkiluoto 3 EPR is approximately 31%, through its PVO B2 shares. Changes in regulatory environment or taxation could also have an impact on the value of the energy generating assets.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n178\n\n## 4.4  Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nThe group's goodwill mainly relates to pulp operations in Finland and Uruguay belonging to UPM Biorefining business area.\n\n## Goodwill by business area 2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Goodwill by business area\n\n| EURm                    |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Pulp operations Uruguay |    102 |     94 |\n| Pulp operations Finland |    113 |    113 |\n| UPM Raflatac            |      7 |      7 |\n| UPM Plywood             |     13 |     13 |\n| Other operations        |      1 |      1 |\n| Total                   |    237 |    229 |\n\n## Goodwill\n\n| EURm                           |   2021 |   2020 |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January   |    229 |    238 |\n| Translation differences        |      8 |     -9 |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December |    237 |    229 |\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\n| EURm                                                     | INTANGIBLE RIGHTS   | SOFTWARE AND  OTHER INTANGIBLE  ASSETS   | TOTAL   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|---------|\n| 2021                                                     |                     |                                          |         |\n| Accumulated costs                                        | 477                 | 541                                      | 1,018   |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairments                 | -279                | -477                                     | -756    |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                           | 198                 | 64                                       | 262     |\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                             | 199                 | 69                                       | 267     |\n| Additions                                                | 3                   | 13                                       | 15      |\n| Amortisation                                             | -3                  | -18                                      | -21     |\n| Reclassifications                                        | -                   | 1                                        | 1       |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                           | 198                 | 64                                       | 262     |\n| Emission rights, carrying value  1)                      |                     |                                          | 104     |\n| Carrying value including emission rights, at 31 December |                     |                                          | 366     |\n| 2020                                                     |                     |                                          |         |\n| Accumulated costs                                        | 471                 | 665                                      | 1,136   |\n| Accumulated amortisation and impairments                 | -272                | -596                                     | -868    |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                           | 199                 | 69                                       | 267     |\n| Carrying value, at 1 January                             | 199                 | 47                                       | 246     |\n| Additions                                                | 3                   | 34                                       | 37      |\n| Amortisation                                             | -4                  | -12                                      | -16     |\n| Reclassifications                                        | -                   | 1                                        | 1       |\n| Carrying value, at 31 December                           | 199                 | 69                                       | 267     |\n| Emission rights, carrying value  1)                      |                     |                                          | 95      |\n| Carrying value including emission rights, at 31 December |                     |                                          | 363     |\n\n- 1) \u00bb Refer Note 2.3 Operating expenses and other operating income, for further information on emission rights.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n179",

        "page_content": "## Impairment testing\n\nImpairment tests for goodwill and water rights with indefinite life were carried out in the fourth quarter 2021.\n\nWater rights of hydropower plants belonging to UPM Energy and reported in intangible rights amounted EUR 189 million at the end of 2021 and 2020. The values of water rights were tested based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydro power plant.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nGoodwill impairment tests were carried out for pulp operations in Finland and Uruguay, belonging to UPM Biorefining business area, UPM Raflatac business area and UPM Plywood business area.\n\nThe 2021 impairment tests did not result in a recognition of any impairment.\n\nThe basis for valuation and key assumptions used in goodwill impairment testing are summarised in below table:\n\n| CASH GENERATING UNIT    | BASIS OF  VALUATION   | PERIOD OF FORECAST        | PRE-TAX DISCOUNT RATE   | KEY ASSUMPTIONS                  |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Pulp operations Finland | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 9.41 % (2020: 7.84 %)   | Pulp price, wood costs           |\n| Pulp operations Uruguay | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 7.50 % (2020: 7.84 %)   | Pulp price, wood costs           |\n| UPM Raflatac            | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 8.22 % (2020: 7.60 %)   | Product prices, cost development |\n| UPM Plywood             | Value in use          | 10 years + terminal value | 13.01 % (2020: 13.04 %) | Product prices, cost development |\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nThe sensitivity analyses of goodwill impairment tests indicate that no reasonable change in key assumptions would result in recognition of impairment loss against goodwill. In pulp operations the recoverable amount is most sensitive to pulp sales prices and the cost of wood raw material.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\nThe group's assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life assets requires significant judgement.\n\nWhile management believes that estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and operational conditions. Actual cash flows could therefore vary from estimated discounted future cash flows and could result in changes in the recognition of impairment charges in future periods.\n\n## Future cash flows\n\nThe review of recoverable amount for goodwill and indefinite life assets is based on a calculation of value in use, using management projections of future cash flows. The most important assessments and assumptions needed in calculations are forecasts for future growth rates for the business in question, product prices, cost development and the discount rates applied. The group is using ten-year forecasts in calculations as the nature of the group's business is long-term, due to its capital intensity, and is exposed to cyclical changes. In estimates of product prices and cost development, forecasts prepared by management for the next three years and estimates made for the following seven years are taken into consideration. In addition, consideration is given to the investment decisions made by the group as well as the profitability programmes that the group has implemented and the views of knowledgeable industry experts on the long-term development of demand and prices. In the projection of cash flows UPM uses EBITDA adjusted with cash flows not captured within EBITDA, including working capital movements and capital expenditures.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nThe discount rate is estimated using the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) on the calculation date adjusted for risks specific to the business in question. The adjusted after-tax discount rate is translated to a pre-tax rate for each cash generating unit (CGU) based on the specific tax rate applicable to where the CGU operates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises in connection with business combinations where the consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the acquired net assets. Goodwill is recognised at cost less accumulated impairment and is an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies from the business combination.\n\n## Intangible rights\n\nIntangible rights include water rights of hydropower plants, patents, licences, intellectual property and similar rights. Water rights are deemed to have an indefinite useful life as the company has a contractual right to exploit water resources in the energy production of power plants.\n\nThe values of water rights are tested annually for impairment based on expected future cash flows of each separate hydropower plant. Other intangible rights are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 10 years.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs incurred in acquiring software that will contribute to future period financial benefit are capitalised to software and systems. Other intangible assets are recognised at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 5 years.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n180\n\nexceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised. Impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to other assets of the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nOther intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are impaired if the recoverable amount of the asset is less than the carrying amount. The carrying amount of the asset is then reduced to the recoverable amount which is the higher of the asset's net selling price and its value in use.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are tested at least annually for impairment. For goodwill impairment testing purposes the group identifies its cash-generating units (CGUs), which is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or other groups of assets. Each CGU is no larger than a business area. The carrying amount for the CGU includes goodwill, non-current assets and working capital. If the balance sheet carrying amount of the CGU unit\n\n## 4.5  Provisions\n\n| EURm                                | RESTRUCTURING   | TERMINATION   | ENVIRON- MENTAL   | EMISSIONS   | OTHER   | TOTAL   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| 2021                                |                 |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 52              | 91            | 29                | 21          | 28      | 222     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 5               | 6             | 2                 | 41          | 11      | 64      |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -22             | -53           | -1                | -21         | -10     | -107    |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -11             | -8            | -1                | -2          | -2      | -25     |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 24              | 36            | 30                | 39          | 26      | 155     |\n| Non-current                         |                 |               |                   |             |         | 68      |\n| Current                             |                 |               |                   |             |         | 88      |\n| Total                               |                 |               |                   |             |         | 155     |\n| 2020                                |                 |               |                   |             |         |         |\n| Provisions at 1 January             | 30              | 36            | 20                | 18          | 41      | 144     |\n| Provisions made during the year     | 43              | 96            | 7                 | 23          | 3       | 173     |\n| Provisions utilised during the year | -11             | -33           | -1                | -19         | -9      | -73     |\n| Unused provisions reversed          | -6              | -7            | -                 | -1          | -7      | -21     |\n| Reclassifications                   | -4              | -             | 4                 | -           | -       | -       |\n| Provisions at 31 December           | 52              | 91            | 29                | 21          | 28      | 222     |\n| Non-current                         |                 |               |                   |             |         | 100     |\n| Current                             |                 |               |                   |             |         | 122     |\n| Total                               |                 |               |                   |             |         | 222     |\n\nUPM has undergone several restructuring in recent years including mill closures and profit improvement programs. Restructuring provisions recognised include various restructuring activities including dismantling costs. Termination provisions include severance payments, unemployment compensations or other arrangements for employees leaving the company. In Finland termination provisions include also unemployment arrangements and disability pensions. Unemployment provisions in Finland are recognised 2-3 years before the granting and settlement of the compensation.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 and 2020, restructuring and termination provisions relate mainly to capacity closures and optimisation of operations in UPM Communication Papers business area. In 2021, there were no significant additions to restructuring and termination provisions. In 2020, additions to restructuring and termination provisions of EUR 106 million related to closure of UPM Chapelle paper mill and UPM Kaipola paper mill. In addition, termination provision made in 2020 related to restructuring of business functions of UPM Communication Papers and UPM Raflatac amounting to EUR 14 million. In UPM Plywood business Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 plywood mill was closed in 2020 and EUR 12 million restructuring and termination provision recognised.\n\nThe group recognises provisions for normal environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred in a future period upon a\n\nremoval of non-current assets and restoring industrial landfills where a legal or constructive obligation exists.\n\nOther provisions are mainly attributable to onerous contracts and will be incurred over a period longer than one year.\n\nProvisions for emissions include liability to cover the obligation to return emission rights. The group possesses emission rights amounting to EUR 104 million (95 million) as intangible assets.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 2.3 Operating expenses and other operating income, for further information on emission rights.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n181",

Provisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\n## Restructuring and termination provisions\n\nA restructuring provisions is recognised when a detailed plan for the implementation of the measures is complete and when the plan has been communicated to those who are affected. Employee termination provisions are recognised when the group has communicated the plan to the employees.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed. The recognition of environmental provisions is based on current interpretations of environmental laws and regulations. Such provisions are recognised when the group has an obligation to dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located. The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. A corresponding item of property, plant and equipment of an amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised and subsequently depreciated as part of the asset. Provisions do not include any third-party recoveries.\n\n## Emission provisions\n\nEmission obligations are recognised in provisions based on realised emissions. The provision is measured at the carrying amounts of the corresponding emission rights held, which are recognised as intangible assets. In case of deficit in emission rights, the shortage is valued at the market value at the balance sheet date.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nThe estimates used in determining the provisions are based on the expenses incurred for similar activities in the current reporting period taking into account the effect of inflation, cost-base development and discounting. Because actual outflows can differ from estimates due to changes in laws, regulations, public expectations, technology, prices and conditions, and can take place many years in the future, the carrying amounts of provisions are regularly reviewed and adjusted to take into account of any such changes. The discount rate applied is reviewed annually.\n\nThe group aims to operate in compliance with regulations related to the treatment of waste water, air emissions and landfill sites. However, expected events during production processes and waste treatment could cause material losses and additional costs in the group's operations.\n\n## Legal contingencies\n\nManagement judgement is required in measurement and recognition of provisions related to pending litigation.

The group has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis. Outstanding trade receivables, days of sales outstanding (DSO) and overdue trade receivables are followed on monthly basis. Potential concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables are limited due to the large number and the geographic dispersion of customers. Customer credit limits are established and monitored, and ongoing evaluations of their financial condition is performed. The group has trade credit insurances to protect accounts receivables from significant credit losses. In certain market areas, including Asia and Northern Africa, measures to reduce credit risks include letters of credit, prepayments and bank guarantees. Maximum exposure to credit risk, without taking into account any credit enhancements, is the carrying amount of trade and other receivables.\n\nUPM does not have significant concentration of customer credit risk. The ten largest customers accounted for approximately 15% (15%) of the trade receivables as at 31 December 2021 - i.e., approximately EUR 200 million (170 million).\n\nIn 2021, trade receivables amounting to EUR 5 million (10 million) were subject to permanent write-off and the loss was recognised under other costs and expenses. In accordance with the group's accounting policy, trade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined by the method most appropriate to the particular nature of inventory, the first-in, first-out (FIFO) or weighted average cost. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costs and related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the costs of completion and selling expenses. If the net realisable value is lower than cost, a valuation allowance is established for inventory obsolescence.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables arising from selling goods and services in the normal course of business are recognised initially at transaction price and subsequently at amortised cost less loss allowance provision. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of 14-60 days, which is consistent with market practice.\n\nThe group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance for all trade receivables. The group has recognised two types of provisions for trade receivables - a general provision for lifetime expected credit losses and a provision for specified individual trade receivables, both of which are charged to the income statement. The group uses a provision matrix for estimating lifetime expected credit losses where trade receivables are segregated by businesses. The provision matrix is based on historical observed default rates, adjusted by forward looking information. It takes into account trade credit insurances, payment profile of customers and the factor that as debts get older they are more likely not to be paid. Additionally, the group recognises a provision individually for outstanding trade receivables where specific debtor information is available. In these cases there must be objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.\n\nTrade receivables are permanently written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. The customer entering into bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings or finalising such proceedings, or entering into debt-restructuring are considered indicators that the trade receivables are no longer expected to be recovered. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement. The carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the receivables.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n183",

        "page_content": "## Trade and other payables\n\nTrade payables arise from purchase of inventories, fixed assets and goods and services in the ordinary course of business from UPM's suppliers. Trade and other payables are classified as current liabilities if they are due to be settled within the normal operating cycle of the business or within 12 months from the balance sheet date. Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of trade payables approximates to their fair value due to the short-term nature of the payables.\n\nThe group is recognising refund liability for expected volume and other discounts arising from contracts with customers. Customer rebates\n\nBUSINESSES\n\ninclude mainly volume discounts and are recognised as equal to an amount which is most likely to be paid to the customer. The carrying amount of expected customer rebates is updated at each reporting date, using the latest forecast data available.\n\nCustomer claims relating to quality complaints are accounted for as revenue related refund liability. Expected customer claims are estimated based on historical data and the amount of refund liability is updated at each reporting date. Customer claims and customer rebates are typically expected to realise within the next 12 months.\n\nAdvances received are recognised as contract liability until the performance obligation is fulfilled.\n\n## 5.  Capital structure\n\nUPM has a strong cash flow and industry-leading balance sheet that mitigates risks and enables value-enhancing strategic actions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.1  Capital management\n\nUPM's objective for managing capital comprising of net debt and total equity is to ensure maintenance of flexible capital structure to enable the ability to operate in capital markets and maintain optimal returns to shareholders. The group manages its financing activities, debt portfolio and financial resources via various policies that are designed to ensure optimum financing arrangements minimising simultaneously financial expenses and refinancing risk and optimising liquidity. Borrowing activities are centralised to the parent to the extent possible and cash resources are distributed within the group by the central treasury department.\n\nUPM targets a net debt to EBITDA ratio of approximately 2 times or less.\n\n## UPM's capital\n\n| EURm                                                          | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity attributable to owners of the parent  company          | 10,846 | 9,351  |\n| Non-controlling interest                                      | 261    | 162    |\n| Total equity                                                  | 11,106 | 9,513  |\n| Non-current debt                                              | 2,566  | 1,952  |\n| Current debt                                                  | 86     | 90     |\n| Total debt                                                    | 2,652  | 2,042  |\n| Total capitalisation                                          | 13,759 | 11,555 |\n| Total debt                                                    | 2,652  | 2,042  |\n| Less: Interest-bearing financial assets and  investment funds | 2,006  | 1,986  |\n| Net debt                                                      | 647    | 56     |\n| Gearing ratio, %  1)                                          | 6      | 1      |\n| Net debt to EBITDA  1)                                        | 0.35   | 0.04   |\n\n- 1) Refer \u00bb Other financial information on Alternative performance measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing risk\n\nUnder all circumstances, UPM seeks to maintain adequate liquidity, which depends on a number of factors, such as the availability of cash flows from operations and access to additional debt and equity financing. UPM aims to ensure sufficient liquidity by means of efficient cash management and restricting financial investments to investment types that can readily be converted into cash and by keeping a sufficient amount of unused committed credit lines or cash as a reserve. UPM aims to minimise refinancing risks by ensuring a balanced loan portfolio maturing schedule and sufficiently long maturities. The average loan maturity at 31 December 2021 was 7.3 years (7.6 years).\n\n## Liquidity and refinancing\n\n| EURm                               | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Cash at bank                       | 1,313  | 1,390  |\n| Cash equivalents                   | 146    | 330    |\n| Investment funds                   | 100    | -      |\n| Committed credit lines             | 909    | 1,458  |\n| of which used                      | -      | -      |\n| Loan commitments                   | -123   | -123   |\n| Used uncommitted credit lines      | -2     | -2     |\n| Long-term loan repayment cash flow | -77    | -80    |\n| Liquidity                          | 2,267  | 2,973  |\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits held at banks and with original maturities of three months or less.

In 2021, net debt increased  by EUR 591 million. Net debt totalled EUR 647 million (56 million) at the end of 2021.\n\nIn October 2020 UPM established a EUR 3 billion Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme and launched a Green Finance Framework. The independent second opinion concerning the framework was provided by CICERO Shades of Green. UPM's framework was rated with the highest-grade, CICERO Dark Green.\n\nIn March 2021, UPM successfully issued a new EUR 500 million Green Bond under its EMTN (Euro Medium Term Note) programme and its Green Finance Framework. The bond matures in March 2031 and pays a fixed coupon of 0.50%. In November 2020 UPM issued its first Green Bond under the EMTN programme with a nominal value of EUR 750 million. The bond matures in November 2028 and pays a fixed coupon of 0.125%. There are no financial covenants connected to the bonds. The net proceeds from the bonds are used for financing and/or refinancing Eligible Projects and Assets under UPM's Green Finance Framework. Both bonds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange plc, trading as Euronext Dublin.\n\n## Net debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net debt\n\n| EURm                                | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Bonds                               | 1,624  | 1,153  |\n| Loans from financial institutions   | 213    | 121    |\n| Lease liabilities                   | 504    | 469    |\n| Derivatives                         | 23     | -      |\n| Other loans                         | 201    | 210    |\n| Non-current debt                    | 2,566  | 1,952  |\n| Repayments of non-current debt      | 7      | 5      |\n| Repayments of lease liabilities     | 70     | 75     |\n| Derivatives                         | 8      | 8      |\n| Other liabilities                   | 2      | 2      |\n| Current debt                        | 86     | 90     |\n| Total debt                          | 2,652  | 2,042  |\n| Loan receivables                    | 4      | 4      |\n| Derivatives                         | 126    | 157    |\n| Other receivables                   | 19     | 20     |\n| Non-current interest-bearing assets | 148    | 181    |\n| Loan receivables                    | 3      | 8      |\n| Derivatives                         | 4      | 12     |\n| Other receivables                   | 292    | 66     |\n| Investment funds                    | 100    | -      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 1,460  | 1,720  |\n| Current interest-bearing assets     | 1,858  | 1,805  |\n| Total interest-bearing assets       | 2,006  | 1,986  |\n| Net debt                            | 647    | 56     |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Debt\n\nDebt comprising of bonds, bank and pension loans, lease liabilities and other loans is recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the estimated life of the borrowing. UPM classifies debt as non-current unless due for settlement within a year. Most of the debt is hedged in a fair value hedge relationship as described in \u00bb Note 6.1 Financial risk management.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n186\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Change in net debt 2021\n\n## Reported in financing activities in cash flow statement\n\n| EURm                                                     | NON- CURRENT  LOANS INCL.

Approximately 36 % (33%) of leased assets recognised on the balance sheet consists of land areas in Uruguay, which the group uses for eucalyptus plantations. Approximately 30% (34%) of the leased assets on the balance sheet consist of five power plants. UPM uses the energy generated by these plants for its own production. In addition, the group has leased one waste water treatment plant as well as several warehouses, terminals, offices, railcars and vessels. UPM also leases some production machinery and equipment like forklifts and vehicles that are insignificant to the total leased assets portfolio.\n\nIn 2021, the total cash outflow for leased assets was EUR 84 (86) million. The expenses related to short-term leases recognised in the income statement in 2021 amounted to EUR 3 (7) million. The group had no significant variable lease payments in 2021.\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at year-end 31 December 2021 totalled approximately EUR 409 (412) million, which are mostly related to long-term charter agreements, railway service agreement in Uruguay and service agreements related to wood handling, waste water treatment and other utilities in Leuna, Germany.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n189",

This assessment involves the exercise of judgment about whether it depends on a specified asset, whether UPM obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether UPM has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\nThe group recognises a leased asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases. UPM applies this to all asset classes. Short-term leases are leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less. A lease that contains a purchase option is not a short-term lease. UPM recognises lease payments of short-term leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe lease term is determined as the non- cancellable period of the lease taking into consideration the options to extend and terminate if it is reasonably certain that the group will exercise the extension option or will not exercise the termination option. If the contract is for an indefinite period of time and the group and the lessor both have a right to terminate the contract within a short notice period (12 months or less) without a significant economic penalties and termination cash payments, the contract is considered to be a short-term.\n\nThe lease liability is recognised at the commencement date and measured at the present value of the lease payments to be paid during the lease term. The group uses, as a basis, discount rate implicit in the lease and if that rate cannot be readily determined, UPM uses incremental borrowing rate which comprises of currency and lease termbased reference rate and specific credit spread as well as other specific terms and conditions of a lease. Lease payments can include fixed\n\npayments, variable payments that depend on an index or rate and extension option payments or purchase options if it is reasonably certain that the group will exercise them. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and remeasured (with corresponding adjustment to the related leased asset) when there is a change in future lease payments due to renegotiation, changes of an index or rate or reassessment of options.\n\nLeased asset comprises the initial lease liability, initial direct costs and the obligations to refurbish the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessors. The leased asset is subsequently valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Remeasurement takes place in case lease liability is remeasured and change in cash flows is based on contract terms that have been included in the original contract. The leased asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term. The leased asset is subject to testing for impairment if there is an indicator for impairment, as for own assets.\n\nThe group has elected to separate non-lease components such as service components and other variable components and account them for as expenses, if they can be separated from the leased asset. However, the group does not separate non-lease components from the lease contracts of company cars.\n\nThe group does not apply portfolio approach of leases with similar characteristics.\n\nLeased assets are presented in the balance sheet as a separate financial statement line item. Lease liabilities are presented as part of non-current debt and current debt line items in the balance sheet. Lease liabilities are part of net debt calculation of the group. Short-term lease payments are reported as rents and lease expenses. Variable lease payments are recognised within the operating costs and expenses based on the nature of the payment. The interest expense on the lease liability is recognised as a component of finance costs in income statement. In cash flow statement, payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are recognised as financing cash flow while payments for interest portion of lease liability, short-term leases, and variable\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n190\n\namounts not included in the measurement of the lease liability, are classified within operating cash flow.\n\n## The group as a lessor\n\nAt inception of a lease contract, the group makes an assessment whether the lease is a finance lease or an operating lease. If the lease\n\n## 5.3  Financial assets and liabilities by category\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, loans and other financial receivables, investments in securities, trade receivables, trade payables, loans, bank overdrafts and derivatives.\n\nClassification of financial assets into different measurement categories depends on the contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model for managing the financial asset. The measurement\n\ntransfers substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset, it is considered to be a finance lease; if not, the lease is considered to be an operating lease. The group has only a minor amount of operating lease contracts, whereby the lease payments are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n\ncategory of each financial asset is determined at inception. Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right in all circumstances to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities by category at the end of 2021\n\n| EURm                                    | FAIR VALUE  THROUGH PROFIT  AND LOSS   | EQUITY  INSTRUMENTS AT  FAIR VALUE  THROUGH OCI   | DERIVATIVES  UNDER HEDGE  ACCOUNTING   | FINANCIAL  ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AT  AMORTISED COST   | TOTAL   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Energy shareholdings                    | -

The fair value of non-current loans amounted to EUR 2,573 million (1,978 million) at the end of 2021. For quoted bonds, the fair values are based on the quoted market value as of 31 December. At the end of 2021, all bonds were quoted.\n\nFor other non-current borrowings fair values are estimated using the expected contractual future payments discounted at market interest rates and are categorised within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n- \u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information on net debt and bonds.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n192\n\n## Fair value measurement hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                               | 2021    | 2021    | 2021    | 2021   | 2020    | 2020    | 2020    | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n|                                    | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Total  |\n| Financial assets                   |         |         |         |        |         |         |         |        |\n| Investment funds                   | -       | 100     | -       | 100    | -       | -       | -       | -      |\n| Derivatives, non-qualifying hedges | -       | 13      | -       | 13     | -       | 32      | -       | 32     |\n| Derivatives under hedge accounting | 1       | 148     | -       | 149    | 2       | 252     | -       | 254    |\n| Energy shareholdings               | -       | -       | 2,579   | 2,579  | -       | -       | 1,936   | 1,936  |\n| Total                              | 1       | 261     | 2,579   | 2,841  | 2       | 284     | 1,936   | 2,222  |\n| Financial liabilities              |         |         |         |        |         |         |         |        |\n| Derivatives, non-qualifying hedges | -       | 20      | -       | 20     | -       | 27      | -       | 27     |\n| Derivatives under hedge accounting | 6       | 102     | -       | 108    | 2       | 27      | -       | 29     |\n| Total                              | 6       | 122     | -       | 128    | 2       | 54      | -       | 56     |\n\nThere have been no transfers between levels in 2021 and 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nThis category includes derivatives that don't qualify for hedge accounting and investments funds. They are measured at fair value and any gains or losses from subsequent measurement are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Equity instruments at fair value through OCI\n\nThis category includes mainly UPM's energy shareholdings. These assets are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial assets at amortised cost\n\nThis category comprises loan receivables with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, as well as trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents. They are included in non-current assets unless they mature within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Cash and cash equivalents are always classified as current assets. Loan receivables that have a fixed maturity are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Loan receivables without fixed maturity date are measured at amortised cost. As soon as a loan receivables or cash and cash equivalents are originated or purchased, a loss allowance for 12-month expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. If credit risk increases significantly, full lifetime expected credit losses are recognised in profit or loss. In the comparison period, loan receivables were impaired if the carrying amount exceeded the estimated recoverable amount. The credit loss model applied to trade receivables is described in \u00bb Note 4.6 Working capital.\n\n## Derivatives under hedge accounting\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. Gains and losses on remeasurement of derivatives used for hedging purposes are recognised in accordance with the accounting principles described in \u00bb Note 6.2 Derivatives and hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost\n\nThis category includes debt, trade payables and other financial liabilities. \u00bb Refer Note 5.2 Net debt, for further information.\n\nThe different levels of fair value hierarchy used in fair value estimation are defined as follows:\n\n## Fair values under level 1\n\nQuoted prices (unadjusted) traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Derivatives include futures and commodity forwards traded in exchange.\n\n## Fair values under level 2\n\nObservable inputs are used as basis for fair value calculations either directly (prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. For investment funds, the valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in markets that are not active. For derivatives, level 2 include OTC derivatives like forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency options, interest and currency swaps and commodity swaps. Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments at level 2 include the following methods:\n\nInterest forward rate agreements (FRA) are fair valued based on quoted market rates on the balance sheet date. Forward foreign exchange contracts are fair valued based on the contract forward rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign currency options are fair valued based on quoted market rates and market volatility rates on the balance sheet date by using the Black&Scholes option valuation model. Interest and currency swap instruments are fair valued as present value of the estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves. Commodity swaps are fair valued based on quoted forward prices on the balance sheet date.\n\nAn embedded derivative that is by nature a foreign currency forward contract is valuated at market forward exchange rates and is included in level 2. Embedded derivatives are monitored by the group and the fair value changes are reported in other operating income in the income statement.\n\n## Fair values under level 3\n\nFinancial assets or liabilities of which fair values are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs) are classified under level 3. This category include UPM's energy shareholdings and forest assets. Fair valuations are performed at least quarterly by respective business areas or functions. Fair valuations are reviewed by the group finance management and overseen by the Audit Committee. \u00bb Refer Note 4.3 Energy shareholdings and \u00bb Note 4.2 Forest assets.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n193",

There are no specific terms related to the shares. At 31 December 2021, the number of the company's shares was 533,735,699. The shares do not have any nominal counter value. The shares are included within the book entry system for securities.\n\n## Share-based payments reserve\n\nThe share-based payments reserve is used to recognise the fair value at the grant date of the share incentive plans, Performance Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan, over their vesting period.\n\n## Reserve for invested non-restricted equity\n\nReserve for invested non-restricted equity includes, under the Companies' Act, the exercise value of shareholders' investments in the company unless otherwise decided by the company.\n\n## Translation reserve\n\nThis reserve includes the foreign currency differences arising from the translation of foreign operations, and the effective result of transactions that hedge the group's net investments in foreign operations. There were no reclassifications from the translation reserve to profit or loss during the period resulting from inefficiency of net investment hedges.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nTransaction costs directly relating to the issue of new shares or share options are recognised, net of tax, in equity as a reduction in the proceeds. Where any group company purchases the parent company's shares (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of tax), is deducted from equity attributable to the owners of the parent company until the shares are cancelled or reissued. Where such shares are subsequently reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the owners of the parent company.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nAt 31 December 2021, the company held 411,653 (411,653) of its own shares, 0.08% (0.08%) of the total number of shares.\n\n## Reserves\n\n| EURm                                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fair value reserve                         | 2,012  | 1,380  |\n| Hedging reserve                            | -96    | 28     |\n| Share-based payments reserve               | 21     | 22     |\n| Total other reserves                       | 1,938  | 1,430  |\n| Reserve for invested non-restricted equity | 1,273  | 1,273  |\n| Translation reserve                        | 329    | 25     |\n| Total reserves                             | 3,539  | 2,728  |\n\n## Fair value reserve\n\nThis reserve represents the cumulative net change in the fair value of investments in equity securities comprising mainly of the fair value change of the energy shareholdings. Amounts are recycled only within equity upon the disposal of the asset.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\nThis reserve comprises the cumulative net change in the fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred and the cost of hedging when recognised in OCI. Amounts are recognised in profit or loss when the associated hedged transactions affect profit or loss or as part of the acquisition cost of property, plant and equipment. In 2021, a gain of EUR 9 million was reclassified from the hedging reserve to other financial income as a result of inefficiency. In 2020, there were no reclassifications from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss during the period resulting from inefficiency.\n\n## Hedging reserve\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2021                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | 57                            | -26                                        | -2                 | -1    | 28      |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | -5                            | 85                                         | -1                 | -16   | 63      |\n| Amounts reclassified to acquisition cost of a fixed assets    | -14                           | -                                          | -                  | -     | -14     |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | -70                           | -143                                       | 2                  | 38    | -172    |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | -32                           | -84                                        | -1                 | 22    | -96     |\n\n-5\n\n| EURm                                                          | CURRENCY  CASH FLOW  HEDGES   | ELECTRICITY  PURCHASE  AND SALES  HEDGES   | COST OF  HEDGING   | TAX   | TOTAL   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------|---------|\n| 2020                                                          |                               |                                            |                    |       |         |\n| Hedging reserve, at 1 January                                 | -4                            | 78                                         | -6                 | -14   | 55      |\n| Amounts reclassified to profit and loss                       | 10                            | -61                                        | 9                  | 8     | -34     |\n| Amounts reclassified to acquisition cost of a fixed assets    | -4                            | -                                          | -                  | -     |         |\n| Change in fair value of hedging instruments recognised in OCI | 55                            | -43                                        | -5                 | 5     | 11      |\n| Hedging reserve, at 31 December                               | 57                            | -26                                        | -2                 | -1    | 28      |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n195\n\n## Share capital\n\n|                          | 2021    | 2020    |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Number of shares (1,000) | 533,736 | 533,736 |\n| Share capital, EURm      | 890     | 890     |\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n194",

Risk management\n\n## 6.1  Financial risk management\n\nThe objective of financial risk management is to protect the group from unfavourable changes in financial markets and thus help to secure profitability. The objectives and limits for financing activities are defined in the Group Treasury Policy approved by the Board of Directors. In financial risk management various financial instruments are used within the limits specified in the Group Treasury Policy. Only such instruments which market value and risk profile can be continuously and reliably monitored are used for this purpose.\n\nFinancing services are provided to the group entities and financial risk management carried out by the central treasury department, Treasury and Risk Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreign exchange risk\n\nAs a consequence of the global nature of its business, UPM is exposed to risks associated with changes in exchange rates, primarily with respect to USD, GBP and JPY. Foreign exchange risk arises from contracted and expected commercial future payment flows (transaction exposure), changes in value of recognised assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency and changes in the value of assets and liabilities in foreign subsidiaries (translation exposure). The objective of foreign exchange risk management is to limit the uncertainty created by changes in foreign exchange rates on the future value of cash flows earnings and in the group's balance sheet. Changing exchange rates can also have indirect effects, such as change in relative competitiveness between currency regions.\n\n## Transaction exposure\n\nThe group hedges transaction exposure related to highly probable future commercial foreign currency cash flows on a rolling basis over the next 12-month period based on forecasts by the respective business areas. Transaction risk arises from the changes in currency rates of highly probable transactions, which are expected to take place in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity. The group's policy is to hedge an average of 50% of its estimated net risk currency cash flow. Some highly probable cash flows have been hedged for longer than 12 months ahead while deviating from the risk neutral hedging level at the same time. At 31 December 2021, 49% (49%) of the forecast 12-month currency flow was hedged.\n\nThe group enters into external forward contracts, which are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk of specific future foreign currency flows. Cash flow hedge accounting is applied when possible. If hedge accounting is not possible, fair value changes of the hedging instrument are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nAt the end of 2021, UPM's estimated net risk currency flow for the next 12 months was EUR 1,886 million (1,327 million).\n\nThe weighted hedging rate by currency against EUR were USD 1.18, JPY 130.29 and GBP 0.86.\n\nIn addition to commercial foreign currency flow, the group has hedged risk currency flow related to investments. Cash flow or fair value hedge accounting is applied. At the end of 2021 the hedged net risk currency flow was EUR 360 million (EUR 470 million).\n\nRm\n\nEU\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 12 months net risk currency flow and hedges 2020\n\nRm\n\nEU\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Translation exposure\n\nThe group has several currency denominated assets and liabilities on its balance sheet such as foreign currency bonds, loans and deposits, group internal loans and cash in other currencies than functional currencies. UPM aims to fully hedge this balance sheet translation exposure, however, UPM might have unhedged balance sheet exposures within the limits set in group Treasury Policy.\n\nAt 31 December 2021 the unhedged balance sheet exposures in net of interest-bearing assets and liabilities amounted to EUR 9 million (11 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nThe group has also accounts receivable and payable balances denominated in foreign currencies and UPM aims to fully hedge the net exposure in main currencies. The nominal values of the hedging instruments in net of accounts payable and receivable hedging were EUR 352 million (540 million). Hedge accounting is not applied and all fair value changes of hedging instruments are recognised through profit and loss immediately.\n\nUPM's net investments in foreign subsidiaries are also subject to foreign currency translation differences. The exchange rate differences arising from translation of foreign subsidiaries are accumulated as a separate component of equity in the translation reserve relate mainly to USD, CNY and GBP. Currency exposure arising from the net investment in foreign subsidiaries is generally not hedged. However, at 31 December 2021, part of the foreign exchange risk associated with the net investments was hedged, major ones in China and Uruguay, and net investment hedge accounting has been applied. The average\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n196\n\nweighted hedging rate of these hedges against EUR were China CNY 8.28 and Uruguay USD 1.23.\n\nDerivatives used for hedging translation risks are external forward contracts, cross currency swaps and currency options.\n\n## Foreign exchange risk sensitivity\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect to profit before tax due to recognised balance sheet items in foreign currency and the effect to equity arising mainly from foreign currency forwards used to hedge foreign currency flows.\n\n|                        | Profit before tax   | Profit before tax   | Equity   | Equity   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------|----------|\n| EURm                   | 2021                | 2020                | 2021     | 2020     |\n| EUR strengthens by 10% |                     |                     |          |          |\n| USD                    | 2                   | 1                   | 97       | 91       |\n| GBP                    | -                   | -                   | 19       | 8        |\n| UYU                    | -                   | -                   | -12      | -15      |\n| JPY                    | -                   | -1                  | 9        | 9        |\n| EUR weakens by 10%     |                     |                     |          |          |\n| USD                    | -2                  | -1                  | -97      | -91      |\n| GBP                    | -                   | -                   | -19      | -8       |\n| UYU                    | -                   | -                   | 12       | 15       |\n| JPY                    | -                   | 1                   | -9       | -9       |\n\nThe following assumptions were made when calculating the sensitivity to changes in the foreign exchange risk:\n\n- \u00b7 Major part of non-derivative financial instruments (such as cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, debt and trade payables) are either directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives i.e. the balance sheet position is close to zero. Exchange rate fluctuations have therefore minor or no effects on profit or loss.\n- \u00b7 The position includes foreign currency forward contracts that hedge commercial flows or investments and are part of the effective cash flow hedge having an effect on equity.\n- \u00b7 The position includes also foreign currency forward contracts that are not part of the effective cash flow hedge having an effect on profit.\n- \u00b7 The position excludes foreign currency denominated future cash flows and effects of translation exposure and related hedges\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe interest-bearing liabilities and assets expose the group to interest rate risk, namely repricing and fair value interest rate risk caused by interest rate movements. According to the Group Treasury Policy the interest rate exposure is defined as the difference in interest rate sensitivity between assets and liabilities compared to a benchmark portfolio with a 6-month duration. The total interest rate exposure is a net debt portfolio which includes all interest bearing assets and liabilities and derivatives that are used to hedge the aforementioned balance sheet items. The policy sets risk limits and allowed deviation from target net debt duration level. The group uses interest rate derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate futures and cross currency swaps, to change net debt duration.\n\nThe table below shows the nominal value of interest rate position exposed to interest rate risk in each significant currency.

Electricity prices rely on fossil fuel and emissions allowance prices as well as the balance of supply and demand.  The group's sensitivity to electricity market price is dependent on the electricity production and consumption levels and the hedging levels. The inherent price risks arise from the daily sales and purchases of electricity from the power market with spot prices, and the hedging objective is to reduce the earnings volatility that arises from electricity prices.\n\nUPM considers Nordic system and electricity price area differential (EPAD) for Finland products perfect hedges for corresponding electricity price risk components in Finland. The components of electricity price risk in the Nordic power market are hedged by entering into System and EPAD electricity derivative contracts, mostly Nasdaq Commodities forwards, futures and options. system and EPAD prices are considered as separately identifiable and reliably measurable risk components in electricity sales and purchase contracts as well as in the hedging instruments, as a quoted price is available. Fair value changes of designated system and EPAD derivatives are offsetting electricity sales and purchase price changes. The share of system component covers approximately 80-90% and the share of EPAD component covers 10-20% of the changes in electricity sales and purchase prices.\n\nThe electricity price risk in the Central European power market is hedged by entering into European Electricity Exchange futures. Products used for hedging hedge the entire price risk for the underlying price area.\n\nThe time frame hedged has historically been approximately rolling 5 years. Hedging level has been typically higher for the nearest years and lower for the latter years. Hedging level for a certain year has historically varied between 0-80%. UPM constantly updates its electricity production and consumption forecasts. Hedging level is calculated based on the most recent available information about the electricity production and consumption forecast.\n\nThe group applies cash flow hedge accounting for the hedging relationships when it hedges its electricity price risk. In addition to hedging, the group is also trading electricity forwards and futures. As well as hedging, proprietary trading risks are monitored on a daily basis. Value-At-Risk levels are set to limit the maximum risk at any given time. Cumulative maximum loss is limited by stop-loss limits.\n\n## Electricity derivatives price sensitivity\n\nSensitivity analysis for financial electricity derivatives is based on position at the end of financial year. Sensitivities change over time as the overall hedging and trading positions change. Underlying physical positions are not included in the sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is calculated separately for the hedge accounted and nonhedge accounted volumes. In the analysis it is assumed that forward quotation in Nasdaq Commodities and EEX would change EUR 5/ MWh throughout the period UPM has derivatives. EUR 5/ MWh price sensitivity is estimated from historical market price movements in Nasdaq and EEX markets.\n\n| EURm                                             | EFFECT   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|\n| +/- EUR 5/MWh in electricity  forward quotations |          |        |        |\n| Effect on profit before tax                      | +/-      | 0.1    | 0.7    |\n| Effect on equity                                 | +/-      | 115.9  | 64.9   |\n\nBUSINESSES\n\n## 6.2  Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe group uses financial derivatives to manage currency, interest rate and commodity price risks.\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 6.1 Financial risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAll derivatives are initially and continuously recognised at fair value in the balance sheet. The fair value gain or loss is recognised through the income statement or other comprehensive income depending on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and on the nature of the item being hedged. Certain derivatives are designated at inception either hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedge), hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions (cash flow hedge), or hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries with other than the EUR as their functional currency (net investment hedge). Derivative fair values on the balance sheet are classified as non-current when the remaining maturity is more than 12 months and as current when the remaining maturity is less than 12 months.\n\nFor hedge accounting purposes, UPM documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception date. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments or forecast transactions. The group also documents its assessment, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedge is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.\n\nCertain derivatives, while considered to be economical hedges for UPM's financial risk management purposes, do not qualify for hedge accounting. Such derivatives are recognised at fair value through the income statement in other operating income or under financial items.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income. Cost of hedging, meaning forward points of derivative forward contracts accounted as cash flow hedges, is recognised as a part of the hedging reserve. Amounts deferred in equity are transferred to the income statement and classified as income or expense in the same period as that in which the hedged item affects the income statement (for example, when the forecast external sale to the group that is hedged takes place).\n\nWhen the forecasted transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a fixed asset, gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets hedge accounting criteria, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the committed or forecasted transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. However, if a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately recognised to the income statement.\n\nIn currency cash flow hedging, the hedging instrument is made in the same currency as the hedged item and hence the fair value change of the hedging instrument are expected to effectively offset the fair value\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n198\n\nchanges generated by the hedged items. Thereby the hedge ratio between the instrument and the cash flow is 1:1. Ineffectiveness may arise in the highly unlikely case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur. Ineffectiveness can also occur in a situation where the hedging instrument with an appropriate maturity is not available in the market for the whole duration of the hedged item. Then the terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item don't fully match, which causes minor ineffectiveness. There are no other significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\nIneffectiveness in electricity price hedges may arise in the highly unlikely case that the forecasted cash flows are no longer expected to occur. Ineffectiveness may also arise in case EPAD prices remained negative for a longer period of time, but considering historical price development UPM considers this scenario to be highly unlikely.\n\n## Hedges of net investments in foreign subsidiaries\n\nThe fair value changes of forward exchange contracts used in hedging net investments that reflect the change in spot exchange rates are recognised in other comprehensive income within translation reserve. Any gain or loss relating to the interest portion of forward exchange contracts is recognised immediately in the income statement under financial items. Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold.\n\nThe hedging instrument is always made in the same currency as the hedged investment, hence the hedge ratio in net investment hedging is 1:1. For hedging of net investments, ineffectiveness may only arise in the highly unlikely situation where the hedged item is disposed or sold during the duration of the hedging instrument.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe group applies fair value hedge accounting for hedging fixed interest risk on debt. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges and that are prospectively highly effective are recorded in the income statement under financial items, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liabilities that are attributable to the hedged risk. The carrying amounts of hedged items and the fair values of hedging instruments are included in interest-bearing assets or liabilities.\n\nDerivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges mature at the same time as hedged items. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the expected period to maturity.\n\nIneffectiveness in fair value hedge of fixed interest risk may arise in case of early redemption of such debt, which is hedged under fair value hedge accounting. The group has not recognised other significant sources of ineffectiveness that can reasonably be expected to take place.\n\nThe group applies fair value hedge accounting also for hedging firm commitment of a purchase in foreign currency. The currency changes of the hedging instrument are recorded through profit and loss in financial items, until they are recognised as a part of the acquisition cost of a fixed asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial counterparty risk\n\nThe financial instruments the group has agreed with banks and financial institutions contain an element of risk of the counterparties being unable to meet their obligations. According to the Group Treasury Policy derivative instruments and investments of cash funds may be made only with counterparties meeting certain creditworthiness criteria. The group minimises counterparty risk also by using a number of major banks and financial institutions. Creditworthiness of counterparties is constantly monitored by Treasury and Risk Management.\n\n## Effect of IBOR reform and significant assumptions\n\nGroup's risk exposure that is directly affected by the IBOR reform is fair value hedge accounting of long-term fixed-rate debt for changes in fair value attributable to USD LIBOR which is the current benchmark interest rate. USD LIBOR is currently expected to be published until June 2023. Group currently has only few contracts which reference USD LIBOR and extend beyond June 2023. Group oversees the IBOR transition and follows changes to ISDA and other market guidelines on effects of these changes to UPM's contracts. In fair value hedging relationships, fair value for both the hedged item and hedging instrument is calculated with identical rate. Therefore no ineffectiveness is expected.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n199",

The effective tax rate was 15.5% (22.9%). In 2021 and 2020, the effective tax rate was affected by the income not subject to tax from subsidiaries operating in tax free zone and German tax rate that is higher than in Finland. In addition, in 2021 effective tax rate was impacted by tax exempt capital gain on the sale of shares of Shotton Mill Ltd and in 2020 by the  losses resulting from the closure of UPM Chapelle paper mill  for which no deferred tax assets were recognised due to uncertainty of their utilisation.\n\n## Income tax\n\n| EURm                     |   2021 |   2020 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax expense      |    273 |    141 |\n| Change in deferred taxes |    -32 |     28 |\n| Total                    |    240 |    169 |\n\n## Tax rate reconciliation\n\n| EURm                                              | 2021   | 2020   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Profit before tax                                 | 1,548  | 737    |\n| Computed tax at Finnish statutory rate of 20%     | 310    | 147    |\n| Difference between Finnish and foreign rates      | -16    | 1      |\n| Tax-exempt income                                 | -90    | -29    |\n| Non-deductible expenses                           | 6      | 6      |\n| Withholding taxes                                 | 4      | 9      |\n| Tax loss with no tax benefit                      | 18     | 29     |\n| Results of associates                             | 0      | -1     |\n| Change in tax legislation                         | 2      | 4      |\n| Change in recoverability of deferred tax assets   | 13     | 3      |\n| Utilisation of previously unrecognised tax losses | -3     | -3     |\n| Other items                                       | -3     | 2      |\n| Total income taxes                                | 240    | 169    |\n| Effective tax rate, %                             | 15.5 % | 22.9 % |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nThe group's income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax. Current tax is calculated on the taxable result for the period based on the tax rules prevailing in the countries where the group operates and includes tax adjustments for previous periods and withholding taxes deducted at source on intra-group transactions. Tax expense is recognised in the income statement, unless it relates to items that have been recognised in equity or as part of other comprehensive income. In these instances, the related tax expense is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income, respectively.\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the group's tax expense and income tax liabilities involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Tax balances reflect a current understanding and interpretation of existing tax laws. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect of situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and adjusts income tax liabilities where appropriate.\n\n## 7.2  Deferred tax\n\n| EURm                                                 | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Deferred tax assets                                  |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | 83     | 77     | 77     |\n| Inventories                                          | 53     | 38     | 45     |\n| Retirement benefit liabilities and provisions        | 127    | 156    | 148    |\n| Other temporary differences                          | 269    | 163    | 103    |\n| Tax losses and tax credits carried forward           | 230    | 157    | 180    |\n| Offset against liabilities                           | -297   | -170   | -157   |\n| Total                                                | 466    | 421    | 395    |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                             |        |        |        |\n| Intangible assets and property, plant and  equipment | -261   | -245   | -249   |\n| Forest assets                                        | -398   | -352   | -364   |\n| Retirement benefit assets                            | -17    | -5     | -7     |\n| Other temporary differences                          | -217   | -132   | -86    |\n| Offset against assets                                | 297    | 170    | 157    |\n| Total                                                | -596   | -564   | -549   |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)                | -130   | -143   | -153   |\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n202\n\n## Movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n| EURm                                  |   2021 |   2020 |\n|---------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying value, at 1 January          |   -143 |   -153 |\n| Charged to income statement           |     32 |    -28 |\n| Charged to other comprehensive income |    -15 |     29 |\n| Exchange rate adjustments             |     -4 |      9 |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) |   -130 |   -143 |\n\n## Tax charge to other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                     |   Before tax | Tax   |   After tax |   Before tax | Tax   |   After tax |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------|-------------|--------------|-------|-------------|\n| EURm                                                |         2021 | 2021  |        2021 |         2020 | 2020  |        2020 |\n| Actuarial gains and losses on defined benefit plans |          128 | -32   |          96 |          -50 | 14    |         -36 |\n| Energy shareholdings                                |          643 | -11   |         632 |         -254 | 3     |        -251 |\n| Translation differences                             |          337 | -     |         337 |         -262 | -     |        -262 |\n| Cash flow hedges                                    |         -149 | 22    |        -127 |          -37 | 13    |         -24 |\n| Net investment hedges                               |          -27 | 5     |         -21 |            6 | -1    |           5 |\n| Total                                               |          933 | -15   |         918 |         -597 | 29    |        -569 |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key estimates and judgements\n\n## Recognised deferred tax assets\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets requires management judgement as to whether it is probable that such balances will be utilised and/or reversed in the foreseeable future. At 31 December 2021, net operating loss carry-forwards for which the group has recognised a deferred tax asset amounted to EUR 802 million (536 million), of which EUR 717 million (475 million) was attributable to German subsidiaries. In Germany net operating loss carry-forwards do not expire. In other countries net operating loss carry-forwards expire at various dates and in varying amounts. Based on profit forecasts, it is probable that there will be sufficient future taxable profits available against which the tax losses can be utilised.\n\nThe assumptions regarding future realisation of tax benefits, and therefore the recognition of deferred tax assets, may change due to future operating performance of the group, as well as other factors, some of which are outside of the control of the group.\n\n## Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe net operating loss carry-forwards for which no deferred tax is recognised due to uncertainty of their utilisation amounted to EUR 843 million (849 million) in 2021. These net operating loss carry-forwards are mainly attributable to certain German and French subsidiaries and do not expire. In addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax assets on loss carry-forwards relating to closed Miramichi paper mill due to only minor operations in Canada. These loss carry-forwards expire at different times by the end of 2029.\n\nBUSINESSES\n\nThe group has not recognised deferred tax liability in respect of undistributed earnings of non-Finnish subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. In addition, the group has not recognised deferred tax liability for the undistributed earnings of Finnish subsidiaries and associates as such earnings can be distributed without any tax consequences.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nDeferred tax is calculated based on temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the taxable values of assets and liabilities and for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that it is probable that these can be utilised against future taxable profits.\n\nDeferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.\n\nDeferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised net where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n203",

Group structure\n\n## 8.1 Business acquisitions and disposals\n\nIn 2021, UPM permanently closed paper production at its Shotton newsprint mill site in North Wales, United Kingdom. The site and all related assets were sold to Eren Paper Ltd, a subsidiary of Modern Karton Sanayi Ve Ticaret A. \u015e ., the containerboard and corrugated packaging business of the Turkish industrial conglomerate Eren Holding ('Eren'), thereby closing the transaction announced in May 2021. UPM also made several minor sales of equity investments accounted at fair value through OCI. In 2020, UPM sold its 50% share in the joint operation Kainuun Voima. UPM also made a minor sale of its 6.1% ownership BSW Timber Ltd, which was accounted for as a fair value through OCI investment.\n\nIn 2021, UPM purchased an additional 20.23% share in the joint operation Alholmens Kraft, increasing UPM's ownership from 29.77% to 50.00 %. UPM also made a minor investment in InfraLeuna GmbH which is an equity investments accounted at fair value through OCI. In 2020, UPM purchased an additional 1.89% share in the joint operation Alholmens Kraft, increasing UPM's ownership from 27.88% to 29.77 %\n\n## Reconciliation of gain on sale and net cash arising from the disposal of Shotton Mill Ltd\n\n| EURm                             | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|\n| Reconciliation of gain on sale   |        |\n| Consideration paid in cash       | 160    |\n| Consideration to be received     | 3      |\n| Net assets sold                  | -25    |\n| Transaction and other costs, net | -3     |\n| Gain on disposal                 | 133    |\n| Consideration paid in cash       | 160    |\n| Cash in company disposed         | -2     |\n| Net cash arising from disposal   | 157    |\n\n## Transactions with non-controlling interests\n\nIn 2021, UPM made a minor acquisition of an additional 24% holding of its subsidiary Jyv\u00e4s-Helmi Oy from a non-controlling shareholder. In 2020, there were no changes in the share of non-controlling interests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nUPM consolidates acquired entities at the acquisition date which is when it gains control using the acquisition method. Consideration transferred is determined as the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and equity instruments issued including the fair value of a contingent consideration. Acquisition related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The group measures any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.\n\nThe excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the subsidiary acquired is recorded as goodwill.\n\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of subsidiaries with noncontrolling interests are consolidated line by line into the UPM consolidated financial statements.

There are no loans granted to any members of the Board of Directors or the Group Executive Team at 31 December 2021 or 2020.\n\nFor information concerning shares held by members of the Board of Directors as well as remuneration to members of the Board of Directors and the Group Executive Team are disclosed in \u00bb Note 3.2. Key management personnel.\n\n## Associates and joint ventures\n\nIn Finland, the group organises its producer's responsibility of recovered paper collection through Encore Ymp\u00e4rist\u00f6palvelut Oy. Austria Papier Recycling GmbH purchases recovered paper in Austria and L.C.I s.r.l. in Italy. ASD Altpapier Sortierung Dachau GmbH is a German recovered paper sorting company. The purchases from those four companies represented approximately 91% (95%) of total recovered paper purchase amount from associates and joint ventures.\n\nTransactions with associates and joint ventures are presented in the table below. The group has no individually material associates or joint ventures.\n\n| EURm                                    |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Dividends received                      |      2 |      3 |\n| Purchases of raw materials and services |     69 |     60 |\n| Loan receivables                        |      5 |      6 |\n| Trade and other receivables             |      2 |      1 |\n| Trade and other payables                |      9 |      7 |\n\n## Subsidiaries and joint operations\n\n\u00bb Refer Note 8.2 Principal subsidiaries and joint operations.\n\n## Pension Funds\n\nIn Finland, the group has the pension foundation, UPM Sellutehtaiden el\u00e4kes\u00e4\u00e4ti\u00f6, which is a separate legal entity. Pensions for about 21% (19%) of the group's Finnish employees are arranged through the Foundation.\n\nIn 2021, the contributions paid by UPM to the Foundation amounted to EUR 18 million (18 million). The Foundation manages and invests the contributions paid to the plan. The fair value of the Foundation's assets at 31 December 2021 was EUR 597 million (563 million), of which 15% was in the form of equity instruments and 85% was invested in property and money market.\n\nIn the UK, the single UPM Pension Scheme operates under a Trust which is independent from the group.

The group made contributions of EUR 6 million (6 million) to the defined benefit sections of the Scheme in 2021. The fair value of the UK defined benefit fund assets at 31 December 2021 was EUR 565 million (515 million), of which 10% was invested in equity instruments, 45% in debt instruments, 41% in property and money market and 4% in other investments.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n206\n\n## 8.4  Assets held for sale\n\n## 9.2  Litigation\n\nNo assets were classified as held for sale at the end of 2021 or 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, if UPM will recover their carrying amount through a sale transaction which is considered highly probable. Non-current assets classified as held for sale, or included within a disposal group that is classified as held for sale, are not depreciated after the classification.\n\n## 9. Unrecognised items\n\n## 9.1  Commitments and contingencies\n\nIn the normal course of business, UPM enters into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties. The maximum amounts of future payments for which UPM is liable is disclosed in the table below under 'Other commitments'. Property under mortgages given as collateral for own commitments include property, plant and equipment, industrial estates and forest land.\n\n| EURm                                                                       | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| On behalf of others                                                        |        |        |\n| Guarantees                                                                 | 2      | 2      |\n| Other own commitments                                                      |        |        |\n| Leasing commitments for the next 12 months in  accordance with IFRS 16  1) | 4      | 6      |\n| Other commitments                                                          | 213    | 214    |\n| Total                                                                      | 220    | 223    |\n\nThe lease commitments for leases not commenced at the end of 2021 totals approximately EUR 409 million, which are mostly related to longterm charter agreements, railway service agreement in Uruguay and service agreements related to wood handling, waste water treatment and other utilities in Leuna, Germany. Such lease commitments at the end of 2020 amounted to EUR 412 million.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThe group is defendant or plaintiff in a number of legal proceedings incidental to its operations. These lawsuits primarily involve claims arising from commercial law issues.\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe group's management is not aware of any significant litigation in the end of 2021.\n\nIn October, the European Commission conducted an unannounced inspection at UPM's premises. According to the Commission's press release on 12 October, the Commission has concerns that the inspected companies in the wood pulp sector may have violated EU antitrust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. The Commission states that the unannounced inspections are a preliminary step in an investigation into suspected anticompetitive practices, and the fact that the Commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself. UPM takes any suspected violation of antitrust rules very seriously and has a compliance programme in place to mitigate the risk of such violations. For example, all employees and executives are required to take training on the UPM Code of Conduct, which includes a section regarding antitrust compliance. In addition, UPM has also in place a specific training programme regarding antitrust rules which covers approximately 3,000 employees and executives.\n\n## 9.3  Events after the balance sheet date\n\nOn 1 January, UPM announced that members of the Paperworkers' Union, the Finnish Electrical Workers' Union and the Trade Union Pro have started strikes at UPM mills in J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski, Kouvola, Lappeenranta, Pietarsaari, Rauma, Tampere and Valkeakoski. UPM businesses falling under the strikes in Finland are UPM Pulp, UPM Biofuels, UPM Communication Papers, UPM Specialty Papers and UPM Raflatac. According to the unions, the strikes would continue until 22 January 2022 unless a new collective labour agreement is reached before that. The duration of the strike has since been extended twice (on 5 January and 20 January) by the Paperworker's union and at the time of signing the annual accounts, 27 January, the strike is due to last until 19 February 2022, unless new agreements are reached before that.\n\nUPM FINANCIAL REPORT 2021\n\n207",

Other notes\n\n## 10.1 Forthcoming new standards, amendments and accounting policy changes\n\nCertain new accounting standard amendments and interpretations have been published that come into effect only after the reporting period started on 1 January 2021. These standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the group in the current or future reporting periods and on foreseeable future transactions and have not been early adopted.\n\n## Change in the composition of reportable segments\n\nThe group will change its reportable segments composition by moving\n\nthe UPM Biofuels business into Other Operations on 1 January 2022. UPM is forming a new business unit by combining UPM Biofuels, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals and UPM Biocomposites businesses. The aim is to speed up business growth and to leverage the capabilities and competences across projects efficiently. This unit will inherit the name UPM Biorefining and will be reported as part of Other operations. UPM Pulp and UPM Timber currently reported under UPM Biorefining will be reported as UPM Fibres business area from 1 January 2022.\n\nFollowing the change, Other Operations will include UPM Forest, UPM Biofuels, UPM Biochemicals, UPM Biomedicals and UPM Biocomposites businesses as well as group services. The change will impact KPIs of UPM Biorefining (1.1.2022 UPM Fibres) reportable segment and Other Operations. The comparative periods will be restated according to the new reporting principles. The reporting change has no impact on group financial result or balance sheet.\n\n## UPM Biorefining (1.1.2022 UPM Fibres)\n\n| 2021                                                               | UPM

The main differences in accounting policies of the group and the parent company relate to the measurement of financial derivatives and forest assets and recognition of defined benefit obligations, share-based payments, lease agreements and deferred income taxes.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in millions of euros and rounded and therefore the sum of individual figures might deviate from the presented total figure.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nReceivables and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies outstanding on the balance sheet date and other commitments are translated into euro currency using the balance sheet date exchange rate. Exchange rate differences arising from the valuation of trade receivables are recognised in sales and exchange rate differences on trade payables in purchases. Exchange differences arising from the measurement of other receivables and liabilities are recognised in financial items.\n\n## Tangible and intangible assets\n\nTangible and intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortisation according to plan and impairments. Emission rights are recognised using net approach. Depreciation and amortization according to plan is recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\nLand and water areas, no depreciation\n\n| Intangible assets             | 5 - 10 years   |\n|-------------------------------|----------------|\n| Buildings                     | 20 - 50 years  |\n| Light machinery and equipment | 5 - 10 years   |\n| Heavy machinery               | 15 - 20 years  |\n| Power plants                  | 20 - 30 years  |\n| Other tangible assets         | 5 - 20 years   |\n\nForest assets are recognised as tangible assets within land and water areas at historical cost and revaluation. No systematic depreciation or changes in value due to felling is recognised.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments are stated at cost less impairments.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are stated at cost or the lower of replacement cost and probable selling price. Costs are measured using FIFO-method. In addition to variable costs, the cost of inventories includes a portion of the fixed costs of acquisition and manufacturing.\n\n## Revaluations\n\nThe balance sheet value of land includes revaluations. No new revaluations are made and the balance sheet value of land is considered to be below their fair value.\n\n## Leases\n\nLease payments of lease contracts are recognised in other operating expenses over the lease term. Lease payments due in future years under lease contracts are presented as off-balance sheet items.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions include foreseeable future expenses and losses to which the company is committed, the realization of which is probable and the amount can be reliably estimated, e.g. pension and environmental liabilities and termination and restructuring costs. Changes in provisions are recognised in income statement within particular cost items.\n\n## Sales\n\nSales include sales revenue from actual operations less indirect taxes, discounts, claims and exchange rate differences on net cash flow hedges and trade receivables.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed in the year in which they are incurred.\n\n## Pensions\n\nIn Finland employers are obliged to insure their employees for statutory benefits, as determined in Employee's Pension Act (TyEL). The mandatory pensions are arranged mainly through pension insurance companies. Contributions to pension insurance companies are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate. Pension obligations of own pension funds are fully funded.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nShare based compensation is recognized as an expense in the income statement over the earnings period and the related liability is booked to the balance sheet.\n\n## Closing entries\n\nParent company closing entries consists of the change in the depreciation difference and group contributions granted to group companies. The accumulated depreciation difference in the parent company has not been divided into equity and deferred tax liability.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome taxes presented in the income statement consist of accrued taxes for the financial year and tax adjustments for prior years. The parent company has not recognised deferred tax assets and liabilities in the balance sheet, but presents the information in the notes.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nIncome and expenses of derivative contracts relating to net cash flow hedges are recognised in sales. Income and expenses related to commodity derivatives are recognised in purchases. Income and expenses of fair value hedges are recognised in financial items. Net cash flow hedging derivatives and commodity derivatives are recognised in the income statement when the cash flow occurs. Hedge accounting is not applied.

The financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00b7 the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including a summary of significant accounting policies\n- \u00b7 the parent company's balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and notes.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with good auditing practice in Finland. Our responsibilities under good auditing practice are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the parent company and of the group companies in accordance with the ethical requirements that are applicable in Finland and are relevant to our audit, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, the non-audit services that we have provided to the parent company and to the group companies are in accordance with the applicable law and regulations in Finland and we have not provided non-audit services that are prohibited under Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014. The non-audit services that we have provided are disclosed in note 2.3 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Our Audit Approach\n\n## Overview\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Overall group materiality: \u20ac 77 million, which represents approximately 5 % of the the profit before tax.\n- \u00b7 The group audit scope encompassed all significant group companies, as well as a number of smaller group companies in Europe, Asia, North America and South America covering the vast majority of revenue, assets and liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of forest assets\n- \u00b7 Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nAs part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements; for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.",

An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group materiality for the consolidated financial statements as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n| Overall group materiality                        | \u20ac 77 million (previous year \u20ac 60 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How we determined it                             | Approximately 5% of the profit before tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| Rationale for the materiality  benchmark applied | We chose profit before taxes as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the benchmark against  which the performance of the Group is commonly measured by users, and is a generally accepted  benchmark. We chose approximately 5%, which is within the range of acceptable quantitative  materiality thresholds in auditing standards. |\n\n## How we tailored our group audit scope\n\nWe tailored the scope of our audit, taking into account the structure of the UPM-Kymmene Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industry in which the group operates.\n\nWe determined the type of work that needed to be performed at group companies by us, as the group engagement team, or by auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Audits were performed in group companies which were considered significant either because of their individual financial significance or due to their specific nature, covering the majority of revenue, assets and liabilities of the group. Selected specified procedures as well as analytical procedures were performed to cover the remaining group companies.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.\n\n## Key audit matter in the audit of the group\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matter\n\n## Valuation of forest assets\n\nRefer to note 4.2. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe group owns and leases total of a 1 057 thousand hectares of forests and plantations in Finland, the United States and Uruguay valued at \u20ac 2 328 million at 31 December 2021. Forest assets are measured at fair value less cost to sell. The fair value is calculated on the basis of discounted future expected cash flows as there is a lack of a liquid market. Young saplings and land are valued at cost. Main factors used in the valuation are estimates for growth and wood harvested, stumpage prices and discount rates.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nIn testing the valuation of forest assets, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodologies adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n- -Assessed the discount rates applied in the valuation;\n- -Assessed the other key valuation assumptions; and,\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as stumpage price, trend price forecast, tree growth assumptions, consumer price index and inflation.\n\nIn testing the valuation of the energy shareholdings, in conjunction with our valuation specialists we:\n\n- -Assessed the methodology adopted by management for the valuation;\n- -Tested the mathematical accuracy of the model used for valuation;\n- -Assessed the future electricity prices and price trends;\n- -Assessed the discount rate applied in the valuation;\n- -Validated the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant unit start-up schedule against the most recent available information;\n- -Validated key inputs and data used in valuation model such as production costs and volumes, UPM's ownership percentages, inflation, tax rate and net debt.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Valuation of energy shareholdings\n\nRefer to note 4.3. in the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures.\n\nThe energy shareholdings amounted to \u20ac 2 579 million at 31 December 2021. The energy shareholdings are unlisted equity investments in energy companies and are valued at fair value through other comprehensive income, net of tax if applicable. The fair value is determined on a discounted cash flow basis. The main factors impacting the future cash flows include future electricity prices, price trends, discount rates and the start-up schedule of the nuclear power plant unit Olkiluoto 3.\n\nWe focused on this area as the amounts are material, the valuation process is complex and judgmental and is based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market or economic conditions.\n\nWe have no key audit matters to report with respect to our audit of the parent company financial statements.\n\nThere are no significant risks of material misstatement referred to in Article 10(2c) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 with respect to the consolidated financial statements or the parent company financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the EU, and of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the preparation of financial statements in Finland and comply with statutory requirements. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for assessing the parent company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The financial statements are prepared using the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the parent company or the group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with good auditing practice will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with good auditing practice, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the parent company's or the group's internal control.\n\n\u00b7\n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by\n\nmanagement.\n\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' and the Managing Director's use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the parent company's or the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the parent company or the group to cease to continue as a going concern.",

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Reporting Requirements\n\n## Appointment\n\nWe have been acting as auditors appointed by the annual general meeting since 30 April 1996. Our appointment represents a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 26 years. The Company arranged the latest audit tendering process in 2013. Authorised Public Accountant (KHT) Mikko Nieminen has acted as the responsible auditor since 4 April 2019, representing a total uninterrupted period of three years.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the report of the Board of Directors and the information included in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. We have obtained the report of the Board of Directors prior to the date of this auditor's report and the Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after that date.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. With respect to the report of the Board of Directors, our responsibility also includes considering whether the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn our opinion\n\n- \u00b7 the information in the report of the Board of Directors is consistent with the information in the financial statements\n- \u00b7 the report of the Board of Directors has been prepared in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Other Statements\n\nWe support the proposal that the financial statements are adopted. The proposal by the Board of Directors regarding the distribution of profits is in compliance with the Limited Liability Companies Act. We support that the Members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of the parent company should be discharged from liability for the financial period audited by us.\n\nHelsinki 15 February 2022\n\n## PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy\n\nAuthorised Public Accountants\n\nMikko Nieminen Authorised Public Accountant (KHT)\n\n## Other financial information\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\nUPM presents certain performance measures of historical performance, financial position and cash flows, which in accordance with the 'Alternative Performance Measures' guidance issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) are not accounting measures defined or specified in IFRS and are therefore considered as alternative performance measures.

Numerical threshold for items to be considered as significant in UPM's business areas  UPM Biorefining, UPM Specialty Papers and UPM Communication Papers is determined as one cent (EUR 0.01) after  tax per share or more. In other business areas, the impact is considered to be significant if the item exceeds EUR 1  million before tax. |\n| Free cash flow                                         | Cash generated from
