This, in a challenging environment marked by inflation and logistics issues, and increased requirements to reduce our environmental impact.\n\nWe improved our organic growth and continued to deliver a strong financial performance by:\n\n- f Achieving strong growth in volume and price with continued cost discipline.\n- f Delivering class-leading EBITDA margins of 23.3%.\n- f Investing \u20ac736 million for future growth, while maintaining capital discipline and coherence with strategic imperatives.\n- f Further improving our cash generation.\n- f Further improving our credit strength, by reducing our debt and pension obligations by \u20ac884 million.\n- f Simplifying our portfolio.\n\nWith our G.R.O.W. strategy and Solvay One Planet roadmap as a compass, we took bold actions in 2021 to strengthen leadership positions, reallocating resources to growth and sustainable businesses. This included:\n\n- f Accelerating development of innovative solutions for now and the future, by further investing in our 'growth platforms', dedicated to battery materials, thermoplastic composites (TPC) and green hydrogen.\n- f Expanding our capacities, by establishing a new manufacturing facility for TPCs in the US and announcing an investment to increase our PVDF production in Europe, among other intiatives.\n- f Reinforcing our bio-based seed care portfolio through an acquisition.\n- f Developing new biosourced solutions for home and personal care.\n\nWe raised the bar on sustainability, taking actions to move toward becoming a low-carbon and more inclusive company:\n\n- f Creating an ESG Committee in Solvay's Board of Directors, to help guide strategic priorities and ensure that we execute on our commitments.\n- f Announcing a plan to achieve carbon-neutrality 1 before 2050, supported by a value-creating investment program of around \u20ac2 billion.\n- f Accelerating the energy transition in our plants, with 36 projects underway across the globe.\n- f Engaging with our suppliers, calling on 400 of them to sign up to the SBTi, to help reduce emissions along the value chain.\n- f Partnering with customers and key players to create circular businesses, including developing sustainable tire technology with Bridgestone and Arlanxeo and working on recycling solutions for advanced materials with Mitsubishi.\n- f Developing new non-fluorosurfactant technologies, which has enabled us to explore technological innovations that advance our sustainability ambitions while meeting customer needs.\n- f Launching Solvay One Dignity, committing to nine objectives and related action plans to drive more diversity, equity and inclusion at Solvay.\n- f Announcing the launch of Solvay's first employee stock ownership plan.\n\nAt Solvay, we are REINVENTING ourselves and the way we serve our stakeholders by ensuring we make our Purpose We bond people, ideas and elements to reinvent progress - a reality. In doing so, we are creating more sustainable value for all, as the information in this Annual Integrated Report shows. -",

The appointment of Ilham Kadri as CEO has led to an acceleration on all fronts and a change in direction, as Solvay is now implementing structural measures to raise the bar in all domains - strategy, mindset and operations - and amplifying our ability to create value in the long term.\n\nEqually striking was the manner in which these fundamental decisions were made. The Management and Board of Directors have reinvented their modus operandi, not only as a consequence of the pandemic but also, much more profoundly, as the result of a concerted effort to sustain trust through transparency.

Through these close and frequent contacts, we have implemented a structured and objective approach that has allowed our Group to progress on its transformation journey both promptly and smoothly.\n\nI truly felt a step change in the Board of Directors' activity. Many major decisions were made, on substantial investments to curb Solvay's carbon footprint; our Solvay One Planet sustainability ambition; the Solvay Solidarity Fund to alleviate the hardship endured by those in need; and our One Dignity program to ensure a more diverse, equitable and inclusive Solvay, among others. At the same time, 2021 saw concrete structural initiatives, which are bringing us even closer to the society we serve, with the creation of an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Committee and the launch of a process aimed at more diversity, as well as better representation of our different shareholders and stakeholders. Right from the beginning, the newly appointed ESG Committee set the bar very high, as its first decision was to support the Management's plans to reach carbon neutrality before 2040 in all businesses, and before 2050 in soda ash.\n\nYou will certainly agree with me: the world that we see emerging today is more complex than ever. Its contradictions appear to have grown even more acute, as we are navigating a society that seeks to restore pre-pandemic comfort, while at the same time demanding solutions to ensure a sustainable future. That is why I would like to pay homage to the Solvay teams, which have kept delivering these solutions in spite of highly volatile conditions, generating exceptional results in 2021 and rallying behind an ambitious leadership team.\n\n'I would like to reiterate my/uni00A0full support, as well as the/uni00A0Board of Directors', for the project to create two market leaders in Essentials and in Specialties.'\n\nLastly, I would like to reiterate my full support, as well as the Board of Directors', for the project to create two market leaders in Essentials and in Specialties, which I see as an elegant illustration of our Group's ability to anticipate and make bold decisions in our own right. We are going beyond our G.R.O.W. strategy, which set specific mandates for our different business segments. Today, we are planning to constitute two great companies, empowered to take their futures into their own hands and exercise the freedom to mobilize the resources they need to maximize sustainable, shared value for all.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNicolas Bo\u00ebl Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n05",

We immediately made sure our team in Ukraine were safe; we mobilized the Solvay Solidarity Fund to donate \u20ac1 million in relief aid; and we channeled our employees' own generosity and matched all individual donations with an equal contribution. As an organization, we unequivocally condemned the invasion and decided to suspend all trade with Russia and Belarus, as well as dividend payments from our 50:50 joint venture Rusvinyl, until peace returns. And we considered alternative solutions for the raw materials we sourced in Russia.\n\n## Can you guide us through the highlights of Solvay's performance in 2021?\n\nI.K. The Russian attack took place only the day after we announced spectacular financial results, setting three new records in EBITDA, net profit and returns. I would like us to pause and consider the results from a longer-term perspective, as they represent the successful outcome of our G.R.O.W. strategy, launched in the fall of 2019.\n\nIn 2021, our EBITDA shot up by 27% compared to 2020 - and we are rebounding higher, as it increased by 8% compared with 2019 pre-pandemic levels, lifting our EBITDA margin to a record 23.3%. We have built the muscle we need to power our Growth, with accelerated innovation focused on three platforms: Batteries, Thermoplastic Composites and Green Hydrogen. We are also expanding to serve markets growing at high speed, with new PVDF capacities for electric vehicle batteries in Europe and China, for instance, or investing to reinforce our leading position in sulfone polymers in the United States of America. We have clearly demonstrated our Resilience as a Group, as we improved our cash generation through the pandemic and subsequent recession, totaling \u20ac2.4 billion in 2020-2021, and culminating in an FCF conversion ratio of 37.6% in 2021. We are now facing the future\n\nwith increased confidence, as we strengthened Solvay's balance sheet with a total reduction in debt and pensions of \u20ac2.7 billion. Our endeavor to Optimize our operations has borne fruit, as we have simplified our portfolio by divesting non-core activities and simplifying our industrial footprint. We achieved our Return on Capital Employed target three years earlier than anticipated, as we lifted our ROCE to 11.4% in 2021. We achieved all of this because we have learned to Win together and be more effective in all we do, with accelerated structural cost reductions totaling \u20ac390 million in 2020-2021. Looking back at these past three years, we got fit, and now we are ready to change the game.\n\n## Can you elaborate on Solvay's progress with regard to sustainability?\n\nI.K. It's at the heart of our strategy, and our vision is to create sustainable shared value for all. I am particularly proud that we have surpassed the Paris Agreement targets for carbon emission cuts, as we achieved more than a 3.5% annual reduction since 2018, which is better than the Science Based Target Initiative goal of minus 2.5% per annum. We are resolutely committed to our ambitious Solvay One Planet goals, which we have stepped up to include carbon neutrality by 2050 at the latest for soda ash, our most energy-intensive activity, and before 2040 for all other businesses. We are walking the talk to deliver on these bold commitments, with the decision to phase out coal at three major sites: Rheinberg (Germany) in 2020, Dombasle (France) in 2021 and partly at Devnya (Bulgaria) in 2022.\n\nI would also like to highlight another concrete achievement, which further improves the sustainability profile of our industrial activities. Last year we developed and implemented an innovative polymerization technology which removes the need for fluorosurfactants in the production of fluorinated materials. And we are expanding our impact beyond our boundaries, as customer intimacy has made us a partner of choice for leading manufacturers and Fast Moving Consumer Goods companies, whom we help to meet their own sustainability goals with natural or bio-based ingredients, for instance, or through joint development programs, such as our partnership with Renault and Veolia for battery recycling. In 2021, we also launched a comprehensive sustainability partnership with our suppliers to have an even bigger impact, address indirect Scope 3 emissions and curb the CO 2 emissions that are generated by our supply chain.\n\n## Has Solvay's company culture changed over the past three years?\n\nI.K. We have a strong heritage and deeply rooted values, which were those of our founder, Ernest Solvay: faith in scientific progress; the desire to serve humankind; and the ability to make bold decisions. Our Purpose built on these strong roots and transformed us into a truly daring AND caring organization, that is both performance and people-minded. Throughout the crisis, our Pulse surveys indicated how employee engagement at Solvay resisted and emerged stronger as well. In that respect, I was particularly pleased that 80% of respondents in our latest survey feel they can be themselves at work, confirming that we are an inclusive, welcoming company and encouraging us to press ahead with Solvay One Dignity, the diversity, equity and inclusion ambition that we unveiled last year. I am also proud to announce that you will find in this report our first wage equity benchmark, as well as our",

Our ambition is to keep transforming for the better, while remaining true to who we are.\n\n## Looking back at 2021, what are you most proud of and what do you regret?\n\nI.K. I am most proud of our people, without a shadow of a doubt. Their unwavering engagement and the stamina of our frontline crew, which has spearheaded our topline growth and resistance to inflationary pressures. We are definitely building up a strong, robust company where meritocracy rules - and we will reinforce the bonds with our teams even further, as we decided last year to launch a global employee share program, open to all colleagues at Solvay. Still on the financial front, the continued deleveraging of our balance sheet in 2021 was a major source of pride.\n\nWe have also developed stronger bonds with our investors, proactively addressing our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ambition in dedicated events and reaching out directly to shareholder representatives and proxy voters more frequently, in addition to our intense investor relations activity.\n\nMy biggest regret for 2021 is that we seem to have steered away from our spectacular improvement trajectory for occupational safety. We halved the number of reportable injuries and illnesses (RII) at Solvay between 2015 and 2020 but saw a slight increase last year. Even though we are still in line with the benchmark of industry peers, we will do what it takes to continue improving and aim for zero accidents.\n\n## What does the future look like for Solvay?\n\nI.K. It is more exciting than ever, as we are presenting the General Assembly with a bold plan to create two fabulous new companies, building on what Solvay has always been throughout history: Essential AND Special. We are essential simply because the world cannot work without us. And we are special, because the future will not work without us. Going forward, if our project becomes a reality, we will build on that duality to create two independent, pure-play, public companies - one active in essential chemicals and the other in specialities, one focusing more on resilience and cost effectiveness and the other on customer intimacy and innovation. We would be creating two strong industry leaders that would benefit from the strategic and financial flexibility to concentrate on their distinctive business models, market and stakeholder priorities, with the freedom to reach their fullest potential. The special bonds with our shareholders would remain unchanged, as they would be offered the opportunity to keep their equity position in both companies, which would present distinctive investment profiles. The creation of two market leaders would in fact be an unprecedented opportunity to increase the total value of their shareholding in Solvay. This is the beginning of two exciting stories\u2026 and I invite all of our stakeholders to write them with us.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIlham Kadri\n\nPresident of the Executive Leadership Team and CEO\n\n07",

We have reinforced our foundations, with a keen focus on Purpose, Strategy and Culture and we have delivered. In spite of the highly volatile environment in which we have been operating, we achieved our mid-term financial targets three years earlier than planned, while also advancing on our Solvay One Planet sustainability commitments. We are now ready to change the game and show the world how we continue to Reinvent Progress.\n\n## Creating two strong industry leaders\n\nThe delivery of our G.R.O.W. strategy and business optimizations have led to the emergence of two distinct groups of businesses: Essential and Specialty chemicals. Both have incredible potential and are bold in their ambitions, but they have different - sometimes competing - needs, different operating requirements and different investment demands. In March 2022, we therefore announced that we were reviewing plans to separate the Company along these lines, into two independent, publicly traded companies:\n\n- f EssentialCo would comprise the leading mono-technology businesses in Solvay's Chemicals segment, including Soda Ash, Peroxides, Silica and Coatis, and the Special Chem business.\n- f SpecialtyCo would comprise Solvay's Materials segment, including our Specialty Polymers and Composites businesses, our four Growth Platforms and the majority of Solvay's Solutions segment, including Novecare, Technology Solutions, Aroma Performance, and Oil and Gas.\n\nUpon completion, the separation would establish two strong industry leaders that would benefit from the strategic and financial flexibility to focus on their distinctive business models, market and stakeholder priorities and achieve their full potential. Following the separation, each standalone company would be positioned to:\n\n- f intensify focus on its strategy and growth opportunities;\n- f prioritize resources to meet its unique business needs;\n- f apply differentiated operating models to better serve its customers;\n- f pursue distinct capital structures and capital allocation priorities;\n- f drive sustainability initiatives, including reaching carbon neutrality before 2040 for SpecialtyCo, and before 2050 for EssentialCo;\n- f attract and retain the talent best suited for distinct businesses;\n- f provide a clear investment thesis and visibility to attract a long-term investor base suited to each company.\n\n| Soda Ash & Derivatives        | #1  Soda Ash (global)                                                          |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Peroxides                     | #1  Hydrogen Peroxide (global)                                                 |\n| Silica                        | #1  Silica for tires (global)                                                  |\n| Others (Coatis, Special Chem) | #1  Coatis (Latin America) #1   Rare earths for automative  catalysts (global) |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEssentialCo would provide technologies that have proven essential across a number of attractive and resilient end markets, including building, consumer goods and automotive, and it will benefit from a foundation of strong, global leadership positions. As an independent company, EssentialCo would be positioned to further reinforce its leadership through expansion and consolidation opportunities, including accelerating growth in natural soda ash and sodium\n\nbicarbonate, pursuing growth in the Asia-Pacific region and further extending its leadership in a consolidating peroxide market. It would also play a key role in accelerating the energy transition that began in its soda ash business, in order to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. Following the separation, EssentialCo would strengthen its operating model by enhancing its cost leadership and maximizing cash generation.",

As part of our efforts to unleash our full potential, we announced a bold new step in this ongoing journey: exploring a separation into two independent, publicly listed companies.\n\n## SpecialtyCo -\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecialtyCo would provide innovative, value-added solutions that support a more sustainable world, driving above-market growth and strong returns. It would comprise two business segments:\n\n- f Materials: an industry leader in advanced materials, focused on bringing new solutions to customers that address critical performance and environmental challenges. These businesses have a strong track record of above-market growth, supported by underlying megatrends including electrification, lightweighting, sustainable mobility and digitalization. With a focus on innovation, a robust commercial engine and a unique understanding of its customer base, this segment would be positioned to drive continued penetration of its sustainable solutions to help customers disrupt there industries such as transportation, electronics and healthcare. It would benefit from increased investments in capacity, innovation and commercial capabilities to support above-market organic growth at superior returns and industry-leading margins.\n- f Consumer and Resources: The Consumer & Resources segment primarily consists of businesses within Solvay's current Solutions segment and would be a market leader in providing specialty ingredients focused on more natural and sustainable solutions by anticipating rapidly evolving customer needs. With a proven, assetlight business model that is supported by underlying megatrends including eco-friendly ingredients and resource efficiency, the segment is well positioned to drive the consumer industry toward biobased, natural and circular solutions, leveraging its portfolio of innovative solutions and application expertise. The segment would be positioned to drive above market growth at strong returns.\n\nThe separation will also enable SpecialtyCo to extend its leading position in sustainability, with a clear path to achieving carbon neutrality before 2040.\n\n## Unleashing our full potential to unlock value\n\nBy strenthening the link between each company's unique needs and strategic path forward, we believe we can unleash our full potential and unlock value for all stakeholders moving forward. Each company would have a tailored capital structure that best supports its value creation objectives: SpecialtyCo would be committed to a strong investment-grade rating and would have full financial flexibility at the time of separation to fund its growth plan, while EssentialCo would maintain a prudent financial policy to support cash generation.\n\nUnder the separation plan, Solvay's shareholders would retain their current shares of Solvay stock. The separation would be effected by means of a partial demerger of Solvay whereby the specialty businesses will be spun off to SpecialtyCo. At the time of the separation, Solvay shareholders would also receive shares in SpecialtyCo pro rata to their shareholding in Solvay SA. We expect the shares of each company to be listed on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris and plan to structure the separation in a manner that would be tax efficient for a significant majority of shareholders in key jurisdictions.\n\nThe transaction is subject to general market conditions and customary closing conditions, including final approval by Solvay's Board of Directors, consent of certain financing providers and shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting. We expect to complete it in the second half of 2023. The Board of Directors of Solvac, Solvay's long-standing reference shareholder, has confirmed its full support for this transaction.\n\n09 09",

Meanwhile, our soda ash plant in Rheinberg, Germany, is set to phase out the use of thermal coal by 2025, through the installation of a second biomass boiler. These projects combined will cut Group emissions by around 6%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u273a\n\n03.\n\n## Launched a share purchase plan for employees\n\nOur first employee stock ownership plan offers all Solvay personnel globally the opportunity to buy company shares at a discount of 10%. The initiative aims to better align employees with the Group's performance and encourage them to develop an ownership mindset that embraces opportunities to drive progress and create more sustainable value for all.\n\n## \u273a 01.\n\n## Set out our plan to achieve carbon neutrality 1 before 2050\n\nIn October 2021, Solvay announced our plans to reach carbon neutrality on scope 1 and 2 emissions before 2040 for all businesses, except soda ash, and before 2050 in soda ash. Consequently, the 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions was upgraded to reduce by -30% from -26%, as compared to the 2018 baseline. The scope 3 target shall at least meet the 2\u00b0C criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative. A strategic initiative was launched in 2021 to spur transformative progress with our suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n04.\n\nThe completion of our TPC manufacturing facility in Greenville, South Carolina is a milestone in our efforts to industrialize Solvay's capacity in this field.

Our unwavering focus on cost reduction, disciplined cash management and strategic investments in high-growth sustainable solutions, consistent with our G.R.O.W. strategy, enabled us to successfully pass the pandemic stress-test and to emerge stronger, ready to deliver superior and sustainable growth.\n\nWe faced significant inflationary costs of \u20ac465/uni00A0million for the full year 2021. About 70% of the increase was directly related to raw materials and energy and the remainder to logistics and packaging. To address this, we took actions across our businesses to accelerate price increases. As a result, we overcame a significant number of those costs while keeping our assets running safely with very high utilization rates, ensuring supply to our customers, and protecting our margins.\n\n## \u20ac390 million cost savings over two years, well on track to achieve our 2024 target\n\nWe continued to make good progress on our structural cost programs, totaling \u20ac213/uni00A0million for the year. We focused our actions in three key areas:\n\n- f restructuring, with around \u20ac75/uni00A0million saved from reductions in labor costs;\n- f indirect costs reduction of \u20ac85/uni00A0million;\n- f productivity efficiencies at our industrial sites totaling \u20ac53/uni00A0million.\n\nIn just two years, we have already achieved 80% of our target of reaching \u20ac500/uni00A0million by the end of 2024.\n\n## Strong cash generation of \u20ac843 million\n\nFor the eleventh quarter in a row, we have generated positive free cash flow (FCF), delivering a free cash flow to shareholders from continuing operations of \u20ac843/uni00A0million in 2021. This strong performance reflects our continued careful and disciplined management of working capital, effective Capex management, cost reductions, adapted investments and lower pension cash, cost and taxes.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, we were able to increase our investments by 20% to \u20ac736/uni00A0million in 2021, in line with our guidance, focusing on our growth businesses. This resulted in an FCF conversion ratio of over 37% for the last twelve months - higher than our initial ambition of 30%. The strong free cash flow also allowed us to further deleverage the balance sheet, bringing the leverage ratio to 1.7x, which is the lowest since 2015.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Solvay's teams have raised the bar, setting three new records - EBITDA, Net Profit and Returns - as we accelerated our price actions to overcome cost headwinds in 2021. We also increased our investment by 20% and still exceeded all expectations on cash generation. As we look forward, we intend to ramp up our investments even more, as we are now entering a growth cycle to prepare for opportunities in the coming years.\"\n\n## Karim Hajjar\n\nChief Financial Officer, Member of the Executive Leadership Team\n\n## Taking actions to enhance growth\n\nOur G.R.O.W. strategy is aligned with powerful global business trends and our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap, and guides every action we take. In 2021, we continued to simplify our portfolio, reallocating resources to growth and sustainable businesses. In parallel, we continued the profound transformation of our operating model, to make the Group leaner and more efficient, with a new culture focused on customers and performance.\n\n## Simplifying the portfolio\n\nIn line with G.R.O.W., we have taken significant action to refocus our portfolio on our highest growth, highest margin opportunities - which are also our most sustainable solutions.\n\nIn 2021, following the optimization of several businesses, we have divested six commodity business lines, mainly in the Chemicals and Solutions segments.\n\nOver the past three years, we have simplified our portfolio and footprint: we divested seven product lines and 28 sites, totaling ~\u20ac2/uni00A0billion in sales.\n\nMoving forward, Solvay will continue to pursue opportunities to further simplify our portfolio.",

This has involved strict Capex management and investment in activities aligned with G.R.O.W. and our sustainability objectives.\n\n## Strengthening our portfolio in strategic markets\n\n- f Agro: In 2021, we acquired Bayer's global seed coatings business, making us one of the three leading companies in seed coating technology and strengthening our seed care portfolio in bio-based, seed-applied solutions. Seed coatings are particularly important for field crop seeds, protecting them against insects and diseases and facilitating a better crop yield.\n- f Electronics: We launched a new joint venture with Shinkong Synthetic Fibers Corporation in August 2021, to serve booming semiconductor demand in South-East Asia. Shinsol Advanced Chemicals is scheduled to begin operations in early 2023 and will develop, produce and market electronic grade hydrogen peroxide, an indispensable chemical agent for the production of integrated electronic circuits.\n- f Healthcare: In May 2021, we invested in Invizius, a biotechnology start-up in the/uni00A0UK that is developing an anti-inflammatory solution for hemodialysis. With the need for dialysis treatment rising, the global market for this solution is estimated to be worth more than \u00a31.5/uni00A0billion.\n- f Biotechnology: In December 2021, we invested in US-based company DMC Biotechnologies. Their core technology addresses a key challenge for biotech companies. It delivers robust and predictably scalable biocatalysts using microbial fermentation, resulting in cost-competitive bio-based chemicals for use in animal feed, human nutrition, sustainable cleaning and pharmaceutical applications.\n\n## Expanding capacities\n\nWe have prioritized investments that serve our growth markets. This includes expanding our thermoplastic composites (TPC) capacity by opening a new manufacturing facility in the US and investing \u20ac300 million over the next two years in creating the largest PVDF production site in Europe at our facility in Tavaux, in France, to meet the growing demand for batteries. In addition, we are investing in a research pilot line in La Rochelle (France), the most advanced one in Europe, to develop essential materials for solid-state electrolytes to be used in next-generation electric vehicle (EV) batteries. And in response to growing demand from mining operations for our copper solvent extraction products, we also announced plans to expand capacity at our Mount Pleasant Tennessee facility, in the/uni00A0US, by 20%. Lastly, in early 2022, we announced our intent to increase our capacity in the US sulfone polymers market where we are leaders. These polymers address growth in various markets, including health care, water filtration and food.\n\n## Leveraging our potential as ONE Group to better serve customers\n\nWe are reinventing the way we operate to become a simpler and leaner company. This involves putting in place a new operating model, which leverages our potential as ONE/uni00A0Group to more effectively serve our customers.\n\n## Focusing on customer needs\n\nWe have implemented a number of initiatives across the Group to ensure that each of our customers receives the appropriate level of service, thus enabling us to create more shared value. Through the Group Strategic Key Account Program, we are strengthening our relationships with the customers who drive our growth. This is vital, as it will allow us to better understand their needs and challenges and ensure they have access to our full portfolio of technologies and skills, so that we can co-create tailored and innovative solutions with and for them.\n\nIn addition to this, in early 2021, we launched our Sales Academy, aimed at our frontline employees. This program targets each role in the commercial organization and focuses on upgrading skills. We invested around \u20ac2/uni00A0million in the program over just one year, focused on training and replacing staff. So far we have delivered 11,500/uni00A0hours of training to frontline teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n19",

This has involved reshaping it to better fit our new business profile, making it leaner, more agile and more focused on customers' needs. This has also enabled us to implement new common ways of working that facilitate better collaboration across our businesses and Functions.\n\nWe began this transformation by completely rethinking our organization as if we were starting from a clean slate, implementing a 'zero-based approach.' Our aim was to connect our strategic priorities with our organizational design, by identifying and prioritizing the activities that best support our businesses and customers. Each of Solvay's Group Functions was challenged to rethink their organization and ways of workingpoint apr\u00e8s working.

STRATEGY?\n\nH.T. Our Purpose We bond people, ideas and elements to reinvent progress /uni00A0is the foundation of our G.R.O.W. strategy and drives all of our entities and activities. To make it happen, we are developing a human-centric culture that engages our people and in which we value unity not uniformity to break down silos and challenge the status quo. As a strongly bonded community, sharing the same ambitions, we aim to achieve our passion for performance by caring and collaborating.\n\n## WHAT IS THE 'CARE AND DARE' CULTURE ALL ABOUT?\n\nH.T. Its strength comes from the power of the \"and,\" of breaking down silos and building the ability to deal with ambiguity within our network. The cultural shift here is more about giving our employees' well-being the same weight as our expectations in terms of performance or zero-based mindset. It is about making everyone feel they can bring their whole selves to work while encouraging them to explore the unknown. As we are facing unprecedented times, we believe that empowering our people and embracing their differences will be key to fostering innovative ideas to fulfill our customer obsession. It is okay to try and fail; your leaders will encourage you to get back on your feet. This is a culture that allows you to learn, unlearn and relearn to answer the challenges of an everchanging world.\n\n## HOW ARE YOU ENGAGING EMPLOYEES?\n\nH.T. Employee engagement is firstly about listening to our employees: their\n\nsocial and corporate governance (ESG) at its heart and focuses on putting One Solvay and One Planet into practice at site level. We are in the process of defining clear KPIs and milestones for our plants, to help them define their distinct site roadmaps.\n\nTo improve our performance and reduce costs, the STAR Factory program involves investing in new tools and processes to leverage digital and data science. We will also look for ways to more positively impact our people and the communities we serve, paying particular attention to diversity. Our ambition is to deliver innovative products with a neutral or very light environmental footprint. The program was launched in two of our most critical sites for our materials business: Tavaux, in France, and Spinetta, in Italy. By 2030, we want all Solvay plants to be STAR Factory certified.\n\nconcerns, needs and what they are satisfied with. That is what our Pulse survey enables us to do. Then it is about showing them that everyone deserves and will have the same chance to evolve in our organization, which, in practice, is translated into action by our One Dignity strategy. To go beyond, we try to improve their quality of life through Solvay Cares: through giving the same parental leave to everyone or through introducing the Employee Assistance Program to try and ease their work life integration.

To achieve our ambition, we need to train our leaders to be the best in the industry.\n\nThis is why we have redesigned our leadership model and made it a point of reference based on four principles: prepare for the future, achieve results, lead people and develop capability. This human-centric leadership is also articulated around the Care and Dare approach:\n\n- f Care: leading by example with humility and integrity, having the courage to change and ignite change or diving deeper when \"the story\" does not align with \"the facts.\"\n- f Dare: to value human skills as much as technical skills, to be more DEI driven, to coach and be ready to be coached, and -/uni00A0especially/uni00A0- to make it safe to try and safe to fail.\n\nWe are supporting leaders to be in the driver's seat to inspire their teams and deal with uncertainty. At the end of 2021, we began rolling out the Performance Accelerator program. This program will be delivered by a pool of 80 diverse Ambassadors, who provide Solvay managers with the skills to passionately coach their teams, help them give better and more constructive feedback and to be comfortable with having courageous conversations. In/uni00A02022, we will launch new programs focusing on Care and Dare leadership, aimed at developing self-awareness and personal growth to futureproof our organizational capabilities. Renewed academies for Manufacturing and R&I are also on the agenda for 2022.\n\n## A share purchase plan for employees\n\nIn December 2021, we announced the launch of our first employee stock ownership plan, offering Solvay personnel the opportunity to buy company shares at a discount of 10%. The initiative, which will be available to all Group employees globally, aims to promote an ownership mindset and better align employees with the Group's performance, encouraging them to embrace all opportunities to drive the Group's transformation and create sustainable value for all.\n\n## Innovating in Growth platforms: Battery Materials, Thermosplastic Composites, Green Hydrogen\n\nUsing our Purpose and G.R.O.W. strategy as a compass, we have strengthened our innovation portfolio, focusing most of our resources on what we call our growth businesses. Sustainability and circularity are integrated into our innovation projects from the very beginning, with each project assessed using our Sustainability Portfolio Management (SPM) methodology 1 . We are also using digital tools to transform how we do research. This includes using artificial intelligence, machine learning and computer simulations to enable faster and cheaper innovation and accelerate time to market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Our long-term investment orientation is a real differentiating factor for our customers. It's crucial to the development of our growth platforms, helping us to establish strong partnerships that will bring to market the innovative solutions that customers need.\"\n\n## Nicolas Cudre-Mauroux\n\nChief Technology Officer and Materials Research and/uni00A0Innovation/uni00A0Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increasing the speed of research in the agro market\n\nSolvay's 45 years of expertise in agrochemical formulation gives us a rather unique position in this market. However, we were not organized in a way that allowed us to efficiently store or save all of this R&I data. DataGrow is a new and comprehensive digital formulation database comprising more than 14,000/uni00A0agrochemical formulations, 2,600/uni00A0ingredients and 64,000/uni00A0tests. It allows us to share information internally and accelerate our delivery to customers, as well as to identify and reallocate our resources to growth areas like crop protection and biocontrol. Our next step is to combine the benefits of the database with the use of artificial intelligence to make delivery times even quicker.\n\n21",

Our products are essential to their business, enabling them to achieve a better yield while helping them reduce the impact of their activities on the environment.\n\n' Solvay's ACORGA\u00ae extractants and AERO\u00ae promoters are core to improving the efficiency of our mills and leaching (extraction) operations, ' says William Cobb, Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer at Freeport-McMoRan.\n\n'Improving our effectiveness is important, but improving our efficiency provides even greater benefits, including positive contributions to climate and water, both of which play a critical role in preserving biodiversity. As it is imperative to enable sustainable sourcing solutions, Solvay and Freeport's ambition is to accelerate impact through collaboration, supporting biodiversity impacts.'\n\n## William Cobb\n\nVIce President and Chief Sustainability Officer, at Freeport-McMoran\n\n## Local initiatives inspiring Group success\n\nIn February 2021, we joined the Wildlife Habitat Council (WHC), an international NGO that works with businesses to promote biodiversity conservation. This partnership helps us to focus our efforts and identify areas for improvement, both at our sites and in collaboration with our customers.\n\n' Adopting a recognition standard such as WHC Conservation Certification\u00ae offers us a great opportunity to launch local action plans, but also to propose concrete collaborations to our clients to reduce the pressure on biodiversity, protect habitats and species, and work on the restoration and improvement of certain areas, ' explains Pascal Chalvon Demersay, Solvay's Chief Sustainability and Government Affairs Officer.\n\nA good example of one of our local projects is a landscape recovery initiative at a former limestone quarry near our Torrelavega site, in Cuchia, Spain, for which we received the Cefic 'Ecosystem Preservation' award in October 2021. This vast project turned the former quarry into a thriving wildlife reserve, with 169/uni00A0species of birds and 289 varieties of plants.\n\nThe first chemical company in Brazil to be awarded the WHC Gold Certification\n\nTwo rivers cross our 16 million square meter site in the Atlantic Forest, which is home to a vast range of wildlife species. Through activities such as reforestation, riverbank recovery, education and the installation of a fish ladder to enable fish to migrate for breeding, the site has established itself as a wildlife haven.

Yet to be successful in reaching our biodiversity target, our employees must play an active role.\n\nTo increase employee engagement and raise awareness of the importance of biodiversity across the Group, we focused the 2021 edition of our annual Citizen Day on biodiversity. We also promised that the more people who took part, the more money we would donate to biodiversity associations.\n\nOur employees across the world came together to take part in more than 500/uni00A0biodiversity actions. At our Tavaux site, in France, for example, employees were set a challenge to reduce their digital carbon footprint, with one tree planted at the site for every 100,000/uni00A0emails they deleted. In Thailand, around 300/uni00A0volunteers came together to clean up ten local beaches, helping to save sea creatures and protect the environment, while in Guatemala, employees created an on-site ecosystem for endangered native bees,at their plant in Amatitlan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlanting herbs, installation of birdhouses and a talk by/uni00A0a/uni00A0beekeeper in the green area at our Bollate site, in Italy.\n\n'To witness initiatives such as these being carried out in our area by a company like Solvay is a source of great pride and is further proof of the effective and substantial collaboration between the company and the public authorities, with a shared commitment to sustainability. \"\n\n## Ida DeFlaviis\n\nCouncillor for Environmental and Educational Affairs at Bollate/uni00A0City/uni00A0Council\n\nVisit to a wetland nature reserve at the mouth of/uni00A0the/uni00A0Yangtze/uni00A0River, in China.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'This year's citizen day is a very inspiring experience.

This includes partnering with Veolia and Renault to develop solutions for the recycling and reuse of electric car batteries and working with organizations such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to accelerate the global transition toward a circular economy. In 2021, we extended and deepened our partnership with the Foundation, committing to more than double our revenues from renewables and recycled-sourced products by 2030.\n\n## TECHSYN, a new technology for increased sustainability in the tire industry\n\nIn 2021, Bridgestone, Arlanxeo and Solvay launched TECHSYN, a new technology that gives tires unrivaled strength and environmental performance. It enables tires to achieve up to 30% better wear efficiency and up to 6% less rolling resistance, without compromising performance, helping to reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions, and to cut raw material consumption. TECHSYN went from concept to reality in just 24/uni00A0months, thanks to the expertise and close collaboration between the partners. This includes Solvay's unique advanced silica developments; Arlanxeo's expertise in developing, manufacturing and delivering novel tire polymers and Bridgestone's innovative compound technology.\n\n'At Bridgestone, we fundamentally believe that ground-breaking innovation and the future of mobility can't be achieved without collaboration.

Solvay has been producing it at our plant in Rosignano for more than 100/uni00A0years. Over the past 20/uni00A0years, we have invested more than \u20ac400/uni00A0million, helping to decrease freshwater consumption, lower energy usage, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase recycling at the plant.\n\nAt the end of the soda ash production process, we dispose of the remaining inert, natural materials in the sea. These consist of powdery limestone mixed with gypsum, sand and clay - none of which are toxic or dangerous. However, as this contributes to the white color of the beach, we regularly face questions from stakeholders and the public concerning the potential impact on the environment.\n\nFollowing discussions with local, regional and national authorities, and supported by independent scientific bodies, a release to the sea through an open channel was confirmed to be the best and preferred solution for Rosignano. This is because underwater currents ensure that the limestone does not accumulate, but instead spreads evenly on the seabed, while the limestone that flows back onto the shore and the beach plays an important role in stabilizing the coastline against erosion.\n\nThe process is undertaken in full compliance with/uni00A0EU and Italian regulations, as well as our own high standards for health, safety and environmental protection. Every step of the process is monitored by Solvay, regulators and independent academic institutions and all of this research demonstrates that the water near our operations is safe, and consistent with the rest of the Tuscan coast.\n\nSolvay also works hand in hand with the community to help protect local biodiversity. For example, Solvay participated in the creation of Italy's first bird reserve around the nearby Santa Luce lake, which is located on a migratory route and boasts over 3,000/uni00A0different species. On land near the industrial site, the Group also manages our own certified organic farm, which was set up in 2017.\n\nSolvay has been cooperating with the towns of Cecina and Rosignano through the Aretusa Consortium project since 2006, whose facilities treat municipal wastewater that is reused in the Rosignano plant for industrial purposes, reducing freshwater withdrawals by 30%. Similarly, the Rosignano facility is also committed to reducing its pressure on biodiversity by reducing CO 2 /uni00A0 emissions. This has been achieved by implementing a cogeneration plant and a high efficiency gas turbine on the site, and by capturing part of the site's emissions and reusing the captured residue in the manufacturing process. Some further actions have been carried out and are still underway to reduce the amount of non-recoverable industrial waste and the quantities of natural resources extracted from the environment, especially water, rock salt and limestone.",

Our focus is on building equity first and creating the kind of inclusive environment that will attract and retain diverse talent. If each of us - regardless of our background or identity - feels respected, heard and/uni00A0valued, we will be more engaged, more innovative and, as a consequence, will perform at our best. Our/uni00A0broad program includes nine objectives and encourages a bottom-up approach.\n\n## TELL US ABOUT THE PROGRESS MADE SO FAR IN ACHIEVING THE ONE DIGNITY OBJECTIVES?\n\nN.v.Y.DEI is not a question of statistics, but of culture and engaging people, so our focus right now is on developing a new mindset within the company and among employees. In just six months, we've made progress on several fronts. We're working to expand the talent pool from which we will select future leaders, for example, and we launched our very first company-wide inclusion survey at the end of 2021, which will help us to set priorities and measure our progress.\n\n## WHAT CHALLENGES DO YOU EXPECT TO FACE MOVING FORWARD?\n\nN.v.Y.We are not yet where we want to be, but we now have momentum. In 2022, we will define specific KPIs, cascade DEI training down through the organization and conduct pilot initiatives, to see what works and can be scaled. For example, we're currently in discussion with a specialized partner in the US to help us increase our outreach efforts toward talents with disabilities.",

During the pandemic, we put in place dedicated tools to protect the health of employees and their families. They help the Group, and managers worldwide, to quickly adapt and put in place appropriate action plans. They include:\n\n- f Global monthly monitoring of all employees who have tested positive for Covid-19 or are in quarantine, which is used by site managers to adapt safety measures locally.\n- f A Pulse survey, carried out worldwide every quarter, which measures employee motivation and mindset and helps identify areas for improvement. In September 2021, specific questions were included to measure employee engagement and enable us to monitor this key indicator over time.\n- f The Solvay Solidarity Fund continues to support employees significantly impacted by the pandemic and natural disasters. Over 850/uni00A0individual applications for support have been processed since April 2020 and we have supported local communities through 30/uni00A0distinct projects, including initiatives relating to urgent healthcare needs, mental health support for caregivers and assistance for schools affected by flooding. In early 2022, we donated \u20ac1/uni00A0million to relief efforts in Ukraine and promised to double future employee donations.\n- f Our Employee Assistance Program, launched globally in November 2021, which offers confidential psychological support and other assistance, such as life coaching and legal and financial orientation, to all employees and members of their households. In collaboration with Jaume I University of Valencia, in Spain, we also launched a pilot initiative to create an employee well-being observatory. Through a holistic well-being diagnosis led in three Solvay sites, we will measure the effectiveness of our efforts and design the course of action needed.\n\nThe following initiatives are also part of our well-being at work policy:\n\n- f Starting on January 1, 2021, we increased our global maternity leave policy to 16/uni00A0weeks and extended it to all co-parents employed by the company. This is part of our Solvay Cares benefit program, which provides a minimum level of company social benefits to all employees worldwide.\n- f In  2021, more than 7,500/uni00A0of our people moved into a hybrid mode of working across Solvay's 35 administrative sites globally. This is part of our mobile working framework, launched in 2020.\n\n## Driving change through the Sustainable Guar Initiative\n\nSolvay is a world leader in guar-based business and has been acting as a change agent in this field through the Sustainable Guar Initiative (SGI). The initiative was launched in 2015, in collaboration with the NGO Technoserve and our customer L'Oreal, with another customer, Henkel, joining shortly after. It aims to help make guar cultivation more sustainable in Rajasthan, India, while empowering women farmers through training in hygiene, health, and nutrition.\n\nIn 2021, we took the initiative a step further, partnering with Technoserve and BanQu to further enhance our social impact. Using blockchain, we have built a digital platform that allows farmers to trace their guar from farm to shampoo, ensuring full transparency on prices and volumes sold and enabling them to benefit from direct payment. So far, 2,000/uni00A0farmers have started using the platform, which also provides training on sustainable farming practices and school attendance for children, and includes programs dedicated to the empowerment of women farmers. Perhaps most importantly, it enables women to access a financial identity, giving them the opportunity to open their own bank accounts and offering them opportunities to continue to do business during pandemic restrictions.\n\n## Innovating to raise the bar with new non-fluorosurfactant technologies\n\nSolvay's goal, wherever possible, is to use non-fluorosurfactant technologies in our operations. It is an ongoing journey, which has enabled us to explore new technological innovations that advance our sustainability ambitions.\n\nThe launch of our new non-fluorosurfactant technologies, Hylar\u00ae/uni00A05000S and Tecnoflon\u00ae LX, in May 2021 is a great example of how Solvay is leveraging our innovation engine to drive new sustainable solutions for customers. These technologies use a new polymerization process that does not require the use of fluorosurfactant process aids from the polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) family of compounds, while keeping important properties required by customers and applications.\n\nAt our West Deptford facility, in New Jersey, our new nonfluorosurfactant technologies have been in full production since July 2021. As a result, Solvay has been able to completely eliminate the use of PFAS-based process aids in the US.\n\nThe phasing out of PFAS-based process aids is not yet feasible in all applications. Research is ongoing to transform our products and provide more specialized products that our customers can qualify for use in a variety of applications that support a more sustainable society and green mobility. This includes solutions used in renewable energy installations, lithium-ion batteries and components for compact engines in hybrid vehicles.\n\nToday, we use a very limited number of fluorosurfactant process aids at our Spinetta plant, in Italy, where we apply state-of-theart techniques that eliminate nearly 100% of fluorosurfactant emissions from our manufacturing. This is a concrete example of how we are using science to focus on a more sustainable future.",

In some cases, we blend or transform products so\n\nthat they offer more innovative features, with greater added value. Examples include our surfactant and solvent formulations, as well as copolymer blends or compounds in pellet form, and composite materials.\n\nSolvay collaborates with brand owners and their suppliers to develop tailor-made solutions based on our products.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Main inputs                                                  | Businesses                   | Raw  materials               | Production of  ingredients   | Processing/ formulation      | End markets                                                                    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Raw materials - Minerals - Fossil-based -  Renewable/        | MATERIALS Specialty Polymers | MATERIALS Specialty Polymers | MATERIALS Specialty Polymers | MATERIALS Specialty Polymers | Automotive and  Aerospace Consumer Goods,  Home and Personal  Care, Healthcare |\n| recycled                                                     | Composite Materials          |                              |                              |                              |                                                                                |\n| Primary energy -  Fossil (gas, solid,  liquid) -  Renewable/ | CHEMICALS                    | CHEMICALS                    | CHEMICALS                    | CHEMICALS                    |                                                                                |\n| recycled Secondary energy - Electricity                      | Soda Ash and Derivatives     |                              |                              |                              |                                                                                |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | Peroxides                    |                              |                              |                              | Resources and  Environment                                                     |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | Silica                       |                              |                              |                              |                                                                                |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | Coatis                       |                              |                              |                              | Agro, Feed and Food                                                            |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | SOLUTIONS                    |                              |                              |                              | Agro, Feed and Food                                                            |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | Novecare                     |                              |                              |                              | Electronics                                                                    |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             |                              |                              |                              |                              | Building                                                                       |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | Special Chem                 |                              |                              |                              |                                                                                |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | Aroma Performance            |                              |                              |                              |                                                                                |\n| - Heat - Cooling                                             | Oil & Gas                    |                              |                              |                              | Industrial  Applications                                                       |\n\n<!-- image -->",

At Solvay, we focus our expertise on the links in the value chain where we can make the biggest contribution. This/uni00A0means working closely with suppliers, partners, customers and brand owners to share knowledge and unlock shared value for all. Our new End-to-End Value Chain initiative takes customer service a step further, making the most of our internal resources and expertise.\n\n## Reinventing our end-to-end value chain to unlock more value\n\nDespite a challenging supply chain environment in 2021, we continued our journey in transforming our value chain performance. This included stepping-up a Logistics Crisis Team to help us to navigate the logistical disruptions we faced.\n\nSolvay's objective is to provide the best customer experience in line with our G.R.O.W. strategy, by finding the right balance between cost, cash and service, and doing this in a sustainable way. We approach this transformation by looking to optimize the outcome of the entire end-to-end value chain, rather than the outcome of each individual step.\n\nTo achieve our goals, we are leveraging the full potential of digital, breaking silos through cross-functional collaboration, sharing best practices to aid simplification and standardize our ways of working, and providing transparency through rigorous performance management.\n\nFor example, on the planning side we work cross-functionally, involving supply chain, commercial and manufacturing to define the right lead times and stockholding strategies, so that we are able to offer the desired service level for our customers. We are implementing this approach in a plant-by-plant roll out. We also rely on digital to support our initiatives to improve forecasting, advanced scheduling and planning maturity. These programs have already delivered \u20ac202 1 million in value since 2019.\n\n'To face the unprecedented logistical challenges, we quickly assembled a team of cross-functional experts who helped Solvay navigate the complex supply chain situation supporting the various people involved in operations around the world. This team leveraged our expertise and relationships to support better delivery to our customers, helping to resolve well over 1,000 complex cases over a period of six months.'\n\n## Scott Hain\n\nHead of Value Chain Transformation",

Positive ratings help us to create a long-term relationship with our stakeholders that is based on/uni00A0trust. Agency feedback also has a real impact on/uni00A0our priorities, as it helps us to better understand our stakeholders' key concerns.\n\nIn previous years we have focused our action plans on addressing the common strengths and weaknesses identified by the ratings agencies. This allowed us to achieve results in the top quartile, and sometimes even the top ten. However, questionnaires are evolving and agencies are now sometimes assessing the same dimension differently. This means, for example, that while some ratings agencies identify 'green sales' as a strength for Solvay, based on the use of our Sustainable Portfolio Management methodology, others identify it as a weakness, because of our limited use of biosourced raw materials.\n\nDespite these challenges, we continue to take comments from ratings agencies very seriously. This includes addressing operational eco-efficiency and the need to reduce emissions faster through our Solvay One Planet commitments, which focus on reducing emissions and effluents that could impact biodiversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSolvay received the following awards for/uni00A0sustainability reporting in 2021:\n\n- f Our integrated report was listed in the top ten of/uni00A0the ninth edition of Reporting Matters, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) annual review of its member companies' sustainability and integrated reports.\n- f Chemical Week's Best ESG Reporting Program Sustainability Award, in recognition of our efforts to/uni00A0build a more sustainable future.\n- f The Annual Award competition for Best Financial Communication, a quality review for and by experts of the international financial community, under the/uni00A0auspices of the Belgian ABAF/BVFA.\n- 1.

There was no material capital gain/loss on these divestments.\n\n- On July 1, Solvay announced the closing of the acquisition, from Bayer, of a seed coating business, with facilities in M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, France, and tolling operations in the U.S. and Brazil. This is a natural extension to Solvay's own AgRHO\u00ae family of sustainable seed boosting solutions (part of Novecare) and supports the drive toward more bio-based, sustainable technologies.\n\n## 1.2. Extra-financial figures\n\nSince 2019, Solvay has embarked on a sustainability journey that is captured in the Solvay One Planet roadmap, which is an integral element of its G.R.O.W. strategy and company Purpose. Structured around the three major categories of climate, resources and better life, Solvay One Planet is a roadmap towards a sustainable future that provides shared value for all. Solvay made further advances on this journey in 2021, accelerating efforts to meet stakeholders' growing expectations, including protecting the most vulnerable during the pandemic; setting more ambitious environmental targets and building partnerships to enable the circular economy. The table below provides an update on Solvay's progress.",

(a) Effective 2022, the CO 2 price was increased from \u20ac75 to \u20ac100 per metric ton CO 2 eq. As a consequence, the level for 2021 will be restated to 50%.\n\n## Climate\n\nIn October 2021, Solvay announced its plans to reach carbon neutrality on scope 1 and 2 emissions before 2040 for all businesses except soda ash and before 2050 in soda ash. Consequently, the 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions was upgraded to reduce by -30% from -26%, as compared to the 2018 baseline. The scope 3 target shall at least meet the 2\u00b0C criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative. A strategic initiative was also launched in 2021 to spur transformative progress with its suppliers in 2021. The Group will continue its effort in that direction beyond 2030 within its neutrality vision.\n\nPreviously, GHG emissions had been reduced by -14% at constant scope between 2018 and 2021, of which -11% relates to structural improvements and -3% to lower levels of production./uni00A0 As part of its transition to cleaner energy sources, Solvay has 36 emission reduction projects identified, of which 21 are already underway. These represent 2.5 megatons of CO 2 annually, which is the equivalent of taking 1.4 million cars off the road./uni00A0\n\nThe use of coal for energy production is already being phased out of two soda ash plants in Europe. In 2020, Rheinberg in Germany began switching from coal to biomass, reducing the Group's total emissions by -4% by 2025. More recently, the Dombasle site in France began exiting coal by transitioning to primarily refuse-derived fuel, cutting another -2% of the Group's total emissions by 2024. And now in 2022, Solvay takes the first step to reduce coal usage in its largest European soda ash operation in Devnya, Bulgaria by converting a boiler to biomass. All projects generate returns above 15% and further de-risk our operations./uni00A0\n\nSolvay has also decreased its pressure on biodiversity by -24% versus 2018 according to the ReCiPe methodology (reducing pressure on terrestrial acidification, climate, water eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity). The overall trend is fully aligned with 2030 targets, with part of this progress related to methodology improvements. In 2021, the Paulinia site in Brazil was awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council's (WHC) Gold Certificate and our efforts to restore the Cuchia Quarry in Spain also received recognition.\n\nSolvay's climate progress was recently recognized by CDP (formerly the 'Carbon Disclosure Project'') who upgraded Solvay's rating from B to A-, which is in the leadership band, and higher than the chemical sector average of B.\n\n## Resources\n\nIn 2021, the proportion of sales from sustainable solutions improved by +1 percentage point, largely reflecting the reduction of environmental impact in production within Specialty Polymers and Peroxides, the acquisition of new agriculture activities, and the requalification of some solutions for coatings./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->",

The hydrometallurgical process to extract and purify cobalt, lithium and nickel from Veolia's battery cells at end of life has proven successful. The project is now moving into an engineering phase for construction of/uni00A0 a pilot plant./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nInnovation to develop more sustainable solutions is a continuous process for Solvay teams collaborating with partners and customers to anticipate future needs and identify higher performance requirements for new technologies. As an example, solutions for the next generation of battery technologies are underway with a clear roadmap (Gen 3 and the solid state battery Gen 4). Solvay is the front-runner in Europe for this new technology, and we are investing in the most advanced pilot plant in Europe. Also in the automotive market, Solvay partnered with Bridgestone and Arlanxeo to launch TECHSYN, a new tire technology platform reducing overall fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions while enhancing tread mileage. In the consumer space, customers are recognizing Solvay for its Actizone\u2122 innovation- a unique long-lasting antimicrobial disinfection technologywhich is now commercialized./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, Solvay's freshwater withdrawal remained essentially constant compared to 2020 (+1 Mm3), despite an organic sales growth of 17.0%.\n\nIn 2021, Solvay also successfully reached its target to reduce non-recoverable industrial waste by -30%, well in advance of its 2030 timeline. Much of this was accomplished from waste valorization, which is the process of reusing, recycling, or composting waste and converting them to more useful products. Some examples include repurposing waste for cement, transforming wastewater sludges into bricks for construction, and better monitoring of the waste management data./uni00A0\n\n## Better Life\n\nInvesting in human capital remains a high priority, as this underpins the foundation that propels Solvay forward./uni00A0\n\nOur safety results deteriorated in 2021 following the impact of the Covid-19 situation on behaviors and its impact on operations (volume growth, supply chain disruptions) created by the very strong recovery. The results in 2021 versus 2018 show good progress.\n\nIn 2021, we launched the Solvay One Dignity program with the objective to accelerate diversity, equity and inclusion within our organization.\n\nOn Diversity, Solvay is accelerating gender equity at all mid and senior levels by 2030. The first step was to update a DEI dashboard with associated metrics. In addition, a Gender Impact Assessment (GIA) is planned to identify where current policies may be negatively impacting the advancement of female employees within the organization.\n\nSolvay is also encouraging employees to bring their 'whole self' to work and is supporting that ambition by helping colleagues create employee resource groups (ERGs) worldwide. Two new ERGs were launched in 2021 for African American employees.\n\nOn gender equity, Solvay is also working to ensure fair recruitment and has set a target for 50% participation of under-represented groups, including women, in the shortlist of all mid and senior level jobs. On pay equity, we are collecting data to help us identify if there are unjustified pay inequities across Group profiles. While there is more progress to be made, the current ratio of basic salaries of women to men by management category is encouraging. Solvay intends to publish these results for the most significant countries in its 2021 annual report, in an effort to promote transparency./uni00A0\n\nAnother highlight includes the launch of a new mentoring program: Almost 25% of our female junior managers responded to a call for volunteers to take part in 'The A Effect Ambition Challenge', an international program designed to help women boost their careers. In 2021, 150 women participated in the program and another 300 women are scheduled to participate in 2022.\n\nIn our effort to build a more inclusive workplace, Solvay launched a global survey to assess the inclusive culture. The results have been added to the DEI Dashboard and used as a baseline to track our progress. Eighty percent of employees feel they can be 'themselves' at work./uni00A0 While this is a great insight, it also highlighted certain areas where Solvay needs to focus its efforts in 2022, such as the importance of speaking up when experiencing non inclusive behaviors./uni00A0\n\nIn December 2021, Solvay launched a Global Share Ownership Program, which is historic for the company and its employees- the first of its kind since the company went public in 1967. With this initiative, we seek to better align employees with the Group's performance by offering them a 10% discount on Solvay shares. The aim is to promote an ownership mindset by broadening the employee perspective thereby promoting deeper engagement and participation in driving superior value./uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nSolvay Solidarity Fund raised \u20ac15 million in 2020 thanks to the support of shareholders, directors, CEO and Executive managers, and employees. Originally set up to help employees cope with hardship due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the fund this year also addresses other kinds of hardship such as the aftermath of the floods in Belgium, Germany and China. To date \u20ac2.4 million has been provided to individuals and/uni00A0\u20ac4 million to collective support: 30 projects in 13 countries.\n\nMore information in the extra-financial report.",

Comparability of results & reconciliation of underlying Income Statement indicators\n\nBesides IFRS accounts, Solvay also presents alternative performance indicators to provide a more consistent and comparable indication of the Group's underlying financial performance and financial position, as well as cash flows. These indicators provide a balanced view of the Group's operations and are considered useful to investors, analysts and credit rating agencies as these measures provide relevant information on the Group's past or future performance, position or cash flows. These indicators are generally used in the sector it operates in and therefore serve as a useful aid for investors to compare the Group's performance with its peers. The underlying performance indicators adjust IFRS figures for the non-cash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) accounting impacts related to acquisitions, for the coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds, classified as equity under IFRS but treated as debt in the underlying statements, for impairments and for other elements that would distort the analysis of the Group's underlying performance.\n\n## 2.2. Alternative performance metric (APM)\n\nSolvay measures its financial performance using alternative performance metrics, which can be found below. Solvay believes that these measurements are useful for analyzing and explaining changes and trends in its historical results of operations, as they allow performance to be compared on a consistent basis. Definitions of the different metrics presented here are included in the glossary at the end of this financial report.\n\n## 2.3. Description of the operational segments\n\nSolvay is organized in the following operating segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Materials offer a unique portfolio of high-performance polymers and composite technologies used primarily in sustainable mobility applications.

The raw materials expense can be split into several categories: crude oil derivatives for 36%, minerals derivatives for 20% (e.g. glass fiber, sodium silica, calcium silicate, phosphorus, sodium hydroxide\u2026), natural gas derivatives circa 8%, biochemicals for 10% (e.g. glycerol, guar, fatty alcohol, ethyl alcohol\u2026) and others for 25.5% (composites...)./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nNet energy costs represented about \u20ac789 million (vs.\u20ac497 million in 2020). The distribution per region is the following: in Europe (63%) followed by the Americas (21%), and Asia and the rest of the world (16%). The main energy sources expense are natural gas for 35% (25% in 2020, and 29% in 2019), coke, anthracite, petcoke and coal for 21% (27% in 2020 and 29% in 2019), electricity for 31% (33% in 2020 and 31% in 2019), steam, hydrogen and biomas for 12% (14% in 2020 and 11% in 2019), and fuel oil for 1% (stable vs 2020 and 2019). These percentages have been reviewed for previous years following a change of methodology that now better reflects the energy sources as used by Solvay in its operations.\n\nMore information on the energy efficiency in the Extra-financial section of this Annual Report 4.2.

        "page_content": "## 5. RECONCILIATION OF UNDERLYING AND IFRS MEASURES\n\nIn addition to IFRS accounts, Solvay also presents underlying Income Statement performance indicators to provide a more consistent and comparable indication of Solvay's economic performance. These figures adjust IFRS figures for the non-cash Purchase Price Allocation (PPA) accounting impacts related to acquisitions, for the coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds classified as equity under IFRS but treated as debt in the underlying statements, and for other elements to generate a measure that avoids distortion and facilitates the appreciation of performance and comparability of results over time.\n\nEBITDA on an IFRS basis totaled \u20ac2,038 million versus \u20ac2,356 million on an underlying basis. The difference of \u20ac318 million is explained by the following adjustments to IFRS results, which are done to improve the comparability of underlying results:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac3 million to adjust for the 'Cost of goods sold' resulting from the step up of the inventories of Novecare seeds coatings acquisition\n- \u00b7 \u20ac1 million in ' Earnings from associates & joint ventures ' for Solvay's share in the financial charges of the Rusvinyl joint venture. These elements are reclassified in ' Net financial charges '.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac192 million to adjust for the ' Result from portfolio management and major restructuring ', excluding depreciation, amortization and impairment elements. This result comprises \u20ac181 million restructuring charges mainly related to the new simplification program of the support functions and net expenses for \u20ac11 million related to disposals of subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac123 million to adjust for the ' Result from legacy remediation and major litigations ', primarily related to the remediation costs.\n\nEBIT on an IFRS basis totaled \u20ac1,190 million versus \u20ac1,600 million on an underlying basis. The difference of \u20ac410 million is explained by the abovementioned \u20ac318 million adjustments at the EBITDA level and \u20ac92 million of ' Depreciation, amortization & impairments '. The latter consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac150 million to adjust for the non-cash impact of purchase price allocation (PPA), consisting of amortization charges on intangible assets, which are adjusted in 'Cost of goods sold' for \u20ac3 million, in \" Administrative costs \" for \u20ac1 million, in \" Research & development costs \" for \u20ac3 million, and in \" Other operating gains & losses \" for \u20ac147 million.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac-58 million to adjust for the net impact of impairments and impairment reversals reported in ' Result from portfolio management and major restructuring ' as a result of the impairment tests undertaken during 2021 and mainly related to RusVinyl impairment reversal (\u20ac67 million).\n\nNet financial charges on an IFRS basis were \u20ac-96 million versus \u20ac-235 million on an underlying basis. The \u20ac-139 million adjustment made to IFRS net financial charges consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 \u20ac7 million for the costs related to the early repayment of \u20ac373 million on the \u20ac750 million senior bond tendered in December 2021.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac-82 million reclassification of coupons on perpetual hybrid bonds, which are treated as dividends under IFRS, and as financial charges in underlying results.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac-16 million reclassification of financial charges and realized foreign exchange result on the \u20ac-denominated debt of RusVinyl as net financial charges.\n- \u00b7 \u20ac-48 million for the net impact of increasing discount rates on the valuation of environmental liabilities in the period.\n\nIncome taxes on an IFRS basis were \u20ac-110 million versus \u20ac-287 million on an underlying basis. The \u20ac-178 million adjustment includes mainly the tax effect of the adjustments of profit before taxes and reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets on losses and other temporary differences.\n\nDiscontinued operations generated a profit of \u20ac5 million on an IFRS basis and \u20ac2 million on an underlying basis. The \u20ac-2 million adjustment to the IFRS profit relates mainly to the Pharma business.\n\nProfit / (loss) attributable to Solvay shareholders was \u20ac948 million on an IFRS basis and \u20ac1,040 million on an underlying basis. The delta of \u20ac92 million reflects the above-mentioned adjustments to EBIT, net financial charges, income taxes and discontinued operations. There was a \u20ac1 million impact on non-controlling interests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n85",

The dividend for the fiscal year 2021 is in line with the Group's dividend policy of maintaining a stable to increasing dividend whenever possible and, as far as possible, never reducing it.\n\nGiven the interim dividend of \u20ac1.50 gross per share, with 30% withholding tax, paid on January 17, 2022, the balance of the dividend in respect of 2021, equals \u20ac2.35 gross per share, which will be paid on May 19, 2022, provided prior agreement by General Shareholders Meeting.\n\n## 7. OUTLOOK\n\nAgainst an unprecedented inflationary cost environment, pricing actions in 2022 are expected to accelerate, and full year EBITDA is estimated to grow organically by mid-single digits. With the current cycle of growth investments underway, Free Cash Flow is estimated to exceed \u20ac650 million.",

They met with the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) eleven times. In particular, the Board has strengthened its focus on Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) factors. Business performance reviews at Board level take into account progress on our One Planet sustainability roadmap and every key decision made integrates essential ESG dimensions. As part of their Continuous Training Program, the Board also visited our Tavaux site, in France.\n\nMain decisions in 2021:\n\n- f Creation of a stand-alone ESG Committee - This new Committee oversees the Group's ESG policies, progress and effectiveness, helping Solvay to seize ESG opportunities that create long-term value. The Chair of the ESG Committee, Matti Lievonen, has significant experience in this area, having led other companies' sustainability transformations. In 2021, the Committee provided a meaningful contribution to the Board's deliberations, helping to further accelerate our sustainability efforts. Solvay's new carbon neutrality ambition was the first recommendation it made to the Board.\n- f Launch of a global share ownership program - The Board supported the launch of our first employee share purchase plan, offering Solvay personnel the opportunity to buy company shares at a discount of 10%. The initiative aims to promote an ownership mindset among Solvay employees.\n- f Evolution of the Board - The appointment of two new independent members, Pierre Gurdjian and Laurence Debroux, will be proposed and voted on at the Shareholders Meeting on May 10, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE AND INDEPENDENT BOARD\n\n|               | 2010   | 2015   | 2021   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Nationalities | 7      | 7      | 7      |\n| Women         | 13%    | 33%    | 43%    |\n| Independance  | 50%    | 67%    | 64%    |\n\n- f Evolution of Remuneration report and policy - We have enhanced our disclosure of remuneration following the feedback shared by our stakeholders. This involved improving our disclosure of ELT members' remuneration by providing a clear explanation of how the qualitative metrics (financial and extra-financial) are assessed.\n\nIn addition, we have taken the opportunity to reflect on and integrate stakeholder feedback into our executive remuneration policy. A revised remuneration policy, taking into account feedback received from key stakeholders, will be voted on at the 2022 General Shareholders Meeting. The key policy changes we have made improve alignment with shareholder value creation, strengthen the pay-for-performance model and increase emphasis on the Solvay One Planet criteria. We also ensure that long term incentives prioritize the delivery of strategic commitments related to growth and greenhouse gas targets, while accentuating the focus on returns.\n\n89 89\n\nT",

We seek to consistently strengthen our corporate governance practices and disclosures, emphasizing transparency and promoting a culture of sustainable long-term value creation.\n\nSolvay's governance bodies are responsible for maintaining the Group's long-term thinking, pursuing the vision of Solvay's founder, and implementing the Group's strategy. The Board of Directors is entrusted with challenging and supporting the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) in implementing Solvay's strategy.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Statement adheres to the recommendations of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code (the 'Belgian Governance Code'), which companies can apply on a 'comply or explain' basis. The Corporate Governance Statement includes additional factual information with respect to Solvay's corporate governance practices and relevant modifications thereto, together with details on directors' and executive remuneration and of relevant events that took place during the preceding year.\n\nExcept for the principles set out in provisions 7.6 and 7.9 of the Belgian Governance Code (see Remuneration Report), Solvay SA complies fully with all the recommendations of the Belgian Governance Code.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Charter (the 'Charter') adopted by the Board of Directors of Solvay on December 11, 2019 is available on solvay.com and describes the main aspects of the Solvay's approach to corporate governance, including its governance structure and the internal rules of the Board of Directors, the ELT and committees set up by the Board of Directors.\n\n## 2.

Shareholder structure\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, Solvay's capital was represented by 105,876,416 ordinary shares. All Solvay shares are entitled to the same rights. There are no different classes of shares and the 'one share, one vote, one dividend' principle is upheld.\n\nSolvay ordinary shares can be held as:\n\n- \u00b7 Registered shares: shares represented by an entry within Solvay's share registry, managed by the Solvay Shareholders Service. This type of holding enables shareholders to benefit from free custody and administration fees, an invitation to the Shareholders' General Meeting, dividend and tax reporting paid, among other things. Solvac SA holds its shares in registered form.\n- \u00b7 Dematerialized shares: shares represented by a book entry in the name of the shareholder with a recognized account keeper or a clearing institution.\n\nThe chart below represents Solvay's shareholder structure, including the notifications made by shareholders as of December 31, 2021. The transparency notifications are required by Belgian law and/or pursuant to Solvay's bylaws, when the shareholding crosses the thresholds of 3%, 5%, 7.5% or any multiple of 5%.\n\n## Shareholder structure\n\nSHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Solvac SA gave notice that it held 30.81% of Solvay's capital on March 19, 2021.\n- \u00b7 Solvay Stock Option Management SRL notified Solvay, through Solvac SA, that its shareholding amounted to 2.99% (voting rights) on March 19, 2021.\n- \u00b7 Blackrock Inc., an institutional investor, gave notice on May 19, 2021, that it holds a 3.19% interest.\n\nThe remaining shares, comprising approximately 63%, are held by institutional and retail shareholders.",

        "page_content": "## Solvac\n\nSolvay's largest shareholder is Solvac SA ('Solvac'), which holds 32,621,583 shares. This represents 30.81% of Solvay's issued share capital.\n\nSolvac SA is a public limited liability company established under Belgian law, founded in 1983. Its annual reports indicate that its primary asset consists of shares in Solvay.\n\nSolvac's shares are traded on Euronext Brussels and have approximately 14,000 shareholders. Among them, approximately 2,300 individuals are related to the founding families of Solvay, which, combined, are reported to hold approximately 77% of Solvac shares.\n\nSolvac's Board has expressed its strategic investment objective in Solvay in its 2020 Corporate Governance Statement:\n\n'Solvac supports the development of Solvay's strategy focused on its transformation towards world leadership in advanced materials and specialty chemicals. Solvac supports the Solvay One Planet initiative and its ambitious commitments. Solvac underlines the importance for it to see Solvay maintain its policy stable and, if possible, increasing dividends, as well as prudent financial discipline leading to an investment grade qualification of its short and long term debt.'\n\nConsidering Solvac's stated investment objective, and its engagement track-record with Solvay since its initial investment in 1983, a relationship agreement with Solvac has not been considered necessary. As such, there is no requirement to have Solvac representation on Solvay's Board.\n\n## Solvay Stock Option Management\n\nSolvay Stock Option Management SRL, is an indirect subsidiary of Solvay, and holds 2.99% of Solvay's capital through shares and purchase options. These are held as part of the Group's strategy to hedge the risk linked to stock options granted by Solvay to senior executives of the Group.\n\n## 2.4.  Relations with investors and analysts\n\nSolvay establishes an open and constructive dialogue with the entire investment community. Solvay provides accurate information to promote the understanding of its business and strategy, which leads to a fair assessment by the market. Detailed information on our business activities, strategy and financial performance is available through various regulatory and other publications, such as the integrated annual report, financial reports and press releases, as well as additional information, such as webcasts, which are available on the company's website (www.solvay.com).\n\nThe investor relations team maintains a close relationship with investors throughout the year. The CEO and CFO also prioritize interactions with the various members of the investment community. The teams have been agile and flexible in maintaining a wide range of interactions through digital technologies.\n\nIt is important to note that all interactions are based on public information.\n\nThis year, as last year, Solvay reinforced our communication on our ESG strategy and performance. On December 2, 2021, we held our second ESG webinar to present an update on our progress with the Solvay One Planet plan. The webinar, which was hosted by the CEO and members of management, was attended by current shareholders, potential investors, market analysts, employees and other stakeholders. A recording of the event is available on the solvay.com.\n\nFinally, Solvay also adheres to the guidelines issued by the FSMA (Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority) and fully complies with the disclosure obligations defined by Belgian law and contained in the Market Abuse Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (MAR).\n\n## 2.4.1. Interactions with shareholders, Solvac and Solvay founding families\n\nEvery shareholder has access to clear, comprehensive, transparent information, tailored to his or her individual needs, through a dedicated section on the Solvay website. Solvay also engages with private banks, regularly interacting with their analysts and participating in events dedicated to private investors.\n\nSolvay also has regular meetings with its major reference shareholder, Solvac. The CEO and CFO gave three digital presentations to Solvac's Board of Directors following the announcement of the Solvay Group's half- and full-year results and general overview of the chemical environment.\n\nIn 2021, Solvay's management participated in three digital events organized by Solvay's founding families to update them on strategy and results.\n\n## 2.4.2. Interactions with sell-side analysts\n\nSolvay is covered by 21 sell-side analysts who regularly publish research on the Company. In 2021, one broker dropped coverage due to M&A and one broker initiated coverage on Solvay. The up-to-date list of covering analysts can be found on Solvay's website.\n\nApart from regular individual meetings, emails and phone conversations, Solvay organizes quarterly conference calls between the Executive Leadership team and the sell-side analysts, following the publication of Group's results. Although specifically geared to analysts, these conference calls are accessible live to all investors and remain available in the form of a video and transcript on the Solvay website.\n\n## 2.4.3. Interactions with institutional investors\n\nSolvay mainly interacts with institutional investors following the announcement of our quarterly, half- and full-year results. As a result of Covid-19, all one-on-one meetings and investor conferences have been attended by Solvay digitally from 2020 onwards.\n\nIn 2021, Solvay participated in 59 events, 28 of which involved senior management: 15 digital roadshows, 6 of which were dedicated to ESG and 39 conferences in countries across Europe, North America and Asia.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nT",

They discuss different topics, including quarterly earnings results, market conditions, the prospects for the current year and the medium-term strategy. Particular attention was given in 2021 on improving our cash conversion, generating cash, divesting businesses, deleveraging our net debt, maintaining a strong credit rating and sustaining a strong dividend.\n\n## 2.4.4. Interactions with stewardship teams at shareholders and ESG research providers, including proxy advisors\n\nAt least once a year, Solvay's practice has been for the Head of Investor Relations and the Group Corporate Secretary to reach out directly to stewardship teams of certain institutional investors and to ESG Research providers, including proxy advisors. The purpose of this engagement exercise is to better understand the changes to their methodologies and policies as well as to actively solicit their feedback as to how Solvay can further improve upon its ESG practices and disclosures.\n\nDuring 2021, Solvay organized an ESG Roadshow to meet with the stewardship teams of its top shareholders. These meetings, attended by various members of the Executive Leadership Team, including Solvay's CEO, provided an update on Solvay's key ESG targets as well as its performance.\n\n## 3. BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND BOARD COMMITTEES\n\nThe Charter defines the role and mission, functioning, size, composition, training, and evaluation of the Board of Directors. The internal rules of the Board of Directors are attached to the Charter.\n\n## 3.1.  The Board of Directors\n\n## 3.1.1.

Functioning of the Board of Directors\n\nIn 2021, the Board held five regular meetings and five additional meetings in order to react to current events and implement the board strategy, as needed. Each Director's attendance is shown in the table in section 3.1.1. Structure and composition.\n\nThe Board of Directors' discussions, reviews and decisions focused on, but were not limited to, the annual review of Group strategy, strategic projects, such as acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditure, capital allocation, financial reporting, the review of Solvay's sustainability initiatives, risk management, intra-group restructuring, Board composition and the reports and resolution proposals for the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Board's focus on ESG has been strengthened this year. The creation of a stand-alone ESG Committee provided a meaningful contribution to the Board's deliberations, helping to further accelerate our sustainability efforts. The new carbon neutrality ambition was the subject of the first ESG Committee meeting and was also the first recommendation it made. The Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors have been active to further align our ESG mindset, behaviors and projects with our Executives' remuneration. The Board also supported the launch of a Global Share Ownership Program to encourage employees to invest in Solvay shares.\n\nThe Board is also very engaged in the company's ESG issues and carefully reviews the environmental and governance controversies encountered by the Group.\n\nTo monitor the wellbeing of our employees, Solvay continued to launch Pulse Surveys during the year 2021, the results of which were regularly shared with the Board of Directors.\n\nThe evolution of the Group's financial situation was closely monitored, with a focus on cash flow management (reduction of costs, reduction of Capex, working capital requirement).\n\nDuring 2021, article 7:96 of the Code of Companies and Associations, relating to conflict of interests, was applied by the Board of Directors on February 23, 2021, in relation to decisions regarding the CEO's remuneration:\n\nPrior to any discussion or decision by the Board on this agenda item, Ilham Kadri declared that she had a direct financial interest in the implementation of the Board's decisions regarding her ex-2020 Bonus and 2021 remuneration.\n\nIn accordance with Article 7:96 of the Companies and Associations Code, Ilham Kadri withdrew so as not to be present during the Board's deliberations on this decision and not to take part in the vote.\n\nThe Board established that Article 7:96 of the Companies and Associations Code was applicable to this decision.\n\nThe Board had an exchange on the evaluation of the CEO's performance in 2020, and on the score attributed to each of the individual and collective objectives, which were unanimously approved.\n\nIn line with the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee, the Board set the CEO's STI 2020 (payable in 2021) at 147.4% of her Base Salary, i.e. \u20ac1,695,100.",

        "page_content": "- ' The Board congratulated Mrs. I. Kadri on the results achieved in 2021.\n\nThe Board then had an exchange on the basis of market references and set the CEO's 2021 remuneration:\n\n- \u00b7 Base Salary: \u20ac1,250k, +9%.\n- \u00b7 Bonus: principles unchanged\n- \u00b7 LTI: principles unchanged; amount of LTI 2021: \u20ac862.5k in SOP and \u20ac862.5k in PSU (amounts unchanged)\n- \u00b7 Exceptional allocation of \u20ac250k in the form of PSUs '\n\nThe Board noted that the CEO's 2021 objectives will be finalized and submitted to the Board for approval after the Board has approved the 2021 Budget, based on the recommendation of the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## 3.1.4. Evaluation\n\nBoard performance evaluations are undertaken every two to three years with the objective of identifying how to improve the way it functions and better follow best practice. Evaluations focus primarily on the Board composition, including diversity and skills considerations), functioning, disclosures and interactions with executive management, and the composition and functioning of the Committees it creates.\n\nThe evaluation was carried out at the end of January 2020, and consisted of a questionnaire based on the evaluation process developed by Guberna (Belgian Association for Governance). The responses were very similar, notably in relation to the execution and implementation of Solvay's business and sustainability strategy and on the cultural evolution of the Group. The interaction and way of working with the CEO and the Executive Leadership Team was appreciated by all Directors. As an area of improvement, the Board agreed to dedicate more time to human capital, including talent development, and innovation.\n\nIt is foreseen that a new evaluation will be carried out in the course of 2022.\n\n## 3.1.5. Induction and continuous Board training\n\nAn Induction Program is in place for new Directors and open to every Director who wishes to participate. The program includes a review of the Group's strategy and activities and of the main challenges in terms of growth and competition, as well as finance, research and innovation, human resources management, legal context, corporate governance and compliance.\n\nSite visits are part of the Board's Continuous Training Program, combining meetings with management and local teams, business presentations and field tours. In 2021, a site visit was organized at our Tavaux site in France.\n\nThe Board is actively engaged on the topic of sustainability. Every year the Board of Directors dedicates a specific session to receiving updates on various themes, so as to better understand the Group's strengths and weaknesses, including on ESG topics, and to determine the impacts of emerging trends on the Group's business and performance. In addition, the new ESG Committee created by the Board in 2021 will oversee the Group's ESG strategy, policies, progress and effectiveness to help us seize ESG opportunities to create long-term value whilst minimizing risks.\n\n## 3.2.  Board committees\n\nThe Board of Directors has set up the following permanent Committees: Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Remuneration Committee, Nominations Committee and ESG Committee.\n\nThe terms of all the various Committee members expire on May 10, 2022. The mandate of most members will be renewed, with the following changes.\n\n- \u00b7 Subject to his appointment as director by the Shareholder's Meeting of Tuesday, May 10, 2022, Mr. Pierre Gurdjian will join the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee.\n- \u00b7 Subject to her appointment as director by the Shareholder's Meeting of Tuesday, May 10, 2022, Ms. Laurence Debroux will join the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Mr. Edouard Janssen will join the Audit Committee in replacement of Mr. Herv\u00e9 Coppens d'Eeckenbrugge (who shall retain his membership on the Finance Committee).\n\nFurther to these renewals and changes, all mandate will expire in May 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n101\n\nT",

        "page_content": "## 5. REMUNERATION REPORT\n\n## 5.1.  Year in overview\n\nIn 2020 Solvay acted decisively to overcome the significant challenges resulting from the onset of the Covid-19 sanitary crisis, cutting costs, adapting its capital investment plans and preserving its leading market positions thereby delivering record cash generation and profitability.\n\n2021 was marked by a rapid resumption in demand, marred by significant dislocation in supply chains that constrained capacity and by exceptionally strong cost inflationary headwinds that continue into 2022. These challenges tested Solvay's teams to the fullest, and enabled us to show our strengths as we accelerated the deployment of digital technologies to maximise production and by working diligently to meet our customers' needs and driving price increases in order to maintain margins.  The focus on value creation also motivated us to resume our investment plans with discipline and focused primarily on our high growth businesses.\n\nThe financial results that were delivered in 2021 exceeded all our expectations and indeed exceeded growth trends in a number of important end markets as we leveraged on our unique technologies to deliver superior growth, always at the service of our customers.\n\nOur organic EBITDA in 2021 reached an all-time record of \u20ac2.35Bn, a 27% increase compared to 2020, and an 8% increase compared to 2019 on a like-for-like basis. This achievement is the combination of growth in the majority of markets, improved pricing power in the latter part of the year and continued discipline and focus on cost reductions reaching \u20ac390m of structural savings in the period since 2019, significantly ahead of the \u20ac0.5Bn promised by the end of 2024.\n\nWe were also able to accelerate investments, finishing the year at \u20ac736m Capex, in line with our indications, overcoming supply chain constraints in the first half of 2021. Further, the focus on cash management was maintained and resulted in Free Cash Flow of \u20ac843m FCF and a class leading 38% free cash flow conversion.\n\nThe focus on returns also resulted in a record ROCE of 11.4%, reaching our mid-term guidance of exceeding 11%, a full three years earlier than indicated in 2019. In short, 2021 can be credibly described as a year of significant progress in the group Transformation.\n\nFinally and importantly, these results also reflect the dedication of Solvay's employees, as none of that would have been possible without their determination and engagement. Indeed, employees systematically and regularly provide feedback through pulse surveys using multiple channels. As an example the Q3 pulse focused on engagement showed an overall engagement score of 80% for the Group, a record. These pulse surveys enable Solvay managers to continually improve and embark employees on the Group's transformation.\n\nMore details on our 2021 results and the impact of these on remuneration are disclosed in the relevant sections below.\n\n## Developing Solvay's Employee Value Proposition (EVP)\n\nSolvay has launched a number of programs aimed at supporting and empowering our employees. This includes the evolution of our Solvay Cares benefit program, which now offers a global maternity/paternity & co-parent leave policy of 16 weeks for all new parents, regardless of gender and orientation. Besides that Solvay started a global rollout of Employee wellbeing support program available to all employees and members of their household (including children) easy, free and confidential access to mental health and other support services, like psychologist, legal, financial and wellbeing (relating to nutrition, tobacco, mindfulness, parenting, etc.). Since the start of the pandemic, the Solidarity Fund has provided support for employees and Solvay communities in need and in December 2021 we announced employee stock purchase program, aimed at increasing employee alignment with Group performance and encouraging share ownership available to employees as of the second part of 2022.\n\nIn addition to other topics relating to remuneration, Solvay is excited to be among the very first to start discussions and hold a more open dialogue on fair and equal pay in our Group. In addition to holding internal dialogue with our stakeholders, we are also disclosing the pay gaps in our organization. This information can be found in section 6.3. Diversity and inclusion, as part of the Extra-financial statements of this report. From our 2022 report onwards, we will communicate our progress in this area. We are committed to closing the gaps, and share plans as soon as possible.\n\n## Reinventing executive remuneration\n\nIn our journey to bond people, ideas and elements to reinvent progress, we are continuously striving to improve our governance practices, including our approach to executive remuneration. The remuneration report of 2020 received lower shareholder support (87% compared to 95% the year before). This lower level of support, based on our discussions with shareholders and proxy advisors, was primarily due to the discretion used by the Remuneration Committee to adjust the bonus performance objectives in light of Covid-19. While the use of such discretion was considered a oneoff decision given Covid-19, the Remuneration Committee used such an opportunity to take a more holistic approach to review and strengthen our Executive Remuneration Policy./uni00A0\n\nThe revised policy, which is being put to a vote at the 2022 general shareholders meeting, takes into account the evolving legal, compliance and regulatory framework and most importantly the feedback gathered through our continuous dialogue with our key stakeholders, namely shareholders, investors, proxy advisors and independent advice from executive remuneration consultants.\n\nThe key policy changes we have made enhance alignment with shareholder value creation, strengthen the pay-for-performance model, reinforce the link between executive remuneration and the interests of shareholders through the provision of shares and introducing share ownership requirements for both Non-Executive Directors and ELT Members. The new policy will become effective following approval, if given, from our shareholders in May 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n107\n\nT",

Remuneration of the board of directors\n\nSolvay SA Directors are remunerated, in line with our Remuneration Policy, with fixed emoluments, the common basis for which is set at the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting, with any addition to this decided by the Board of Directors. This process is based on Article 26 of our articles of association, which states that:\n\n- \u00b7 'Directors shall receive fixed emoluments payable; the Shareholders' Meeting shall determine the amount and terms of payment';\n- \u00b7 'That decision shall stand until another decision is taken';\n- \u00b7 'The Board of Directors shall be authorized to grant Directors with special duties, different from their Director's mandate, fixed emoluments in addition to those provided for in the above paragraph';\n- \u00b7 'Each of the Directors responsible for day-to-day management and ELT Member, are also entitled to variable remuneration determined by the Board of Directors on the basis of their individual results and of the consolidated results of the Solvay Group'.\n\n## 5.2.1. Board of Directors individual remuneration\n\nThe Ordinary Shareholders' Meetings of June 2005 and May 2012, which introduced member and attendance fees respectively, approved Directors' pay to be set as follows, starting from the financial year 2005:\n\n| Board fees by type                                                             | Gross amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Annual gross fixed remuneration                                                | \u20ac35,000        |\n| Board Meeting attendance fee                                                   | \u20ac4,000         |\n| Audit Committee Chairman attendance fee                                        | \u20ac6,000         |\n| Audit Committee Member attendance fee                                          | \u20ac4,000         |\n| Remuneration, Nominations, ESG and Financial Committee Chairman attendance fee | \u20ac4,000         |\n| Remuneration, Nominations, ESG and Financial Committee Member attendance fee   | \u20ac2,500         |\n\n- \u00b7 Directors sitting on both the Remuneration Committee and the Nominations Committee do not receive double remuneration if the meetings happen on the same date.\n- \u00b7 No attendance fees for the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Executive Committee and the Executive directors taking part in these committees.\n- \u00b7 For the Chairman of the Board, the Board of Directors used its authorization under Article 24 of our articles of association to grant an additional yearly fixed remunerationcompensation of \u20ac250,000 gross, unchanged since 2012.\n- \u00b7 Non-executive Directors do not receive any other remuneration. More specifically, non-executive Directors are not entitled to annual bonuses, stock options or performance share units, or to any supplemental pension scheme.\n- \u00b7 Solvay reimburses Directors' travel and expenses for meetings related to their Board and Board Committee functions.\n\nThe Group provides administrative support through the provision of an office, use of the General Secretariat and a car to the Chairman of the Board only. The other non-executive Directors receive logistical support from the General Secretariat when needed. Solvay also provides customary insurance policies covering the Board of Directors' activities when carrying out their duties.\n\nSolvay acknowledges that the 2020 Belgian Code of Corporate Governance (the 'Code') recommends partial remuneration of our Board Members in shares, and that our policy does not provide for this. The Remuneration Committee considers that the current Remuneration Policy remains relevant, and is aligned with Solvay's long-term strategy and Belgian market practice.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee frequently reviews Solvay's Remuneration Policy and market practices. Any changes to the policy with regard to remuneration of the Board will be submitted to our shareholders and only be implemented following shareholder consent.\n\nReflecting the Board's particular engagement and interest in sustainability issues, which are central to all key decisions made at Board level, we established an ESG Committee. This new Board Committee is responsible for overseeing the Group's ESG policies, progress and effectiveness and ensuring that we are able to make the most of ESG opportunities that could create long-term value. More on this can be found in the Governance section of this report.\n\nIn 2021 the Remuneration Committee has not made any changes to the remuneration packages for the Board of Directors since 2012. In 2022 Share ownership guideline requirements to be introduced for the Directors together with other changes proposed in Executive Remuneration policy as indicated and explained in the section 5.1. Year in review of this report.",

payout amounts with consideration of performance of the Group and Individual performance of each ELT member fo the results achieved in 2021 are disclosed in section 5.3.4. Amount of remuneration paid and other benefits granted directly or indirectly to the CEO and other ELT Members of this report.\n\n## Long-term incentive (LTI)\n\nLong-term incentive grants for the ELT Members were offered according to the current Remuneration Policy, using a mix of Stock Options (SOP) and cash-settled Performance Share Units (PSU).",

        "page_content": "## Long-term Incentive award opportunity\n\nThe CEO has an LTI grant target of 150% of fixed base remuneration, with a maximum of 200%. For all other ELT Members, the grant target value is set at \u20ac500,000, with a maximum of \u20ac750,000.\n\nThe actual annual grant value, within the limits of the policy, is determined and approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Stock options (SOP)\n\nUnder Belgian law, unlike most other jurisdictions, taxes on stock options are due at the time of grant. Solvay, like other Belgian companies, therefore sets no additional performance criteria for determining the vesting of stock options. The options have a vesting period of over three calendar years meaning that options will vest on the first day of the fourth year after the grant year - followed by a four-year exercise period.\n\nThe SOP gives each beneficiary the right to buy Solvay shares at a strike price corresponding to the fair market value of the shares upon grant. Every year, the Board of Directors determines the volume of stock options available for distribution, based on an assessment of the economic fair value at grant using the Black Scholes valuation formula. The total volume of options available is subsequently allocated to the eligible population.\n\n## SOP features:\n\n- \u00b7 Options are granted at the money (or fair market) value.\n- \u00b7 Options become exercisable for the first time three full calendar years after they are granted.\n- \u00b7 Options have a maximum term of eight years.\n- \u00b7 Options are not transferable inter vivos.\n- \u00b7 The plan includes a bad leaver clause.\n\n## Performance Share Units (PSUs)\n\nOur PSUs are aligned with typical market practices, allowing Solvay to remain competitive in attracting, retaining and motivating key Executives, aligning interests with shareholders and encouraging a pay for performance mindset.\n\nThe PSUs are cash-settled and vest three years from the date of grant, as long as certain, pre-set performance objectives are met. The payout varies from a minimum of zero, if the minimum target is not met, to a maximum payout of 120%, if the maximum target is achieved.\n\nEvery year, the Board of Directors determines the budget available for distribution based on the 30 days average closing preceding the grant date of Solvay's share price on the Euronext. The total volume of PSUs available is subsequently allocated to the eligible population.\n\n## PSU features:\n\n- \u00b7 The plan is purely cash-based and does not encompass any transfer of shares to beneficiaries.\n- \u00b7 The vesting of awards is based on meeting pre-set performance targets (see below).\n- \u00b7 The performance period is three years.\n- \u00b7 An employment condition applies.\n- \u00b7 The plan has a claw back provision for a period of three years after the payout, in case of erroneous results.\n- \u00b7 The payout is based on the value of Solvay shares after the vesting.\n- \u00b7 Dividends accrue only in respect of vested awards and are paid at the end of the performance period.\n\nThe Board of Directors assesses the achievement of the targets set, based on the audited results of the Group. They may use discretion to re-evaluate the targets in exceptional situations. Where such discretion is applied by the Remuneration Committee, the rationale for the use of such discretion will be disclosed. Additionally, discretion, if used, is subject to the award limit stated under the Executive Remuneration Policy. The Remuneration Committee has not applied such discretion in the recent past.\n\n## Claw back provisions in respect of PSU plan\n\nSolvay has the right to claim reimbursement of undue amounts paid in accordance with the plan from any PSU plan participant, during a period of three years from the date of the payment, on the basis of erroneous results that were subsequently adjusted or corrected. This claw back clause has not been applied in the recent past.\n\n## 2018-2020 LTI Performance Share Unit plan performance results\n\nThe results of the PSU grant of 2018 were calculated and paid in June 2021, based on a three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2020. As 2020 was heavily impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, this has left a lasting impact on all Solvay's PSU plans that include performance of the Group in 2020. To date, the Board has not revised the PSU plan performance targets or their thresholds in the context of Covid-19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n115",

The ratio reduced in 2021, due to several reasons, including changes in the demographics of the lowest paid employee, indexation of pay and higher incentives payouts in 2021 compared to 2020, but most importantly because there were no 'one off' payments issued to the CEO in 2021.\n\nThe lowest paid employee is defined as a full time employee in Belgium who has worked for a full year and holds the lowest base salary at year end. The actual total remuneration received by this employee is considered in the calculation of the ratio.\n\n## 5.5.  Statements of compliance of remuneration for Chairman and ELT members\n\nThis report has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe remuneration packages of Ms. Ilham Kadri, the Chairman of the ELT (or CEO) and the other ELT Members, are in compliance with Article 7:91 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations, which provides that, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary or express approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, at least 25% of the variable remuneration shall be linked to predetermined performance criteria that are objectively measurable over a period of at least two years, and at least another 25% should be based on predetermined performance criteria that are objectively measurable over a period of at least three years.\n\nThe remuneration packages are set by the Board of Directors, based on recommendations from the Remuneration Committee. These remuneration packages are also compliant with the Belgian Code of Corporate Governance (2020), except in regard to guidance on share ownership, as foreseen by the Code. However following stakeholder recommendations, such guidelines will be proposed in the new Remuneration Policy, which will be submitted for shareholder approval in 2022.\n\n119\n\nT",

Private expenses are not reimbursed. In the case of mixed business and private expenses, such as cars, a proportionate rule is applied in the same way as to all management staff in the same position.\n\nAccording to Belgian Law, any changes to our Remuneration Policy need to be submitted to shareholders for approval before implementation.\n\n## 5.6.  Key provisions of Executive Leadership Team Members' contractual relationships with the Company and/or an affiliated company, including provisions relating to remuneration in the event of early departure\n\nELT Members, including the Chairman (or CEO), have directorships in Group subsidiaries as a function of their responsibilities. Where such directorships are compensated, they are included in the amounts given above, regardless of whether the position is deemed to be salaried or undertaken on a self-employed basis under local legislation.\n\nAt the time of departure from the ELT and the Group on June 30, 2021 Mr. Vincent De Cuyper/uni00A0 has received a statutory termination compensation in accordance with his statutory entitlements under the Belgian 1978 Employment Contract Act and taking into account his employment start date on February 1, 1987.\n\nMr.Hua Du left ELT on the March 31, 2021 without any termination indemnity related thereto and undertook another executive role within the Group.\n\nELT Members will not benefit from any contractual departure indemnity linked to the exercise of their office. In case of early termination, only the legal system applies, except for the CFO, Karim Hajjar, and the General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Dominique Golsong 1 . The CFO's employment contract contains a contractual departure indemnity of 12 months of his salary after five years of seniority, and a non-competition clause of 12 months. The General Counsel and Corporate Secretary's services contract (1) is for a (renewable) fixed term that coincides with the mandate as ELT Member, but which can be terminated with notice or a departure indemnity of three months' base remuneration. A non-competition clause of 12 months applies after termination. A non-competition clause of 12 months also exists for Herv\u00e9 Tiberghien and Augusto Di Donfrancesco.\n\nIn the event of a decision to terminate Ms. Ilham Kadri's contract, she will be eligible for a contractual indemnity of 12 months of her total target remuneration. In the event that Ms. Ilham Kadri resigns, she is subject to a non-competition clause of 12 months with no additional remuneration.\n\nThe above report and the decisions made during 2021 about the Remuneration of the Executives of the Group are aligned with the Remuneration Policy approved at the Annual Shareholders' meeting, which took place on May 12, 2020.\n\nThe above is in line with Belgian Corporate governance code requirements.\n\n## 6. MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS\n\nSolvay leaders and managers are accountable for ensuring the adequacy of the risk management and internal control framework in their respective Global Business Units (GBUs) and Functions.\n\nThe Internal Audit and Risk Management Department (IA/RM) provides advice and ensures that leaders address the challenges at stake. The team is in charge of setting up and maintaining a comprehensive and consistent system for risk management and internal control across the Group.\n\nThe extent to which Solvay is willing to take risks in the pursuit of our business strategy and our objective to create shareholder value is defined by a number of qualitative and quantitative expressions of risk appetite, operated through measures such as limits, triggers and indicators. The IA/RM Department communicates directly with the Audit Committee, helping to regularly ensure that the risk appetite of Management is in alignment with the risk appetite of the Board.\n\nSolvay has set up an internal control system designed to provide reasonable assurance that:\n\n- \u00b7 (i) current laws and regulations are respected;\n- \u00b7 (ii) policies and objectives set by general management are implemented;\n- \u00b7 (iii) financial and extra-financial information is accurate;\n- \u00b7 (iv) internal processes are efficient, particularly those contributing to the protection of Solvay's assets.\n- \u00b7 The five components of the internal control system are described below.",

        "page_content": "## 6.1.  The control environment\n\nAs the foundation of the internal control system, the control environment promotes awareness and compliant behavior among all employees. Its various elements create a clear structure of principles, rules, roles and responsibilities, while demonstrating general management's commitment to compliance.\n\n- \u00b7 The Code of Business Integrity is available on Solvay's website. It refers to underlying policies and procedures. Employees receive training regularly on the Code. More information can be found in the chapter on Corporate Governance and Extra-financial section in this report.\n- \u00b7 An Ethics Helpline, managed by a third party, enables employees to report potential Code of Business Integrity violations if they cannot go through their managers or through the Compliance organization, or if they wish to remain anonymous. More information can be found in the Extra-financial section of this report.\n- \u00b7 Standardized processes are in place for financial and non-financial activities.\n\n## 6.2.  The risk assessment process\n\nThe process of risk management takes into account the organization's strategic objectives and is structured into the following phases:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk analysis (identification and evaluation), risk assessment and decision on how to manage the critical risks.\n- \u00b7 Implementation of mitigation plans with risk owners accountable for delivery.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of risk mitigation plans for adequacy and effectiveness.\n\nMore information on Enterprise Risk Management, including a description of the Group's main risks and the actions taken to avoid or mitigate them, can be found in the Risk management section of this report.\n\nOur approach to designing internal controls for major processes includes a risk assessment step defining which key control objectives to tackle. In particular, this is the case for processes at subsidiary, Shared Services, GBU or corporate level, leading to the production of reliable financial reporting.\n\n## 6.3.  Control activities\n\nSolvay uses a systematic approach to designing and implementing control activities for the most relevant Solvay processes.\n\nAfter the risk analysis and risk assessment phase, the controls are designed and described by the corporate process managers with the support of the Risk Management team. The descriptions of the controls are used as a reference for the internal control assessment and roll-out across the Group.\n\nAt each level of the Group (corporate, Shared Services platforms, and GBUs), the manager operating the process is responsible for the control execution.\n\nAgile internal control governance has been set up under the CFO's sponsorship: Corporate Process Owners and GBU representatives (Process Risk Coordinators) are part of a network aiming to promote an Internal Control system tailored to the risks of each GBU.\n\nSolvay implements policies and processes applicable to all employees in the following domains: management control, financing and cash flow, financial control, financial communication, tax and insurance policies. Control activities are defined for all of these financial processes and in major cross-Group projects, like acquisitions and divestitures. Furthermore, an online Financial Reporting Guide explains how the IFRS rules should be applied throughout the Group.\n\nFinancial elements are consolidated monthly and analyzed at every level of responsibility in the Company, including Solvay Business Services, the Finance Director of the entity, Group Accounting and Reporting and the Executive Leadership Team. Elements are analyzed using various methods, such as a variance analysis, plausibility and consistency checks, ratio analysis and comparison with forecasts.\n\nIn addition to the monthly reporting analysis prepared by Group Controlling teams, the Executive Leadership Team thoroughly reviews GBU performance every quarter in the context of business forecast reviews.\n\n## 6.4.  Internal control monitoring\n\nThe Audit Committee is in charge of monitoring the effectiveness of internal control systems. It supervises the work of Internal Audit and Risk Management with regard to financial, operational, and compliance monitoring. It is kept informed of the scope, programs and results of the internal audit work, and it verifies that audit recommendations are properly implemented. The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are further detailed in the Corporate Governance Charter.\n\nInternal audit assignments are scoped, planned and defined on the basis of a risk analysis; due diligence focuses on the areas perceived as having the highest risks. All the consolidated entities within the Group are inspected by Internal Audit at least every five years. Internal Audit recommendations are implemented by management.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance department coordinates investigations of potential Code of Business Integrity infringements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n121\n\nT",

A large majority of Group operations are supported by a small number of integrated Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Financial consolidation is supported by a dedicated tool.\n\nAll financial reporting procedures and internal controls ensure that all material information disclosed by Solvay to our investors, creditors and regulators is accurate, transparent and timely, and that it fairly represents the Group's most relevant developments, financial fundamentals and performance.\n\nThe Group Accounting and Reporting department circulates detailed written instructions to all financial actors involved before each quarterly closing.\n\nThe publication of the quarterly financial results is subject to various checks and validations carried out in advance:\n\n- \u00b7 The Investor Relations team designs, develops, and issues messages and information about the Group with the needs of financial markets in mind. It does so under the supervision and control of the Executive Leadership Team.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee ensures that financial statements and communications by the Company and the Group conform to generally accepted accounting principles (IFRS for the Group, Belgian accounting law for the Company).\n- \u00b7 The Board of Directors approves the consolidated periodic financial statements and those of Solvay SA (quarterly, semiannual and annual) and all related communications.\n\n## 7. EXTERNAL AUDIT\n\nThe audit of the Company's financial situation, financial statements, extra-financial statements and the conformity of these statements - and the entries to be recorded in the financial statements in accordance with the Code of Companies and Associations and the bylaws - are entrusted to one or more auditors. These are appointed at the Shareholders' Meeting and chosen from among the members, either natural or legal persons, of the Belgian Institute of Company Auditors.\n\nThe responsibilities and powers of the auditor(s) are set by law.\n\n- \u00b7 The Shareholders' Meeting sets the number of auditors and their emoluments in accordance with the law. Auditors are also entitled to reimbursement of their travel expenses for auditing the Company's sites and administrative offices.\n- \u00b7 The Shareholders' Meeting may also appoint one or more alternate auditors. Auditors are appointed for three-year renewable terms, which may not be revoked by the Shareholders' Meeting other than for good reason.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee assesses the effectiveness, independence and objectivity of the external auditor having regard to the:\n- -Content, quality and insights provided in key external auditor plans and reports, in particular those summarizing audit work performed on risks identified by the Company;\n- -engagement with the external auditor during Committee meetings;\n- -robustness of the external auditor in their handling of key accounting principles;\n- -provision of non-audit services.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, professional services were performed by Deloitte Bedrijfsrevisoren BV, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited, and their respective affiliates.\n\nThe yearly 2021 audit fees for Solvay SA were set at \u20ac1.2 million. They include the audit of the statutory and consolidated accounts of Solvay SA. Additional audit fees for Solvay affiliates in 2021 amount to \u20ac4.5 million. Supplementary non-audit fees of \u20ac1,1 million were paid in 2021 by Solvay SA and affiliates of which:\n\n- \u00b7 Invoiced by the statutory auditor of the Group:\n- -Other assurance missions: \u20ac0.3 million,\n- -Audit and reviews supporting divestiture activities: \u20ac0.2 million.\n- \u00b7 Invoiced by other Deloitte entities:\n- -Other assurance missions: \u20ac0,6 million.\n\nThe mandate of Deloitte will expire at the end of the shareholders' meeting of 10 May 2022 and the shareholders' meeting will be requested to approve the appointment of Ernst & Young Bedrijfsrevisoren BV as new statutory auditor of the company for a duration of three years ending after the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of 2025 which will be called to approve the accounts for the year 2024. It will be proposed to set the annual fees of the new statutory auditor, which include the audit of the statutory accounts as  well as the audit of the consolidation of the Group, at \u20ac1,278,402.",

ITEMS TO BE DISCLOSED PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 34 OF THE BELGIAN ROYAL DECREE OF NOVEMBER 14, 2007\n\nAccording to Article 34 of the Belgian Royal Decree of November 14, 2007, the Company hereby discloses the following items:\n\n## 8.1.  Capital structure\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the capital of the Company amounted to \u20ac1,588,146,240, represented by 105,876,416 ordinary shares with no par value, fully paid up.\n\nAll Solvay shares are entitled to the same rights. There are no different classes of shares.\n\n## 8.2.  Transfer of shares and shareholders' arrangements\n\nSolvay's bylaws do not contain any restriction on the transfer of shares.\n\nThe Company has been informed that certain individual shareholders who hold shares directly in Solvay have decided to consult one another when questions of particular strategic importance are submitted by the Board of Directors to the Shareholders' Meeting. Each of these shareholders, however, remains free to vote as he or she chooses. None of these individuals, either individually or in concert with others, reaches the initial 3% transparency notification threshold.\n\nSolvay is not aware of any other voting agreements among our shareholders or of the existence of a concert between our shareholders.\n\n## 8.3.  Holders of securities with special control rights\n\nThere are no such securities.\n\n## 8.4.  Control mechanism of any employee share scheme where the control rights are not exercised directly by the employees\n\nThere is no employee share scheme with such a mechanism.\n\n## 8.5.  Restrictions on the exercise of voting rights\n\nEach Solvay share entitles holders to exercise one vote at Shareholders' Meetings.\n\nArticle 10 of the Company's articles of association provides that the exercise of voting rights and other rights attached to shares that are jointly owned, or of which the usufruct and bare ownership rights have been separated or are pledged, are suspended pending the appointment of a single representative to exercise the rights attached to the shares. The voting rights attached to the shares in Solvay held by Solvay Stock Option Management, an indirect subsidiary of the company, are, as a matter of law, suspended.\n\n## 8.6.  Appointment, renewal, resignation and dismissal of directors\n\nThe articles of association of the Company provide that the Company is to be managed by a Board of Directors composed of no less than five members, their number being determined by the Shareholders' Meeting (Article 12). Directors are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting for four years (and may be reappointed).\n\nThe Board of Directors submits Directors' appointments, renewals, resignations or dismissals to the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting for approval. It also invites such Shareholders' Meetings to vote on the independence of the Directors fulfilling the related criteria, having first sought the advice of the Nominations Committee, whose mission is to define and assess the profile of any new candidate using its criteria for appointment and for specific competences.\n\nThe Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting decides on proposals made by the Board of Directors in this matter by a simple majority.\n\nIf a directorship becomes vacant during a term of office, the Board of Directors may appoint a new member, subject to ratification at the next Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting.\n\n## 8.7.  Amendment of solvay's articles of association\n\nAmendments to the Company's articles of association must be submitted as a resolution to the Shareholders' Meeting, at which at least 50% of the share capital of Solvay must be present or represented. In principle, amendments must be passed by a 75% majority of the votes cast.\n\nIf the attendance quorum is not met at the first Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, a second Shareholders' Meeting may be convened and will take a decision without any attendance quorum requirement.\n\nFor certain other matters, such as amendment of the purpose of the Company, higher voting majorities may apply.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n123\n\nT",

RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nValue can be created when risk is well understood and managed. Anticipating, mitigating, measuring and monitoring risks is as important to Solvay as the related activity of identifying, managing and optimizing opportunities. The extensive risk-related processes and provisions that we apply with everyone from the Board of Directors and front-line workers to supply chain partners and customers demonstrates this. These processes include:\n\n## 1.1.  Risk analysis and decision on how to manage the critical risks\n\nWe analyze risks in three ways. This includes establishing their level of priority for Solvay, which means categorizing them as 'main risks' (most critical), 'emerging risks' or 'other risks'. We also identify in which area the risk would have the most impact: the environment, people, economic or reputation. In addition, we classify risks according to their time horizon: short term (up to one year); medium term (more than one year and less than five); and long term (more than five years).\n\n## 1.2.  Risk management in action\n\nSolvay's Enterprise Risk Management methodology requires our Global Business Units (GBUs) and Functions - and the Group as a whole - to prioritize risks, develop and deliver on mitigation plans and continually scan the environment to assess whether risks and exposures are changing and test whether priorities and plans remain appropriate. These assessments, which are recorded systematically, enable us to monitor decisions and measure actions and progress.\n\nCritical risks for the Group are closely and systematically monitored by the Group Risk Committee, which ensures that these risks are assessed for materiality and are adequately addressed. The Committee is composed of the Executive Leadership Team (ELT), the Group General Manager Research & Innovation and the Chief Sustainability and Government Affairs Officer.\n\n## Leaders of businesses and functions integrate risk management in decision making to support delivery of objectives\n\nLeaders of GBUs and Functions are responsible for identifying, monitoring and managing the key risks in their domains. Risk management is embedded in the day-to-day operations of each entity, and operational managers are expected to anticipate and react rapidly when circumstances change. Each GBU formally presents their risk matrix and follow-up actions to mitigate any critical risks to the ELT.\n\n## Group risks are overseen at Executive Leadership Team level\n\nGroup-level risks are managed and monitored at the top level. The Senior Leadership Team contributes to identifying risks, the Group Risk Committee contributes to assessing risks and the ELT members contribute to risk sponsorship, treatment and response. Board members also provide inputs independently, bringing to bear their broad expertise Additional input may be provided by the Corporate Risk Management Department, which scans external sources such as the World Economic Forum Global Risks report, the Risk in Focus report from the ECIIA1 or the AXA Future risks report, for relevant information. These inputs are reviewed and validated by the ELT once a year and are reviewed and updated more frequently when necessary, such as with the significant impacts on market demand at the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020.\n\nThe Audit Committee meets with the CEO and all other members of the Board once a year to discuss the major risks facing the Group. During the year, the Audit Committee reviews progress systematically and covers every Group Risk at least once a year inviting the relevant leaders and Risk Owners' to provide overviews on their risk assessments and progress, such as industrial safety, security, cybersecurity, or ethics and compliance topics.",

The Corporate Governance chapter of this report provides a detailed description of Solvay's risk management and internal control system (see chapter 6.).\n\n## 1.3.  Crisis preparedness\n\nThere is a structured network within the Group to ensure crisis preparedness. Members of this network perform tasks and implement programs in order to ensure that their business units and functions are prepared for specific crisis situations. These programs include crisis simulations, media training for potential spokespersons, the maintenance of key databases and analysis of relevant internal and external events. The risks identified using our Enterprise Risk Management methodology influence the scenarios used in our simulations.\n\n## 2. SOLVAY'S MAIN RISKS\n\nThe Group Risk Committee assesses the impact of risks and the level of control we have over these risks. To assess impact, we use a four-level scale: low, medium, high or very high.\n\n| Impact           | Low                                            | Medium                                                                                                          | High                                                  | High                                                                                        | Very high                                                  | Very high                                                                                              |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Economic         | Less than \u20ac10 million                          | \u20ac10 million to \u20ac50 million                                                                                      | \u20ac50 million to \u20ac100 million                           | \u20ac50 million to \u20ac100 million                                                                 | \u20ac100 million or larger                                     | \u20ac100 million or larger                                                                                 |\n| Injury to people | Nuisance (noise, smoke, odor)                  | 1 or multiple First Aid Injuries or  Shelter-in-place                                                           | 1 or multiple First Aid Injuries or  Shelter-in-place | 1 irreversible Injury  or multiple Reversible  Injuries                                     | 1 or multiple Fatalities or multiple Irreversible Injuries | 1 or multiple Fatalities or multiple Irreversible Injuries                                             |\n| Reputation       | -                                              | \u00b7 Local news headlines \u00b7 Low activity in social media \u00b7 Moderate to strong  reaction from local  stakeholders   |                                                       | National news headlines Strong activity in social  media Strong reaction from  stakeholders | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7                                                      | International news  headlines Massive activity in social  media Severe reaction from all  stakeholders |\n| Environment      | Non reportable Operating  Permit Limits Exceed | \u00b7 Damages limited to the  immediate vicinity of the  site  \u00b7 Minor impact on plants or  animals around the site |                                                       | Reversible damages off- site Major impact on plants or  animals around the site             | \u00b7                                                          | Long-term damages off- site   (10 years)                                                               |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n127",

The mitigation efforts described do not guarantee that risks will not materialize or impact the Group, but they show how we proactively manage our exposure to risk.\n\n## 2.1.  Security\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TERM TREND: IMPROVEMENT\n\n## 2.1.1. Risk description\n\nCertain security threats can have negative consequences for our business. These include terrorism, crime, violence, vandalism, theft and cyberattacks, which impact employees or other stakeholders, sites, assets, critical information or intellectual property.\n\nSolvay is exposed to physical security risks because it has 62 high-risk operations (high Seveso level, process safety management (PSM) covered). A number of our products, if mishandled, can cause severe damage For more information on this, see the Extra-financial statements section of the report: 6.7 hazardous materials.\n\nWe also have sites located in countries where security concerns are rated high by SOS international. Of our 105 sites, 98 have undergone a Security Vulnerability Self-Assessment (SVSA) and four have been assessed as having the highest level of security risk - level 1.\n\nThe exposure of Solvay to cyber risk, as for most major companies, comes from our extensive use of information and communication technologies and the gradually increasing automation level of our sites. Like most multinationals, Solvay experiences cyber incidents and responds actively to those incidents to limit the impact. The Solvay management team is not aware of any incident that would have significant consequences on the financial statements or our business.",

        "page_content": "## 2.1.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nSolvay has a risk-based security approach to protecting sites, information, and people.\n\n- \u00b7 A Chief Security Officer coordinates all security activities globally in order to ensure efficient security risk mitigation. A Chief Information Security Officer, reporting to the Chief Security Officer, coordinates all related information security activities.\n- \u00b7 Three governance bodies lead the security risk management effort:\n- -a Security Board, chaired by the CEO, which provides strategic direction for the Group's security risk mitigation;\n- -a Cyber Security Leadership Committee, chaired by the Chief Information Security Officer, which oversees all security activities and provides budget and priority recommendations to the Security Board;\n- -a Security Coordination Working Group, chaired by the Chief Security Officer, which runs a continuous security threat monitoring program and an optimized security program for the Group.\n\nSolvay management provides updates on information security to the Board at least once a year.\n\n## Cyber security program\n\nThe three governance bodies leading the security risk management effort also supervise our cyber security program, which includes:\n\n- \u00b7 the use of assessments conducted by external experts;\n- \u00b7 the use of penetration tests and internal phishing simulations;\n- \u00b7 substantial training for all Solvay Business Services professionals and mandatory security training for all employees;\n- \u00b7 the regular publication of cubersecurity tips to increase employee awareness;\n- \u00b7 some significant improvements in security posture have been achieved by deploying enhanced security technology across the network. These include controls such as endpoint detection and response, multi-factor authentication, immutable back-ups, DMZ hardening.\n\nA significant cyber-attack could negatively impact Solvay in many ways, including people, operations, results as well as know-how and intellectual property. We will therefore continue to solidify our cyber defenses so that we are able to manage the evolving cyber threat landscape.\n\n## Insurance\n\nSolvay is insured to a limited degree against the potential financial impact of a cyberattack. This insurance covers damage to assets, business interruption and cases of fraud, and is only limited by the lack of sufficient insurance market capacity on such risks.\n\n## 2.1.3. 2021 main actions\n\nIn 2021 we continued to implement our cyber security program, focusing on the following key aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 governance and execution;\n- \u00b7 cyber hygiene, including a remediation plan resulting from penetration tests;\n- \u00b7 identity and access Management, including privileged access management;\n- \u00b7 detection and response;\n- \u00b7 network, data and application security.\n\n## 2.2.  Environmental impact and controversies\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG TERM TREND: IMPROVEMENT\n\n## 2.2.1. Risk description\n\nSolvay's activities impact the environment through:\n\n- \u00b7 Our use of raw materials based on fossil or non-renewable resources and our consumption of energy.\n- \u00b7 Our access to scarce resources, including water.\n- \u00b7 Our management of waste, by-products, emissions and effluents.\n\nSolvay manages or remediates historical soil contamination at all sites for which it is responsible, including divested or discontinued, ensuring/uni00A0continuous compliance/uni00A0with applicable/uni00A0environmental legislation. More information in the Extra financial chapter of the report.\n\nThese impacts on environment are in turn creating the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 The challenges and expenses related to meeting increasingly strict regulatory standards and changing customer expectations, standards and purchasing decisions.\n- \u00b7 Changes in investor sentiment and preferences as a result of the changing investor environment.\n- \u00b7 Impact on our ability to recruit employees due to negative public perceptions of environmental issues.\n\n## 2.2.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Careful monitoring and management of sites with a history of soil contamination by a dedicated expert team (about 300 locations throughout the world are followed up).\n- \u00b7 Rolling out a risk characterization approach at every affected site when relevant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n129",

At the end of the soda ash production process in Rosignano, we dispose of the remaining inert, natural materials in the sea- none of which are toxic or dangerous. A release to the sea through an open channel was confirmed to be the best and preferred solution for Rosignano, as it also plays an important role in stabilizing the coastline against erosion.The process is undertaken in full compliance with EU and Italian regulations, as well as our own high standards for health, safety and environmental protection. Every step of the process is monitored by Solvay, regulators and independent academic institutions and all of this research demonstrates that the water near our operations is safe, and consistent with the rest of the Tuscan coast. However, as this contributes to the white color of the beach, we regularly face questions from stakeholders and the public. For more information: see solvay.com.\n- \u00b7 Launch of our non-fluorosurfactants technology (Hylar\u00ae 5000S and Tecnoflon\u00ae LX) in New Jersey, in the US. Today Solvay can confirm that the Group has successfully eliminated the use of fluorosurfactant process aids in the U.S. We recognize however that its work is not yet done. Solvay continues to use a limited number of fluorosurfactant-based process aids in its facility in Spinetta, Italy. At present, The Group is applying state-of-theart techniques that eliminate nearly 100% of fluorosurfactant emissions . /uni00A0\n\nMore information in the litigations section and in the Financial statement statements chapter of the report: F31.B and F36\n\n## 2.3.  Compliance and business integrity\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TO MEDIUM TERM TREND: STABLE\n\n## 2.3.1. Risk description\n\nSolvay management, in alignment with the Board, adopts a zero-tolerance approach in relation to non-compliance toward its Compliance and Business Integrity policy. Solvay's activities require that the following risk categories - among others - be considered in relation to compliance and business integrity:\n\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with governmental laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which Solvay operates.\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, including:\n- -intentional misstatements;\n- -corruption, misappropriation;\n- -by-passing corporate controls, and;\n- \u00b7 Human rights violations.\n- \u00b7 Failure to implement good governance in a joint venture.\n- \u00b7 Failure to comply with chemical product usage standards, such as:\n- -inappropriate use of a Solvay product by Solvay personnel or customers, which can lead to adverse health and environmental impacts, property damage and resulting litigation;\n- -production of faulty products, which can result in exposure to liability for injury, health impairment and damage, or product recalls. Product liability risk is generally higher for products used in medical devices, healthcare, food contact and feed applications, and sensitive applications in general;\n- -chemical and market regulations in countries where a product is marketed, which could have negative consequences.",

        "page_content": "## 2.3.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, policies and procedures\n\n- \u00b7 We made significant enhancements to the Code of Business Integrity in 2020 to broaden the scope and include the issues listed above. The new version was deployed in early 2020, and applies to all employees and majority-owned joint venture partners. Our Supplier Code of Business Integrity applies to suppliers.\n- \u00b7 We introduced training courses which all employees are required to undertake and to pass. We also require that all employees sign an annual acknowledgement that they have read the Code and that they have nothing to report. We have also created several training courses and communication actions to address specific behavioral risks. These include:\n- -anti-bribery and anti-corruption;\n- -anti-competitive activity;\n- -confidential and proprietary information,\n- -conflict of interest;\n- -Human Rights in Business Policy: reporting non-compliance;\n- -use of a gifts and entertainment tracking system;\n- -use of third-party reporting hotlines and a Group-wide 'Speak Up' program to report non-compliance.\n\n## Chemical product usage\n\n- \u00b7 Solvay Safety Data Sheets (SDS) ensure harmonized content by implementing a common worldwide SAP system for the Group. This SAP system has now been fully implemented across the company. Our Composite Materials activities were the last to join the SAP system (2020-2021).\n- \u00b7 SDS are constantly maintained for all products and are distributed worldwide to all customers, in compliance with local regulations and in the local language. Our GBUs ensure that SDS are revised at least once every three years for all the products they sell.\n- \u00b7 All GBUs perform an annual inventory of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) - defined by Solvay - in the products they sell. A risk assessment and analysis of any available safer alternatives is performed for each SVHC identified in the inventory.\n- \u00b7 Recall procedures are developed and deployed as prescribed by the product stewardship programs.\n- \u00b7 Insurance reduces the financial impact of a product liability risk, including for first-party and third-party product recalls.\n\n## 2.3.3. 2021 main actions\n\n## Business Integrity\n\nAs part of our deployment of the new Code of Business Integrity in 2020, all employees were required to read the new Code, take a mandatory e-learning course and sign an acknowledgement that they had read it. The e-learning training course focused on bribery and corruption, confidential and proprietary information, conflicts of interest, harassment and how to lodge 'Speak Up' complaints. A new round of training was launched in 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 99% of employees have received training on our Code of Business Integrity;\n- \u00b7 All employees were required to take the training module on bribery and corruption and a separate Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption (ABAC) training course is now available to employees through the Group's e-training platform. In 2021, we launched a new ABAC training campaign, which resulted in a participation rate of 96%.\n\n## Chemical product usage\n\nThe Solvay Product Safety Management Process (PSMP) identifies risks relating to products marketed by Solvay. All GBUs use this process, with a specific focus on prioritizing the required risk assessments in the product portfolio and on regularly carrying out risk assessments for the most sensitive product applications.\n\nMore information on this can be found in the Extra-financial chapter of the report: 3.2. Management of the legal, ethics, and regulatory framework.\n\n## 2.4.  Operations safety\n\n## RISK HORIZON: SHORT TERM TREND: STABLE\n\n## 2.4.1. Risk description\n\nThe safety of our people is a priority for Solvay, as is specified in our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap. A major accident - whether occupational, process or transport related - that is linked to our internal or outsourced activities may cause human, environmental or asset damages, lead to significant exposure or cause injuries or fatalities. Solvay industrial sites, like most industrial operations, carry out high pressure and high temperature processes. We also use chemical substances that have risks associated with their chemical composition.\n\nFor more information about Solvay's management approach, see the Extra-financial chapter of the report: 6.1 Employee Health and Safety, 6.8 Critical incident risk management (process safety), 6.7 Hazardous materials.\n\n131",

        "page_content": "132\n\nWe have identified four major operational risks:\n\n- \u00b7 An occupational safety incident which results in a fatality or irreversible (life-altering) injury;\n- \u00b7 A severe process safety incident which results in fatalities, irreversible injuries, environmental harm, and/or loss of physical assets;\n- \u00b7 Chronic exposure to occupational agents - chemical, physical, biological or psychological - known to cause work-related disease;\n- \u00b7 A severe transport accident in connection with hazardous chemical transportation which results in irreversible injuries, fatalities or environmental damages.\n\n## 2.4.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\nIn 2018, Solvay redefined our Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) strategy and issued a new set of Minimum Requirements to create a shared understanding and approach to mitigating major risks. As part of this new approach, we also introduced a new way of working, including a more collaborative and supportive approach to HSE across the Group.\n\nOur HSE strategy is based on the following four levers:\n\n- \u00b7 Culture: promoting a culture of safety for all employees and contractors.\n- \u00b7 Continuous improvement: utilizing networking, best practice, common methods and tools, Solvay HSE Minimum Requirements, external monitoring and benchmarking to improve our HSE performance.\n- \u00b7 Competency: ensuring all employees have the right level of knowledge and skills to put in place the HSE Minimum Requirements, starting with those working in key positions.\n- \u00b7 Compliance: detecting and mitigating regulatory and non-regulatory compliance issues, with a focus on priority risks, both in our operations and commercialized products.\n\n## Occupational safety\n\nSolvay has consistently prioritized occupational safety. The results of our efforts are positive, showing a 30% reduction in the total number of injuries, and no fatalities, over the last three years. Our efforts to create a safety culture where all employees work together and care for one another are based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Solvay's Safety Excellence Plan, which enables the involvement and engagement of all Solvay employees. It includes activities such as Safety Days, Leadership Safety Visits, Behavior Based Safety programs, and an individual HSE annual objective for each employee.\n- \u00b7 The Solvay HSE Minimum Requirements for the Solvay Life Saving Rules (SLSR).\n- \u00b7 The Creating Safety program for leadership teams, aimed at changing mindsets and behavior.\n- \u00b7 A monthly review of occupational safety results by the relevant GBUs and at the Executive Leadership Team level.\n\n## Industrial Hygiene & Occupational Health\n\nSolvay has implemented a comprehensive approach to reducing the chemical exposure risk in the workplace. Our approach includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Chemical risk assessments and risk-based medical surveillance, using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies;\n- \u00b7 Pandemic preparedness and mitigation plans;\n- \u00b7 Human biomonitoring, when warranted;\n- \u00b7 Improving and adapting working conditions;\n- \u00b7 Promoting general physical and mental health;\n- \u00b7 Setting more conservative in-house exposure limits for critical substances.\n\n## Process safety management\n\nSolvay has created and uses a Process Safety Management System. Among other things, this system includes:\n\n- \u00b7 A preventive risk-based approach founded on systematic Process Hazard Analyses (PHA), and the identification of critical scenarios for which mitigation action must be implemented in a committed time frame;\n- \u00b7 Management of changes (MOC);\n- \u00b7 A team of process safety experts trained to apply the PHA methodologies.\n\n## Transport Safety\n\nWe have put in place a number of tools and procedures that allow us to identify and take action to mitigate transport-related risks. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 qualification standards for carriers of dangerous goods;\n- \u00b7 enhanced training where appropriate;\n- \u00b7 implementation of safety procedures and guidelines;\n- \u00b7 collection and sharing of lessons learned;\n- \u00b7 providing emergency response hotlines worldwide and in many languages.\n\n## Environment\n\nTo mitigate environmental risks, the following minimum requirements must be respected:\n\n- \u00b7 The discharge of substances, wastewater and atmospheric emissions from our plants must meet all applicable emission limit values;\n- \u00b7 Waste must be disposed of using appropriate technologies and qualified companies;",

Risk description\n\nThe Group strategy to address climate-related risks, as defined by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), could be ineffective and damage the environment, the lives of current and later generations and Solvay's reputation. This, in turn, could cause business losses, undervaluation and difficulty attracting long-term investors. The possible risks to Solvay that we have identified are as follows:\n\n## A - Transition risks:\n\nSolvay's energy mix (use of coal), raw materials (use of petrochemicals) and end markets (automotive and aerospace, building and construction) mean that we are exposed to risks and opportunities as part of the energy transition. This transition risk can be further detailed as displayed hereafter:\n\n- \u00b7 Policies and legal context: regulations and actions to limit CO 2 emissions, such as increasing carbon taxes, barring internal combustion engines, mandating use of certain fuel types, tightening environmental standards.\n- \u00b7 Technology: unsuccessful investment in new, lower-emission technologies.\n- \u00b7 Markets: failure to adapt to changing customer behavior.\n- \u00b7 Financial: inability to cope with the influence of climate change on investors' and lenders' decisions.\n- \u00b7 Changed climate: failing to adequately anticipate the impact of upcoming changes on industrial operations and in the value chain or the tightening of environmental standards.\n- \u00b7 Reputation: negative stakeholder attitudes caused by failing to address stakeholder climate change concerns effectively.\n\n## B- Physical risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Sites in water scarcity regions\n- \u00b7 Sites in flood zone\n\n## 2.5.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Implementation of a strategy focused on shifting to businesses with reduced environmental exposure and high value-adding potential that have positive environmental effects.\n- \u00b7 Progression toward ambitious 2030 goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations by 30% - an annual pace aligned with the Paris Agreement objectives - and to phase-out the use of coal for energy where renewable alternatives exist.\n- \u00b7 Design of a Carbon Neutrality roadmap to reach carbon neutrality on scope 1 and 2 by 2040 for all GBUs, expect Soda Ash and before 2050 for the hard to abate Soda Ash activity. This roadmap will require around \u20ac2 bn investments and is expected to generate compelling economic returns.\n- \u00b7 Develop scope 3 targets to set Science Based Targets by mid-2022, as committed in October 2020, connecting with customers and suppliers, especially through the suppliers engagement program which engaged 250+ executives from 130+ companies, creating 60 collaborative projects.\n- \u00b7 Assessment of potential climate change impacts on our operations due to flooding, water scarcity, hurricanes, and other environmental events through the application of best-in-class models and collaboration with external experts.\n- \u00b7 Establishment of a task force that develops renewable energy and other energy transition projects adapted to local markets and regulations.\n- \u00b7 Internal carbon price was raised from \u20ac50 to \u20ac100 per metric ton of CO 2 on greenhouse gas emissions from operations and a Sustainable Portfolio Management tool (SPM) assessment on all capital investment decisions worldwide.\n- \u00b7 Alignment of R&I projects with market expectations and assessment of operations exposure relating to the environment using an SPM lens.\n- \u00b7 Linking long term incentives of senior executives to our achievements in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## 2.5.3. 2021 main actions\n\nOur work covers four main workstreams:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate emissions reductions actions are described in detail in the Extra-financial section of the report. Among the numerous actions taken,\n- -In Rheinberg (Germany), the first boiler shifting coal to biomass started in May 2021, and the decision to install a 2nd boiler to start before 2025 has been taken. This will allow to phase out coal and reduce the Group GHG emissions by 4%\n- -In Dombasle (France), the decision to shift from coal to RDF (Refuse Derived Fuel) has been taken and will allow to phase out coal by 2024 and reduce the Group GHG emissions by 2%\n- -The Energy Transition multiple projects implemented or committed globally in 2021 will reach 35% renewable electricity purchase\n- \u00b7 An annual review of climate-related risks and opportunities for each product in each market performed with the Solvay SPM tool. This shows that our climate-related 'Solutions' (18% of sales) out number our climate-related 'Challenges' (3% of sales). For more information, see 5.1 'Product Design and Life Cycle Management' in the Extra-financial Statements section of this report.\n- \u00b7 A scenario analysis, conforming to TCFD recommendations, was performed in 2019, using the International Energy Agency's 'Sustainable Development' scenario as a reference. The impact on energy and CO 2 costs and on markets were assessed, showing that the potential impact on sales outweighs the potential impact on costs. Four ELT members were directly involved in the exercise, which will be updated in 2022, taking into account the IPCC AR6 report conclusions. Updates of the IEA 'Sustainable Development' in 2020 did not justify a revision of the scenario analysis. A full revision of the scenario analysis is planned in 2022, including reference to recent 1.5\u00b0C scenarios.",

This exercise identifies sites in risk areas and a maximum foreseeable loss greater than 10M USD. Seven Solvay sites are located in high frequency (2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of US$13.5-196.4 million. Fifteen Solvay sites are located in low frequency (0.2% chance per year) flood areas, with a loss expectancy range of US$14-243.3 million. One site is located in a wind exposed area, with a loss expectancy of US$17.3 million. Solvay has a damage insurance program in place to cover catastrophic risks, while covering smaller losses through self-insurance.\n- \u00b7 Sites in areas of water scarcity have been identified, and the risks have been assessed based on their water consumption and maximum foreseeable loss. Thirty-one Solvay sites are located in areas subject to hydric stress, of which eight have been identified as having a high business impact.

Regulatory framework for chemicals sustainability\n\n## RISK HORIZON: MEDIUM TERM\n\n## 2.6.1. Risk description\n\nIn all major regions chemicals management legislation is developing and changing, but particularly in the EU and the US. We are closely monitoring the upcoming European Union Chemical Strategy for Sustainability (CSS) regulatory framework, including its possible impact on our business and operations. We are also considering the potential additional opportunities that could come from this legislation, regarding less harmful and more biodegradable and sustainable products. Based on public comments from EU regulators and key decision makers the main focus will be on consumer facing products and protecting human health and the environment. The US Administration is also developing a stricter regulatory framework for chemicals, as well as a framework relating to Environmental Justice.\n\n## 2.6.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Solvay has participated in an industry wide impact assessment, led by the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC), of the current proposals in the CSS. Within this framework, the Sustainability Department of the Group of Solvay analysed the business impact with our GBUs.\n- \u00b7 The Government and Public Affairs Department(GPA) of Solvay, together with the Product Stewardship team in our Industrial Function, is closely monitoring the regulatory and legislative proposals that will come from the CSS, starting in Q1 2022. Meanwhile the GPA has set up a multidisciplinary Task Force within Solvay to analyze new regulatory and legislative proposals and develop an advocacy strategy.\n\n## 2.7.  Emerging risk\n\n## 2.7.1. Geopolitical impacts on trade and supply chain\n\nGeopolitical rivalries can cause trade wars, supply chain constraints and regulatory deadlocks. This can make it impossible to trade across our three key regions, impacting financial results, and potentially leading to fines and/or litigation. Our actions to mitigate this threat are currently being defined.\n\n## 3. OTHER RISKS\n\n## 3.1.  Market and growth - strategic risk\n\n## RISK HORIZON: MEDIUM TO LONG TERM\n\n## 3.1.1. Risk description\n\nStrategic risks in market and growth concern Solvay's exposure to developments in our markets or our competitive environment, and the risk of making erroneous strategic decisions.\n\n## 3.1.2. Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Systematic and formal analysis of markets and marketing challenges with respect to investments and innovation project ramp-ups.\n- \u00b7 Regular performance review of strategy deployment.\n- \u00b7 Development of long term GDP+ growth markets and building on sustainable development opportunities, particularly in the mobility, Home and Personal Care, Healthcare, resources and environment, electrical and electronics, and Agro, Feed and Food markets.\n- \u00b7 Development of customized, mission-critical solutions with Solvay key accounts.\n- \u00b7 Adaptation of our operations to new energy and CO 2 markets.\n- \u00b7 Strong focus on cash conversion and generation.\n- \u00b7 Disposal of businesses that fall below the cyclicality threshold.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n135",

We regularly monitor Credit Default Swaps trends to assess changes in bank creditworthiness and take rapid action if required.\n- \u00b7 For our commercial activities, Solvay's external customer risk and cash collection are monitored by a professional network of credit managers and cash collectors located in the Group's various operating regions and countries. Their controls are supported by a set of detailed procedures and managed through Corporate and GBU Credit Committees. These loss mitigation measures have led, over the past few years, to a record low rate of customer defaults.\n\n## Pension governance and pension plan optimization\n\n- \u00b7 Pension governance: Solvay engages proactively and constructively with trustees and stakeholders to ensure that funding, liability management and investment policies are appropriate, in line with best practice and in full compliance with domestic regulatory expectations and laws.\n- \u00b7 Pension plan optimization: we reduce the Group's exposure to defined-benefit plans either by converting existing plans into pension plans with a lower risk profile for future services or closing them to new entrants.\n- \u00b7 For each of the main Group pension plans, which represent about 90% of the Group's gross or net pension obligations, Asset Liability Management (ALM) analyses are performed at least once every three years to identify and manage corresponding risks.\n\n## Control processes for tax regulation compliance and transfer pricing policies\n\n- \u00b7 Our control processes for tax regulation compliance involve monitoring procedures and systems, which we carry out thorough internal reviews and audits performed by reputable external consultants.\n- \u00b7 Our transfer pricing policies, procedures and controls are aimed at meeting the requirements of the authorities.\n- \u00b7 Solvay's Tax department pays close attention to the correct interpretation and application of new tax rules This ensures compliance with applicable rules and regulations and avoids tax and future litigation risks.\n\n## 3.3.3. 2021 main actions\n\n- \u00b7 Successful cash tender offer of the \u20ac750 million bonds due in September 2022 (3m par call, coupon of 1.625%) with a repurchase of \u20ac372.5 million bonds (outstanding: \u20ac377.5 million).\n- \u00b7 Monitoring of ESG debt capital market issuances in the chemical industry.\n- \u00b7 Compliance for \"Ibor-transition rates\" to risk free rates and adjustments of financing documentations\n- \u00b7 Competitive financing of both biomass boilers in Rheinberg (commission of a first boiler and construction of a second), including ESG content.\n- \u00b7 Optimizing our liquidity reserves and rebalancing the refinancing strategy of some bilateral credit facilities.\n- \u00b7 Extension of the Treasury Management Systems to bonds and credit facilities;\n- \u00b7 Additional voluntary pension contributions: Belgium up to \u20ac100 million in Q1 2021; UK up to \u20ac140 million in Q4 2021. Further contribution of up to \u20ac155 million in Germany under consideration for early 2022.\n\n## 3.4.  IT risk\n\n## 3.4.1. Risk description\n\nOur IT risk relates to an inability to:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensure the continuity of digital technology services to business;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n137",

Prevention and mitigation actions\n\n- \u00b7 Close monitoring of the cybersecurity roadmap. (see cybersecurity section).\n- \u00b7 Close monitoring of security and performance indicators.\n- \u00b7 Annual IT audit program to ensure compliance with group security policies.\n\n## 4. LITIGATION\n\nWith our variety of activities and geographic distribution, the Solvay Group is exposed to legal risks, particularly in the areas of product liability, contractual relations, antitrust laws, patent disputes, tax assessments and HSE matters. In this context, litigation cannot be avoided and is sometimes necessary in order to defend the rights and interests of the Group.\n\nThe outcome of proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. It is therefore possible that adverse final court decisions or arbitration awards could lead to liabilities (and expenses) that are not covered, or not fully covered, by provisions or insurance, and that could have a material impact on the revenues and earnings of the Group.\n\nOngoing legal proceedings involving the Solvay Group that are currently considered to involve significant risks are outlined below. The legal proceedings described below do not constitute an exhaustive list.\n\nThe fact that litigation proceedings are reported below is unrelated to the merits of the cases. In all the cases cited below, we are defending ourselves vigorously and believe in the merits of our defense.\n\nFor certain cases, we have created reserves or provisions in accordance with accounting rules, to cover financial risk and defense costs (see the section 'Provisions for litigation to the consolidated financial statements' in this report).\n\n## Antitrust proceedings\n\nIn Brazil, CADE (the Brazilian antitrust authority) issued fines against Solvay and others in May 2012, relating to/uni00A0hydrogen peroxide activities, and in February 2016, relating to perborate activities. Solvay's share of these fines amounts to \u20ac29.6 million and \u20ac3.99 million respectively. We have filed a claim with the Brazilian Federal Court contesting these administrative fines.\n\n## HSE related proceedings\n\n- \u00b7 Asbestos Cases: Up to now, 21 civil proceedings have been brought before Italian Courts by past workers and relatives of deceased workers at Solvay sites seeking damages, provisionally quantified at \u20ac12 million, in relation to diseases allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos./uni00A0\n- -Five proceedings have ended with damages awarded for a total of around \u20ac40,000./uni00A0\n- -One proceeding has ended with damages awarded of approximately \u20ac550,000./uni00A0\n- -One proceeding has ended with a decision entirely favorable to Solvay, with an appeal pending./uni00A0\n- -Ten proceedings are currently pending before the Courts of First Instance./uni00A0\n- -One proceeding is presently pending before the Court of Appeal, after damages amounting to \u20ac13,000 were awarded by the Court of First Instance./uni00A0\n- -One proceeding is currently pending before the Cassation Court, after damages amounting to \u20ac3,000 were awarded by the Court of Appeal./uni00A0\n- -Two proceedings were settled before the Court of Appeal for about \u20ac8,000 each./uni00A0\n- -One proceeding has been definitively terminated in favor of Solvay.\n- \u00b7 Rosignano and Spinetta sites: criminal preliminary investigations are pending before the Criminal Court of Livorno and of Alessandria respectively, regarding the contamination of certain areas outside these industrial sites.\n- \u00b7 Bussi site: administrative litigation is pending in relation to the identification of the polluter of external areas at Bussi (external discharges, sold in 2017) and of the industrial site (divested in 2016).\n- \u00b7 PFAs: Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC (SpP) is a defendant in 25 separate lawsuits in the US relating to SpP's use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The vast majority of these cases are in the federal and state courts in New Jersey, in the US, and the majority are claims by private plaintiffs seeking medical monitoring or compensation for personal injury or other economic loss. Two of the cases involve civil claims by separate US State governmental authorities - New Jersey and Michigan - seeking various damages, including natural resource damages. The lawsuit brought by the State of New Jersey also seeks the environmental cleanup of PFAS pollution caused by SpP's lone operating facility in New Jersey./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\n## Pharmaceutical activities (discontinued):/uni00A0\n\nThe contractual arrangements for the sale of our pharmaceutical activities in February 2010 defined terms and conditions for the allocation and sharing of liability arising out of activities carried out before the sale. This means that, subject to limited exceptions, Solvay's exposure for indemnifications to Abbott for liabilities arising out of sold activities is limited to an aggregate amount representing \u20ac500 million and with limited duration. All postclosing indemnification claims made against Solvay have now been resolved except the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Liabilities arising from private civil antitrust claims made against the buyer of the business. Solvay's potential exposure is limited to a possible clawback of the \u20ac300 million received by Solvay as an additional purchase price based on post-closing ANDROGEL \u00ae sales./uni00A0",

Building on stakeholder feedback, we continued to take actions toward becoming a low-carbon and more inclusive company. This includes reallocating resources to growth and sustainable businesses and further integrating sustainability into all of our key strategic decisions, including on research and innovation, capital expenditure, mergers and acquisitions activities, and investment.\n\nIn 2021, we raised the bar in the three main areas of our Solvay One Planet roadmap - Climate, Resources and Better Life - and we\n\n- delivered on our commitments.\n\n## Climate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- f Unveiling our plans to reach carbon neutrality on Scope 1 and 2 emissions before 2040 for all businesses except soda ash, and before 2050 for soda ash. As a consequence, we upgraded our 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions from -26% to -30%, as compared to the 2018 baseline. Our Scope 3 target shall at least meet the 2\u00b0C criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative.\n- f Achieving a 14% (11% structural) reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2018.\n- f Accelerating the energy transition in our plants, with 36 projects underway globally that will save 2.5 million tons of CO 2 emissions per year.\n- f Launching a strategic initiative to mobilize suppliers in working together to transform the value chain. As part of this, we called on our 400 strategic suppliers to join us in our climate journey.\n- f Continuing our efforts to phase out the use of coal for energy production by 2030 at a second soda ash plant, in Dombasle, France. The plant is transitioning to primarily refuse-derived fuel.\n- f Improving our CDP Climate rating from B to A-, which is higher than the chemical sector average of B.\n- f Receiving recognition for our progress in reducing our pressure on biodiversity. Our Paulinia site in Brazil was awarded the Wildlife Habitat Council's (WHC) Gold Certificate, a first for a chemical company in this country.\n- f Mobilizing 15,000 employees and more than 7,500 people from local communities and NGOs to participate in actions promoting biodiversity, as part of our annual Citizen Day.",

We are focusing resources on developing more sustainable solutions that meet higher performance requirements. We have a clear roadmap for developing the solutions for the next generation of battery technologies and, as the European leader for this new technology, we are investing to create the most advanced pilot plant in Europe.\n- f Reinforcing our portfolio of bio-based solutions, with the acquisition of a bio-based seed care portfolio and the development of new bio-sourced solutions for home and personal care.\n- f Partnering to create circular businesses. This includes partnering with Bridgestone and Arlanxeo to launch TECHSYN, a new technology that gives tires unrivaled strength and environmental performance, and advancing our tripartite partnership with Veolia and Renault to establish a sustainable supply source for strategic battery raw materials.\n- f Surpassing our 2030 target to reduce industrial waste not treated in a sustainable way by 30%.\n\n## Better life\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- f Launching Solvay One Dignity, committing to nine objectives and action plans to drive diversity, equity and inclusion at Solvay.\n- - Diversity: we are accelerating efforts to achieve gender equity at all mid and senior levels by 2030. In 2021, the number of women working at these levels reached 25%. Our upcoming Gender Impact Assessment will help us identify where current policies may be negatively impacting the advancement of female employees. Three new employee resource groups (ERGs) were also launched in 2021, helping to encourage employees to bring their 'whole self' to work.\n- - Equity: we are working to ensure fair recruitment. This includes collecting data to help us identify any unjustified pay inequities across Group profiles and publishing the results in this report for the most significant countries, in an effort to promote transparency. We also launched a new mentoring program for women, which almost 25% of our female junior managers volunteered to take part in.\n- - Inclusion: we launched a global survey assessing inclusive culture at Solvay, the results of which will be used to track our progress.\n- f Launching Solvay's first employee share purchase program to promote an ownership mindset among employees by encouraging deeper engagement and driving value creation.\n- f Extending the scope of our Solvay Solidarity Fund to provide support for employees and local communities facing hardship in a variety of different situations, in addition to the pandemic.\n- f Hazardous materials: we closely monitor the Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) listed in the EU REACH Candidate list and EU REACH Authorization list, by identifying all marketed products sold in the EU and worldwide containing a concentration of those substances above 0.1%. We go beyond what is required by regulation, screening our own broader internal reference list of SVHC for our products marketed worldwide. Our target is to phase out all SVHCs present in our marketed products at a concentration above 0.1% by 2030, wherever feasible.\n- f EU Taxonomy eligible activities: we identified Solvay activities eligible for the EU Taxonomy, an EU classification system aimed at establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities to help the EU to scale up sustainable investment.\n\n141 141\n\nT",

BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThe main reporting frameworks used to prepare the Annual Integrated Report are:\n\n- \u00b7 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI): the GRI standards are the main reference for Solvay's sustainability reporting; the latest edition of the standards is used, including the new GRI-1 and GRI-2 universal standards.\n- \u00b7 United Nations Global Compact: the information provided serves as a progress report on implementation of the United Nations Global Compact's ten principles.\n- \u00b7 International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC): Solvay adheres to the principles and content elements of Integrated Reporting, as described in the 'International Framework' published by the IIRC.\n- \u00b7 2014/95/EU: Solvay uses the GRI Standards to comply with Directive 2014/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 22, 2014 amending Directive 2013/34/EU as regards disclosure of non-financial and diversity information. The Directive was transposed into Belgian law in September 2017.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB): Solvay aligns our materiality analysis with the SASB approach to prepare the SASB Materiality Map\u2122. For more details, see the Materiality Analysis section of this chapter.\n- \u00b7 World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD): Solvay's report aligns with the WBCSD ESG Disclosure Handbook guidance in terms of process and content selection.\n- \u00b7 World Economic Forum: Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation September 2020: Solvay reports on the WEF report Core Metrics and Disclosures.\n- \u00b7 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Solvay has identified the nine Sustainable Development Goals on which it can have the most impact, through its operations or across the value chain, in line with the materiality analysis.\n- \u00b7 Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Solvay reports on our alignment with the 11 recommendations of the TCFD.\n- \u00b7 RESPONSIBLE CARE\u00ae: Solvay is a signatory to the International Council of Chemical Associations' (ICCA) Responsible Care Global Charter\u00ae.\n- \u00b7 EU Taxonomy: a first estimate of eligible activities as defined by the EU Taxonomy in the delegated act of April 2021 is presented in 5.1. Product design and life cycle management.\n\n## 2.1.  Reporting practices\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-2 2-3 2-4 2-7\n\n## 2.1.1. Reporting scope and boundaries\n\nUnless stated otherwise, the environmental and social reporting boundaries are consistent with the financial reporting scope and boundaries, as described in the 'List of companies included in the consolidation scope' in the financial statements. In other words, social and environmental indicators are consolidated according to the equity share approach described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard.\n\nSolvay uses the 'rolling base year' approach described in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to calculate target achievements.\n\nUnless stated otherwise, past years are not restated for extra-financial indicators.\n\nThe reporting scope includes all material aspects, as identified in Solvay's materiality analysis. Some additional disclosures have been included because they are requested by specific groups of stakeholders./uni00A0\n\nReporting practices specific to the dimension reported are integrated in the corresponding 'Definitions' subsection.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n145",

The Covid-19 crisis confirmed the priorities defined during the Solvay One Planet preparative work, and in particular:\n\n- \u00b7 An increased emphasis on climate change and biodiversity, with evidence of the link between human activities and the pandemic and the changes in air quality during lockdown phases.\n- \u00b7 An increased emphasis on social aspects, with evidence of minorities being the most vulnerable populations.\n\n## 2.2.4. Why is it material?\n\nThe tables below summarize Solvay's assessment of material aspects for each category. The corresponding United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are used to describe what impacts are considered, where they may occur and how they may be caused.

This working group took a leadership role in piloting and refining the three-step framework described in the WBCSD's SDG Sector Roadmap Guidelines.\n\nAs part of this exercise, Solvay identified the Sustainable Development Goals on which we could have a material impact, positive or negative. We then integrated these sustainable development goals into our materiality analysis as the official agenda of the 'Planet' (Governments and NGOs) stakeholder group.\n\nThis preliminary list was reviewed in 2019, within the context of the Solvay One Planet sustainability ambition, with an increasing focus on the impact of products and operations.\n\nSolvay's main impacts can be grouped into three categories: climate, resources and quality of life. The corresponding list of SDGs on which Solvay can have the most impact, positive or negative, through our operations and the products we sell, is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate and biodiversity, which includes the Group's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and other emissions or effluents that put pressure on biodiversity, but also products that may impact customers' energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions:\n- -SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy\n- -SDG 13: Climate action\n- -SDG 14: Life below water\n- -SDG 15: Life on land\n- \u00b7 Resources, which includes the Group's raw material consumption, water consumption, effluents, emissions and waste generation, but also products' life cycles and end-of-life management:\n- -SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production\n- \u00b7 Better life, which includes the Group's management of hazardous materials, people, process and product safety, social dialogue initiatives and potential social impacts of our product portfolio:\n- -SDG 3: Good health and well-being\n- -SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation\n- -SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth\n- -SDG 17: Partnership for the goals\n\n## 154 2.6.

Its direct members are national business federations, but selected companies may participate in BusinessEurope through the Advisory and Support Group (ASG). BusinessEurope and its members campaign on the issues that most influence the business performance and growth of European companies, in Europe and globally. Within this framework, Solvay provides input through participation in working groups dealing with energy, environment and research, as well as trade policy. Solvay's position on climate is more ambitious than the federation position.\n\n## 2.7.11.

World Business Council for Sustainable Development\n\nThe World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a CEO-led organization of over 200 leading businesses working together to accelerate the transition to a sustainable world. Solvay has been  an active member since 2010, and Solvay CEO Ilham Kadri is personally involved. In 2021, the WBCSD appointed Ilham Kadri as its new executive committee chair. She is the WBCSD's first female chair in its 26-year history. Solvay CFO Karim Hajjar serves as co-chair of the Redefining Value Program. Solvay plays an active role in four of the six programs:\n\n- \u00b7 Redefining Value Program: Redefining Value helps companies measure and manage risk, gain competitive advantage and seize new opportunities by understanding environmental, social and governance (ESG) information. By building collaborations and developing tools, guidance, case studies, engagement and education opportunities to help companies incorporate ESG performance into mainstream business and finance systems, the ultimate goal is to improve decision-making and external disclosure, eventually transforming the financial system so that it rewards the most sustainable companies.\n- \u00b7 Circular Economy: The future of business is circular, and there's no room for waste in it. Factor 10, the WBCSD's circular economy program, brings circularity into the heart of business leadership and practice. It builds a critical mass of engagement within and across businesses to spur the circular economy to deliver and scale the solutions needed to build a sustainable world.\n- \u00b7 Climate and Energy: Combating climate change and transforming the energy system are core challenges on the path to a sustainable future for business, society and the environment. The Paris Agreement has sent a decisive and global signal that the start of the transition to a thriving, clean economy is inevitable, irreversible and irresistible. The WBCSD Climate and Energy Program facilitates interaction on cutting-edge climate and energy topics between WBCSD members, their peers and stakeholders as they address critical industry issues and share best practice and solutions.\n- \u00b7 People: Our current society is characterized by a range of dynamic shifts and evolutions. We are faced with a world that is polarizing, a world that presents risks and opportunities in the way we work, a world that is on the move and a world in which people are living beyond their means. The People program provides solutions that support companies by ensuring that they remain in tune with the needs, rights, goals and aspirations of society against the backdrop of this rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nSolvay also plays an active role in the WBCSD Chemicals Group. Together with leading chemical company members, ACC and Cefic published the SDG Roadmap for the Chemical Sector in 2018. This methodology provides clear guidance on how the chemical sector can contribute to change across the spectrum of the SDGs, unlocking their value by acting on key impact opportunities. Notably, Solvay works proactively to accelerate adoption of our Sustainable Portfolio Management system across the chemical industry and other sectors.\n\n157",

Definition\n\nThe Solvay One Planet Guide is the new sustainability reference framework for the Solvay Group. While the previous Solvay Way reference framework focused mainly on processes, the Solvay One Planet Guide explains our ambitions and the reasons why we must act now.\n\nThis Guide is organized in three work axes: content, performance and assessment.\n\nThrough the content axis we help every Solvay employee understand the indicators that are part of our Solvay One Planet program. The Group targets are sorted per impact category, namely climate, resources and better life, and for each target we describe:\n\nWhat we are talking about, why it is important and the main legislation (where relevant).\n\nSolvay's ambition: internal definitions which are relevant for the target, our footprint, our actions and ambitions, and key contacts.\n\nThe performance axis includes a dashboard with the results of the Solvay One Planet targets for the entire Group.\n\nThe assessment axis allows us to identify each entity's main strengths and weaknesses, and develop plans for improvement.\n\n## 3.1.2. Management approach\n\nThe Solvay One Planet Guide was launched on September 1, 2021, and addressed to every Solvay employee.\n\nSolvay's Corporate Sustainable Development Function defines and deploys Solvay One Planet. The content axis has already been deployed, while the performance axis is under construction, integrating all existing tools currently used to measure the performance of each component of the strategy. The assessment axis is currently being evaluated in order to provide a solid framework for progress.\n\nIn each of our Global Business Units (GBUs), a member of the leadership team acts as head of sustainability. They are in charge of integrating sustainability aspects into the GBU's strategy and operations.\n\nA network of Sustainability Champions and correspondents ensures that the Guide is deployed in all Solvay sites, GBUs and Corporate Functions. They inform their entity about any changes in the strategy and objectives, ensure necessary training is organized and develop an annual and multiyear roadmap to meet final objectives. They are then responsible for implementing the roadmap in their entity.\n\nDefinitions, management approach, indicators and targets, and main actions specific to each topic are described in the corresponding sections of the Extra-financial statements. The management approach is adjusted each year based on the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 evolution of frameworks and reporting standards, such as GRI Standards;\n- \u00b7 auditors report on material aspects;\n- \u00b7 feedback from practitioners;\n- \u00b7 feedback from sustainability rating agencies;\n- \u00b7 feedback received on the annual report, such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's 'Reporting Matters' yearly analysis;\n- \u00b7 evolution of Solvay's strategy.\n\n## 3.1.3. Indicators and targets\n\nSolvay One Planet is our roadmap to a sustainable future that provides shared value for all. It is structured around the three major impact categories, climate, resources, and better life, and sets out the following main targets to be achieved by 2030, as compared to the 2018 baseline:\n\n## Climate Pillar\n\n- \u00b7 GHG reduction: -30% of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050.\n- \u00b7 Coal phase-out: phase out coal usage in energy production wherever renewable alternatives exist.\n- \u00b7 Biodiversity preservation: -30% of negative pressure.\n\n## Resource Pillar\n\n- \u00b7 Sustainable solutions: 65% of total Group sales from sustainable solutions.\n- \u00b7 Circular economy: more than double total Group sales from renewable or recycled resources.\n- \u00b7 Waste: -30% of industrial waste.\n- \u00b7 Water: -25% of freshwater intake.",

Management of the legal, ethics, and regulatory framework\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-26 2-27 3-3 205-2 205-3 406-1 415-1 MATERIALITY: HIGH\n\nManagement of the legal, ethics and regulatory framework encompasses business ethics, namely human rights, anti-corruption and non-discrimination, and anti-competitive behavior.\n\n## 3.2.1. Commitments and policies\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity\n\nSolvay's Code of Business Integrity and the policies and procedures adopted to enhance good governance apply to all employees wherever they are located. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 third parties are expected to act within the framework of the Code of Business Integrity;\n- \u00b7 all core suppliers must confirm that they adhere to the principles set out in the Solvay Supplier Code of Business Integrity;\n- \u00b7 majority-owned joint ventures are held to the Solvay Code of Business Integrity, or to a separate code adopted based on similar principles.\n\nThe Code of Business Integrity is available on Solvay's website.\n\n## Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and Policy on Gifts and Entertainment\n\nSolvay's Code of Business Integrity expressly states that the Group prohibits bribery in any form. Solvay and our employees do not use gifts or entertainment to gain competitive advantage. Facilitation payments are not permitted by Solvay and disguising gifts or entertainment as charitable donations is also a violation of the Code of Business Integrity.\n\nThe Code is supported by more detailed policies. At the end of 2020, Solvay split our Gifts, Entertainment and Anti-Bribery Policy into two separate policies: an Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy and a Policy on Gifts, Entertainment, Charitable Donations, and Sponsorship.\n\nThe Group employs an internal tracking system to record gifts and entertainment that exceed the acceptable reasonable value applicable in each region, as well as charitable donations and sponsorship with charitable purpose and requires manager approval for accepting or giving them. The use of the Gift and Entertainment Tracking System ('GETS') is part of Solvay's Internal Audit review process.\n\nSolvay is also a member of Transparency International Belgium.\n\n## Human Rights in Business Policy\n\nSolvay's Human Rights in Business Policy, published on our website, sets out Solvay's commitment to respecting human rights and acting with due diligence to avoid any infringement of human rights or any adverse impact on or abuses of such rights. The policy emphasizes Solvay's commitments to our stakeholders, namely our employees and business partners, the communities and environment in which we operate, and children.\n\nSolvay has a Global Human Rights Committee (GHRC), which oversees implementation of the policy, ensures compliance and monitors the Group's performance. Members of the Global Human Rights Committee include the heads of the following Solvay business service activities and/or their delegates: General Counsel, Compliance, Human Resources, Procurement, Communication, Internal Audit and Risk Management, and Sustainable Development. The GHRC is chaired by the Group General Counsel, who is the head of the General Counsel Function. Members of Solvay's Global Business Units and other business service activities contribute to the work of the GHRC on an ad hoc basis, as necessary.\n\nThe GHRC discusses its activities before the Group's annual report is issued, and also validates any human rights reporting made in conjunction with the report. Upon request, the Chair of the GHRC may be called upon to provide an annual report to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Human rights due diligence and risk assessment\n\nTwo parallel processes are used to assess human rights risks at Solvay sites. These focus on Solvay employees, based on internal data, or on our business partners, namely suppliers and contractors identified according to the risk associated with the country they operate in. Six human rights dimensions are considered: child labor; forced labor; trafficking in persons; human development; freedom of association; and collective bargaining. The assessment is used by Solvay's internal auditors to identify priorities for their work on the subject.\n\nThe assessment was suspended during the Covid-19 crisis, as priorities shifted to protecting the most vulnerable employees and local communities from the impact and consequences of the pandemic.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n159",

Solvay develops and maintains a culture of compliance to keep the company and our people on the right side of the law. Solvay has a formal Competition Law Policy that stresses the importance of strict adherence to all competition laws. It has been approved by Solvay's Executive Committee and is published on the Solvay intranet, to which all our employees have access. Any violation of this policy may result in disciplinary action, subject to and in conformity with applicable laws.\n\n## 3.2.2. Resources and responsibilities\n\nA compliance organization under the leadership of the Chief People Officer reinforces a Group-wide culture based on ethics and compliance.\n\nThe Ethics and Compliance Department consists of Regional Compliance Officers who serve in the four zones in which the Group operates, under the direction of the Chief Compliance Officer. This department is responsible for investigating, either alone or with the assistance of other departments, all reports that are brought to its attention. The Chief Compliance Officer reports to the Chief People Officer. All acts of non-compliance concerning the Solvay Code of Business Integrity and the related policies and procedures, including Speak Up cases, are reported to the Leadership Team and the Board of Directors Audit Committee annually.\n\nFor Competition Law, Solvay has a dedicated team within the General Counsel Function, which is responsible for implementing the Competition Law Compliance Program. They are in charge of providing competition law advice and guidance, as well as deploying effective and regular communication and training on competition law-related subjects.\n\n## Implementation of the Competition Law Policy\n\nSolvay has put in place a Competition Law Compliance Program that propagates a zero-tolerance approach to competition law infringements. As part of our Competition Law Compliance Program, Solvay provides a competition law toolkit on our intranet that includes up-to-date guidelines on specific areas of competition law, including guidance on dealing with competitors, dawn raids, information exchange on mergers and acquisitions transactions, swaps, price announcements and vertical relationships.\n\nTo minimize cartel risks, Solvay has put in place a computer-based system that tracks all contacts that relevant employees have with competitors through a managerial approval procedure./uni00A0\n\n## 3.2.3. Grievance mechanisms\n\nEmployees are encouraged to report suspected violations or concerns through various internal avenues, including management, Human Resources, the General Counsel Function, Ethics and Compliance, Internal Audit, or through employees' representatives.\n\nA Group-wide Speak Up program is in place and overseen by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. An external, third-party helpline, active 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, allows employees to ask questions, raise concerns or file reports. The helpline is open to internal and external parties.\n\nThe following chart shows the types of claims made from January to December 2021 through Solvay's Speak Up program.\n\n## Solvay's speak up program\n\nCategories have been modified in 2021.",

In keeping with our commitment to transparency, the Speak Up tool is used to report progress on investigations and is used to communicate the results of investigations directly to those concerned when concluded. Posters and an online brochure are available to employees and advertise the website and toll-free numbers needed to access this tool in their regions. The Board's Audit Committee oversees the running of Speak Up.\n\n## In 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 137 cases opened:\n- -25 cases still in progress;\n- -112 cases resolved.

Communication and training\n\n## Solvay's Code of Business Integrity\n\nMandatory Code of Business Integrity training, both live and web-based, is organized for all employees to ensure understanding and to address behavioral risks such as anti-bribery and corruption, conflict of interest and harassment. As part of this training, employees are also trained on the Speak Up Helpline. Specific anti-corruption training is tailored to management. Special campaigns to maintain and enhance the level of awareness within the Group are identified and adopted annually. In 2020-2021, 100% of the target population was trained on the Code of Business Integrity and 96% on the Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy.\n\n## Competition Law and Antitrust/uni00A0\n\nSolvay has a concrete Competition Law Compliance Action Plan, designed to mitigate the specific risks the Group has identified in this field of law. It has been in force since 2003 and is updated yearly. In 2021, it covered:\n\n- \u00b7 an update of the existing Group policy on competition law and the relevant guidelines;\n- \u00b7 continuation of the \"General Antitrust Training\" sessions for new employees, which was successfully completed by 93% of the targeted population;\n- \u00b7 continuation of the roll-out of a video on the Contacts with Competitors Tracking System (CCTS), used to train 1470 of the individuals targeted;\n- \u00b7 additional, tailored, face-to-face training sessions for 365 high-risk individuals;\n- \u00b7 roll-out of a new trade association training, which was attended by 97% of the relevant target audience.\n\n## Anti-Corruption\n\nAnti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption training is now done on a two-year cycle for the pre-identified target population. For the 2021 cycle, 96% of the target population (all cadres S15 and above) completed the online training course. In addition, the Code of Business Integrity online training course that is mandatory for all employees to complete, also covers the topic of anti-corruption.\n\n## 3.2.5. Public policy\n\nThe Government Affairs and Country Management Function is responsible for raising Group awareness about the general political context, the main challenges faced by public authorities and more specific policy issues. In line with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity, and with the aim of ensuring the best possible business environment, the Government Affairs and Country Management team works to foster long-term partnerships with public authorities and other relevant stakeholders. They do this by building a transparent and constructive dialogue in support of company strategy./uni00A0\n\nIssues that fall within the scope of activities of the Government Affairs Function include:\n\n- \u00b7 Promoting climate change solutions for the energy transition: Solvay supports the UN Paris Climate Agreement and contributes to its implementation. Solvay therefore argues for the development of a clear and predictable legislative framework that promotes sustainable growth while maintaining competitiveness for industry, and ensuring a balanced transition to a low carbon economy.\n- \u00b7 Competitiveness: Solvay advocates for a regulatory system that fosters entrepreneurship and industrial innovation by safeguarding or improving competitiveness, and that creates highly skilled jobs worldwide.\n- \u00b7 Environmental and chemical policy: Solvay collaborates with trade associations, public authorities and other stakeholders to develop science- and risk-based regulations and standards in the interest of a more sustainable industry and products.\n- \u00b7 Promoting global trade: As an international company, Solvay recognizes the importance of free trade based on a multilateral and rules-based trading system. Reducing trade barriers is essential for economic growth and thus for industrial activity.\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical assessment: Solvay assesses the geopolitical situation in order to better understand the potential impact, in relation to trade, logistics, investments and security, on our businesses.\n- \u00b7 Supporting the business: Solvay works to develop new markets and new geographies for business, and to obtain the necessary permits for our facilities and registrations for our products.\n\nSolvay's public policy activities also include participation in many trade associations, as outlined in section 2.8.\n\nThe Group does not take part in party political activities, nor do we make corporate donations to political parties or candidates. We engage in constructive debate with public authorities on subjects of legitimate interest to Solvay, where necessary, but only those employees specifically authorized to do so may carry out such activities.\n\nSolvay respects the freedom of our employees to make their own political decisions. Any personal participation or involvement by an employee in the political process must be done on an individual basis, on the employee's own time and at the employee's personal expense.\n\n## 3.2.6. Animal testing\n\nSolvay provides innovative products for a wide variety of uses and a large number of users. The Group must have a proper understanding of the hazards of our product in order to carry out our activities and to protect users, the general public, Solvay personnel and the environment. With society expressing a continuing demand for new, better and safer chemicals and plastics, there is growing demand from both regulatory authorities and the public for product risk and hazard assessments. These require testing, both with and without the use of animals.",

        "page_content": "## Testing\n\nTo comply with new and existing chemical regulations, or to further consolidate safety data, Solvay commissioned animal tests in 2021. Solvay avoids animal testing whenever possible, but in cases in which animal testing is required we commit to conducting studies that treat animals humanely, giving them the best care possible, and using all animals responsibly, with great regard for their welfare. In compliance with European cosmetic regulations, Solvay does not perform specific testing solely to support cosmetic uses.\n\n## Substance-based testing for multiple applications\n\nSolvay carries out tests required for all regulations and applications relating to a given substance just once . We avoid the need for new studies by actively advocating for the reuse of data from studies conducted within a given framework, such as REACH, for other registration systems.\n\n## Ethical compliance\n\nSolvay's policy, outlined in the Solvay Animal Care and Use Procedure, is to apply the '3R principles' (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) in each case and to comply with all applicable regulations. All of our studies comply with international standards, such as OECD guidelines. Regulatory studies are almost exclusively performed by laboratories accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC). This worldwide organization sets quality standards for testing laboratories and ensures responsible and humane treatment of laboratory animals. Before they start, all studies commissioned by Solvay are subject to an ethical assessment at local or national level by the laboratory conducting the study.\n\nOnce a study is underway, Solvay staff monitor the execution and quality of the studies and maintain a continuing qualification and evaluation program for the laboratories. A dedicated Solvay corporate committee reviewed the animal testing activities commissioned by Solvay during 2021, verifying conformity with the principles and the mandatory elements of Solvay's Animal Care and Use Procedure.\n\n## VERTEBRATE ANIMAL TESTS COMMISSIONED BY SOLVAY IN 2021\n\n|                                                                |   Number of studies | Number of vertebrates (*)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Registration obligations (EU, China, Korea, US)                |                  20 | 9,963                       |\n| Additional product safety questions (toxicity, classification) |                   7 | 200                         |\n| Total                                                          |                  27 | 10,163                      |\n\n- (*) Includes all animals, including control animals not being exposed to test substances and used as reference\n\n## Regulatory testing\n\nIn 2021, 99% of the vertebrate animals (representing 74% of the animal studies) were used to address mandatory requirements from authorities. The remaining 1% were used to address additional product safety questions. In total, 10163 vertebrate animals (82% rats, 9% rabbits, 8% fish, 0.8% guinea pigs and 0.2% mice) were used. Solvay did not commission any studies on dogs, cats, pigs or non-human primates. Most vertebrate animals (99%) were used in tests required by the EU REACH Regulation, although these studies will also be valid for demonstrating compliance with chemical regulations elsewhere in the world. The number of studies and vertebrate animals used in 2021 was about half that of 2020.\n\n## Drivers for the future\n\nWhile studies are needed for regulatory and scientific purposes, Solvay continues to strengthen its capabilities and understanding of alternative methodologies that do not involve vertebrate animals. Further advances were made in quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs), a computer-based method used to predict the properties of chemicals based on information about similar substances. These models are fit for regulatory use and will increase our ability to avoid animal testing when assessing our products.\n\nHowever, the higher tier animal studies requested by authorities, which required the largest number of animals in 2021, will continue to be the major driver for animal tests in the near future. The EU chemicals strategy for sustainability, which was published at the end of 2020, does not suggest a major shift in this respect. Solvay therefore fully supports the joint position of the European Chemicals Industry (Cefic) and Cruelty Free Europe, published in July 2021, calling on the European Commission to include animal testing in the REACH Impact Assessment and to do more to support non-animal methods.\n\nAdvances in the implementation of non-animal methods and alternative hazard identification strategies are crucial if a reduction of animal use in hazard assessment is to be achieved. For instance, with the upcoming information requirements for nanomaterials and endocrine disruptors, more, rather than less, animal testing appears to be required in Europe.\n\n163",

Actizone\u2122, a patented technology, is a line of ready-to-use products and ingredients developed by Solvay that rapidly kills germs to protect consumers from harmful bacteria and viruses, including coronavirus.\n\nAmni\u00ae Virus-Bac OFF, is a functionalized polyamide textile yarn, developed to eliminate the proliferation of bacteria and inhibit the transmission of viruses on textiles. The Amni\u00ae Antiviral yarn acts on groups of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and bacteria, providing a powerful barrier against the spread of Covid-19. Articles made with Amni\u00ae Virus-Bac OFF are long-lasting and durable. For example, it has been used successfully for masks, school and professional uniforms, seat coverings in public transportation, sports clothing and hospital bed linen.\n\n## Solvay's Materials GBU and emerging opportunities\n\nSolvay's Materials GBU continues to develop new solutions that enable sustainable mobility, digitalization and connectivity, and healthy living.\n\nFor example, our ability to deliver materials with both structural and electrical properties, such as Ketaspire \u00ae PEEK in e-motors, allows us to improve energy and power density in electric vehicles (EV). The breadth of our materials portfolio has also enabled the development of multi-layer and multi-material solutions for electronic shielding and transmissivity. Solvay's short and long fiber composites, compounds and adhesives enable lightweighting, and we collaborate on these with customers who seek to transform the boundaries of mobility, such as Vertical Aerospace and Avio. And through expanding the range of thermal conductivity, stiffness and compatibility in our polymer science capabilities, we are now able to provide solutions for noise and vibration in consumer applications and advanced filtration.\n\nWe also continue to reinvent our portfolio through sustainable solutions. This includes increasing sourcing from renewable feedstocks. Our collaborations range from producing bio-sourced acrylonitrile with Trillium, to introducing Amodel Bios PPA, our bio-based polymer for use in e-mobility.\n\n## Batteries and the circular economy\n\nSolvay and Veolia came together as a circular economy consortium to offer new solutions to improve resource efficiency for critical metals used in lithium-ion EV batteries. We have since been joined in this consortium by Renault. Solvay's role in this project is to optimize the extraction and purification of critical metals such as cobalt, nickel, and lithium and transform them into high-purity raw materials for new batteries, helping to close the circular economy loop for EV batteries. The project is supported by BPi France.\n\nWhile Solvay is present in the current EV and hybrid battery value chain, through our high-performance specialty polymers for binders and separators and specialty additives for electrolytes, we are also focused on the future. Solvay is fully involved in the EU's Horizon 2020 program, notably in the field of batteries, through the CoFBAT, Spider and Naima projects. We are also part of both the European Battery Alliance and the IPCEI (Important Project of Common European Interest), which are working to develop the solid-state battery of the future, which involves developing state-of-the-art electrolytes, electrode binders and separators.\n\n## Open Innovation: a long tradition of collaboration with academia worldwide\n\nSolvay continues to be heavily involved in high-level scientific collaborations with top universities globally. These collaborations range from direct contracts to longer term partnerships. The latter includes our Joint Research Units set up with the CNRS (National Scientific Research Center) and universities in Bordeaux, France, focused on microfluidics and high throughput screening, and in Shanghai, China, focused on organic chemistry and catalysis. Other long-term partnerships established with Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) and the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba (AIST), have delivered very interesting results on modeling and machine learning. A series of more recent collaborations have also been launched on topics related to energy generation and storage), biobased chemistry, advanced polymers and formulations with institutions such as the University of Chicago, Edinburgh University and Politecnico Milano.\n\n## Venture capital and start-ups\n\nIn 2021, Solvay's venture capital fund of Solvay, Solvay Ventures, closed three new investments:\n\n- \u00b7 DMC Biotechnologies is a developer of bio-based products designed for the low-cost and sustainable transformation of bio-based feedstocks. DMC uses engineered microbes, leveraging a technology that reduces biological complexity and enhances the speed of development for new sustainable markets.\n- \u00b7 Sepion is an energy storage company aimed at speeding up the electrification revolution. Their unique material membrane can be used to create safe, energy-dense, lithium-metal batteries for long-range and low-cost electric transportation. This investment is in alignment with the acceleration of the Solvay battery platform.\n- \u00b7 Longwater (fund II) is a venture capital fund dedicated to new technologies in material science and chemistry. Its management company, Longwater Investment, is a partner of choice to help us tap into the dynamic innovation ecosystems in China.",

Definition\n\nOur supply chain organization accounts for 2,200 people. Most of them are located in the Global Business Units (GBUs), where they are in charge of planning, customer care, logistics operations and improvement projects. In addition to this, a small Supply Chain Excellence team is located in Solvay's Excellence Center. We have programs in place to foster continuous improvement in the value chain performance of our GBUs, while also improving cash generation, cost and customer experience./uni00A0\n\nOur procurement organization consists of 580 people, located in Corporate Procurement, the GBUs, or Purchasing Service Line support./uni00A0\n\n## 3.5.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay integrates our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) principles and Solvay One Planet ambition into our procurement processes and strategies in order to create sustainable business value with our suppliers.\n\n## Supplier Code of Business Integrity\n\nOur Supplier Code of Business Integrity is key for the implementation of our Responsible Procurement Policy. It is fully aligned with Solvay's Code of Business Integrity and our CSR agreements with IndustriALL Global Union. It was inspired by the UN Global Compact principles and Responsible Care\u00ae practices.\n\nAll written procurement contracts must make reference to the Supplier Code of Business Integrity or a valid alternative. In addition, and even given the existence of a written purchase contract, all of our Core Suppliers must subscribe to the principles detailed in the Supplier Code of Business Integrity.\n\n## Together for Sustainability initiative\n\nSolvay is a founding member of the Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative, a unique member-driven organization set up in 2011 to help member companies shape the future of the chemical industry together. A global, procurement-driven initiative, with regional representation in Asia and North and South America, TfS provides the global standard for environmental, social and governance performance in chemical supply chains.\n\nThe TfS program is based on the UN Global Compact and Responsible Care\u00ae principles./uni00A0It provides a framework and tools (TfS Assessments and TfS Audits) that can be used to assess and improve the sustainability performance of chemical companies and their suppliers. The TfS program also addresses scope 3 GHG emissions, Product Carbon Footprint and global capability building activities. TfS operates according to the principle of 'an assessment or audit for one member company is an assessment or audit for all'. By sharing supplier evaluations among the 34 global chemical companies involved, we are able to lessen the administrative burden and leverage synergies among the member companies. TfS assessments are carried out by the initiative's key partner EcoVadis, a global service provider specialized in sustainability performance assessments. For audits, TfS cooperates with a TfS-approved audit company.\n\nSolvay Chief Procurement Officer (CPO) Lynn De Proft is a member of the TfS Steering Committee.\n\n## Procurement strategy\n\nProcurement strategies are defined by category experts in collaboration with the GBUs. These strategies are executed and deployed at global, regional or local level, depending on the supplier market structure.\n\nProcurement resources and capabilities are shared across an international network of category and sourcing managers and individuals responsible for site procurement, all of whom follow the common way of working known as the Solvay global procurement process. Procurement priorities are centered around two main topics: 'Act NOW', focused on protecting and running the business in the present and 'Prepare for the FUTURE'.\n\n## 3.5.3. Indicators\n\n## Core Suppliers\n\nSolvay applies supplier segmentation in order to identify key suppliers, which we refer to as Core Suppliers. Core Suppliers encompass three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic Alliances: strategic suppliers at Group level that contribute to Solvay's growth, market differentiation and innovation.\n- \u00b7 Strategic Partners: suppliers that deliver strategic materials or services to Solvay that can have a possible business impact.\n- \u00b7 Bottlenecks: suppliers that represent a high potential risk to Solvay or the business.\n\nThis approach enables Solvay to focus on managing performance, mitigating supply risk and improving relationships, while also forming the basis for collaboration and stimulating innovation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n167",

This makes Solvay the fourth best performer in terms of suppliers, when compared to the other Together for Sustainability members.\n\n## Raw materials\n\nAs a large chemical manufacturer, Solvay uses raw materials from a range of suppliers and sources: the overall volume purchased in 2021 was over 4.92 million metric tons. The Solvay Group transforms large quantities of petrochemicals and uses large amounts of water./uni00A0\n\nSolvay is concerned that the trade in tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold, and the metals known as 3TGs that are refined from such minerals and mined in certain conflict-affected and high-risk regions, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and neighboring countries, may be contributing to human rights abuses. Our product portfolio does not contain 3TG products needed for the functioning or production of products that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in these regions. We continue to work to verify the integrity of our sourcing, and to support the actions of governments, our customers and suppliers toward achieving this aim globally. If our suppliers fail to meet our expectations in this regard, we will take these factors into consideration when making future business and sourcing decisions.\n\n## NON-BIOSOURCED AND BIOSOURCED RAW MATERIALS - MATERIAL PURCHASED\n\n|                     |                   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mineral products    | 1,000 metric tons | 2,690  | 2,370  | 2,970  |\n| Biosourced products | 1,000 metric tons | 240    | 230    | 260    |\n| Natural gas         | 1,000 metric tons | 940    | 900    | 980    |\n| Petrochemical       | 1,000 metric tons | 950    | 830    | 980    |\n| Other raw materials | 1,000 metric tons | 100    | 120    | 390    |\n| Total               | 1,000 metric tons | 4,920  | 4,450  | 5,580  |",

To comply with Global Reporting Initiative requirements, we apply the following criteria (in decreasing order of priority) when selecting the CO 2 emission factor of each electricity supply contract:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy attribute certificates: emission factors resulting from specific instruments such as green energy certificates.\n- \u00b7 Contract-based: the emission factor obtained from contract agreements on specific sources for which there is no emission of specific attributes.\n- \u00b7 Supplier or utility emission rates: the emission factor disclosed as a result of the supplier's retail mix.\n- \u00b7 Residual mix: if a residual mix is unavailable, grid-average emission factors are used as a proxy.\n- \u00b7 Location-based: if none of the above factors are available, we use the national emission factor published by national authorities or the International Energy Agency. Based on a World Resources Institute (WRI) recommendation, Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) emission factors published by the United States Environmental Protection Agency are used for the US, instead of the state emission factor. Similarly, grid emission factors published by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment are used for China, instead of the state emission factors.\n\n## 4.1.2. Management approach\n\nIn October 2021 we announced our plans to reach carbon neutrality on scope 1 and 2 emissions before 2050. We have committed to set science based targets in 2020. Our scope 3 target shall at least meet the 2C criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative. A strategic initiative has been launched to spur transformative progress with our suppliers in 2021. We will continue our effort in that direction beyond 2030 within our 2050 neutrality vision. We also upgraded our emissions scope 1 and scope 2 reduction target from -26% to -30% by 2030, as compared to the 2018 baseline.\n\nTo achieve our targets, we are taking a range of different actions. This includes transforming our energy mix and investing in clean technologies. We are developing a growing pipeline of energy-climate transition opportunities through collaborations between a dedicated team of experts in energy transition and operational teams at the industrial sites. For greenhouse gas emissions not related to energy, specific task forces have been set up with strong technical support in order to help them develop the required clean technologies. In addition, Solvay applies an internal carbon price of \u20ac100 per metric ton of CO 2 to all greenhouse gas emissions in our capital investment decisions worldwide./uni00A0\n\nAn externally verified greenhouse gas emission reporting system, and responses to rating agencies such as the Carbon Disclosure Project, help the Group align our efforts with the magnitude of the greenhouse gas challenges we face.\n\n## 4.1.3.

Definitions\n\nThe different components of Solvay's energy consumption are converted into primary energy sources as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 fuels, using the net calorific values;\n- \u00b7 steam purchased, taking into account the boiler efficiency reference value for the type of fuel used to generate the steam, for example 90% efficiency based on the net calorific value for natural gas;\n- \u00b7 electricity purchased, assuming an average efficiency of 39.5% for all types of power production except for nuclear power (33%), hydro (100%), solar (100%) and wind (100%), based on net calorific value (source: International Energy Agency - IEA).\n\n## 4.2.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay has both industrial activities that consume large amounts of energy, such as our synthetic soda ash plants and peroxides, and industrial activities that have a relatively low energy content as a percentage of the sales price, such as fluorinated polymers.\n\nThe Group considers it particularly important to swiftly transition our energy consumption towards zero- or low-carbon sources without compromising competitiveness or supply security. We have therefore taken the following strategic initiatives:\n\n- \u00b7 Creation of a Sustainable Environment and Climate (SEC) Department within Solvay's Industrial Function to support the development of energy transition projects worldwide, taking into account the specifics of each site's local energy market.\n- \u00b7 Technological leadership in processes and high-performance industrial operations to minimize energy consumption.\n- \u00b7 Diversification and flexible use of the different types and sources of primary energy.\n- \u00b7 Periodic review of the condition of industrial sites' energy assets and connections.\n- \u00b7 A strategy of supply coverage, with long-term partnerships and medium- to long-term contracts, and price-hedging protection mechanisms when needed.\n- \u00b7 In-house market intelligence and direct access to energy markets, including gas hubs, electrical grids, financial spots and future exchanges, when possible.\n- \u00b7 Dedicated services aimed at optimizing energy purchasing and helping Global Business Units manage energy and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe Group has reduced its overall energy intensity. Key factors in this progress have been the SOLWATT \u00ae energy efficiency program rolled out at most plants worldwide and the dissemination of technological breakthroughs to improve the overall energy efficiency of our operations./uni00A0\n\n## 4.2.3.

Coke and anthracite used as raw materials in chemical reactions have been removed from classification as solid fuels. Historical figures have been restated retroactively.\n\nFuel consumption from non-renewable sources increased in 2021. This variation is explained mainly by the restart of activity following the Covid-19 crisis. There is a decrease in coal use, from 32 PJ in 2019 to 27 PJ in 2021, which is in line with Solvay's objective of phasing out coal used as energy by 2030. Over the same period, renewable fuel consumption increased by 1.5 PJ, from 5 PJ in 2019 to 6.2 PJ in 2021.",

Definitions\n\nThe calculation of the Solvay Group's pressure on biodiversity is performed along the value chain, from cradle-to-gate, for our entire portfolio of products. This is a global approach that is based on a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methodology: the ReCiPe2016 method. This method translates emissions and resource extractions into a limited number of environmental impact scores by means of what are known as characterization factors.",

        "page_content": "174\n\nThe first step in this method involves using emissions from environmental reporting that are linked with the following 'midpoint impact categories':\n\n- \u00b7 global warming, from CO 2 and greenhouse gas emissions, for example;\n- \u00b7 water use;\n- \u00b7 freshwater ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 freshwater eutrophication;\n- \u00b7 ozone depletion;\n- \u00b7 terrestrial acidification;\n- \u00b7 terrestrial ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 marine ecotoxicity;\n- \u00b7 land use or transformation;\n- \u00b7 use of mineral resources;\n- \u00b7 use of fossil resources.\n\nThe potential damage to nature is calculated by connecting the midpoint indicator with an endpoint factor, such as damage to freshwater, marine or terrestrial species and natural resources. The unit for measuring ecosystem quality is local relative species loss in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, respectively, measured over space and time: potentially disappeared fraction of species per square meter per year or potentially disappeared fraction of species per cubic meter per year).\n\n## 4.3.2. Management approach\n\n## Local biodiversity\n\nWe have screened all of our sites and their potential impact on protected areas according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) management categories. We prioritized sites for risk assessment according to their proximity to protected areas and the IUCN management category. This led to us working with local administrations in charge of the protected areas to track and analyze the actions required to alleviate our impact, depending on the type of biodiversity that needed protecting.\n\nFor example, our Rosignano, in Italy, is located near the protected area of the Pelagos Sanctuary for the Conservation of Marine Mammals. The plant is therefore currently working on an action plan to reduce its impact on marine biodiversity, through possible partnerships with local universities and the possible rehabilitation of our quarries. The first actions to promote biodiversity at the site were undertaken during Solvay's 2021 Citizen Day (see section 3) and a detailed action plan will be launched in 2022.\n\n## Global biodiversity\n\nAs part of Solvay One Planet, we set a target to reduce our pressure on biodiversity by 30% by 2030, as compared to 2018. Using the environmental profiles of our products, and looking at their entire life cycle from raw material to distribution, we were able to identify the areas of our portfolio that contribute the most to biodiversity pressure. We found that greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater eutrophication, marine ecotoxicity and soil acidification represent 90% of the drivers affecting biodiversity.\n\nAs part of our efforts to contribute to biodiversity preservation, Solvay joined the Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et Consignations' Business for Biodiversity (B4B+) interest group, which is working on an international Global Biodiversity Score (GBS) as part of a European initiative./uni00A0Solvay is also a founding member of Entreprises pour l'Environnement (EpE), which was created in 1992. It is a think-tank and platform for expertise, bringing together around 60 large French and international companies from all sectors of the economy to work together to better integrate the environment into both their strategies and their day-to-day management. Within the EpE, Solvay is an active member of the Commission on Biodiversity.\n\n## 4.3.3.

It is the highest level of certification awarded by the WHC, an international organization promoting biodiversity conservation practices in the private sector. The site is a hub for wildlife in the region, following several decades of work to promote harmonious coexistence with nature.\n\nOur efforts to restore the Cuchia Quarry in Spain also received recognition in 2021. The project won the European Council of Chemical Industry Federations (Cefic) award for ecosystem preservation. The quarry supplied our site in Torrelavega with limestone for almost 80 years - from 1927 to 2006. Restoration efforts have been underway for the last 30 years, including when the quarry was still in operation.\n\n## 5. RESOURCES\n\n## 5.1.  Product design and life cycle management\n\nGRI DISCLOSURE 3-3 416-1 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY\n\n## 5.1.1. Definitions\n\nSolvay's Sustainable Portfolio Management (SPM) focuses on sustainable business solutions. The SPM methodology is designed to boost Solvay's business performance and deliver higher growth, by letting decision-makers know how our products contribute to sustainability with regard to two factors:\n\n- \u00b7 The environmental footprint related to their production and associated risks and opportunities, based on cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessments.\n- \u00b7 How their applications create benefits or challenges from a market perspective, based on a qualitative assessment using a cradle-to-cradle scope.\n\nLife Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool for compiling inputs and outputs, along with an evaluation of the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle. LCA methodologies meet international standards, namely ISO 14040, ISO 14044 and ISO 14046 norms.\n\nA sustainable solution is defined by Solvay's Sustainable Portfolio Management tool as a product in a given application that makes a greater social and environmental contribution to the customer's performance and, at the same time, demonstrates a lower environmental impact in its production phase.\n\n## 5.1.2. Management approach\n\nSPM assessments are performed every year in order to capture the most recent signals from the market and cover more than 80% of Group revenue. Since its implementation in 2009, the Sustainable Portfolio Management tool has been widely adopted by Solvay Global Business Units and Functions to integrate sustainability into their key processes:\n\n- \u00b7 The Sustainable Portfolio Management profile is an integral part of strategic discussions between Global Business Units and the Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7 The SPM tool is used to evaluate mergers and acquisition projects, to determine whether an investment is feasible in light of Sustainable Portfolio targets.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Having a dedicated LCA team makes it possible to maintain a high level of staff competency and coordinate updates of the main methodologies used based on best practice. Core LCA activity is based on recognized tools, software and databases, and we also have our own database, specific to Solvay business and innovation segments, for instance in material science or battery development.\n\nThe LCA team is also called upon to support business activity concerning customer relations, by sharing environmental and LCA data on products in order to enhance understanding and environmental impact assessments along the value chain, from cradle to grave or recycling. Examples include the automotive sector, the construction sector and Product Carbon Footprint declarations for our customers.\n\n## Taking part in world class Life Cycle Assessment platforms\n\nTo maintain a high level of LCA expertise, we participate in the following collaborative platforms:\n\n- \u00b7 International Reference Centre for the Life Cycle of Products, Processes and Services (CIRAIG): - Solvay joined CIRAIG in 2012 as an industrial partner, ensuring access to high level research and expertise on Life Cycle Assessment methodologies.\n- \u00b7 Association Chimie du V\u00e9g\u00e9tal: Solvay is a member of this association in France, focused on the use of bio-sourced materials in chemistry.\n- \u00b7 SCORE Life Cycle Assessment platform: this platform was created in March 2012 to promote collaboration between industrial, institutional and scientific actors, and to foster positive developments in environmental quantification methods, particularly in Life Cycle Assessments, to be shared and recognized at the European and international levels.\n- \u00b7 World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD): Solvay takes part in Life Cycle Assessment projects and Product Carbon Footprint working groups organized by the WBCSD.\n- \u00b7 Roundtable for Product Social Metrics: this association of industry representatives and consultants establishes guidelines for assessing the social impacts of industrial product life cycles.\n\n## 5.1.3. Indicators\n\nExtensive cradle-to-gate Life Cycle Assessments were performed for 96% of our products, by turnover share, placed on the market, as compared to 94% last year. Solvay's LCA team manages its own product database representing more than 1,300 different chemicals and materials, which is continuously updated to include the most recent industrial or innovation data. As set out in our Solvay One Planet sustainability roadmap, we will continue to shift our portfolio toward opportunities that grow our sustainable solutions, with a target of increasing sustainable solutions to 65% of total Group sales by 2030.\n\n## REVENUE BREAKDOWN BY SPM HEAT MAP CATEGORIES\n\n|               | Units   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Solutions     | %       |     53 |     52 |     53 |\n| Neutral       | %       |     28 |     27 |     27 |\n| Challenges    | %       |      9 |      8 |      7 |\n| Not evaluated | %       |     10 |     13 |     13 |\n\nIn 2021, the proportion of sales from sustainable solutions improved by +1 percentage point, largely reflecting the reduction of environmental impact in production within Specialty Polymers and Peroxides, the acquisition of new agriculture activities, and the requalification of some solutions for coatings.\n\nEffective 2022, the CO 2 reference price was increased from \u20ac75 to \u20ac100 per metric ton CO 2 eq.

For example, composite materials used in planes make the plane lighter, allowing lower greenhouse gas emissions (climate impact), but they also increase the plane's lifespan (resources impact).\n\n## EXTERNAL VALIDATION\n\nSince 2009 with the exception of 2019 and 2020, Arthur D. Little (ADL), our partner in developing and improving our SPM methodology, has performed an in-depth verification of our market alignment results. In 2021, ADL screened every Product Application Combination (PAC) in the database and selected 70 PACs for deeper review.\n\nDiscussions with Arthur D. Little revealed that we reach the same conclusion for 43 PACs out of the sample of 70, representing an agreement rate of 61%. For 21 PACs (30%), Arthur D. Little came to a more negative conclusion than Solvay. For six PACs (9%), Arthur D. Little did not reach final results. For these six PACs, all of which relate to the PFAS family of compounds, ADL identified indicative evidence for an 'Exposed' assessment, and therefore recommended deeper exploration of PFAS before finalizing results. For a sizable number of the PACS concerned, we will not change our SPM 2021 score. Instead, we will instead commit to exploring these results in depth in 2022. In the meantime, our 2021 conclusions remain as they were.\n\n## EU TAXONOMY ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES\n\nThe EU taxonomy (2020/852) is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. It is intended to play an important role in helping the EU scale up sustainable investment and implement the European Green Deal. The EU taxonomy would provide companies, investors and policymakers with appropriate definitions under which economic activities can be considered environmentally sustainable. According to the new timeline set out in the Taxonomy's Delegated Act 2021, companies will have to publish their first Taxonomy eligibility report in 2022.\n\nIn order to be taxonomy-eligible, an economic activity must contribute substantially to at least one of the six environmental objectives - climate mitigation, climate adaptation, water, circular economy, pollution prevention and biodiversity - and do no significant harm to the others. Currently, only climate mitigation and climate adaptation are considered. As such, the taxonomy only addresses a limited number of Solvay activities.\n\nOur calculation of the share of 2021 Solvay sales eligible for the EU taxonomy is based on our best interpretation of the EU Taxonomy texts, including the 2021 version of Technical Annex of the Taxonomy Report. Our only manufacturing activities eligible as \"transition activities\" are soda ash and polymers.\n\nFigures reported for soda ash correspond to the Soda Ash and derivatives business, which is a mono-technology business as described on Solvay's website.\n\nEnabling economic activities as referred to in Article 10(1), point (i), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 do not substantially contribute to climate change mitigation through their own performance. Such activities play a crucial role in the decarbonisation of the economy by directly enabling other activities to be carried out at a low carbon level of environmental performance.\n\nWe identified eligible enabling activities using our Sustainable Portfolio Management methodology, taking into account product / application combinations identified as 'climate Solutions' as described above. This enables us to avoid double counting, as double counting is neutralized in the Sustainable Portfolio Management reporting of Solutions for each impact category as described above. Possible double counting between transition activities and enabling activities are detailed in the table.\n\nSome of our activities, such as polymer membranes in batteries, or soda ash for glass in double glazing, may be eligible both as transitional and enabling activities We have therefore removed these activities from the total of eligible activities.\n\nThe basis on which the turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure were calculated is explained in the Financial statements chapter of this report: note F1: revenue and segment information.\n\nCapital expenditures and operating expenditures corresponding to enabling activities are not yet available. The eligible share of investments depends on the estimation of the corresponding eligible share of future sales and allocation rules have not been defined yet.\n\nFigures reported for plastics in primary form correspond to the Speciality Polymers business. Solvay's portfolio of specialty polymers is described on Solvay's website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n177",

Circular Economy\n\n## 5.2.1. Definitions/uni00A0\n\nCircular economy is a new approach to business that aims to decouple economic growth from resource consumption. Solvay's Circular Economy Business Solution Program is underpinned by a transition to renewable energy sources. It is based on three principles:\n\n- \u00b7 Shifting our product portfolio to bio-based feedstocks and renewable-based feedstock.\n- \u00b7 Retaining the value of the products and materials currently in use by enabling recycling (process additives and technology) or recyclability (by design) of the product.\n- \u00b7 Designing products that increase the longevity of reusable materials.\n\nWe use the following definitions:\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable resources: materials that are continually replenished at a rate equal to or greater than the rate of depletion. This includes plant-based materials from cultivation and animal-based materials from breeding. To fit in a circular economy, the material should be produced from food waste or using regenerative production practices.\n- \u00b7 Renewable energy: energy produced from renewable resources, namely solar, wind, hydroelectric power, biomass or geothermal. Energy provided by technological waste, such as solid recovered fuels, is not considered.\n- \u00b7 Products enabling recycling: products designed to increase the recycling yield, with regard to quality and quantity.\n- \u00b7 Products enabling increased durability: products designed to increase the longevity and durability of other products further down in the value chain in such a way that encourages longer use than the industry standard and at scale, without compromising circularity at the end of the product's functional life.\n\nThe measurement of products based on recycled or renewable materials and renewable energy is weighted by applying a factor of 85% to renewable materials and 15% to renewable energy, according to the average manufacturing cost weight. A similar approach has been defined at the research and innovation level to monitor the contribution of innovation projects to Solvay's circularity ambition.\n\n## 5.2.2. Management approach\n\nOur Circular Economy Transition Program focuses on three categories of actions:\n\n- \u00b7 Increasing the use of bio-based and recycled raw materials.\n- \u00b7 Innovating with regard to materials recycling in closed and open circles, and business models.\n- \u00b7 Innovating to increase the lifespan of materials.\n\nThe transformation of Solvay into a circular economy driver is embedded in our G.R.O.W. strategy. We are working individually and with customers, suppliers and partners to identify opportunities where the Group can leverage our capabilities.\n\nOur research and innovation project portfolio is screened and prioritized according to the principles of the circular economy and around 20% of our innovation budget was attributed to circular innovation in 2021.",

This process is used as an opportunity to develop a circular economy mindset throughout the organization.\n\nA single point of contact is identified to consolidate the data and fill in the questionnaire for assessment. The scorecard and feedback provided by the Foundation are shared and discussed at an appropriate level inside the Group.\n\n## 5.3.  Air quality\n\nGRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 305-6 305-7 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 3 15\n\n## 5.3.1. Definitions\n\nNitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions, conventionally expressed as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), comprise the emissions of nitrogen monoxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ). NOx emissions from Solvay's operations result mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) are excluded from this definition, as they have no impact on acidification. The impact of our N2O emissions is taken into account when assessing Solvay's contribution to climate change./uni00A0\n\nSulfur oxide (SOx) emissions, conventionally expressed as sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), comprise the emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and sulfur trioxide (SO 3 ). SOx emissions arise mainly from the combustion of coal or anthracite.\n\nAccording to the EU Solvent Directive 1999/13/EC, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are compounds with a standard boiling point below or equal to 250\u00b0C. Non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) include all VOCs other than methane. The impact of methane emissions from Solvay's mining activity at Green River, Wyoming, in the US, is therefore not included here, but is taken into account when calculating our contribution to climate change.\n\nOzone-depleting substances (ODS) are expressed as ODP Tonnes, which is defined as the metric tonnes of ODSs weighted by their Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP).).\n\n## 5.3.2. Management approach\n\nAir quality is managed through the health, safety and environment management systems deployed by our sites, in line with their regulatory requirements and those of the Group. Solvay works in close cooperation with local stakeholders to improve air quality at local and regional levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n179",

This was mainly due to the economic upsurge following the 2020 pandemic, which is reflected in higher auto-energy production, which increased by 2.7%). The increase is also partly explained by the need to use more Russian coal instead of petcoke at our Devnya site in Bulgaria.\n\nThe SOx emissions at Group level increased by 641 metric tons - equivalent to 25% - between 2020 and 2021. The sites which have contributed the most to this global change are Torrelavega, in Spain (+301 metric tons), Atequiza, in Mexico (+219 metric tons, due to the higher production rate of dithiophosphate) and Devnya, in Bulgaria (+118 metric tons, caused by a boiler problem in the desulfurization unit).\n\nThe start-up of the new WoodPower I boiler in Rheinberg, in Germany, on April 1, 2021 resulted in an improvement in SOx emissions by 62 metric tons, achieved through reduced coal usage. The impact of this new biomass boiler on our future SOx emissions will be more visible in 2022.\n\nNMVOC emissions increased by 670 metric tons - equivalent to 20 % - in 2021, as compared to 2020. The biggest increases have been observed on the sites of Green-River (+470 metric tons) and Panoli (+89 metric tons), both linked to far higher productions; and also on Saint-Fons (+81 metric tons) due to an issue in one of the production units.\n\n## 5.4.

Definitions\n\nWater management encompasses the management of water flows and water quality, from extraction from the natural environment to restitution in the same or another part of the environment.\n\nFreshwater withdrawal, measured in millions of cubic meters per year, is the amount of incoming freshwater purchased from third parties (e.g. drinking water from the public network) or pumped by Solvay from the public network (drinking water), freshwater systems, such as rivers and lakes, and groundwater sources (aquifers). Freshwater consumption, also measured in millions of cubic meters per year, is calculated as the sum of water lost through evaporation, leakage and exportation of products and wastes. For/uni00A0example, water that is taken from a river for cooling and returned to it after use counts as freshwater withdrawal but not as freshwater consumption.\n\nChemical Oxygen Demand (COD) is the amount of oxygen-reducing substances, mainly dissolved organic matter, discharged into aqueous receivers. COD is expressed as metric tons of oxygen. In addition to nitrogen and phosphorus species, COD also contributes to aquatic eutrophication.\n\nOur estimation of water consumption for Solvay's cradle-to-gate production is effectively equivalent to the water consumption of a product. Simply put, it is the amount of water withdrawn, minus the amount of water of the same quality released back into the same watershed. This means that the water used in turbines for hydropower and the cooling of water in open-loop systems are not included in this indicator. Solvay's main areas of water consumption are in production, or what is known as industrial water, and in irrigation for bio-based raw materials.\n\n## 5.4.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay has a company-wide approach to water that includes limiting freshwater withdrawal and consumption, particularly in locations subject to hydric stress, and ensuring that the water quality remains good in bodies of water in which effluents are discharged, so that the impact on downstream users and natural biota is minimized. Specifically, we focus on reducing the impact of freshwater withdrawal and Chemical Oxygen Demand releases.",

Definitions\n\nIndustrial waste is defined as the waste resulting from our regular manufacturing and research activities. It does not include domestic waste and waste from demolition or construction projects. Mining waste, which results from the prospecting and extraction of minerals, is considered separately from industrial waste. All our waste volumes are expressed as dry matter.\n\nFor EU sites, Hazardous Industrial Waste (HIW) is defined according to Appendix III of the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC). For non-EU countries, classification follows local legislation.\n\nNon-sustainably treated waste comprises waste that is landfilled or incinerated without energy recovery.\n\n## 5.5.2. Management approach\n\nFor industrial waste, and particularly hazardous industrial waste, Solvay's focus is on switching to more sustainable methods of disposal that avoid landfilling or incineration without energy recovery and therefore promote material or thermal recovery.\n\nFor non-hazardous, mostly mineral, waste, Solvay is launching material recovery initiatives aligned with our ambition to contribute to the circular economy.\n\n## 5.5.3.

Definitions/uni00A0\n\nEmployee health and safety management encompasses occupational safety, industrial hygiene and occupational health./uni00A0\n\nOccupational safety is about preventing work-related injuries. Accidents are mostly linked to falls at the same level, human energy, such as pushing, pulling or striking an object, and exposure while opening a line or system. Industrial hygiene management encompasses the assessment, monitoring and management of workers' potential exposures to ergonomic, chemical and physical hazards. Occupational health includes all the preventive actions undertaken in order to protect and promote physical and psychological health at work, both collectively and for each individual Solvay employee.\n\nIn mid-2020, Solvay began using the OSHA definitions of occupational accidents in order to comply with GRI standards and enable comparisons outside Solvay. These are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Occupational accident: a work-related unexpected and undesirable event resulting in damage or harm, namely injury or illness. Accidents on the way to or from home are not considered as work-related unless the worker was travelling for Solvay at the time of the accident.\n- \u00b7 Lost Time Injury or Illness (LTII): a work-related injury or illness that results in a work interruption of one or more days, not including the day of the accident.\n- \u00b7 Lost Time Injury and Illness Rate (LTIIR): the number of LTIIs resulting from an accident per 200,000 work hours.\n- \u00b7 Reportable Injury and Illness (RII): work-related injury or illness resulting from an accident with severity above first aid, according to US OSHA 29 CFR 1904.\n- \u00b7 Reportable Injury and Illness rate (RIIR): the number of reportable injury or illness per 200,000 work hours.\n\n## 6.1.2. Management approach/uni00A0\n\nSolvay requirements for implementing management systems on our sites are covered under section 3.3. Health, safety and environment management. The occupational health and safety management systems cover all Solvay employees, while external visitors, parcel delivery people and transport drivers not performing loading or unloading on-site fall outside the scope. In addition, our safety management system applies to contractors./uni00A0\n\nHazard identification and risk assessments are performed according to Group procedures, which define minimum requirements for methods and the hierarchy of controls. They cover the following topics or activities:\n\n- \u00b7 chemical hazard communication;\n- \u00b7 chemical risk assessment and management;\n- \u00b7 hearing conservation (noise exposure management);\n- \u00b7 prevention of legionellosis;\n- \u00b7 managing asbestos in buildings and facilities;\n- \u00b7 respiratory protection equipment;\n- \u00b7 Group requirements for occupational health;\n- \u00b7 minimum safety requirements for lifting;\n- \u00b7 working at height;\n- \u00b7 working on powered systems;\n- \u00b7 line breaking;\n- \u00b7 working in confined spaces;\n- \u00b7 working in an explosive atmosphere;\n- \u00b7 lifting;\n- \u00b7 excavation;\n- \u00b7 traffic;\n- \u00b7 personal protective equipment (PPE);\n- \u00b7 work permits;\n- \u00b7 management of change (MOC);\n- \u00b7 contractor management.\n\nAll procedures contain training requirements, guidelines and on-boarding presentations for use in implementation on our sites. Quality, evaluations and process improvements are ensured through the sites' management systems. Sites' reporting processes identify unsafe situations, near-misses, incidents or accidents, as well as those cases with potentially high severity, and also set guidelines for investigating incidents and taking corrective actions./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n183",

Occupational physicians perform risk-based medical surveillance, provide advice on improving and adapting working conditions, and promote physical and mental health. All these processes contribute to managing and minimizing risks at work.\n\nOn the shop floor, workers collaborate with industrial hygienists on risk assessments using SOCRATES (Solvay Occupational Risk Assessment Tool to Employees). This tool gives widespread, easy access to IH methods, tools and databases, consistently performs and documents IH risk assessments and enhances traceability of an individual's potential exposures throughout their working life. Workers are informed of their work-related risks by supervisors, industrial hygienists and occupational physicians or nurses.\n\nFormal joint management-worker health and safety committees are established on our sites according to country legislation. Solvay also contributes to complementary health insurance, for which the terms vary according to the country./uni00A0\n\nInitiatives for health promotion are taken at site level in collaboration with local physicians and nurses. Examples of such initiatives include nutritional advice, cardiovascular prevention programs, general check-ups and fitness sessions led by trainers.

In addition, four accidents involving employees and resulting in amputations occurred in 2021 compared to zero in 2020 for both employees and contractors. The rate of Lost Time accidents (LTIIR) also increased significantly for employees and contractors.\n\nThe Group objective of an RIIR below or equal to 0.34 for 2021 was not achieved. This objective was probably too ambitious, as it was based on only six months of experience using OSHA reporting standards on all our sites. A target of an RIIR of less than 0.4 would have been more realistic, although this is still lower than the result of 0.43 achieved in 2021.\n\nGlobally, our safety results deteriorated in 2021, for several reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 Root causes: taking short-cuts to save time, lack of attention or a sense that something is 'always done that way'.\n- \u00b7 Behaviors:\n- -the impact of the Covid-19 situation, specifically a lower presence of leaders and support staff on site;\n- -moving from low to high production demand in a short time.\n\nOngoing changes have also added another level of complexity and increased workload.\n\nTo ensure improvements, the following actions will be implemented in 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 ensuring that not only site but also Group safety results are communicated to front-line workers, in order to increase awareness of the shift in performance;\n- \u00b7 site leadership, including front-line leaders, are to spend more time in the field;\n- \u00b7 providing support, through physical presence, on selected sites, to help identify risks and provide coaching;\n- \u00b7 re-energizing campaigns relating to the Solvay Life Saving Rules;\n- \u00b7 implementing Competency and Complacency training;\n- \u00b7 sites are to share their HSE performance and commitment at Solvay's Executive Leadership Team meetings.\n\n## Industrial hygiene (IH)\n\nA key aspect of our approach to protecting health is the systematic assessment and management of workers' potential exposures to ergonomic, chemical and physical hazards. Global industrial hygiene (IH) procedures define minimum requirements for Solvay's IH risk assessments and management strategies, including the hierarchy of controls. The IH program encompasses:\n\n- \u00b7 Comprehensive chemical inventories established and reviewed at site level, with screening and priority ranking of substances that carry potential health impacts.\n- \u00b7 Solvay Acceptable Exposure Limits (SAELs) developed internally for insufficient or outdated established Occupational Exposure Limits (OELs)./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Occupational Exposure Banding (OEB) in cases where no established OEL exists or there is limited toxicological data. Solvay's OEB approach provides a simple, quick and easy-to-understand hazard ranking./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Implementation of SOCRATES, a new global tool, at identified sites. We expect to complete this process by the end of 2022, ensuring:/uni00A0\n- -widespread and easy access to IH methods, tools, and databases;/uni00A0\n- -consistent performance and documentation of IH risk assessments;\n- -enhanced traceability of an individual's potential exposures throughout their working life./uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Established KPIs that allow for identification and tracking of the completion of site chemical and noise risk assessments./uni00A0",

This is the ratio of the total number of Chemical Risk Assessments, both inhalation and dermal, completed by the site within the last five years, to the total number of Chemical Risk Assessments to be conducted based on the Chemical Risk Assessment List established by the site.\n- \u00b7 The site regularly communicates identified potential occupational risks to the Medical Service provider.\n- \u00b7 At least 70% of the employees scheduled for Risk-Based Medical Surveillance during the year have completed their medical visit.\n\nIn 2021, 61.9% of our manufacturing and research and innovation sites fulfilled all these criteria, as compared to 44% in 2020./uni00A0\n\n## Human biomonitoring of exposure\n\nHuman biomonitoring (HBM) of exposure involves measuring the concentration of a substance or its metabolites in human fluids, such as blood or urine. It can be used to assess exposure to specific chemicals and helps to verify whether protective measures are effective./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, 19 sites performed HBM of exposure, for 30 different chemicals (substances/group of substances).\n\n## HUMAN BIOMONITORING (HBM) OF EXPOSURE\n\n|                                                                       | Units   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Sites performing HBM of exposure                                      | Number  |     19 |     25 |     35 |\n| Sites with at least one result above the Biological Limit Value (BLV) | Number  |      0 |      1 |      3 |\n\nFor sites, which had results above the biological limit values, action plans were put in place to reduce the exposure levels.",

        "page_content": "## Flu vaccination campaign\n\nAn intensive awareness campaign was conducted in order to encourage employees to get vaccinated against seasonal flu, specifically within the context of Covid-19. This resulted in 20.18% of Solvay employees receiving the vaccination. The number of employees vaccinated is likely to be higher than this, as the figure does not include vaccinations that may have been done by private physicians.\n\n## COVID-19 vaccination campaign\n\nSolvay has actively promoted and facilitated Covid-19 vaccination. In countries where it was authorized and possible to do so, Solvay has organized Covid-19 vaccination campaigns and administered vaccinations. In total, 22 sites administered vaccines and seven additional sites organized vaccination for their employees.\n\n## 6.1.4. Key achievements\n\nIn 2021, we obtained a Special Commendation in the CEFIC Responsible Care awards, for our project on supporting and transforming health and well-being in times of Covid-19. It was a global project that included a range of initiatives in support of employee, community and societal health. In particular, CEFIC appreciated our global approach to creating a sustainable and better life at work, as well as our donations to local communities.\n\n## 6.2.  Employee engagement and well-being\n\n## GRI DISCLOSURES 2-30 3-3 401-2 403-4 407-1\n\n## MATERIALITY: HIGH\n\n## SDG 3 8\n\n## 6.2.1. Definitions\n\nEmployee engagement is the level of commitment, passion and loyalty an employee has toward their work, team and company. Solvay believes that engagement increases performance through higher productivity and employee retention and that engagement is fostered by fair labor practices and well-being at work./uni00A0\n\nA constructive relationship with employees and their representatives, built on trust, is considered the basis of fair labor practices at Solvay. This relationship reflects the Group's commitment to respect employees' fundamental human rights and guarantee their social rights.\n\nWell-being at work is a holistic concept which relates to all aspects of the quality of working life that ensure workers are safe, physically and mentally healthy, satisfied, engaged and efficient. It addresses recognition and support, work-life balance, employee growth and development, and good communication and collaboration, based on International Labor Organization and World Health Organization definitions./uni00A0\n\n## 6.2.2. Management approach\n\n## ONE Pulse\n\nEmployee engagement is measured through confidential surveys open to all employees. This includes global surveys as well as local initiatives, such as 'Voice of the People'' surveys.. The results of our surveys enable the Group and local management to identify strengths and areas where the working environment and employee experience can be improved./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, we continued our series of short quarterly surveys, known as ONE Pulse surveys. Available in 14 languages, the ONE Pulse surveys enable us to listen to the feedback and opinions of Solvay employees around the world. This not only promotes a feedback culture, where everyone can safely share their opinions and have open conversations with their team and leaders, but also helps to improve employee experience at work. Our objective was to equip leaders at all levels in the organization with insights about the wellbeing and experience of their team, foster open dialogue and ensure continuous improvement throughout the year.\n\n## Better Life at Work\n\nSince October 2016, a multidisciplinary Committee on Better Life at Work (BLAW) has been in place to define and promote a well-being at work (WBAW) program. It includes occupational physicians and psychologists, Human Resources, health, safety and environment experts, Global Business Unit (GBU) representatives, and sustainable development experts, representing all regions./uni00A0\n\nIn 2021, a new Better Life at Work program was launched, focused on three pillars:\n\n- \u00b7 Governance: a multidisciplinary Better Life at Work Steering Committee, including representatives from our Human Resources (HR), Occupational Medicine, Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) and Sustainable Development Functions, as well as an employees' representative. Solvay's Chief People Officer serves as the Sponsor.\n- \u00b7 Observatory: the Better Life at Work Observatory includes indicators gathered from HR and HSE data, the Pulse surveys, and from diagnosis and assessment (see below).\n- \u00b7 Positive actions: These will be defined using the information gathered through the Observatory.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n187",

        "page_content": "188\n\nFor diagnosis, we have launched pilots at three Solvay sites, one each in Europe, the Americas and Asia, in collaboration with Jaume I University in Spain. The project aims to assess not only risk factors we need to address for well-being at work, but also positive factors that we can build on, in order to create a sustainable Better Life at Work. A similar approach is being developed in the European H-Work Project, which aims to promote mental health in small and medium-sized enterprises and public workplaces drawing on funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program.\n\nIn September 2021, Solvay began deploying a new, standardized global well-being support program, which offers support to all employees requesting coaching or psychological consultations. Previous to this, a third of Solvay's population was not covered by any mental health support plan. We have also provided training from qualified experts for 66 physicians and nurses, to help them to support employees that may have been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nRegarding labor relations, discussions and activities are held at four levels: site, country, european and Group.\n\n## Solvay Global Forum\n\nIn 2015, Solvay created a global employee representative body, the Solvay Global Forum, composed of nine employee representatives from the main areas where Solvay operates, namely Europe, the US, China, Brazil, India and South Korea. Video Conferences are held quarterly, bringing together the Solvay Global Forum and the Group's top management to comment on and discuss the quarterly results of the Group and to keep everyone informed of the main new projects. Two agreements have been signed with the Solvay Global Forum: Global Performance Sharing 2021 and Solvay Cares, the latter of which extended maternity and co-parent leave to 16 weeks./uni00A0In December 2021, the Group launched a Global employee shareholding initiative, that the Solvay Global forum wished to be an inclusive, simple and meaningful way to create sustainable shared value for all.\n\nSolvay Shares program will be open to employees around the world, irrespective of their position or grading. The employees will get a discount rate on the share price and free shares for every three shares they own after a lock-in period. By mid-2023, most of the employees will be offered the possibility to buy shares, and get the same rights like every other shareholder. This program should increase their understanding of the Group's performance as well as their sense of belonging.\n\n## European Works Council\n\nWe have been in permanent dialogue with our European Works Council (EWC) for more than 20 years. In 2021, the EWC met physically on two occasions and the EWC Secretariat met ten times, either virtually or physically, with senior Group management to help steer Solvay's evolution. The main topics discussed were reorganizations, actions taken by the Group to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic, digitization, the evolution of working conditions with the extension of mobile working, the Group Sustainable Development strategy and Solvay's financial results.\n\n## Solvay Cares\n\nIn February 2017 Solvay signed a global agreement guaranteeing a minimum level of welfare and healthcare protection for all Solvay Group employees worldwide. Solvay Cares was fully deployed in 2019 and aims to provide four major benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 full income protection during parental leave, with 16 weeks for both parents;\n- \u00b7 a minimum coverage of 75% of medical fees in the event of hospitalization or severe illness;\n- \u00b7 disability insurance in the event of lasting incapacity;\n- \u00b7 life insurance, including coverage for the family or partner.\n\nAn addendum to the agreement was signed in December 2021, offering to introduce more flexibility for parents to enjoy parental leave according to family needs, and adding the Employee Wellbeing Support program, through which we committed to giving all employees access to confidential mental health support as from December 2021. By January 2023, when all provider contracts will be reviewed, globally aligned standards of the Employee Wellbeing Support Program will apply, ensuring coverage not only for the employee, but also for all members of the employee's household.\n\n## The IndustriALL Global Union Framework Agreement\n\nOn December 17, 2013, Solvay signed a Corporate Social and Environmental Agreement for the whole Group with IndustriALL Global Union. This agreement is based on International Labor Organization standards and the principles of the United Nations Global Compact. It is a tangible expression of Solvay's determination to ensure that basic labor rights and the Group's social standards in the areas of health, safety and environmental protection are respected at all of our sites.\n\nIn February 2017, we renewed our Global Framework Agreement with IndustriALL Global Union, adding new social projects, including societal actions and the protection of mental safety in the workplace. Every year, IndustriALL Global Union representatives meet Solvay employees to check on compliance in the field. Assessments take place at two different sites: one measures the results of the Group's safety policy and the other examines the application of the agreement, covering the following health and safety aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 ensuring good working conditions;\n- \u00b7 managing risk as a daily concern;\n- \u00b7 defining demanding internal policies and their strict application;\n- \u00b7 improving safety performance and regular monitoring of both Solvay's and contractors' employees;\n- \u00b7 ensuring healthy working conditions for all, regardless of the job they perform and its associated risks.\n\nIn 2021, IndustriALL representatives, together with Solvay management, visited four of our Italian subsidiaries in order to assess labor relations. It was; an opportunity to confirm the positive working atmosphere, safety situation and industrial relations, and identify areas for improvement.",

Indicators/uni00A0\n\nWith regards to engagement and well-being at work, four recurring surveys were launched worldwide between November 2020 and September 2021, collecting an average of 12,000 responses, a response rate 50% higher than for 2020 surveys./uni00A0\n\nEach survey is made up of between ten to 12 questions measuring well-being, safety and other dimensions related to employee experience, such as relationships with managers, remote working, Solvay behaviors and workload./uni00A0\n\nIn the four surveys, employees were asked how they were feeling. The percentage of respondents feeling 'OK or better' was over 70% on average, remaining relatively stable as compared to last year. In addition to our Employee Assistance Program, Solvay has put together a guide for managers to help them better support their teams and a flyer for all employees, available in multiple languages., These provide guidance and suggestions about where to turn for help and encouragement, in order to better support those employees who have reported feeling 'less than OK'./uni00A0\n\nDuring the last four weeks, in general, how have you been feeling?\n\n|              | Units   |   Nov. 2020 |   Mar. 2021 |   Jun. 2021 |   Sep. 2021 |\n|--------------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| OK or better | %       |          73 |          67 |          74 |          76 |\n| Less than OK | %       |          27 |          33 |          26 |          24 |\n\nWe also include three engagement questions in our ONE Pulse survey annually. This revealed that about 75% of employees were satisfied and proud to be working at Solvay and that about 70% would recommend the company as a great place to work.\n\n## Employee Representation Indicator\n\n100% of Solvay employees are covered by a collective agreement. This is the Solvay Cares collective agreement with the global employee representative body, the Solvay Global Forum.\n\nTrade unions are present at a majority of Solvay sites around the world. Union membership is estimated at 20% in Europe, 25% in South America, 30% in North America and 70% in Asia.\n\n## 6.2.4. Key achievements/uni00A0\n\nIn responding to the Covid-19 crisis, it was proven that people could work collaboratively from outside the office. As a result, we successfully launched a global mobile working policy, which was deployed across 35 of our administrative sites in 19 countries. More than 7,500 employees are now working in a hybrid mode with both remote and on-site work.\n\nDuring this period we continued to develop the framework used for meeting with our representatives in a hybrid mode. This involved face-to-face meetings where possible, but also making use of the flexibility offered by remote communication, especially in cases where a topic justified a shorter discussion or needed to be held at shorter notice.\n\n## 6.3.  Diversity and inclusion\n\nGRI DISCLOSURES 3-3 405-1 405-2 MATERIALITY: PRIORITY SDG 8\n\n## 6.3.1. Definitions\n\nSolvay defines diversity, equity and inclusion in the following way:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity is the representation of various identities and differences of individuals in a group.\n- \u00b7 Equity is creating equal access to opportunity by recognizing the existence of advantages for some and barriers for others; promoting justice, impartiality and fairness within the procedures, processes and distribution of resources by institutions and systems.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion is actively and intentionally engaging people with different identities and enabling them to feel valued, able to fully contribute and be welcomed within a given setting.\n\n## 6.3.2. Management approach\n\nWe have identified nine action plans to foster diversity, equity and inclusion by 2025:\n\n## Diversity:\n\n- \u00b7 Accelerate gender parity at all mid and senior levels: achieve gender parity by 2030. The first step is carrying out a Gender Impact Assessment (GIA) to identify where current policies may be negatively impacting the advancement of female employees within the organization.\n- \u00b7 Make our workplace more appropriate for people with disabilities: set up a Solvay Disability Equality Index and improve our results. The first step is conducting an audit of the organization, encompassing everything from premises to services, to identify potential barriers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n189",

        "page_content": "190\n\n- \u00b7 Develop Resource Groups to encourage employees to bring their 'whole self' to work: set up diverse employee resource groups (ERGs) worldwide. The first step was to launch the first ERGs for Women, Men Advocating for Real Change, LGBTQ+ and at least one Ethnic Minority Group by the end of 2021.\n\n## Equity:\n\n- \u00b7 Assess if there are undesired pay gaps and close them: identify potential structural and gender pay gaps and develop and implement a plan of action to close them. The first step is building and reporting the ratio of pay of women to men by management level.\n- \u00b7 Ensure fair recruitment: all mid and senior level job openings to have a shortlist comprising 50% of under represented groups, including women. The first step is reviewing and adjusting job descriptions and recruitment campaigns to be more diverse and friendly.\n- \u00b7 Ensure equitable access to career opportunities and development: set up mentor/mentee programs starting with under-represented groups. The first step was to ensure that all our selected Future Top Leader Women and Asian talents had a structured mentorship program in place by the end of 2021.\n\n## Inclusion:\n\n- \u00b7 Build an inclusive employee experience: set up an Inclusion Index and improve our score. The first steps are developing and deploying inclusive training for new employees at Solvay, and setting up a survey to have a first point of reference.\n- \u00b7 Assessment and development program for Solvay leaders to grow and nurture an inclusive mindset: the Global Business Unit (GBU) Presidents and Heads of Functions have a DEI score for their GBUnit or Function and develop a plan to improve their score. The first step is enrolling all of the Senior Leadership Team in inclusion workshops.\n- \u00b7 Build a culture in which individuals feel empowered to speak out or speak up when they experience or witness non-inclusive behaviors, in line with our Code of Business Integrity: 90% of our employees must feel safe to speak up or speak out when confronted with non-inclusive behaviors. The first step is running an awareness campaign to inform all employees about what inclusive behavior is and what it is not.\n\n## 6.3.3. Indicators\n\nAt Group level, we have identified five areas of focus for diversity, which receive specific attention and monitoring to ensure consistent improvement across the organization:\n\n- \u00b7 improving the gender mix at all levels of the organization;\n- \u00b7 leveraging the generational mix to optimize learning, knowledge and experience;\n- \u00b7 developing national and cultural talent that mirrors growth opportunities;\n- \u00b7 enriching the team mix by leveraging experiences and backgrounds;\n- \u00b7 measuring the ratio of base salary of women to men by management categories in our largest countries of operation.\n\nCountry- and site-specific actions are also crafted in response to the local context, thanks to Solvay's sustainability network and best practices.\n\n## WOMEN IN SENIOR + MIDDLE MANAGEMENT\n\n|                              | Unit   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Senior and Middle management | %      |     25 |   24.7 |   24.3 |\n\n## GENDER DIVERSITY BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY\n\n|                                   | Units   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Women in senior management        | %       |     16 |     15 |     14 |\n| Women in middle management        | %       |     26 |     26 |     26 |\n| Women in junior management        | %       |     35 |     34 |     33 |\n| Women in non-managerial positions | %       |     19 |     20 |     20 |\n| Total women in Solvay             | %       |     23 |     24 |     23 |",

Key achievements\n\nTo support our employees through the Covid-19 crisis, we increased our focus on virtual delivery and virtual content, particularly with workshops to help employees and managers with topics specific to the crisis. Employees have access to a pool of internal coaches and mentors, and can also develop by contributing to a project. Some examples include:\n\n- \u00b7 Upskill our Front line:/uni00A0\n- -Solvay's Leadership Team approved a significant investment in the continued development of our customer-facing teams. The launch of our Sales Academy will help our commercial teams continue to develop long-term, mutually beneficial relationships.\n- \u00b7 Face the Crisis:/uni00A0\n- -Our internal coaching community has been mobilized to support more than 60 individuals. This includes 'flash coaching', through three targeted sessions, to boost remote management abilities, deal more efficiently with uncertainty and to re-engage more than 30 teams.\n- -Specific support has been provided to top leaders through reverse mentoring to upskill them in using remote collaboration tools to reconnect.\n- -Coaching tips are included in communications with senior managers, on topics such as performance dialogue and crisis management.\n- \u00b7 Focus on Remote Learning:/uni00A0\n- -Instructor-led classes represented 33% of total training hours in 2021, as compared to 50% in 2020.

Definitions\n\nThe Net Promoter Score (NPS) is the indicator used to measure customer loyalty for each of Solvay's Global Business Units (GBUs). The metric was developed by, and is a registered trademark of, Fred Reichfeld, Bain & Company and Satmetrix. GBU scores are consolidated at the Group level through a revenue-based weighted average.\n\nThe Net Promoter Score is calculated based on customer responses to a single question: 'How likely is it that you would recommend our company to a friend or colleague?' Answers can range from 0 to 10. Those who respond 9 or 10 are called Promoters and considered likely to exhibit valuecreating behaviors, making positive referrals to other potential customers. Those who respond with a score from 0 to 6 are labeled Detractors and are not supportive. Those who give a response of 7 or 8 are labeled Passives. The Net Promoter Score is calculated by subtracting the percentage of Detractors from the percentage of Promoters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n195",

        "page_content": "196\n\nSolvay uses the Net Promoter System SM methodology to boost customer loyalty by promoting a culture of customer feedback and by developing active listening skills at every single touchpoint in the customer journey. The objective is to go far beyond 'just a score' toward a deep transformation of the Group by fostering a more customer-centric culture.\n\nThe Net Promoter System SM is structured around two pillars, allowing us to gather insights at both the strategic and operational levels. The objective of the first and more strategic stage is to identify and further reinforce the areas where the Group truly stands out against the competition in order to raise customer loyalty and accelerate growth. The second, more operational, stage captures how customers perceive our offer from a day-to-day perspective. These key insights trigger tangible action plans - both account-specific and at the GBU level - to bring Solvay closer to our customers and better serve them by delivering more suitable and efficient services.\n\n## 6.5.2. Management approach\n\nSince 2014, each GBU has conducted a customer satisfaction survey at least once every two years to check their strategic alignment with the trends in their business environment. The aim is to identify and select the right areas for each GBU to focus on, as well as to foster differentiation and accelerate growth.\n\nThe Net Promoter Score has been selected as the key indicator of customer loyalty for the Group. It is measured at the Global Business Unit level, consolidated at the Group level and published annually.\n\nIn 2018, Solvay decided to take this approach to the next level by launching the Net Promoter System SM , aimed at transforming the work practices of the entire frontline population across all GBUs and geographies. This ensures that a customer feedback culture is embedded in our DNA.\n\nThe insights gathered from our customers trigger action plans, allowing us to continuously adapt our value proposition to better serve our customers and increase our share of wallet.\n\n## 6.5.3. Indicators\n\nIn 2021, we sent more than 10,000 surveys to our customers and collected more than 2,000 reponses. This feedback, provided by NPS surveys, combined with other Voice of Customer feedback, was used to drive tactical and strategic changes. /uni00A0\n\nIn 2022, the approach described above will evolve to ensure a better focus on customers that are generating the highest value for the company, in line with our customer segmentation approach, in place from 2020.\n\n|                                   | Units   |   2021 | 2020   |   2019 |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Solvay's Net Promoter Score (NPS) | %       |     32 | NA     |     33 |\n\n## ECOVADIS ASSESSMENT\n\nAbout 150 customers, representing more than 20% of Solvay's sales, use EcoVadis to assess Solvay's performance as a supplier. The EcoVadis sustainability assessment methodology is an evaluation of how well a company has integrated the principles of sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into their business and management system.\n\nSolvay is in the top 1% of companies rated by EcoVadis in the manufacture of basic chemicals, fertilizers and nitrogen compounds, plastics and synthetic rubber in primary forms industry.\n\n## SOLVAY'S ECOVADIS SCORE\n\n|                         | Units   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Environment             | %       |     70 |     70 |     70 |\n| Labor and Human Rights  | %       |     80 |     80 |     80 |\n| Ethics                  | %       |     70 |     70 |     70 |\n| Sustainable Procurement | %       |     80 |     80 |     80 |\n| Overall score           | %       |     75 |     75 |     75 |",

Corporate citizenship\n\nGRI DISCLOSURES 3-3  413-1 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 9 17\n\nValue creation is now a collaborative effort, both within Solvay and between Solvay and our stakeholders. We build on this collaborative effort by facilitating employee participation in projects that serve society and by offering Solvay's expertise in the regions where we operate. Disclosure of Solvay's indirect economic impact is provided in this section.\n\n## 6.6.1. Definitions\n\nOur corporate citizenship is carried out through societal actions, which consist of volunteer activities developed by a site or Global Business Unit (GBU), or at the corporate level. These actions have a positive societal impact on at least one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and are aligned with one of the following three pillars: science and innovation, education and sustainability.\n\n## 6.6.2. Management approach\n\nThe Corporate Citizenship Steering Committee is composed of five members and chaired by Solvay's Chief Executive Officer. The Committee gathers three times a year, approves budgets and decides on projects costing \u20ac50,000 or more. The latter are all presented to the Committee by an internal sponsor, who is also the person who will follow up the project./uni00A0\n\nIn 1923, Solvay created the Ernest Solvay Fund to honor the founder of the company, who died a year earlier. Today, the majority of Solvay's corporate philanthropy goes through the Ernest Solvay Fund, which is managed by the independent King Baudouin Foundation. Examples include the Solvay Prize and the Solvay Institutes, our partnership with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and the Bertrand Piccard Alliance.\n\nBusiness Programs for Social Needs are programs that generate business value through addressing social needs. These programs fall under the governance of the relevant GBU. Examples include the Sustainable Guar Initiative, managed by Novecare, and the Sustainable Vanilla Initiative, managed by Aroma.\n\nThe Site Director is accountable for developing and implementing each site's societal actions plan. This involves assembling a dedicated working group including the Site Director, HR Manager, Communication Manager, the local sustainability correspondent and employee representatives. Employee initiatives are encouraged and supported. An example of this are our Citizen Day actions. The event itself is organized and managed by the Corporate Citizenship committee, but implemented by the individual sites.\n\n## 6.6.3. Indicators\n\n## Citizen Day 2021\n\nCitizen Day gives Solvay employees around the world the opportunity to engage in actions with local communities. The event was created by our CEO, Ilham Kadri, in 2019 to reinforce our purpose - we bond people, ideas, and elements to reinvent progress - and encourage employees to act as one team for one planet.\n\nBiodiversity was the theme of our Citizen Day in 2021. The event provided a unique opportunity for Solvay employees to reconnect, raise awareness on this topic and take actions to help strengthen biodiversity.\n\nEmployees involved in Citizen Day 2021 actions reported the following outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 14,770 participations\n- \u00b7 523 actions\n- \u00b7 121 participating sites\n- \u00b7 20,000 Euros raised and donated to biodiversity-related NGOs\n\nA diverse number of actions were organized as part of the event, from bird shelter building workshops to large conferences with talks from scientists. It was also a great opportunity to present successful nature restoration projects. All organized events were recorded, creating a useful database for future projects.\n\n## 6.6.4. Major projects\n\n## Covid-19 actions and contributions\n\nSolvay's various businesses around the globe have supported local communities and healthcare workers during the Covid-19 pandemic. We partnered with customers to provide much-needed face shields, ventilators and other emergency supplies to help heroic healthcare and other workers on the front line in the fight against the virus. Solvay also donated hydrogen peroxide and hand sanitizers to hospitals and pharmacies, and provided support to local nonprofits and community organizations caring for the most vulnerable populations impacted by the pandemic./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n197",

Created in 2013, this prize perpetuates Ernest Solvay's lifelong support of, and passion for, scientific research. Our objective is to endorse key research and highlight the essential role of chemistry, both as a science and an industry, in helping to solve some of the world's most pressing issues./uni00A0\n\nThe 2022 Science for the Future Solvay Prize has been awarded to Katalin Karik\u00f3, Adjunct Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, in the US, and Professor at the University of Szeged, in Hungary, for her work on the biochemical modification of synthetically produced messenger RNA (mRNA), which has enabled the rapid development of vaccines. Her research was most notably used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to build Covid-19 mRNA vaccines, which have saved many lives. It could also help fight other diseases like cancer, infection from influenza, malaria or HIV in the future. Professor Karik\u00f3 has dedicated her 40-year career to using RNA as a therapeutic, with chemistry as a key element to modify the mRNA to avoid the risk of rejection by the immune system.\n\n## The XperiLAB.be project\n\nThe XperiLAB.be project exists to increase awareness of science among young people, using a personal, hands-on approach. XperiLAB.be is also an opportunity to give pupils and teaching staff the tools that they often lack in class. It is designed for children in the last two years of primary school and the first two years of secondary school. Every year about 10,000 pupils attend sessions in the XperiLab.\n\n## Ellen MacArthur Foundation\n\nIn January 2018, Solvay and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation signed a three-year Global Partner agreement that gives the Group an opportunity to make a difference in accelerating the transition to a circular economy in the chemicals sector.\n\n## Sustainable Guar Initiative\n\nSolvay is the world's leading producer of guar derivatives. Guar is a drought-resistant legume grown in semi-arid areas, predominantly in India. Rajasthan accounts for approximately 70% of the country's production.\n\nSince 2015, Solvay has been spearheading a large-scale development initiative to make guar cultivation more sustainable, while boosting the incomes of the farmers who produce it. In collaboration with L'Oreal and Henkel, two of our strategic customers active in personal care, and with the support of the NGO TechnoServe, more than 7,000 farmers in Bikaner were trained over four years, and more than 971 kitchen gardens were developed in 36 villages.\n\nThe initiative's primary objective is to encourage sustainable and climate-smart agriculture, thereby increasing farmers' revenues through good guar cultivation practices for seed selection, seed treatment, sowing and pest management. The initiative also empowers women through specific training on hygiene, health, and nutrition, which enables us to:\n\n- \u00b7 Encourage better nutritional practices by growing vegetables in kitchen gardens in a region where the traditional diet is very limited.\n- \u00b7 Improve health and hygiene practices for the women themselves and their children.\n\nThe initiative also focuses on agroforestry, with more than 66,000 trees planted to fight sand movement and soil erosion in the fields. In addition to this, trees are planted in communities and technical advice is provided, making 12 different types of fruit available to these communities.\n\nAs water is a rare resource in Rajasthan, a village pond with a capacity of 15.89 million liters was created, helping 150 households to have increased access to drinking water. Rooftop rainwater harvesting systems were also installed, collecting 8,000 liters of water used for the kitchen gardens.\n\nThe Solvay Solidarity Fund has also donated \u20ac100,000 to help address Indian guar farmers' urgent economic and sanitary needs resulting from the Covid-19 crisis. Guar farmers have seen a drop in their income because of severe restrictions on movement. They have also been affected by poor monsoon conditions, which have reduced guar yields. The donation will help the farmers meet their urgent needs, through the distribution of sanitary kits and agricultural inputs, while also helping them to become more resilient in the future, by building lake ponds, for instance.\n\nThe result of this initiative is that guar farmers can earn a better living, global buyers can obtain higher quality guar and the market can benefit from improved supply security.",

Definitions\n\nProduct stewardship means managing risks throughout a product's entire life cycle, from the design stage to end of life. Risks include the possibility of injury or impact on health for a third party or damage to third party property arising from the misuse of Solvay products in a customer's plant or use in an application for which the product is not designed. Risk management is particularly important for products used in healthcare, food and feed applications.\n\n## 6.7.2. Management approach\n\nSolvay's Responsible Care policy requires the Group to:\n\n- \u00b7 Maintain a comprehensive understanding of each product's hazards, risks and impacts related to all life-cycle steps and intended applications.\n- \u00b7 Manage product knowledge so as to comply with local requirements on product information, while ensuring worldwide consistency.\n- \u00b7 Keep records of all necessary and required product safety information to ensure availability throughout the full life cycle, beyond the commercialization period.\n- \u00b7 Send standardized product safety data sheets to customers along with the first delivery and when required by local regulations. This key information is consistently maintained and distributed worldwide for all products to all customers, in compliance with local regulations and in the local languages.\n\nIn line with our Responsible Care commitment, we are constantly improving our knowledge of how Solvay products are used and the associated risks. The extensive knowledge this represents allows Solvay to characterize and manage risks related to product handling and to prioritize mitigation actions related to potential inappropriate use. The management of Safety Data Sheets reflects this commitment to ensuring the information on hazards associated with our products is readily available to our employees and customers.\n\nSolvay ensures that our product portfolio complies with all the relevant regional and national chemicals regulations such as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances) in the European Union, UK REACH in the United Kingdom, K-REACH in South Korea, KKDIK in Turkey and TSCA in the US.\n\nIn addition, Solvay has a strategy to decrease the use of Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) in marketed products and more broadly throughout the entire value chain. We focus on the SVHC on the EU REACH authorization list (annex XIV) and EU REACH candidate list, but we also go beyond this, following an internal process in our operations worldwide. Specifically, we have set up our own reference list of SVHCs, the Solvay-SVHC and Substance Requiring Attention (SRA). This was established in 2015 and includes three categories:\n\n- \u00b7 Black list Solvay-SVHCs: already undergoing a regulatory phasing out process with a known deadline in at least one country or zone, or a restriction for Solvay relevant uses.\n- \u00b7 Red list Solvay-SVHCs: currently included in regulatory lists of substances that could enter into a process of special authorization or restriction in the medium term.\n- \u00b7 Yellow list S-SRAs: substances requiring specific attention, such as substances under scrutiny by authorities, NGOs, scientists and industries due to their known hazardous properties or potential effects.\n\nRisk studies and Analysis of Safer Alternatives (ASA) for red and black Solvay-SVHCs placed on the market are underway, and substances are replaced with safer alternatives where feasible.\n\nNew Analysis of Safer Alternatives (ASA) covering newly identified listed SVHC are performed within three years./uni00A0 All current Analysis of Safer Alternatives shall be reviewed every three years.\n\n## 6.7.3. Indicators\n\n## SAFETY DATA SHEETS\n\nSolvay currently places over 15,000 products on the market and produces safety data sheets (SDS) in 41 languages and specific SDS for 65 countries. Product Stewardship programs give adequate information and technical assistance to customers, ensuring a good understanding of products and how to safely use and handle them. Each of our Global Business Units (GBUs) are responsible for ensuring that SDS are revised at least once every three years, or every time a substance undergoes significant modifications. Solvay manages product information centrally and as legislation continues to evolve, the Group learns more about the conditions under which products are used so as to record and assess any associated risks.\n\nTo make sure that customers are receiving new and updated Safety Data Sheets, and to limit the quantity of paper printed, Solvay uses an automatic system to send SDS by email. In 2021, this automated shipping function was activated for 94.6% of Solvay sales, and the roll-out will continue in 2022. This automatic delivery of the SDS was successful for 83% of shipments, where SDS were available for the delivery country and the customer's email address was also available). When errors occurred, SDS were emailed manually./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n199",

This knowledge must be collected and organized into reliable and systematic safety information that includes all uses and risks incurred along the value chain. Solvay fully complies with the extensive REACH requirements for product registrations. We registered 744 dossiers and are the lead or sole registrant for 263 substances. In accordance with the Cefic Action Plan program, we are also dedicated to improving the quality of REACH dossiers.\n\nRegular updates of dossiers are performed according to REACH obligations, either as new information becomes available or at the request of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA). In total, we have carried out 621 REACH updates on dossiers, with 91 in 2018, 152 in 2019, 142 in 2020 and 236 in 2021 .\n\nBased on the knowledge we have gathered through REACH on our products and associated risks, Solvay has updated the classification of all products based on the new Global Harmonized System.\n\nIn addition, Solvay continues to adapt to new product regulations in many countries, notably to cope with emerging, REACH-like regulations in nonEuropean countries. More specifically we have:\n\n- \u00b7 registered 13 dossiers in 2019 and 23 in 2021 in the framework of Korean REACH;\n- \u00b7 reported 545 substances or polymers to be registered in the framework of KKDIK Reach Turkey, including 66 potential lead dossiers;\n- \u00b7 reported 5,216 substances in the framework of 'existing chemicals' in the Eurasian inventory;\n- \u00b7 reported 275 substances in the framework of the National Chemical Inventory (NCI) of Vietnam;\n- \u00b7 submitted 8 substances in the framework of the new Chinese MEE order N\u00b012.\n\nFor UK REACH, Solvay successfully completed 136 grandfathering registrations and 1569 Downstream User Import Notifications ('DUIN') within the relevant regulatory deadlines.\n\n## SAFER ALTERNATIVES FOR MARKETED PRODUCTS: SVHC according to the EU REACH legislation\n\nSolvay is closely monitoring the SVHC according to the EU REACH Candidate list and EU REACH Authorization list (annex XIV) by identifying all Marketed products containing a concentration above 0.1% of those substances,sold not only in the EU but Worldwide.\n\n|                                                                                                   | Units   |   2021 | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| SVHCs EU REACH Candidate list  (1)  present in Marketed products above 0.1%  on a worldwide scope | Number  |     37 | 40     | 29     |\n| Analysis of safer alternatives required  (2)                                                      | Number  |     62 |        |        |\n| Of which completed                                                                                | %       |     58 |        |        |\n| Of which effective replacement achieved                                                           | %       |     29 |        |        |\n\n- (1) According to the EU REACH authorization list (annex XIV) and EU REACH Candidate list.

Of the 69 analyses of safer alternatives completed as of December 31, 2021, since the start of the program:\n\n- \u00b7 22 have led to effective replacement, either through SVHC substitution or reduction below required threshold, or through stopping production.\n- -Example: N,N-Dimethylformamide: product commercialization stopped\n- -Example: N-Methylpyrrolidone: product replaced by an NMP-free product variant\n- \u00b7 24 are ongoing, meaning that an alternative has been identified and discussed with customers for implementation.\n- \u00b7 23 have resulted in no available alternatives, either because no substitute is available, there are regulatory obligations to use SVHC for some applications, or because an alternative has not been requested due to the application in the final product.\n\n## 6.8.  Critical incident risk management\n\nGRI DISCLOSURE 2-27 3-3 MATERIALITY: HIGH SDG 3 12 13\n\n## 6.8.1. Definitions\n\nThe reporting of Process Safety Incidents is aligned with the globally harmonized metrics from the ICCA (International Council of Chemical Associations) and Cefic (European Chemical Industry Council). The Process Safety Incident rate (PSI rate) corresponds to the number of Process Safety Incidents per 100 Full Time Equivalent (including employees and contractors and assuming 2,000 working hours per worker, per year). This rate is monitored and enables benchmarking with peers.\n\nTransport Safety Incidents are incidents occurring during the movement of a chemical product such as:/uni00A0\n\n- \u00b7 loading or unloading at a Solvay site;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 circulating inside a Solvay site in a vehicle, on the way in or out of the site;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Circulating on public roads, rail, air, inland waterways, or sea;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 Loading or unloading at an off-site location, if Solvay or a logistics provider contracted by Solvay is performing the loading or unloading.\n\n## 6.8.2. Management approach\n\n## Process safety\n\nProcess Safety Management is a management system for designing and operating industrial processes that handle large quantities of hazardous chemicals. For preventing and controlling incidents in industrial processes, Solvay applies the Process Safety Management Principles on all industrial sites, regardless of whether or not the site is covered by regulatory requirements./uni00A0\n\nKey elements are:\n\n- \u00b7 Completion of Process Hazard Analyses to identify high-risk situations. These are performed on each unit with a unique risk matrix to quantify the risk level of every potential accidental scenario, combining severity and probability factors.\n- \u00b7 Activation of an Emergency Response Plan in case of severe incidents on site. Relevant internal and external parties are informed through the application of Solvay's crisis management procedure. If needed, the Corporate Crisis Cell (Crisis alert duty 24/7) is also activated.\n- \u00b7 Systematic analysis of each incident as soon as possible, in order to identify root causes and implement preventive actions to avoid similar incidents in the future.",

The incident severity - medium, high or catastrophic - is assessed by applying internal criteria including consequences on-site or off-site, damage to the immediate vicinity and quantity of spilled material.\n- \u00b7 P ublication of Process Safety bulletins for the most significant incidents, distributed to all sites. These bulletins are used by the sites as support materials for safety talks to increase the process safety knowledge of employees.\n\n## Transport safety\n\nThe major goal of the Transport Safety Management system is a reduction in incidents that could lead to catastrophic consequences. The main elements are :\n\n- \u00b7 regulatory watch and compliance with applicable transport regulations;\n- \u00b7 training;\n- \u00b7 selection process of Logistics Service Providers, based on hazard and risk assessment;\n- \u00b7 operational management of day-to-day transport operations, including loading and unloading;\n- \u00b7 emergency preparedness and response for level 1, level 2 and level 3;\n- \u00b7 incident reporting and investigation;\n- \u00b7 auditing.\n\n## 6.8.3. Indicators\n\n## Process safety\n\nSolvay's target is to avoid any high or catastrophic severity incidents and to reduce the Process Safety Incident rate.\n\n|                                                                     | Units       |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Process Safety Incident rate                                        | per 100 FTE |    0.9 |    0.9 |    0.9 |\n| Process Safety Incidents with high or catastrophic severity/uni00A0 | Number      |    0   |    0   |    1   |\n\nNumber of Process Safety Incidents per 100 full time employees (employees and contractors, assuming 2,000 hours of work per worker per year).\n\n|                                                          | Units   |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Process Safety Incidents with release to the environment | Number  |     30 |     26 |     34 |\n| of which with operating permit exceedance                | Number  |     17 |     14 |     16 |\n| of which without permit exceedance                       | Number  |     13 |     12 |     18 |\n\nThis consolidated data covers all operational sites, including research and innovation centers with significant chemical process risks, but excluding mines, quarries and laboratories with lower risks.\n\nNo incidents with significant off-site environmental impact were reported in 2021. In 2021, 30 process incidents with release to the environment were reported and, among those, 17 generated reportable cases of having exceeded an operating permit limit./uni00A0The reduced number of releases into the environment in 2020 is a consequence of the reduction in industrial activity caused by Covid-19.\n\n## Transport safety\n\nAll medium, high and catastrophic transport safety incidents must be reported in the corporate reporting tool, with a detailed description and classification. Root cause analysis, including actions to prevent recurrence and lessons learned bulletins are mandatory for all high severity and catastrophic incidents, and for medium severity incidents resulting in a fire or an explosion.\n\n## TRANSPORT SAFETY INCIDENTS:\n\n|                 | Units   |   2021 |\n|-----------------|---------|--------|\n| Medium severity | Number  |      7 |\n| High severity   | Number  |      0 |\n| Catastrophic    | Number  |      1 |\n\nThe main incident reported in 2021 was:\n\n- \u00b7 Catastrophic: during a road pre-carriage operation prior to an air shipment, a truck driver had an accident while reversing on a parking lot at Mumbai airport, which resulted in the death of one person.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n203",

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nSolvay (the 'Company') is a public limited liability company governed by Belgian law and quoted on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Paris. The principal activities of the Company, its subsidiaries, joint operations, joint/uni00A0ventures and associates (jointly the/uni00A0'Group') are described in note/uni00A0F1 on revenue and segment information .\n\nOn February/uni00A022, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the consolidated financial statements for issuance. They have been prepared in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0accounting policies as endorsed by the European Union, as disclosed hereafter.\n\n## MAIN EVENTS AND CHANGES IN THE CONSOLIDATION SCOPE\n\nOn January 18, 2021, Solvay sent a Call Option Notice to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to purchase the EBRD shares in the Solvay holding of the Rusvinyl Joint Venture. The option price of \u20ac 52 million for the call option held by Solvay was equal to the option price for the put option held by the EBRD, which was booked as an Other current liability at the end of 2020. The option price was paid in Q1, 2021, thus settling the liability for the same amount.\n\nIn 2021, additional voluntary contributions of \u20ac 102 million and \u20ac 134 million were made to the Belgian and UK pension plans respectively. In 2020, additional voluntary contributions of approximately \u20ac 380 million, \u20ac 80 million and \u20ac 95 million were made to the French, US and German pension plans respectively.\n\nIn January 2021, Solvay launched a new chapter of its strategic transformation aimed to further align its structure to its G.R.O.W. strategy. This builds on previous plans announced in 2020, and represents a profound simplification of all support functions to serve the business more effectively. The plan will lead to an additional net reduction of approximately 500 roles by the end of 2022 and annual cost savings of \u20ac 75 million. As a consequence of the new restructuring plan, a restructuring provision of around \u20ac 150 million was recognized in Q1 2021.\n\nOn November 29, 2021, Solvay closed its tender offer of the buyback operation related to its \u20ac 750 million senior bonds at 1.65% due in 2022 (ISIN:BE6282459609) accepting for purchase in cash all the validly tendered bonds in an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac 373 million. See note F33 Net Indebtedness for additional information.\n\n## Portfolio management\n\nDuring 2021, the assets and liabilities related to the following businesses previously classified as 'held for sale' were divested:\n\n- \u00b7 the Peroxides sodium chlorate business line and related assets in Povoa (Portugal),\n- \u00b7 the various fluorine chemicals assets in Onsan, South Korea, part of Special Chem,\n- \u00b7 the Peroxides sodium percarbonate business line and related assets in Bad H\u00f6nningen (Germany),\n- \u00b7 the Barium Strontium business and the joint venture with Chemical Products Corporation (CPC),\n- \u00b7 the Process Materials business (part of Composite Materials),\n- \u00b7 the Novecare amphoterics surfactants activities, and\n- \u00b7 the Novecare surfactants and anti-oxidants business in Rasal (India).\n\nThese divestments lead to a decrease in sales of \u20ac 220 million in 2021 compared to 2020. There was no material capital gain/loss on these divestments.\n\nOn January 31, 2020, Solvay announced it had formally completed the divestment of its Performance Polyamides activities to BASF and DOMO Chemicals. The transaction is based on an enterprise value of \u20ac 1.6 billion and the selling proceeds net of costs of disposals on the combined transaction were \u20ac 1.3/uni00A0billion (selling proceeds of \u20ac 1.5 billion received on January 31, 2020). The capital gain after taxes was \u20ac 140 million after the agreement on the final purchase price with DOMO Chemicals, finalized in Q4 2020 and the final agreement with BASF reached in 2021 without significant changes, but not yet settled.\n\nOn November 5, 2020, Solvay and Composites One LLC, entered into an exclusive negotiation period for the acquisition of Solvay's Process Materials (PM) business by Composites One. This business line had sales of approximately \u20ac 80 million in 2020 and operated 6 production sites in the US, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. The transaction was completed in Q1 2021.\n\nOn November 23, 2020, Solvay reached an agreement with Latour Capital to sell its technical-grade barium and strontium business in Germany, Spain and Mexico as well as its sodium percarbonate business in Germany. Solvay's barium and strontium business includes a joint venture with Chemical Products Corporation (CPC), which is part of the transaction. The transaction was completed in Q1 2021.\n\nOn December 22, 2020, Solvay signed an agreement to sell its North American and European amphoteric surfactant business to OpenGate Capital, a private equity firm with headquarters in Los Angeles, California (USA). The sale includes three production sites supporting the amphoteric product",

The agreement also includes tolling and service agreements between Solvay and OpenGate to ensure a seamless transition and minimal customer disruption. The Group closed the sale in Q2 2021.\n\nOn July 1 2021, Solvay announced the closing of the acquisition, from Bayer, of a seed coating business, with facilities in M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, France, and tolling operations in the U.S. and Brazil. This is a natural extension to Solvay's own AgRHO\u00ae family of sustainable seed boosting solutions (part of Novecare) and supports the drive toward more bio-based, sustainable technologies.\n\n## COVID-19 impact\n\nThe total net impact of COVID-19 on the full year 2021 EBITDA was not considered to be material to the Group (\u20ac (434) million EBITDA impact in 2020) as the short-term mitigation actions related to labor costs (including furloughs) and indirect spend were substantially completed at December 31, 2020. COVID-19 triggered some impacts and actions in 2020 that have been described in Note F24 Impairment. The Group will continue to monitor any future evolution of the sanitary crisis./uni00A0\n\n## CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n\n| In \u20ac million                                                | Notes    | 2021     | 2020     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Sales                                                       | (F1)     | 11,434   | 9,714    |\n| of which revenue from non-core activities                   | (F3)     | 1,330    | 749      |\n| of which net sales                                          | /uni00A0 | 10,105   | 8,965    |\n| Cost of goods sold                                          | /uni00A0 | -8,508   | -7,207   |\n| Gross margin                                                | /uni00A0 | 2,926    | 2,507    |\n| Commercial costs                                            | /uni00A0 | -287     | -312     |\n| Administrative costs                                        | /uni00A0 | -946     | -900     |\n| Research and development costs                              | /uni00A0 | -325     | -300     |\n| Other operating gains and (losses)                          | (F4)     | -80      | -149     |\n| Earnings from associates and joint ventures                 | (F23)    | 158      | 58       |\n| Results from portfolio management and major restructuring   | (F5)     | -133     | -1,549   |\n| Results from legacy remediation and major litigations       | (F5)     | -123     | -20      |\n| EBIT                                                        | /uni00A0 | 1,190    | -665     |\n| Cost of borrowings                                          | (F6)     | -107     | -114     |\n| Interest on loans and short term deposits                   | (F6)     | 9        | 8        |\n| Other gains and (losses) on net indebtedness                | (F6)     | -4       | -8       |\n| Cost of discounting provisions                              | (F6)     | 1        | -68      |\n| Result from equity instruments measured at fair value       | /uni00A0 | 6        | 3        |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year before taxes                     | /uni00A0 | 1,094    | -844     |\n| Income taxes                                                | (F7)     | -110     | -248     |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year from continuing operations       | /uni00A0 | 985      | -1,092   |\n| Profit for the year from discontinued operations            | (F8)     | 5        | 163      |\n| Profit/(loss) for the year                                  | /uni00A0 | 989      | -929     |\n| attributable to:                                            | /uni00A0 | /uni00A0 | /uni00A0 |\n| - Solvay share                                              | /uni00A0 | 948      | -962     |\n| - non-controlling interests                                 | /uni00A0 | 41       | 33       |\n| Basic earnings per share from continuing operations (\u20ac)     | /uni00A0 | 9.11     | -10.90   |\n| Basic earnings per share from discontinued operations (\u20ac)   | /uni00A0 | 0.04     | 1.58     |\n| Basic earnings per share (\u20ac)                                | (F9)     | 9.15     | -9.32    |\n| Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations (\u20ac)   | /uni00A0 | 9.09     | -10.90   |\n| Diluted earnings per share from discontinued operations (\u20ac) | /uni00A0 | 0.04     | 1.58     |\n| Diluted earnings per share (\u20ac)                              | (F9)     | 9.13     | -9.32    |",

Basis of preparation\n\nThis information was prepared in accordance with European Regulation (EC) 1606/2002 on the application of international accounting standards dated July/uni00A0 19, 2002. The Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A0 31, 2021 were prepared in accordance with IFRS/uni00A0 (International Financial Reporting Standards) as published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and endorsed by the European Union.\n\nThe accounting standards applied in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021 are consistent with those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2020. The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and/uni00A0amendments applicable for the first time in 2021\n\nIn August 2020, the IASB issued Interest Rate Benchmark Reform- Phase 2 (IBOR Reform) which amends IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition & Measurement, IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts, and IFRS 16 Leases which is effective for periods commencing on or after January 1, 2021 and has been endorsed by the EU. The amendments enable entities to reflect the effects of transitioning from benchmark interest rates, such as interbank offer rates (IBORs) to alternative benchmark interest rates without giving rise to accounting impacts that would not provide useful information to users of financial statements.\n\nDuring 2021, Solvay identified the main areas where the reform could have an impact and going forward will continue to monitor the market evolution resulting from the decisions taken by each of the relevant authorities of such benchmarks. The identification covers all financial instruments where a benchmark is referenced including loan and lease contracts for the purpose of calculating interest applicable to such financial instruments. As displayed in note F32.D, Financial Risk Management, the majority of the underlying debts are at fixed rates, which indicates the impact of IBOR Reform under the current understanding did not have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2021, the IASB issued an amendment to IFRS 16 Leases COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions beyond June 30, 2021, which was endorsed by the EU in August 2021 and was effective for annual periods starting on or after April 1, 2021. The amendment did not have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn April 2021, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) issued a final agenda decision on IAS 19 Employee Benefits, which included updates regarding the periods of service to which an entity attributes benefit for a particular defined benefit plan. The application of this agenda decision resulted in a decrease to the defined benefit obligation of \u20ac 8 million with the impact recorded in other comprehensive income. The Group is still assessing the impact of this agenda decision in the various local entities and these impacts will only be determined in future accounting periods when a globally consistent and locally supported methodology is reached.\n\nIn April 2021, the IFRS IC issued its second final agenda decision on IAS 38 Intangible Assets, which clarifies how a customer should account for the costs of configuring or customizing the supplier's application software in a Software as a Service (SaaS) arrangement that is determined to be a service contract. The application of the agenda decision did not have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition to the standards, interpretations and amendments mentioned above, no other standards, interpretations, or amendments applicable for the first time in 2021 had more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and/uni00A0amendments applicable for the first time in 2022\n\nStandards, interpretations, or amendments applicable for the first time in 2022 are not expected to have more than an insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and/uni00A0amendments applicable for the first time after 2022\n\nStandards, interpretations and amendments applicable for the first time after 2022 are not expected to have a more than insignificant impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 2. Basis of measurement and presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in/uni00A0millions of euros, which is also the functional currency of the parent company.\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the application of accounting policies and the measurement of amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The areas for which the estimates and assumptions are material with respect to the consolidated financial statements are presented in the section/uni00A0Critical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty.",

        "page_content": "## 3. Principles of consolidation\n\n## 3.1.   Consolidation scope\n\n## 3.1.1.   General\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, and:\n\n- \u00b7 entities controlled by the Company (including through its subsidiaries) and that hence qualify as subsidiaries (see 3.1.2. below);\n- \u00b7 arrangements over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) exercises joint control, and that qualify as joint operations (see 3.1.3. below);\n- \u00b7 arrangements over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) exercises joint control, and that qualify as joint ventures (see 3.1.4. below);\n- \u00b7 entities over which the Company (including through its subsidiaries) has significant influence and that hence qualify as associates (see 3.1.4. below).\n\nWhere necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the investees so as to align their accounting policies with those of the Group.\n\nIn accordance with the principle of materiality, certain companies, which are not of a significant size, have not been included in the consolidation scope. Companies are deemed not to be significant when, during two consecutive years, they do not exceed any of the three following thresholds in terms of their contribution to the Group's accounts:\n\n- \u00b7 sales of \u20ac/uni00A030/uni00A0million;\n- \u00b7 total assets of \u20ac/uni00A015/uni00A0million;\n- \u00b7 headcount of 150 persons.\n\nCompanies that do not meet these criteria are, nevertheless, consolidated where the Group believes that they have a/uni00A0potential for rapid development, or where they hold shares in other companies that are consolidated based on the/uni00A0above criteria.\n\nIn the aggregate, the non-consolidated companies have an immaterial impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\nThe full list of companies can/uni00A0be obtained at the Company's head office.\n\n## 3.1.2.   Investments in subsidiaries\n\nA subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. Control is achieved when the Group has (a) power over an investee, (b) exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee, and (c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the investor's returns. To assess whether the Group has control, potential voting rights are taken into account. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated. The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal.\n\nIntra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNon-controlling interests in subsidiaries are presented separately from the Group's equity. Non-controlling interests are initially measured, either at fair value (full goodwill method), or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (proportionate goodwill method). The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to the acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\nChanges in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized directly in equity.\n\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest, and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. Amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted for (i.e. Reclassified to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings) in the same manner as would be required if the relevant assets or liabilities were disposed of. The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary at the date when control is lost is considered to be the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accounting in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments or, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or joint venture in accordance with IAS/uni00A028 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures.\n\n## 3.1.3.   Investments in joint operations\n\nA joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. In its consolidated financial statements, the Group recognizes its share of the joint operations' assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, based on its ownership interest in the joint operations.\n\n## 3.1.4.   Investments in associates and/uni00A0joint/uni00A0ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary, nor an interest in a joint arrangement. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n223\n\nT",

Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint ventures are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment is classified as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS/uni00A05 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations . Under the equity method, on initial recognition, investments in associates and joint ventures are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost, and the carrying amount is adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture, less any impairment of the value of individual investments. Losses of an associate or joint venture in excess of the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Group's net investment in the associate or joint venture) are recognized only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and (contingent) liabilities of the associate or joint venture recognized at the date of acquisition is goodwill. The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.\n\nWhere a Group entity transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the relevant associate or joint venture.\n\n## 4. Foreign currencies\n\nThe individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group entity are expressed in euros (EUR), which is the presentation currency of the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entities' functional currency are recognized at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the closing rate. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate when the fair value was measured. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated at the closing rate.\n\nExchange differences are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (therefore forming part of the net investment in the foreign operation), which are recognized initially in other comprehensive income under 'currency translation differences'; and\n- \u00b7 exchange differences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks (see note F32 Financial instruments and financial risk management for hedge accounting policies).\n\nThe main exchange rates used are:\n\nYear-end rate\n\nAverage rate\n\n| 1 Euro =       |     | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | 2021       | 2020       |\n|----------------|-----|---------------------|---------------------|------------|------------|\n| Brazilian Real | BRL | 6.3089              | 6.3731              | 6.3778     | 5.8950     |\n| Yuan Renminbi  | CNY | 7.2188              | 8.0240              | 7.6275     | 7.8749     |\n| Pound Sterling | GBP | 0.8401              | 0.8981              | 0.8596     | 0.8896     |\n| Indian Rupee   | INR | 84.1963             | 89.6502             | 87.4271    | 84.6303    |\n| Japanese Yen   | JPY | 130.4077            | 126.4617            | 129.8783   | 121.8240   |\n| Korean Won     | KRW | 1,346.4377          | 1,332.8358          | 1,353.6608 | 1,345.7603 |\n| Mexican Peso   | MXN | 23.1537             | 24.4329             | 23.9889    | 24.5300    |\n| Russian Ruble  | RUB | 85.3452             | 91.4630             | 87.1511    | 82.7249    |\n| US Dollar      | USD | 1.13265             | 1.2270              | 1.1827     | 1.1420     |\n\n## 5. Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nGovernment grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of those assets. They are recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position at their expected value at the moment of initial recognition. The grant is recognized in profit or loss over the depreciation period of the underlying assets as a reduction of depreciation expense.",

Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.\n\n## 6. Climate Change\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management has considered the impacts of climate change, particularly in the context of the disclosures included in the risk report and Extra-financial Statements and the Group's progression towards the ambitious 2030 goals to reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our operations by 30%, an annual pace aligned with the Paris Agreement objectives, and to phase-out the use of coal for energy where renewable alternatives exist.\n\nIn October 2021, the Group also published its ambitions to become carbon neutral by 2040 for all businesses except Soda Ash, which is targeted to be carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nSolvay plans to invest up to \u20ac 1 billion to reach carbon neutrality by 2040 for all its businesses other than Soda Ash with an additional investment of approximately \u20ac 1 billion identified for Soda Ash to pave its path towards full carbon neutrality for the Group before 2050. These investments will be partially supported by non-recourse financing and government subsidies, enabling Solvay to also continue to invest in its growth initiatives. Further studies on technology innovation will determine the future investment needs beyond 2040.\n\nFor a number of years now, the Group has adopted an internal carbon price and it has imputed that as an input cost into all investment decisions, irrespective of prevailing market prices. The internal cost was originally set at \u20ac 25 per metric ton in 2015, was doubled to \u20ac 50 in 2019 and was raised to \u20ac 100 per metric ton of CO 2 in 2021. This approach ensures that all investments contribute positively to the resilience of the Group in the face of climate change risk and are also oriented towards achieving carbon neutrality.\n\nIn addition to the strategic direction, policies and commitments, it is important to note that Solvay is taking concrete actions aligned with its climate change commitments. These are extensively developed in the Sustainability Report. As an example of the Group's commitment to phase out of coal in Soda Ash business, two projects were initiated comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 The construction of two waste-wood boilers accounted for as finance leases in Rheinberg, Germany;\n- \u00b7 An equity investment at the Dombasle site of which Solvay has a 10% share. The project is valued at approximately \u20ac 225 million and is financed largely through non-recourse debt executed in February 2022 and government subsidies. Included in the investment are two refuse derived fuel boilers.\n\nWhen such investments are made, the Group verifies the useful life of the assets that are replaced and adjusts the estimated useful life if necessary. For 2021, no material revisions were needed and there is no indication that any material amounts of existing assets would be impaired as a result of the investment plans in other fuel types in the future.\n\nThe Group is also actively working on sourcing its energy needs from more environmentally friendly resources including long-term renewable energy generation solutions both onsite and offsite at certain facilities. These include long-term solar and wind power purchase agreements generally accounted for as executory own use contracts. In addition, the Group has entered into long-term contracts to purchase Renewable Energy Certificates, which will cover almost one quarter of the electricity purchased and consumed in the United States. The latter are recorded in operating expenses.\n\nManagement has also considered the impact of climate change in making some key estimates within the consolidated financial statements, including the execution of the Solvay One Planet strategy, which is included in the budgets, mid-term plan and long-term forecasts, which are used to:\n\n- \u00b7 estimate future cash flows used in impairment assessments of the carrying value of non-current assets (such as intangible assets and goodwill) (see Note F24 Impairment);\n- \u00b7 estimate future profitability used in the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets (see Note F7.C. Deferred taxes in the consolidated statement of financial position), provisions, etc.;\n- \u00b7 estimate the long-term accounting assumptions, including CO 2 emission rights and energy prices for the energy intensive Soda Ash GBU.\n\nThe Group's CO 2 emission rights and energy prices (gas/electricity/coal) are an important element of the cost structure, especially for the Soda Ash business. The Group has hedged a significant portion of its expected use through 2030. The hedges were taken into consideration in the goodwill impairment test performed and the long-term assumptions considered the higher capex required by the energy transition of the business after the hedged period. Considering the significant headroom on the Soda Ash CGU, no sensitivity is provided. See Note F24 Impairment.\n\nThe same exercise was done for the other cash generating units and management believes there are no realistic scenarios regarding climate change today, which would lead to an impairment of these assets.\n\nRefer also to note B2: Underlying raw material & energy costs in the Business Review section and Note F2 Consolidated Income Statement by Nature for further insights on the main cost drivers of the business.\n\nIn summary, the Group's climate change considerations mentioned above did not have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments and estimates during the year. Further, the Group concludes that the climate change risk does not impact the going concern assessment for December 2021.\n\n225\n\nT",

Critical accounting judgments\n\nNo critical accounting judgements have been identified for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## 2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe Group performs annual impairment tests on (groups of) CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated, and each time there are indicators that their carrying amount might be higher than their recoverable amount. This analysis requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to be generated by the CGUs and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. The recoverable amount is highly sensitive to discount and growth rates.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F20 Goodwill and Business Combinations and F24 Impairment.\n\n## Income taxes\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nThe carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the Group will earn sufficient taxable profits against which the deductions can be utilized. Any such reduction is reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.\n\nDeferred tax assets other than tax loss carryforwards are analyzed on a case by case basis, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. For example, a zero taxable profit, after deducting the amounts paid to retirees under a defined benefit plan and for which a deductible temporary difference existed, can justify the recognition of the underlying deferred tax assets.\n\nRecognition of deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards requires a positive taxable profit during the year that enables the utilization of tax losses that originated in the past. Because of uncertainties inherent to predicting such positive taxable profit, recognition of deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards is based on a case by case analysis, which is usually based on five-year profit forecasts, except with respect to any financial company for which ten-year financial profit forecasts are considered highly predictable and are consequently used.\n\nThe corporate tax reporting team, which monitors the Group's deferred tax positions, is involved in assessing deferred tax assets.\n\nFurther details are provided in Note F7.C. Deferred taxes in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Provisions\n\n## Restructuring provision for the Group's simplification and transformation program\n\nIn 2021, Solvay launched a new chapter of its strategic transformation aimed to further align its structure to its G.R.O.W. strategy. This builds on previous plans announced in 2020, and represents a profound simplification of all support functions to serve the business more effectively. As a consequence of the new restructuring plan, a restructuring provision of around \u20ac 150 million was recognized in Q1 2021.\n\nThe estimate of the provision is based on the number and the cost of redundancy and relocation packages that the Group expects to pay. It is inherently subject to uncertainty and is monitored by the Human Resources department, in close cooperation with the Finance department.\n\n## Defined benefit obligations - General\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used in determining the defined benefit obligations at December/uni00A031 as well as the annual cost can be found in note/uni00A0F31 Provisions. All main employee benefits plans are assessed annually by independent actuaries. Discount rates and inflation rates are defined centrally by management. The other assumptions (such as future salary increases and expected rates of medical care cost increases) are defined at a local level. All plans are supervised by the Group's central Human Resources department with the help of a central actuary to check the reasonableness of the results and ensure consistency in reporting.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F31.A. Provisions for employee benefits.\n\n## Environmental provisions\n\nEnvironmental provisions are managed and coordinated jointly by the Environmental Rehabilitation department and the Finance department. In case of environmental impacts stemming from historical production activities, generally, no provision is recognized for remediation works beyond the 20 years due to the inherent high level of uncertainty as to whether there will be any obligation after the lapse of this period.",

The discount rates fixed by geographical area correspond to the average risk-free rate on 10-year government bonds or the inflation rate if higher. These rates are set annually by the Finance Department and can be revised based on the evolution of economic parameters of the country involved. To reflect the passage of time, the provisions are increased each year at the discount rates described above.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F31.B. Provisions other than for employee benefits.\n\n## Provisions for litigations\n\nAny significant litigations (post M&A and other, including threat of litigation) are reviewed by Solvay's in-house lawyers with the support, when appropriate, of external counsels at least every quarter together with the Finance and Insurance Departments. This review includes an assessment of the need to recognize provisions, disclose contingent liabilities and/or contingent assets.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F31.B. Provisions other than for employee benefits and F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.\n\n## Leases - Assessment of lease term\n\nDetermining the lease term requires judgment. Elements that are considered include assessing the probability that early termination options or extension options will be exercised. All facts and circumstances relevant to the assessment are considered, and the main ones have been described in note F22 Right-of-use assets and lease obligations. Lease terms are determined with the support of the departments that have the relevant knowledge, and that mainly includes the Purchasing department, and the Facilities department.\n\n## NON-IFRS (UNDERLYING) METRICS\n\nIn addition to the IFRS accounts, the Group also presents underlying income statement performance indicators. The objective is to generate a measure that avoids distortion and facilitates the appreciation of performance and comparability of results over time.\n\nSee Glossary for definitions of adjustments (IFRS vs Underlying metrics) and Business Review for more information and reconciliation with IFRS figures.\n\n## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT\n\nPreliminary comment: consistent with the presentation in the consolidated income statement, the notes to the consolidated income statement as presented hereafter do not include the consolidated income statement impacts from discontinued operations that are presented on a separate line. Those are disclosed in note F8 Discontinued operations.\n\n## NOTE F1\n\n## REVENUE AND SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nIFRS 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts with customers:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify the contract,\n- \u00b7 Identify the performance obligations,\n- \u00b7 Determine the transaction price,\n- \u00b7 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n- \u00b7 Recognize revenue when or as the Group satisfies a performance obligation.\n\nUnder IFRS 15, revenue is recognized at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer.\n\nSale of goods: Contracts can be short term (including based only on a purchase order) or long term, some have minimum off-take requirements. As the Group is in the business of selling chemicals, contracts with customers generally concern the sale of goods. As a result, revenue recognition generally occurs at a point in time when control of the chemicals is transferred to the customer, generally on delivery of the goods.\n\nDistinct elements: a good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if both of the following criteria are met: (a) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e. The good or service is capable of being distinct); and (b) the Group's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e. The promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).\n\nThe revenue of the Group consists mainly of sales of chemicals, which qualify as separate performance obligations. Value-added services mainly customer assistance services - corresponding to Solvay's know-how are rendered predominantly over the period that the corresponding goods are sold to the customer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n227",

        "page_content": "228\n\nVariable consideration: some contracts with customers provide trade discounts or volume rebates. Trade discounts and volume rebates give rise to variable consideration under IFRS 15, and are required to be estimated at contract inception and subsequently at each reporting date. IFRS 15 requires the estimated variable consideration to be constrained to prevent overstatement of revenue.\n\nMoment of recognition of revenue: revenue is recognized when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service (i.e. an asset) to a customer. An asset is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that asset. Substantially all revenue stems from performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, i.e. The sale of goods. Revenue recognition for those takes into account the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has a present right to payment for the asset;\n- \u00b7 The customer has legal title to the asset;\n- \u00b7 The Group has transferred physical possession of the asset;\n- \u00b7 The customer has the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset (in this respect, incoterms are considered); and\n- \u00b7 The customer has accepted the asset.\n\nProducts sold to customers generally cannot be returned, other than for performance deficiencies. Customer acceptance clauses are in many cases a formality that would not affect the Group's determination of when the customer has obtained control of the goods. Revenue from services is recognized in the period those services have been rendered.\n\nThe Group sells its chemicals to its customers, (a) directly, (b) through distributors, and (c) with the assistance of agents. When the Group delivers a product to distributors for sale to end customers, the Group evaluates whether that distributor has obtained control of the product at that point in time. No revenue is recognized upon delivery of a product to a customer or distributor if the delivered product is held on consignment. Indicators of consignment inventory include:\n\n- \u00b7 The product is controlled by the Group until a specified event occurs, such as the sale of the product to a customer of the distributor or until a specified period expires;\n- \u00b7 The Group is able to require the return of the product or transfer the product to a third party (such as another distributor); and\n- \u00b7 The distributor does not have an unconditional obligation to pay for the product (although he might be required to pay a deposit).\n- \u00b7 Agents facilitate sales and do not purchase and resell the goods to the end customer.\n\nWarranties: warranties provide a customer with assurance that the related product will function as the parties intended because it complies with agreed-upon specifications. Substantially all warranties do not provide the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies with agreed-upon specifications, and are hence accounted for in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.\n\nAn Operating Segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the entity's chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Solvay's chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer.\n\n## General\n\nSolvay is organized into four Operating Segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Materials offer a unique portfolio of high-performance polymers and composite technologies used primarily in sustainable mobility applications. Its solutions enable weight reduction and enhance performance while improving CO 2 and energy efficiency. Major markets served include nextgeneration mobility in automotive and aerospace, healthcare and electronics.\n- \u00b7 Chemicals host chemical intermediate businesses focused on mature and resilient markets. Solvay is a world leader in soda ash and peroxides and major markets served include building and construction, consumer goods and food. Its Silica, Coatis and Rusvinyl businesses are also high quality assets with strong positions in their markets. This segment provides resilient cash flows and the company selectively invests in these businesses to become the #1 cash conversion chemical player.\n- \u00b7 Solutions offer a unique formulation & application expertise through customized specialty formulations for surface chemistry & liquid behavior, maximizing yield and efficiency of the processes they are used in while minimizing the eco-impact. Novecare, Technology Solutions, Aroma, Special Chem and Oil & Gas focus on specific areas such as resources (improving the extraction yield of metals, minerals and oil), industrial applications (such as coatings) or consumer goods and healthcare (including vanillin and guar for home and personal care).\n- \u00b7 Corporate & Business Services includes corporate and other business services, such as Group research & innovation or energy services, whose mission is to optimize energy consumption and reduce CO 2 emissions.",

As a result of that ruling, a total gain of \u20ac 97 million related to operations from 2003 to the present date was quantified and assessed as recoverable before tax of \u20ac (26) million. Of that, \u20ac 36 million were recognized under 'Results from portfolio management and major restructuring' mainly as the relevant period pre-dated the Groups' acquisition of Rhodia in August 2011 (see note F5 Results from Portfolio Management and Major Restructurings, Legacy Remediation and Major Litigations - included in line 'M&A costs and gains and losses on disposals')./uni00A0",

The impairments include the impairment reversal of the joint venture RusVinyl for \u20ac 66 million (see note F24) and impairment losses of other non-performing assets for \u20ac (8) million. In 2021, the M&A costs and gains and losses on disposals include a \u20ac 36 million gain related to PIS/COFINs (see note F4). The remediation costs increased versus last year due to higher inflation assumptions and investigation costs. 2020 benefited from one-time settlement indemnities partially compensating the remediation costs.\n\nIn 2020, impairments primarily relate to Composite Materials (\u20ac (798) million), Technology Solution (\u20ac (280) million), Novecare Oil & Gas (\u20ac (155) million) and other assets, mainly in the Solutions Segment (\u20ac (168) million).

Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated income statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Deferred taxes\n\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and their corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences.\n\nNo deferred tax liabilities are recognized following the initial recognition of goodwill. In addition, no deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized with respect to the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination and affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, joint operations, joint ventures, and associates, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nThe carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date. The carrying amount of a deferred tax asset is reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the Group will earn sufficient taxable profits against which the deductions can be utilized. Any such reduction is reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.\n\nDeferred tax assets other than tax loss carryforwards are analyzed on a case by case basis, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. For example, a zero taxable profit, after deducting the amounts paid to retirees under a defined benefit plan and for which a deductible temporary difference existed, can justify the recognition of the underlying deferred tax assets. Recognition of deferred tax assets for tax loss carryforwards requires a positive taxable profit during the year that enables the utilization of tax losses that originated in the past. Because of uncertainties inherent to predicting such positive taxable profit, recognition of deferred tax assets from tax loss carryforwards is based on a case by case analysis, which is usually based on five-year profit forecasts, except with respect to any financial company for which ten-year financial profit forecasts are considered highly predictable and are consequently used.\n\nThe corporate tax reporting team, which monitors the Group deferred tax positions, is involved in assessing deferred tax assets.\n\nFurther details are provided in note/uni00A0F7.B.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\nCurrent tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\n## Current and deferred taxes for the period\n\nCurrent and deferred taxes for the period are recognized as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are recognized outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case the tax is also recognized outside profit or loss, or when they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in the accounting for the business combination.\n\nException to the above, as from January 1, 2019, the Group applies the amendments to IAS 12, that apply to the income tax consequences of dividends recognized on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period, i.e. January 1, 2018. In 2018, the income tax consequences of the coupons on perpetual hybrid bonds classified as equity were recognized in equity. As a result of the adoption of the amendment, those income tax consequences are now recognized in profit or loss.\n\n237",

In 2021, this write-down has been partially reversed for \u20ac 15 million based on a reassessment of recoverability of these deferred tax assets.\n- (c)  In 2020, a deferred tax asset was recognized on the impairment excluding non-deductible goodwill related to Composite Materials, Technology Solutions, Oil & Gas (O&G) and other assets in the Solutions Segment (Spec Chem) for a total amount of \u20ac (1,400) million of which \u20ac (1,050) million was on non-deductible goodwill).\n\n## (d) Other deferred taxes:\n\nIn 2021, the other deferred income taxes (\u20ac (52) million) included:\n\n- \u00b7 The utilization of tax losses carried forward for \u20ac (29) million;\n- \u00b7 The net tax impact of additional pension contributions in Belgium (\u20ac (15) million);\n- \u00b7 The utilization of deferred tax assets on temporary disallowed interests in the United States for \u20ac (10) million;\n- \u00b7 The recognition of deferred taxes related to the Brazilian PIS/COFINs credits temporarily not taxable for \u20ac (16) million;\n- \u00b7 Other net increases and reversals of other temporary differences for \u20ac 18 million.\n\nIn 2020, the other deferred income taxes (\u20ac (68) million) included:\n\n- \u00b7 The net impact of additional pension contributions (\u20ac (60) million);\n- \u00b7 The recognition of deferred tax assets on temporary disallowed interests in the United States for \u20ac 37 million;\n- \u00b7 The outside basis differences for overseas investments held by the United States which would be realizable upon disposal with a tax effect for \u20ac (58) million;\n- \u00b7 Other net increases and reversals of other temporary differences for \u20ac 12 million.",

The main changes in 2021 are related to the following items:\n\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets on employee benefit obligations: \u20ac 289 million at year-end 2021 - \u20ac 114 million lower than in 2020, explained by the significant decrease in pension obligations in 2021 notably in the United Kingdom where the deferred tax liability on plan asset surplus have been recognized, offset by the reversal of the write-down on deferred taxes on capital allowances in the United Kingdom for \u20ac 32 million;\n- \u00b7 deferred tax liabilities on Property, plant and equipment: \u20ac (225) million at year-end 2021 - \u20ac 37 million lower than in 2020 mainly due to the reversal of the write-down on deferred taxes on capital allowances in the United Kingdom for \u20ac 32 million;\n- \u00b7 deferred tax liabilities on intangible assets: \u20ac (274) million at year-end 2021 - \u20ac 37 million lower than in 2020. The decrease in these liabilities in 2021 mainly reflects:\n- -exchange rate impacts of \u20ac (24) million;\n- -the tax impact of \u20ac 37 million of amortization in the consolidated income statement of the step-up of intangible assets resulting from Purchase Price Allocation;\n- -the partial reversal of the write-off of the deferred taxes on tangible and intangible assets for Oil & Gas in the United States for \u20ac 15 million, corresponding to the portion of the deferred taxes that are considered to be utilized in 2022 without any changes in the deferred taxes impairment hypothesis for future years.\n- \u00b7 deferred taxes on operational and non-operational tax losses: \u20ac 263 million at year-end 2021 - \u20ac 55 million higher than in 2020 mainly due to the (key) changes in unrecognized deferred tax assets on losses due to revised forecasts for \u20ac 92 million offset against the newly created or utilized deferred tax on tax losses for \u20ac (37) million.\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets on other temporary differences: \u20ac 20 million at year-end 2021 - \u20ac 6 million lower than in 2020 mainly due to the utilization of deferred tax assets on temporary disallowed interests in the United States for \u20ac (10) million and due to the recognition of deferred taxes related to the Brazilian PIS/COFINs credits for \u20ac (16) million.\n\nAt year-end 2021, \u20ac (53) million for deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings were recognized in the Other Temporary differences. An amount of \u20ac 29 million was not recognized because the Group controls the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nRecognized deferred tax assets for which utilization depends on future taxable profits in excess of the profit arising from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences within entities that have suffered a tax loss in either current or preceding years in the related tax jurisdiction, amount to \u20ac 268 million. This recognition is supported by favorable expectations of future taxable profits.\n\n## F7.D.

Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period except when the impact of applying the average rate is materially different from applying the spot rate at the respective transactions' dates, in which case the latter is applied. Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognized in other comprehensive income as 'currency translation differences'.\n\nCurrency translation differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss, on:\n\n- \u00b7 a disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or a partial disposal involving loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation. In this case, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss. Any exchange differences that have previously been attributed to non-controlling interests are derecognized, but they are not reclassified to profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operation, when the retained interest is a financial asset. In this case, all of the accumulated exchange differences in respect of that operation attributable to the Group are reclassified to profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 a partial disposal of an interest in a joint venture or an associate that includes a foreign operation and that continues to be accounted for as a joint venture or an associate. In this case, a proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nIn case of a partial disposal of a subsidiary (i.e. No loss of control) that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences is reattributed to non-controlling interests and is not recognized in profit or loss.\n\nIn case of (a) a capital decrease of a subsidiary without loss of control, or (b) a capital decrease of an equity method investee or a joint operation without modification of the share of equity interest held in that investee, then no accumulated exchange differences are reclassified from equity to profit or loss.\n\nGoodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated into the Group's presentation currency at the closing rate.",

The income tax paid for discontinuing operations in 2021 (\u20ac 6 million) relates to a tax audit on the Pharma business in Germany that was closed in 2021. The income tax paid has increased compared to previous years due to increased profits mainly in Brazil and Italy and due to increased withholding taxes paid on dividends distributed, mainly by Rusvinyl.\n\nThe major components of Income taxes are discussed in note F7 Income taxes in income statement and statement of financial position.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F14\n\n## CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL\n\n| In \u20ac million                     |   2021 |   2020 |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Inventories                      |   -427 |    100 |\n| Trade receivables                |   -459 |     87 |\n| Trade payables                   |    775 |      3 |\n| Other receivables/payables       |     20 |     59 |\n| Changes in working capital       |    -92 |    249 |\n| Of which discontinued operations |     -5 |    -11 |\n\nSee comments in the Business Review section.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n247",

These deals are subject to margin calls. To cover the credit risk of the counterparty, brokers pay a margin call to Solvay in case the instrument is in the money for Solvay. If the instrument is out of the money for Solvay, Solvay pays a margin call to the brokers. The margin calls are presented as part of financial debt (see note F33 Net indebtedness). Cash flows from margin calls are recognized as financing cash flows that fluctuate with the fair value of the instrument. The actual settlement of these commodity derivatives is net of margin calls and the gross amount (including margin calls that are reclassified from financing cash flows) is recognized in operating cash flows.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F18\n\n## CASH FLOW FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThe 2021 cash flow from discontinued operations amounts to \u20ac (12) million related to the Pharma business and Polyamides.

It is identifiable when it is separable, i.e. Is capable of being separated or divided from the Group, or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights. An intangible asset shall be recognized if, and only if:\n\n(a) it is probable that the expected future economic benefits that are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group; and\n\n(b) the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.\n\nIntangible assets acquired or developed internally are initially measured at cost. The cost of an acquired intangible asset comprises its purchase price, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and rebates, and any directly attributable cost of preparing the asset for its intended use. Subsequent expenditure on intangible assets is capitalized only if it is probable that it will increase the future economic benefits associated with the specific asset. Other expenditure is expensed as incurred.\n\nAfter initial recognition, intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n249",

The estimated useful lives, residual values and amortization methods are reviewed at each year-end, and any changes in estimates are accounted\n\nfor prospectively.\n\n| Patents and trademarks                 | 2-20   | years   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Software                               | 3-5    | years   |\n| Development expenditures               | 2-5    | years   |\n| Customer relationships                 | 5-29   | years   |\n| Other intangible assets - Technologies | 5-20   | years   |\n\nAmortization expense is included in the consolidated income statement within cost of goods sold, administrative costs, research and development costs and other operating gains and losses.\n\nThe asset is tested for impairment if (a) there is a trigger for impairment, and (b) annually for projects under development (see note F24 Impairment).\n\nIntangible assets are derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an intangible asset is recognized in profit or loss at the moment of derecognition.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nResearch costs are expensed in the period in which they/uni00A0are incurred.\n\nDevelopment costs are capitalized if, and only if, all the/uni00A0following conditions are fulfilled:\n\n- \u00b7 the cost of the asset can be reliably measured;\n- \u00b7 the technical feasibility of the product has been demonstrated;\n- \u00b7 the product or process will be placed on the market or/uni00A0used internally;\n- \u00b7 the assets will generate future economic benefits (a potential market exists for the product or, where it is to be used internally, its future utility has been demonstrated);\n- \u00b7 the technical, financial and other resources required to/uni00A0complete the project are available.\n\nDevelopment costs comprise employee expenses, the cost of materials and services directly attributable to the projects, and an appropriate share of directly attributable fixed costs including, and where applicable, borrowing costs. The intangible assets are amortized as from the moment they are available for use, i.e. When they are in the location and condition necessary for them to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Development costs, which do not satisfy the above conditions are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Patents, trademarks and customer relationships\n\nThose intangible assets have mainly been acquired through business combinations. Customer relationships consist of customer lists.\n\n## Other intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets mainly include technology acquired separately or in a business combination.",

The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of acquisition) of assets transferred and liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nWhere applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments (see below). All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs, generally through profit or loss.\n\nWhere a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group's previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. The date the Group obtains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.\n\nThe acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS/uni00A0 3 Business Combinations are recognized and measured at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:\n\n- \u00b7 deferred tax assets or liabilities, and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognized and measured in accordance with IAS/uni00A012 Income Taxes, and IAS/uni00A019 Employee Benefits, respectively;\n- \u00b7 liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquiree's share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS/uni00A02 Share-based Payment; and\n- \u00b7 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS/uni00A05 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see paragraph below), or additional assets or liabilities are recognized, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized as of that date.\n\nThe measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and does not exceed twelve months.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising in a business combination is recognized as an asset at the date that control is obtained (the acquisition date). Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of:\n\n(a) the consideration transferred;\n\n(b) the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; and\n\n(c) in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree,\n\nover the share acquired by the Group in the fair value of the entity's identifiable net assets at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on an annual basis, and more frequently if there are any impairment triggers identified.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units (or groups of cash-generating units) in accordance with IAS/uni00A036 Impairment of Assets.\n\nA cash-generating unit (CGU) is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other group(s) of assets.\n\nThese tests consist of comparing the carrying amount of the assets or (groups of) CGUs with their recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a (group of) CGU(s) is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognized on goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nAssets held for sale include their related goodwill.\n\nOn disposal of an operation within a CGU to which goodwill has been allocated, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. It is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained, unless another method better reflects the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of.",

and\n- \u00b7 are expected to be used during more than one period.\n\nThe items of property, plant and equipment owned by the Group are recognized as property, plant and equipment when the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- \u00b7 it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group;\n- \u00b7 the cost of the asset can be measured reliably.",

        "page_content": "Items of property, plant and equipment are initially measured at cost. The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. If applicable, the cost comprises borrowing costs during the construction period.\n\nAfter initial recognition, items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, if any.\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The components of an item of property, plant and equipment with different useful lives are depreciated separately. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods are reviewed at each year end, also taking into account the potential impact of climate change including the execution of the Solvay One Plant Strategy (see Note Climate Change in the IFRS general accounting policies). Any changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively.\n\n| Buildings                | 30-40   | years   |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|\n| IT equipment             | 3-5     | years   |\n| Machinery and equipment  | 10-20   | years   |\n| Transportation equipment | 5-20    | years   |\n\nDepreciation expense is included in the consolidated income statement within cost of goods sold, administrative costs, and R&D costs.\n\nThe asset is tested for impairment if there is a trigger for impairment (see note F24 Impairment).\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are derecognized from the consolidated statement of financial position on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use or disposal. The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in profit or loss at the moment of derecognition.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nSubsequent expenditure related to items of property, plant and equipment is capitalized only if it is probable that it will increase the future economic benefits associated with the specific asset. Other expenditure is expensed as incurred. Subsequent expenditure incurred for the replacement of a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is only recognized as an asset when it satisfies the recognition criteria mentioned above. The carrying amount of replaced items is derecognized.\n\nRepair and maintenance costs are recognized in the consolidated income statement as incurred.\n\nRegarding its industrial activity, Solvay incurs expenditure for major repairs over several years for most of its sites. The purpose of this expenditure is to maintain the proper working order of certain installations without altering their useful life. This expenditure is considered as a specific component of the item of property, plant and equipment and is depreciated over the period during which the economic benefits are expected to be obtained, i.e. the major repairs' intervals.\n\n## Dismantling and restoration costs\n\nDismantling and restoration costs are included in the cost of an item of property, plant and equipment if the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to dismantle or restore. They are depreciated over the useful life of the items to which they pertain.\n\nGenerally, Solvay's obligation to dismantle and/or restore its operating sites is only likely to arise upon the discontinuation of a site's activities. A provision for dismantling of discontinued sites or installations is recognized when there is a legal obligation (due to a request or injunction from the relevant authorities), or when there is no technical alternative than to dismantle, so to ensure the safety compliance of the discontinued sites or installations.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.\n\nInvestment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n255",

A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAn asset is typically identified by being explicitly specified in a contract. However, an asset can also be identified by being implicitly specified at the time that the asset is made available for use by the customer. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified. A substantive substitution right means that (a) the supplier has the practical ability to substitute the asset throughout the period of use, and (b) would economically benefit from doing so.\n\nTo assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether, throughout the period of use, it has:\n\n- \u00b7 the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset; and\n- \u00b7 the right to direct the use of the identified asset. This is generally the case when the Group has the decision-making rights regarding how and for what purpose the asset is used.\n\nThe Group's leased assets relate mainly to buildings, transportation equipment, and industrial equipment.\n\n## Lease term\n\nThe Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both:\n\n- \u00b7 periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise that option.\n\nIn its assessment, the Group considers the impact of the following factors (non-exhaustive):\n\n- \u00b7 contractual terms and conditions for the optional periods, compared with market rates;\n- \u00b7 significant leasehold improvements undertaken (or expected to be undertaken) over the term of the contract;\n- \u00b7 costs relating to the termination of the lease, including relocation costs, costs of identifying another underlying asset suitable for the Group's needs, costs of integrating a new asset into the Group's operations, and termination penalties;\n- \u00b7 the importance of that underlying asset to the Group's operations, including the availability of suitable alternatives;\n- \u00b7 conditionality associated with exercising the option (i.e. When the option can be exercised only if one or more conditions are met), and the likelihood that those conditions will exist; and\n- \u00b7 past practice.\n\n## Right-of-use asset and lease liability\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, which is the date that the lessor makes the asset available for use by the Group except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. The right-of-use assets are presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position, and the lease liabilities are presented as part of financial debt.\n\n## Right-of-use asset\n\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, less any lease incentive received; and\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs incurred by the Group.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the right-of-use asset is measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line depreciation method, from the commencement date to (a) the end of the useful life of the underlying asset, in case the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group by the end of the lease term, or the lease contains a purchase option that the Group is reasonably certain to exercise, or (b) the earlier of the end of the useful life and the end of the lease term, in all other cases.\n\n257",

        "page_content": "258\n\n## Lease liability\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the respective Group entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for early terminating the lease, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an option to early terminate the lease.\n\nService components (e.g. Utilities, maintenance, insurance, \u2026) are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is measured by:\n\n- \u00b7 increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made; and\n- \u00b7 remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications, or to reflect the impact from a revised index or rate.\n\n## Leasing of Palladium\n\nThe Group uses palladium, a precious metal, for certain of its operations. Next to purchasing this palladium, the Group also enters into various 'leasing' agreements with financial institutions that give the Group the right to use palladium for a certain period and then return it at the end of the 'lease'. Based on our analysis of these agreements, these contracts are not in the scope of IFRS 16 Leases or IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Due to the lack of clear IFRS guidance, the Group applied judgment to determine whether these rights and obligations shall be accounted for on a gross or a net basis. Considering that the Group bears no price risk during the 'lease' term and is not in full control of the asset (in accordance with the IFRS Conceptual Framework), the Group believes a net presentation gives a better view on the economic substance of the transaction. As a result, only accruals are recorded for the production losses and regeneration costs and the 'lease' fee is recognized within cost of sales. At the end of 2021, the total (gross) value of palladium leased still to be returned amounted to \u20ac 50 million (end of 2020: \u20ac 63 million) valued at the year-end closing rate.\n\n| In \u20ac million                     | Land     | Buildings   | Transportation  equipment   | Industrial  equipment   | Other tangible  assets   | Total    |\n|----------------------------------|----------|-------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|----------|\n| Gross carrying amount            | /uni00A0 | /uni00A0    | /uni00A0                    | /uni00A0                | /uni00A0                 | /uni00A0 |\n| December 31, 2019                | 18       | 209         | 185                         | 153                     | 7                        | 571      |\n| Additions                        |          | 39          | 28                          | 12                      | 2                        | 82       |\n| Disposals and closures           |          | -7          | -4                          |                         |                          | -12      |\n| Currency translation differences | -1       | -12         | -11                         | -8                      |                          | -32      |\n| Other                            | 1        | 7           | 11                          | 2                       | 1                        | 23       |\n| Transfer to assets held for sale |          | -10         | -1                          |                         |                          | -12      |\n| December 31, 2020                | 18       | 227         | 207                         | 159                     | 9                        | 620      |\n| Additions                        |          | 29          | 23                          | 82                      | 1                        | 134      |\n| Disposals and closures           |          | -1          | -3                          |                         |                          | -4       |\n| Currency translation differences |          | 9           | 11                          | 7                       |                          | 27       |\n| Other                            |          | 3           | 10                          | 3                       | 1                        | 17       |\n| December 31, 2021                | 19       | 266         | 248                         | 251                     | 11                       | 795      |",

Those leases are generally long-term leases and may include extension options.\n\nNext, the Group leases transportation equipment that mainly consists of railcars and containers to transport the Group's products.\n\nIndustrial equipment mainly relates to utility assets. In 2021, additions include \u20ac 68 million for the construction of a waste-wood boiler, steam turbine and auxiliaries in Germany.\n\nLease contracts generally are negotiated by the local teams, and contain a wide range of different terms and conditions. Many lease contracts contain extension options and/or early termination options to provide the Group with operational flexibility. Such options are taken into account when determining the lease term and the lease liability when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\n\nIf the Group exercised its extension options not currently included in the lease liability, the present value of additional payments would amount to \u20ac 143 million at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac 165 million at December 31, 2020).\n\nLease contracts signed not yet commenced amount to \u20ac 135 million at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac 139 million for 2020) and mainly relate to a second waste wood boiler, steam turbine and auxiliaries in Germany, and industrial equipment in the United States.\n\nTotal cash outflows for leases amount to \u20ac 118 million for 2021, of which \u20ac 99 million related to payment of lease liabilities and \u20ac 19 million of interest expenses. Information on the corresponding lease liabilities (\u20ac 505 million) can be found in the note F33 Net indebtedness. Information on the finance expense related to lease liabilities can be found in note F6 Net financial charges.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F23\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES\n\nThe list of associates and joint ventures is available in the note F40 List of companies included in the consolidation scope.\n\nThe associates and joint ventures not classified as held for sale/discontinued operations are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.\n\n| In \u20ac million                                  | December 31, 2021 /uni00A0   | December 31, 2021 /uni00A0   | December 31, 2021 /uni00A0   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                               | Associates                   | Joint ventures               | Total                        | Associates          | Joint ventures      | Total               |\n| Investments in associates and joint  ventures | 18                           | 619                          | 637                          | 16                  | 479                 | 495                 |\n| Earnings from associates and joint  ventures  | 2                            | 157                          | 159                          | 2                   | 56                  | 58                  |\n\n259",

If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. Where a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are allocated to individual CGUs, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of CGUs for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate. /uni00A0 Future cash flows are adjusted for risks not incorporated into the discount rate./uni00A0\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or CGU) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset (or CGU) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized immediately in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill shall not be reversed in a subsequent period.\n\n## Assets other than non-current assets held for sale\n\nIn accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, CGUs or groups of CGUs, including goodwill, and equity method investees corresponds to the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal, and their value in use. The latter equals the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from each asset, CGU or group of CGUs, and equity method investees and is determined using the following inputs:\n\n- \u00b7 business plan approved by management based on growth and profitability assumptions, taking into account past performances, forecast changes in the economic environment and expected market developments, including opportunity and risks resulting from climate change (taking into account the Solvay One Planet strategy - see note Climate change in the IFRS general accounting policies) and environmental regulations such as products phasing out. For further details, refer to the Risk Management Section. Such business plan generally covers five/uni00A0years, unless management is confident that projections over a longer period are reliable;\n- \u00b7 consideration of a terminal value determined based on the cash flows obtained by extrapolating the cash flows of the last years of the business plan referred to above, affected by a long-term growth rate deemed appropriate for the activity and the location of the assets;\n- \u00b7 discounting of expected cash flows at a rate determined using the weighted average cost of capital formula.\n\n## Discount rate\n\nWeighted average cost of capital (WACC) was computed using the same methodology applied in previous years and after extensive benchmarking with peers.\n\n- \u00b7 A short term WACC of 5.1% was utilized in 2021 (6.4% in 2020) to discount the expected cash flows of the initial four years, computed consistently with previous years based on prevailing discount rates;\n- \u00b7 A long term WACC of 6.8% was utilized in 2021 (7.2% in 2020) to discount the expected cash flows of the fifth year and the Terminal Value, and is a rolling 8-year average of historical short term WACCs.\n\n## Long-term growth rates\n\nThe long-term growth rates used in 2021 are based:\n\n- \u00b7 on the comprehensive review of the entire business portfolio performed in 2019 with the definition of the G.R.O.W Strategy when each CGU was assigned to one of three agile business segments that became effective as from 2020: Materials, Chemicals and Solutions, with different growth opportunities, consistent with the long term growth rates of the market they serve and the Group competitive position in those markets; and\n- \u00b7 on the long term growth potential for Composite Materials and Technology Solutions assessed during the 2020 impairment test which remain very strong.\n\nAfter reassessment of the long-term growth prospects the Group concluded that the prior year rates are still applicable and were thus set at:\n\n- \u00b7 2% for the Specialty Polymers CGU and 3% for the Composite Materials CGU\n- \u00b7 0% in the Segment Chemicals, except for Soda Ash and Peroxides, for which a 1% rate was set, and\n- \u00b7 1% for the other CGUs in the Segment Solutions (excluding Technology Solutions, for which 1.5% was used, and Oil & Gas).\n\nOther key assumptions are specific to each CGU (utility price, volumes, margin, etc.).",

        "page_content": "## Impairment Test 2021\n\nThe impairment tests performed at CGU level at December 31, 2021, were based on the budget 2022 approved by the Board and the Mid Term Plan 2023-2025 which reflect the economic rebound after last year crisis and the results of the structural cost saving measures adopted by the Group. They did not lead to any impairment of assets, as the recoverable amounts of the (groups of) CGUs were higher than their carrying amounts. More specifically, the difference between the (groups of) CGUs' value in use and their carrying amount (headroom) represented in all cases more than 10% of their carrying amount. As a result, for these (groups of) CGUs, a reasonable change in a key assumption relating to the recoverable amount for which the (groups of) CGUs is based, would not result in an impairment loss.\n\n## Fully consolidated CGUs\n\nIn 2020, the Oil & Gas market deteriorated significantly and the value pool for fracking chemicals further decreased with reduced volumes and prices. Consequently, an additional impairment loss of \u20ac (155) million was recorded on tangible and intangible fixed assets. In 2021 although the profitability has improved, the long-term prospects remain uncertain and the impairments recorded in prior years were not reversed./uni00A0\n\nConsidering the impairment losses for Composite Materials and Technology Solutions recorded in 2020 and the consequently higher risk of impairment in case of changes in the Discount rate and Long term growth assumptions used for their test, the following sensitivity analyses are reported for these two groups of CGUs. A broader range of discount rates was used in the sensitivity analysis as compared to the prior year.\n\n## Composite Materials\n\nIn \u20ac billion\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\n|                            | Assumptions: /uni00A0 Discount rate = 6.8% /uni00A0 Long term growth rate = 3%   | Assumptions: /uni00A0 Discount rate = 6.8% /uni00A0 Long term growth rate = 3%   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Sensitivity to:            | Impact on recoverable amount                                                     | Revised headroom                                                                 |\n| Discount rate - 1%         | 1.3                                                                              | 2.4                                                                              |\n| Discount rate + 1%         | -0.7                                                                             | 0.4                                                                              |\n| Long term growth rate - 1% | -0.6                                                                             | 0.5                                                                              |\n| Long term growth rate +1%  | 1.0                                                                              | 2.1                                                                              |\n\n## In \u20ac billion\n\n## December 31, 2020\n\nAssumptions:\n\n/uni00A0\n\nDiscount rate = 7.2%\n\nLong term growth rate = 3%\n\n|                            |   Impact on recoverable amount |   Revised headroom |\n|----------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Discount rate - 0.5%       |                            0.3 |                0.5 |\n| Discount rate + 0.5%       |                           -0.3 |               -0.1 |\n| Long term growth rate - 1% |                           -0.4 |               -0.2 |\n| Long term growth rate +1%  |                            0.6 |                0.8 |\n\nThe table below shows the break-even analysis for the headroom of Composite Materials:\n\nDiscount rate\n\nLong term growth rate\n\n|                   | Base rate   | Break-even rate   | Base rate   | Break-even rate   |\n|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| December 31, 2021 | 6.8%        | 8.6%              | 3.0%        | 0.6%              |\n| December 31, 2020 | 7.2%        | 7.5%              | 3.0%        | 2.6%              |\n\n265",

The impact resulted in 2020 in an impairment loss of \u20ac (169) million, of which \u20ac (24) million is related to the Goodwill, \u20ac (41) million is related to Intangible assets, and \u20ac (104) million for tangible assets. Even if the results of this CGU improved in 2021, the long-term prospects remain unchanged.\n\n## RusVinyl equity investment\n\nRusVinyl is a Russian joint venture in chlorovinyls (included in the Chemicals Segment:) in which Solvay holds a 50% equity interest, together with Sibur who holds the remaining 50% equity interest.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, the Group accounted for a \u20ac 110 million impairment charge for the RusVinyl joint venture. The impairment was partially reversed in 2015 for \u20ac/uni00A019 million after the new business plan was prepared at that time for the company's refinancing.\n\nIn 2021, the recoverable amount of the investment has been estimated based on a dividend discount model taking into account the latest business plan, which reflects the improved profitability and the deleveraging of the euro denominated debt. At the average RUB/EUR rates used for the conversion, the impairment test in 2021 resulted in an impairment reversal of \u20ac 66 million reported in the Note 5 Results from Portfolio Management, Major Restructurings, Legacy Remediation and Major Litigations./uni00A0/uni00A0/uni00A0",

The review confirmed that there was an indication of impairment for the CGUs with the lowest impairment headroom at December 31, 2019 (see Note F27 in 2019 Annual report)./uni00A0 The analysis resulted in impairments within the following CGUs:\n\n- \u00b7 Composite Materials (Materials) - An impairment loss of \u20ac (0.8) billion which was fully allocated to Goodwill, except for the tangible assets related to two shutdown plants.\n- \u00b7 Technology Solutions (Solutions) - An impairment loss of \u20ac (0.3) billion which was fully allocated to Goodwill, with the exception of \u20ac (15) million which was allocated to tangible assets.\n- \u00b7 Oil & Gas (Solutions) - An impairment loss of \u20ac (155) million, of which \u20ac (61) million was allocated to tangible assets and \u20ac (94) million was allocated to intangible assets related to customer relationships.\n- \u00b7 Other small groups of assets (Solutions)/uni00A0- an impairment loss of \u20ac (169) million, of which \u20ac (24) million is related to the Goodwill, \u20ac (41) million is related to Intangible assets, and \u20ac (104) million for tangible assets.\n\n## Q4 2020 update\n\nAn impairment test for Goodwill was performed at year-end based on the 2021 budget and the Mid Term Plan 2022-2024, and the test did not lead to any additional impairments./uni00A0\n\nAdditional information on the impairment reviews undertaken in 2020 can be found in Note F27 of the 2020 Annual Report.\n\n## NOTE/uni00A0F25\n\n## INVENTORIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\nCost of inventories includes the purchase, conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their/uni00A0 present location and condition. The cost of inventories is determined by using the weighted average cost method.\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of purchasing cost (raw materials and merchandise) or production cost (work in progress and finished goods) and net realizable value. Net realizable value represents the estimated selling price, less all estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n## CO 2 emission rights\n\nWith respect to the mechanism set up by the European Union to encourage manufacturers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission rights are granted to the Group for free. The Group is also involved in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto protocol. Under these projects, the Group has deployed facilities in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the relevant sites in return for Certified Emission Reductions (CER).\n\nIn the absence of any IFRS regulating the accounting treatment of CO 2 emission rights, the Group applies the Trade/Production model, according to which CO 2 emission rights are presented as inventories if they will be consumed in the production process within the next 12 months, or as derivatives if they are held for trading. Energy Services is involved in CO 2 emission rights' trading, arbitrage and hedging activities. The net income or expense from these activities is recognized in 'other operating gains and losses' (a) for the industrial component, where Energy Services sells the excess CO 2 emission rights generated by Solvay or where a Group deficit is recognized, as well as (b) for the trading component, where Energy Services acts as a trader/broker with respect to those CO 2 emission rights. In some cases, Energy Services rolls forward CO 2 credits, with continued own use exception, to match credits delivery and consumption in the production process.\n\nIn light of its centralized CO 2 emission rights' portfolio management, for emission rights that are substitutable between subsidiaries, the Group's financial statements reflect the Group's net position. If this net position is negative, a provision is recognized, measured based on the market price of the CO 2 emission rights at reporting date.\n\n## Energy savings certificates (ESCs)\n\nEnergy savings certificates are presented as inventory items in Finished goods. They are measured at weighted average cost. As their cost is not separately identifiable, and as they are a by-product, they are measured at their net realizable value upon initial recognition.\n\n267",

The group includes goodwill acquired in a business combination if the group is a cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated, or if it is an operation within such a cash-generating unit.\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition. For a sale to be highly probable, management should be committed to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group), an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan should be initiated, the asset (or disposal group) should be actively marketed at a price which is reasonable in relation to its current fair value, the sale should be expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification, and actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nWhen the Group is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value less costs to sell is recognized as an impairment loss. Depreciation of such assets is discontinued as from their classification as held for sale. Prior period consolidated statements of financial position are not restated to reflect the new classification of a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale.",

The fair value of services rendered by employees in consideration for the granting of equity-instruments represents an expense. This expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the vesting periods relating to these equityinstruments with the recognition of a corresponding adjustment in equity. The fair value of services rendered is measured based on the fair value of the equity-instruments on the grant date. It is not subsequently remeasured. At each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the number of share options likely to vest. The impact of the revised estimates is recognized in profit or loss against a corresponding adjustment in equity.\n\nIn its cash-settled plans, the Group acquires services by incurring a liability to transfer to its employees rendering those services amounts that are based on the price (or value) of equity instruments (including shares or share options) of the Group (namely through the issuance of performance share units). The fair value of services rendered by employees in consideration for the granting of share-based payments represents an expense. This expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in the consolidated income statement over the vesting periods relating to these share-based payments with the recognition of a corresponding adjustment in liabilities. At each reporting date, the Group re-estimates the number of options likely to vest, with the impact of the revised estimates recognized in profit or loss. The Group measures the services acquired and the liability incurred at the fair value of the liability. Until the liability is settled, the Group remeasures the fair value of the liability at the end of each reporting period and at the date of settlement, with any changes in fair value recognized in profit or loss for the period.\n\n## Stock Option Plan\n\nIn 2021, the Board of Directors offered to executive staff (47 beneficiaries) a share option plan with a view to involve them more closely in the longterm development of the Group. The plan is an equity-settled share-based plan. The majority of the managers involved subscribed to the options offered to them in 2021 with an exercise price of \u20ac 95.58 representing the average stock market price of the share for the 30 days prior to the offer.",

This effect, combined with the unwinding of the opening liabilities for \u20ac 34 million resulted in a net decrease of \u20ac (13) million related to discounting.\n\nThe movements in Other provisions mainly relate to post-closing adjustments resulting from M&A warranties as well as indemnities for environmental remediation.\n\nManagement expects provisions (other than employee benefits) to be used (cash outlays) as follows:\n\n| In \u20ac million                                 | up to 5 years   | between 5 and 10 years   | beyond 10 years   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|-------------------|---------|\n| Total provisions for environment             | 302             | 90 /uni00A0              | 256 /uni00A0      | 648     |\n| Total provisions for litigation              | 57              | 5 /uni00A0               | /uni00A0 /uni00A0 | 62      |\n| Total provisions for restructuring and other | 300 /uni00A0    | 16 /uni00A0              | /uni00A0          | 316     |\n| December 31, 2021                            | 660 /uni00A0    | 110 /uni00A0             | 256 /uni00A0      | 1,026   |",

Provisions for employee benefits\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accounting policy\n\n## General\n\nThe Group's employees are offered various post-employment benefits, other long-term employee benefits, and termination benefits as a result of legislation applicable in certain countries, and contractual agreements entered into by the Group with its employees or constructive obligations.\n\nThe post-employment benefits are classified as defined contribution or defined benefit plans.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nDefined contribution plans involve the payment of fixed contributions to a separate entity, and release the employer from any subsequent obligation, as this separate entity is solely responsible for paying the amounts due to the employee. The expense is recognized when an employee has rendered services to the Group during the period.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined benefit plans concern all plans other than defined contribution plans, and include:\n\n- \u00b7 post-employment benefits: pension plans, other post-employment obligations and supplemental benefits such as post-employment medical plans;\n- \u00b7 other long-term employee benefits: long-service benefits granted to employees according to their seniority in the Group;\n- \u00b7 termination benefits such as early pension plans.\n\nTaking into account projected final salaries on an individual basis, post-employment benefits are measured by applying a method (projected unit credit method) using assumptions involving discount rate, life expectancy, turnover, wages, annuity revaluation and medical cost inflation. The assumptions specific to each plan take into account the local economic and demographic contexts.\n\nThe discount rates are interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligation.\n\nThe amount recognized under post-employment obligations corresponds to the difference between the present value of future obligations and the fair value of the plan assets funding the plan, if any. If this calculation gives rise to a deficit, an obligation is recognized in liabilities. Otherwise, a net asset limited to the lower of the surplus in the defined benefit plan and the present value of any future plan refunds or any reduction in future contributions to the plan is recognized. Therefore the amount at which such an asset is recognized in the statement of financial position may be subject to a ceiling.\n\nThe defined benefit cost consists of service cost and net interest expense (based on discount rate) on the net liability or asset, both recognized in profit or loss, and remeasurements of the net liability or asset, recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nService cost consists of current service cost, past service cost resulting from plan amendments or curtailments and settlement gains or losses.\n\nThe interest expenses arising from the reverse discounting of the benefit obligations, the financial income on plan assets (determined by multiplying the fair value of the plan assets by the discount rate) as well as interest on the effect of the asset ceiling are recognized on a net basis in the net financial charges (cost of discounting of provisions).\n\nRemeasurements of the net liability or asset consist of:\n\n- \u00b7 actuarial gains and losses on the benefit obligations arising from experience adjustments and/or changes in actuarial assumptions (including the effect of changes in the discount rate) recognized in other comprehensive income;\n- \u00b7 Changes as a consequence of plan amendments, recognized in profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 the return on plan assets (excluding amounts in net interest) and changes in the limitation of the net asset recognized.\n\nOther long-term and termination benefits are accounted for in the same way as post-employment benefits but remeasurements are fully recognized in the net financial charges during the period in which they occur.\n\nThe actuarial calculations of the main post-employment obligations and other long-term benefits are performed by independent actuaries.",

Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, Solvay pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension funds or insurance companies. For 2021, the expense amounts to \u20ac 56 million compared to \u20ac 57 million for 2020.\n\n## B. Defined benefit plans\n\nDefined benefit plans can be either funded via outside pension funds or insurance companies ('funded plans') or financed within the Group ('unfunded plans'). Unfunded plans have no plan assets dedicated to them.\n\nThe net liability results from the net of the provisions and the asset plan surplus.\n\nIn \u20ac million\n\n|                     | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   |\n|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Provisions          | 1,371               | 2,006               |\n| Asset plan surplus  | -248                | -31                 |\n| Net liability       | 1,123               | 1,975               |\n| /uni00A0            | 2021                | 2020                |\n| Operational expense | 19                  | 38                  |\n| Finance expense     | 13                  | 26                  |\n\nThe operating expense includes current service cost for \u20ac 43 million (\u20ac 44 million in 2020) (see also B.3.).\n\n## B.1. Management of risks\n\nOver recent years, the Group has reduced its exposure to defined benefit plan obligations stemming from future services by converting existing plans into pension plans with a lower risk profile (hybrid plans, cash balance plans and defined contribution plans) or by closing them to new entrants.\n\nSolvay continuously monitors its risk exposure, focusing on the following risks:\n\n## Asset volatility\n\nEquity instruments, even though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. To mitigate this risk, the allocation to equity instruments is monitored using Assets and Liabilities Management techniques, to ensure it remains appropriate given the respective schemes' and Group's long term objectives.\n\n## Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the carrying amount of the plans' liabilities. For funded schemes this impact will be partially offset by an increase in the fair value of the plan assets.\n\n## Inflation risk\n\nThe defined benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). A/uni00A0limited/uni00A0part of the assets is either unaffected by or only partially correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the plans' net liabilities.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member. Increases in life expectancy will therefore increase the plans' liabilities.",

        "page_content": "278\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nEspecially with respect to funded plans, the Group is exposed to the risk of external funding following regulatory constraints. This should not impact the defined benefit obligation but could expose the Group to a potential significant cash outlay.\n\nFor more information about Solvay risk management, please refer to the 'Management of risks' section of the present document.\n\n## B.2. Description of obligations\n\nThe provisions have been set up to cover post-employment benefits granted by most Group companies in line, either with local rules and /or with established practices, which generate constructive obligations.\n\nThe largest post-employment plans in 2021 are in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany and Belgium. These five countries represent 95% of the total defined benefit obligations.\n\nDecember 31, 2021December 31, 2020\n\n| In \u20ac million    | Defined benefit  obligations   | In %   | Recognized  plan assets   | Net liability/ (asset)   | In %   | Ratio plan  assets on  defined benefit  obligations   | of which  asset surplus  recognized in the  balance sheet   |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| United Kingdom  | 1,618                          | 32%    | 1,678                     | -60                      | -5%    | 104%                                                  | 76                                                          |\n| United States   | 1,315                          | 26%    | 1,230                     | 86                       | 8%     | 93%                                                   | 66                                                          |\n| France          | 953                            | 19%    | 372                       | 582                      | 52%    | 39%                                                   | 50                                                          |\n| Germany         | 516                            | 10%    | 70                        | 446                      | 40%    | 14%                                                   |                                                             |\n| Belgium         | 384                            | 8%     | 405                       | -21                      | -2%    | 105%                                                  | 51                                                          |\n| Other countries | 229                            | 5%     | 139                       | 90                       | 8%     | 61%                                                   | 5                                                           |\n| Total           | 5,016                          | 100%   | 3,893                     | 1,123                    | 100%   | 78%                                                   | 248                                                         |\n\n| In \u20ac million    | Defined benefit  obligations   | In %   | Recognized  plan assets   | Net liability/ (Asset)   | In %   | Ratio plan  assets on  defined benefit  obligations   | of which  asset surplus  recognized in the  balance sheet   |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| United Kingdom  | 1,731                          | 32%    | 1,394                     | 337                      | 17%    | 81%                                                   |                                                             |\n| United States   | 1,327                          | 24%    | 1,175                     | 152                      | 8%     | 89%                                                   | 28                                                          |\n| France          | 1,101                          | 20%    | 349                       | 753                      | 38%    | 32%                                                   |                                                             |\n| Germany         | 583                            | 11%    | 95                        | 488                      | 25%    | 16%                                                   |                                                             |\n| Belgium         | 422                            | 8%     | 294                       | 128                      | 6%     | 70%                                                   |                                                             |\n| Other countries | 273                            | 5%     | 155                       | 118                      | 6%     | 57%                                                   | 3                                                           |\n| Total           | 5,436                          | 100%   | 3,461                     | 1,975                    | 100%   | 64%                                                   | 31                                                          |\n\n## United Kingdom\n\nSolvay sponsors a few defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom; the largest one is the Rhodia Pension Fund. This is a final salary funded pension plan, with entitlement to accrue a percentage of salary per year of service. It was closed to new entrants in 2003 and replaced by a defined contribution plan.\n\nBroadly, about 9% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 29% to former employees and 62% to current pensioners.\n\nThe Fund functions and complies with UK legislation under a large regulatory framework. The Pensions Regulator has a risk based approach to regulation and a code of practice which provides practical guidance to trustees and employers of defined benefit schemes on how to comply with the scheme funding requirements. In accordance with UK legislation, the Fund is subject to Scheme Specific Funding which requires that pension plans are funded prudently.\n\nThe UK Rhodia Pension Fund is governed by a Board of Trustees. They manage the Fund with prudent and fair judgment. The Trustees determine the liabilities used for Statutory Funding Objectives based on prudent actuarial and economic assumptions. Any shortfall or deficit once these liabilities have been deducted from the Fund's assets must be reduced by additional contributions and in a time frame determined in accordance with the employer's ability to pay and the strength of covenant or contingent security being offered by the employer.",

        "page_content": "The Rhodia Pension Fund is subject to a triennial valuation cycle for funding purposes. This valuation is performed by the scheme actuary in line with UK regulations and is discussed between the Trustees and the sponsoring employer to agree the valuation assumptions and a funding plan. The last completed valuation was as of January 1, 2020, which established a fixed contribution rate of pensionable pay for active members plus a deficit recovery plan which aims to fully fund the scheme's technical provisions by the end of 2030 in accordance with local regulations. At the end of 2021 a voluntary contribution was paid (\u00a3 115 million)). This contribution will significantly reduce the recovery contributions to be paid until 2027.\n\nThe guarantee provided by Solvay (\u00a3 362million) is based on local regulations and exceeds the recognized liability - See note F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees for more information.\n\n## France\n\nSolvay sponsors different defined benefit plans in France. The largest plans are the French compulsory retirement indemnity plan and three closed top hat plans. Indeed, as required by the 'Loi Pacte', the open top hat plan (so called 'ARS') has been closed at the end of 2019 and replaced by a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe main plan is for all former Rhodia current and retired employees who contributed to the plan prior to its closure in the 1970s. It offers a full benefit guarantee based on the end-of-career salary; more than 99% of the liabilities are attributable to current pensioners. This plan is partially funded.\n\nIn accordance with French legislation, adequate guarantees have been provided.\n\n## United States\n\nSolvay sponsored five different defined benefit pension plans in the United States (two qualified plans and three non-qualified plans). A qualified plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan that qualifies for special tax treatment under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. At this moment all defined benefit plans are closed to new entrants where newly hired employees are eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan. Note that both qualified defined benefit pension plans are funded while the three non-qualified defined benefit pension plans are unfunded. The qualified plans make up the vast majority of the pension liabilities as of December 31, 2021.\n\nSolvay's plans are in compliance with local laws regarding audited financial statements, governmental filings, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insurance premiums where applicable. The plans are reviewed and monitored locally by fiduciary committees for purposes of plan investments and administrative matters.\n\nFor the US qualified plans, Solvay's contributions take into account minimum (tax-deductible) funding requirements as well as maximum tax deductible contributions, both regulated by the tax authorities.\n\nCertain eligible participants may elect to receive their pension in a single lump sum payment instead of a monthly payment.\n\nBroadly, about 24% of the liabilities are attributable to current employees, 11% to former employees for whom benefit payments have not yet commenced and 65% to current pensioners.\n\nIn 2021, in the United States Solvay contributed to two multiemployer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements that cover certain of its union-represented employees. Each of the multiemployer plans is a defined benefit pension plan. None of the multiemployer plans provide an allocation of its assets, liabilities, or costs among contributing employers. None of the multiemployer plans provides sufficient information to permit Solvay, or other contributing employers, to account for the multiemployer plan as a defined benefit plan. Accordingly, the company accounts for its participation in each of the multiemployer plans as if they were a defined contribution plan. For multiemployer plans, during 2021 and 2020, the annual contributions paid are less than \u20ac 1 million.\n\n## Germany\n\nSolvay sponsors various defined benefit plans in Germany. The largest plans are a closed final-pay plan and an open cash balance plan. Broadly, about 68% of the liabilities are attributable to current pensioners. These plans are partially funded; an additional voluntary contribution of \u20ac 155 million to the Contractual Trust Agreement will be paid during the first quarter of 2022.\n\n## Belgium\n\nSolvay sponsors two defined benefit plans in Belgium. These are funded pension plans. The plan for executives has been closed since the end of 2006, and the plan for the White and Blue collars has been closed since 2004. The past service benefits provided under these plans continue to be adapted each year considering annual salary increase and inflation ('Dynamic management'). In accordance with market practice in Belgium, because of favorable retirement lump sum taxation, most benefits are paid as lump sum. In January 2021, a voluntary contribution of \u20ac 102 million was paid into the pension fund, the objective being to fully fund all Defined Benefit obligations (incl. Dynamic management).\n\nFurthermore, Solvay sponsors two open defined contribution plans, classified as defined benefit plans for accounting purposes due to the minimum guarantees explained hereafter. These are funded pension plans which are open since the beginning of 2007 for the one in favor of the executives and since the beginning of 2005 for the one in favor of the White and Blue collars. Participants may choose to invest their contributions amongst four different investment funds (from 'Prudent' to 'Dynamic'). However, regardless of their choices, the Belgian law foresees that the employer must guarantee a return on employer contribution and on personal contribution, creating that way a potential liability for the Group. Since 2016 the return has been fixed at 1.75% for both types of contributions, at the minimum of the range provided by law since January 1, 2016 (1.75% to 3.75%). At the end of 2021, net liability recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position concerning these plans is not material.\n\nSolvay's plans are administered through the Solvay Pension Fund that operates in compliance with local laws regarding minimum funding, investments principles, audited financial statements, governmental filings, and governance principles. The Pension Fund is managed through a General Assembly and a Board of Directors delegating day-to-day activities to an operational Committee.\n\n279",

This assumption includes impacts of both inflation and merit increases.\n\nThe pension growth assumption defines the expected future adjustments for these annuity payments. The plan defines how these annuity payments will be adjusted, and might be linked to inflation. Pension growth assumptions mainly apply for the defined benefit retirement plans in the United Kingdom, France and Germany.\n\nThe inflation assumption is presented separately as salary growth and pension growth assumptions encompass more variables than inflation.\n\nEurozone\n\nUK\n\nUSA\n\n|                                            | 2021          | 2020          | 2021          | 2020          | 2021          | 2020          |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Discount rates                             | 1.00%         | 0.25%         | 2.00%         | 1.25%         | 2.75%         | 2.25%         |\n| Expected rates of future salary  increases | 1,75% - 4,00% | 1,75% - 3,75% | 2,50% - 3,00% | 2,00% - 2,75% | 3,00% - 3,50% | 3,00% - 3,75% |\n| Inflation                                  | 1,75% - 2,00% | 1,50% - 1,75% | 3.00%         | 2.75%         | 2.50%         | 2.00%         |\n| Expected rates of pension  growth          | 0,00% - 2.00% | 0,00% - 1.75% | 2.85%         | 2.60%         | NA            | NA            |\n\n## Actuarial assumptions used in determining the annual cost\n\n|                                            | Eurozone      | Eurozone      | UK            | UK            | USA           | USA           |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                            | 2021          | 2020          | 2021          | 2020          | 2021          | 2020          |\n| Discount rates                             | 0.25%         | 0.75%         | 1.25%         | 2.00%         | 2.25%         | 3.00%         |\n| Expected rates of future salary  increases | 1,75% - 3,75% | 1,75% - 3,75% | 2,00% - 2,75% | 1,90% - 3,00% | 3,00% - 3,50% | 3,00% - 3,75% |\n| Inflation                                  | 1,50% - 1,75% | 1.75%         | 2.75%         | 3.00%         | 2.00%         | 2.25%         |\n| Expected rates of pension  growth          | 0,00% - 1.75% | 0,00% - 1.75% | 2.70%         | 2.85%         | NA            | NA            |\n\nActuarial assumptions regarding future mortality are based on recent country specific mortality tables.

Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount is the present value of expenditures required to settle the obligation. Impacts of changes in discount rates are generally recognized in the financial result.\n\nWhen some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received when the Group settles the obligation.\n\n## Onerous contracts\n\nAn onerous contract is a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. Present obligations arising from onerous contracts are recognized and measured as provisions.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nA restructuring provision is recognized when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.\n\n## Environmental remediation costs\n\nEnvironmental liabilities are mainly related to non-ongoing activities (shut-down sites, discontinued activities or divested activities for which Solvay keeps commitments) and, to a lower extent, to ongoing activities (see comments below).\n\nAn environmental provision is recognized, in accordance to IAS 37, when there is a current legal or constructive obligation resulting from past events which will result in a probable outflow of resources (expenses / cash outs) to settle it and for which a reliable estimate of such outflows and timing can be made.\n\n## The environmental expenses encompass, but are not limited, to the following key matters\n\n- \u00b7 Sampling and analytical costs for soil and ground water monitoring\n- \u00b7 Cost related to dismantling when required to meet a remediation or permit obligation\n- \u00b7 Asbestos removal when obligated by regulation\n- \u00b7 Environmental investigations and studies (Risk Assessments, Phase I and II soil and groundwater)\n\nThe closing amount of the environmental provisions is based on the net present value of the cash flows forecasts needed, for current and future years, to settle remediation obligations. Forecast expenditures are based on external consultant estimates, where appropriate and possible. Future expenditures are forecast and revised formally biannually and validated quarterly by Solvay financial and suitably qualified industrial experts led by the Group Environmental Rehabilitation Director and benefit from inputs of legal department staff for the evolution of Environmental Regulations.\n\nIn the absence of probable obligations, a contingent liability may be disclosed to represent the future possible liability. In some cases, contingent liabilities cannot be quantified. See Note F36\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nIn 2021, these provisions amount to \u20ac/uni00A0191/uni00A0million, compared with \u20ac/uni00A0120/uni00A0million at the end of 2020.\n\nThe provisions at the end of 2021 mainly relate to the restructuring charges for the simplification of all support functions in the frame of the Group's simplification and transformation program, including the/uni00A0 strategic transformation measures announced on February 24, 2021 (\u20ac 100 million)./uni00A0\n\n285",

The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortized cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Group estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. The calculation includes all fees and points paid or received between parties to the contract that are an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nTrade receivables are initially measured at their transaction price, if they do not contain a significant financing component, which is the case for substantially all trade receivables. Other financial assets are initially measured at fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.\n\nA financial asset is classified as current when the cash flows expected to flow from the instrument mature within one year.",

        "page_content": "All recognized financial assets will subsequently be measured at either amortized cost or fair value under IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. Specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 a debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows and (ii) has contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding is measured at amortized cost (net of any write down for impairment), unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) under the fair value option;\n- \u00b7 a debt instrument that (i) is held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and (ii) has contractual terms that give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, is measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI), unless the asset is designated at FVTPL under the fair value option. Upon derecognition, the cumulative gains and losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss;\n- \u00b7 all other debt instruments are measured at FVTPL;\n- \u00b7 all equity investments are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value, with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss except that if an equity investment is not held for trading, nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination, an irrevocable election can be made at initial recognition to measure the investment at FVTOCI, with dividend income recognized in profit or loss. This classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Upon derecognition, the cumulative gains or losses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to retained earnings.\n- \u00b7 Equity investments in partnerships of investment funds are measured in the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value with gains and losses recognized in profit or loss. Based on the analysis of the characteristics of these funds the Group determined that they were not eligible for the FVTOCI option and therefore are accounted for at FVTPL.\n\nFor instruments quoted in an active market, the fair value corresponds to a market price (level 1). For instruments that are not quoted in an active market, the fair value is determined using valuation techniques including reference to recent arm's length market transactions or transactions involving instruments which are substantially the same (level 2), or discounted cash flow analysis including, to the greatest possible extent, assumptions consistent with observable market data (level 3). However, in limited circumstances, cost of equity instruments may be an appropriate estimate of their fair value. That may be the case if insufficient more recent information is available to measure fair value, or if there is a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents the best estimate of fair value within that range.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment loss of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated based on the expected loss model, representing the weighted average of credit losses with the respective risks of a default occurring as the weights. Expected credit losses are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive, discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.\n\nFor trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component (i.e. substantially all trade receivables), the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Those are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected life of those trade receivables, using a provision matrix that takes into account historical information on defaults adjusted for the forward-looking information per customer. The Group considers a financial asset in default when contractual payments are 60 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a financial asset to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A financial asset is fully impaired when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.\n\nImpairment losses are recognized in the consolidated income statement, except for debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. In this case, the allowance is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. Subsequently, they are measured at amortized cost, except for:\n\n- \u00b7 financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, are subsequently measured at fair value;\n- \u00b7 financial guarantee contracts. After initial recognition, guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the expected losses and the amount initially recognized.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nA derivative financial instrument is a financial instrument or other contract within the scope of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with all three of the following characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 its value changes in response to the change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable, provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract (sometimes called the 'underlying');\n- \u00b7 it requires no initial net investment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors;\n- \u00b7 it is settled at a future date.\n\n287",

The resulting gain or loss is recognized in income or expense, unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument. The Group designates certain derivatives as hedging instruments of the exposure to variability in cash flows with respect to a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction that could affect profit or loss (cash flow hedges).\n\nA derivative with a positive fair value is recognized as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognized as a financial liability. Derivative instruments (or portions of them) are presented as non-current assets or non-current liabilities if the remaining maturity of the underlying settlements is more than twelve months after the reporting period. Other derivative instruments (or portions of them) are presented as current assets or current liabilities.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group designates certain derivatives and embedded derivatives, in respect of interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk, Solvay share price risk, and commodity risk (mainly utility and CO 2 emission rights price risks), as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge relationship.\n\nAt the inception of the hedge relationship, there is a formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the Group's risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. So to apply hedge accounting: (a) there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, (b) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship, and (c) the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nThe requirement under (a) above that an economic relationship exists means that there is an expectation that the value of the hedging instrument and the value of the hedged item will systematically change in the opposite direction in response to movements in either the same underlying (or underlyings that are economically related in such a way that they respond in a similar way to the risk that is being hedged).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments that are designated in a cash flow hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nAs long as cash flow hedge qualifies, the hedging relationship is accounted for as follows:\n\n- a)  the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item (cash flow hedge reserve) is adjusted to the lower of the following (in absolute amounts):\n- (i)  the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; and\n- (ii)  the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (i.e. The present value of the cumulative change in the hedged expected future cash flows) from inception of the hedge.\n- b)  the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge (i.e. The portion that is offset by the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n- c)  any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument (or any gain or loss required to balance the change in the cash flow hedge reserve calculated in accordance with (a)) is hedge ineffectiveness that is recognized in profit or loss.\n- d) the amount that has been accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve in accordance with (a) is accounted for as follows:\n- (i)  if a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the Group removes that amount from the cash flow hedge reserve and includes it directly in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or the liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and hence it does not affect other comprehensive income.\n- (ii)  for cash flow hedges other than those covered by i), that amount is reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the hedged expected future cash flows affect profit or loss (for example, in the periods that interest income or interest expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs).\n- (iii)  however, if that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it immediately reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\n\nMost hedged items are transaction related. The time value of options, forward elements of forward contracts, and foreign currency basis spreads of financial instruments that are hedging the items affect profit or loss at the same time as those hedged items.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging relationship (or a part of a hedging relationship) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after taking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable). This includes instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.",

However, if that amount is a loss and the Group expects that all or a portion of that loss will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it immediately reclassifies the amount that is not expected to be recovered into profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.\n- \u00b7 if the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, that amount is immediately reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.

Equity instruments measured at fair value through OCI and through profit or loss pertain to Solvay's New Business Development (NBD) activity: the Group has built a Corporate Venturing portfolio, which consists of direct investments in start-up companies and of investments in venture capital funds. If the Group does not have significant influence or joint control, the investments are measured at fair value according to the valuation guidelines published by the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association. The impacts of the direct investments are recognized in other comprehensive income while the venture capital funds are generally recognized through the profit and loss.",

The fair values of derivative financial instruments are equal to their quoted prices, if available. In case such quoted prices are not available, the fair value of the financial instruments is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts for non-optional derivatives. Optional derivatives are fair valued based on option pricing models, taking into account the present value of probability weighted expected future payoffs, using market reference formulas.\n\nThe fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis.\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost (excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities)\n\n| In \u20ac million                                                                                        | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2020   | December 31, 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                                                     | Carrying  amount    | Fair value          | Carrying   amount   | Fair value          |\n| Non-current assets - Financial instruments                                                          | 252                 | 252                 | 280                 | 280                 |\n| Loans and other non-current assets (except pension fund surpluses  and long-term inventory balance) | 252                 | 252                 | 280                 | 280                 |\n| Non-current liabilities - Financial instruments                                                     | -2,321              | -2,465              | -2,988              | -3,234              |\n| Bonds                                                                                               | -2,112              | -2,256              | -2,776              | -3,022              |\n| Other non-current debts                                                                             | -55                 | -55                 | -116                | -116                |\n| Other liabilities                                                                                   | -153                | -153                | -95                 | -95                 |\n\nThe carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities are estimated to reasonably approximate their fair values, such in light of short terms to maturity.\n\n## Financial instruments measured at fair value in/uni00A0the/uni00A0consolidated statement of financial position\n\nThe table 'Financial instruments measured at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position' provides an analysis of financial instruments that, subsequent to their initial recognition, are measured at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable. Financial instruments, classified as held for trading and as hedging instruments in cash flow hedges are mainly grouped into Levels 1 and 2. They are fair valued based on forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and interest rates of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodity. The equity instruments measured at fair value through OCI and through profit and loss are presented within Level 1 and 3. The fair value of the instruments presented under Level 3 is measured based on the guidelines recommended by The International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (IPEV).\n\nIn accordance with the Group internal rules, the responsibility for measuring the fair value level resides with (a) the Treasury department for the nonutility derivative financial instruments, and the non-derivative financial liabilities, (b) the Sustainable Development and Energy department for the utility derivative financial instruments and (c) the Finance department for non-derivative financial assets.",

This amount includes \u20ac (3) million for 2021 (\u20ac/uni00A0(6) million for 2020) of financial expenses not related to financial instruments that are excluded in this table from the line item 'Recognized in charges on net indebtedness'.\n\nThe gain on highly probable sales in foreign currency recognized in gross margin for \u20ac 9 million and on utility instruments for \u20ac 78 million is the result of the recycling of gains and losses of derivative financial instruments designated in a cash flow hedge relationship. The gain on utility for \u20ac 78 million is mainly related to gas procurement for \u20ac 171 million, benzene for \u20ac 5 million and coal for \u20ac 13 million, partially offset by a loss on power procurement for \u20ac 113 million./uni00A0/uni00A0\n\nThe change in fair value of financial instruments held for trading recognized in gross margin is explained by:\n\n- \u00b7 a gain of \u20ac 88 million (\u20ac (7) million in 2020) mainly due to the price increase of gas and electricity;/uni00A0\n- \u00b7 a loss of \u20ac (4) million (a loss of \u20ac (19) million in 2020) mainly due to the price variation of CO 2 ;\n- \u00b7 a gain of \u20ac 2 million (a loss of \u20ac (9) million in 2020) recognized in other operating gains and losses is the result of the change in fair value of equity swaps for long-term incentives./uni00A0\n\nIn the caption other gains and losses on net indebtedness, the gain of \u20ac 8 million (\u20ac 2 million for 2020) is related to the interest element of financial derivatives (forward points). This gain is partially offset by the other costs that include a one-off for \u20ac (6) million related to the early repayment of \u20ac 372.5",

Capital management\n\nSee 2 Capital, shares and shareholders in respect of capital in the Corporate governance statement chapter of this annual report.\n\nThe Group manages its funding structure with the objective of safeguarding its ability to continue as a going concern, optimizing the return for shareholders, maintaining an investment-grade rating, and minimizing the cost of debt.\n\nThe capital structure of the Group consists of equity (including perpetual hybrid bonds (see note F28 Equity) and of net debt (see note F33 Net indebtedness). Perpetual hybrid bonds are nevertheless considered as debt in the Group's Underlying metrics.\n\nBesides the statutory minimum equity funding requirements that apply to the Company's subsidiaries in the different countries, Solvay is not subject to any additional legal capital requirements.\n\nThe Treasury department reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis under the authority and the supervision of the Chief Financial Officer. As appropriate, the Legal department is involved to ensure compliance with legal and contractual requirements.\n\n## F32.D. Financial risk management\n\nThe Group is exposed to market risk from movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and other market prices (utility prices, CO 2 emission rights prices and equity prices). The Group's senior management oversees the management of these risks and is supported by the Treasury department (non-commodity risks) and Solvay Sustainable Development and Energy department that advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Group. Both departments provide assurance to the Group's senior management that the Group's financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Group's policies and risk objectives. Solvay uses derivative financial instruments to hedge clearly identified foreign exchange, interest rate, index, utility price and CO 2 emission rights price risks (hedging instruments). All derivative activities for risk management purposes are carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. However, the required criteria to apply hedge accounting are not met in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, the Group is also exposed to liquidity risks and credit risks.\n\n## Foreign currency risks\n\nThe Group is a multi-specialty chemical company with operations worldwide, and hence undertakes transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, the Group is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations. In 2021, the Group was mainly exposed to US dollar, Chinese yuan, Brazilian real and Japanese yen.\n\nTo mitigate its foreign currency risk, the Group has defined a hedging policy that is essentially based on the principles of financing its activities in local currency and hedges the transactional exchange risk at the time of invoicing (risk which is certain). The Group constantly monitors its activities in foreign currencies and hedges, where appropriate, the exchange rate exposures on expected cash flows (risk which is highly probable).\n\nExchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilizing forward foreign exchange contracts or, when appropriate, other derivatives like currency options.\n\nIn the course of 2021, the EUR/USD exchange rate moved from 1.2270 at the start of January to 1.1326 at the end of December (from 1.1231 to 1.2270 in 2020).\n\nA fluctuation of (0.10) to the US$/\u20ac exchange rate, would generate in 2021 about \u20ac 120 million (\u20ac 100 million for 2020) variation to the EBITDA. 58% of this variation is at conversion level and 42% at transaction level, the latter being mostly hedged. EBITDA is the key non-IFRS metric for operational performance as defined in the glossary.\n\nAt the end of 2021, a strengthening of the US dollar vs EUR would increase the net debt by approximately \u20ac 79 million (\u20ac 56 million in 2020) per 0.10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n297",

Conversely, a weakening of the US dollar vs EUR would decrease the net debt by approximately \u20ac 66 million (\u20ac 47 million in 2020) per 0.10 US$/\u20ac fluctuation.\n\nThe Group's currency risk can be split into two categories: translation and transactional risk.\n\n## Translation risk\n\nThe translation exchange risk is the risk affecting the Group's consolidated financial statements related to investees operating in a currency other than the EUR (the Group's presentation currency).\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, the Group did not hedge the currency risk of foreign operations.\n\n## Transactional risk\n\nThe transactional risk is the exchange risk linked to a specific transaction, such as a Group entity buying or selling in a currency other than its functional currency.\n\nTo the largest extent possible, the Group manages the transactional risk on receivables and borrowings centrally and locally when centralization is not possible.\n\nThe choice of borrowing currency depends mainly on the opportunities offered by the various markets. This means that the selected currency is not necessarily that of the country in which the funds will be invested. Nonetheless, operating entities are financed essentially in their functional currencies.\n\nIn emerging countries, it is not always possible to borrow in local currency, either because funds are not available in local financial markets, or because the financial conditions are too onerous. In such a situation, the Group has to borrow in a different currency. Nonetheless, the Group considers opportunities to refinance its borrowings in emerging countries with local currency debt.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are classified into the two categories described below:\n\n## Held for trading\n\nThe transactional risk is managed either by spot or forward contracts. Unless documented as hedging instruments (see above), derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading.\n\nIn 2021, the notional amounts transacted to manage the transactional risk are:\n\n- \u00b7 a short position of \u20ac (660) million (compared to \u20ac (760) million in 2020);\n- \u00b7 a long position of \u20ac 605 million (compared to \u20ac 263 million in 2020).\n\nThis evolution is mainly explained by a significant reduction of foreign exchange risk exposure (US dollar) and internal restructuring optimization activity (mainly Sterling pound).\n\nThe following table details the notional amounts of the Group's derivatives contracts outstanding at the end of the period:\n\n## In \u20ac million\n\n|                                 | Notional amount  (1)   | Notional amount  (1)   |   Fair value assets |   Fair value assets |   Fair value liabilities |   Fair value liabilities |\n|---------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| December 31                     | 2021                   | 2020                   |                2021 |                2020 |                     2021 |                     2020 |\n| Held for trading long position  | 605                    | 263                    |                   3 |                   1 |                       -2 |                       -2 |\n| Held for trading short position | -660                   | -760                   |                   4 |                   5 |                       -2 |                       -8 |\n| Total                           | /uni00A0               | /uni00A0               |                   7 |                   6 |                       -4 |                      -10 |\n\n(1) Long/(short) positions (if the foreign exchange transaction does not involve the functional currency, both notional amounts are considered).\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge identified foreign exchange rate risks. It documents those as hedging instruments unless it hedges a recognized financial asset or liability when generally no cash flow hedge relationship is documented. Most hedges are transaction related.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Group had mainly hedged highly probable sales in foreign currencies (short position) in a nominal amount of US$ 727 million (\u20ac 642 million) and JP\u00a5 9,948 million (\u20ac 76 million). All cash flow hedge contracts that exist at the end of December 2021 will be settled within the next 12 months, and will impact profit or loss during that period.\n\nThe following table details the notional amounts of Solvay's derivatives contracts outstanding at the end of the period:",

Moreover, the Group purchases raw materials with a price formula referring to market indices (e.g. benzene). In order to reduce the cost volatility, the Group has developed a policy for exchanging variable price against fixed price through derivative financial instruments. Most of these hedging instruments can be documented as hedging instruments of the underlying purchase contracts. Utility purchase contracts at fixed price with a physical delivery for use in the Group's operations are qualified as own use contracts (not derivatives) and constitute a natural hedge. Those have not been included in this note.\n\nSimilarly, the Group's exposure to CO 2 price is partially hedged by forward purchases of European Union Allowances (EUA). Forward purchases with physical delivery for use in the Group's operations are qualified as own use contracts (not derivatives).\n\nFinally, some exposure to gas, coal and electricity prices may arise from the production of electricity on Solvay sites (mostly from cogeneration units in Europe), which can be hedged by means of forward purchases and forward sales or optional schemes. In this case, cash flow hedge accounting is applied.\n\nFinancial hedging of utility and CO 2 emission rights price risks is managed centrally by Energy Services on behalf of the Group entities.\n\nEnergy Services also carries out trading transactions with respect to utility and CO 2 (see Business Review).\n\n<!-- image -->",

the liability valuation relating to the PSUs (with related employer charges), the Group entered into equity swaps covering approximately 90% of the risk. In 2021, a liability of \u20ac 24 million recognized for 2020 and 2021 PSU plans (in 2020, \u20ac 8 million for the 2020 PSU plan) corresponds to the best estimate of the amount due at maturity.\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0\n\n/uni00A0",

The Group monitors and manages exposures to financial institutions within approved counterparty credit limits and credit risk parameters in order to mitigate the risk of default. For financial guarantees, see note F36 Contingent assets, liabilities and financial guarantees.\n\nThe Group recognizes expected credit losses on all of its trade receivables: it applies the simplified approach and recognizes lifetime expected losses on all trade receivables, using a provision matrix in order to calculate the lifetime expected credit losses for trade receivables, using historical information on defaults adjusted for the forward-looking information.\n\nThe Group classifies the customers and their related receivables in various rating classes, based on the risks' grading attributed to the customers and on the ageing balance of receivables. As such, for all receivables overdue below 6 months, the Group considers percentages within a range between 0.005% and 4.419%, depending on the rating class. For all receivables overdue in excess of 6 months, the Group considers a rate of 50% or of 100%, depending on the rating class. The customer's grading is reviewed annually for customers assessed as low risk profile, and every six months for customers assessed as higher risk profile.\n\nThere is no significant concentration of credit risk at Group level because the receivables' credit risk is spread over a large number of customers and markets.\n\nThe ageing of trade receivables, financial instruments -

However, when the realization of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and its recognition is appropriate.\n\nContingent assets are assessed continually to ensure that developments are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements. If it has become virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and the related income are recognized in the consolidated financial statements of the period in which the change occurs. If an inflow of economic benefits has become probable, the Group discloses the contingent asset.",

They are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic benefits is remote.\n\nFinancial guarantees are contracts that require the Group to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.\n\nIn order to avoid double counting, only guarantees in excess of liabilities recognized or disclosures made elsewhere in the Group's consolidated financial statements are disclosed in this note./uni00A0 Regarding financial guarantees, all financial guarantees of the Group are presented in this note.\n\n| In \u20ac million                         |   December 31, 2021 | December 31, 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Contingent assets                    |                  91 |                     |\n| Financial guarantees Rusvinyl        |                  83 | 84                  |\n| Guarantees for pensions              |                 348 | 335                 |\n| Environmental contingent liabilities |                 301 | 301                 |\n| Contingent liabilities               |                 733 | 720                 |\n\n## Contingent Asset\n\nFollowing a legal proceeding started in 2012, the Arbitration Court of Geneva issued on June 22, 2021, a decision award in favor of Solvay, ordering Edison S.p.A. to pay approximately \u20ac 91 million for the losses and damages incurred up to the end of 2016 in relation to the environmental issues of the Spinetta Marengo and Bussi sites, previously owned and operated by Edison (Ausimont) SpA. A further phase of the arbitration proceeding or an amicable settlement will define the compensation for the additional losses and damages from 2017 onwards, as well as the interests applicable to the amount awarded and the costs of litigation. No income was recognized during 2021 in relation to the award, pending the enforcement procedures of the arbitration, to which Edison appealed.\n\n## Contingent Liabilities\n\nFinancial guarantees related to Rusvinyl, the joint venture with SIBUR for the operation of a PVC plant in Russia, amount to \u20ac 83 million at December 31, 2021 (\u20ac 84 million at the end of 2020). Those guarantees have been given on the basis of several liability by both shareholders, Solvin/Solvay and SIBUR, proportionate to their equity interest (50/50). In light of Rusvinyl's demonstrated capacity to honor its debt obligations, the probability of the guarantees being called is considered to be highly remote.\n\nThe guarantees for pensions are related to the main UK Pension Funds (\u20ac 348 million) - See note F31.B.2. Description of obligations. Such corresponds to the amount by which the guarantee exceeds the recognized pension liability (as at December 31, 2020) or the recognized plan assets surplus (\u20ac/uni00A0 68/uni00A0 million as per December 31, 2021). This guarantee applies to the pension liability measured based on a local UK regulatory basis (prudential basis) plus an allocation for market risk, which is higher when compared to the IAS/uni00A019 methodology. The probability of the guarantees being called is considered to be highly remote.\n\nContingent liabilities of \u20ac 301 million above relate to environmental remediation matters that can be estimated with sufficient reliability.\n\nGenerally, in line with good business practice, we are not reporting any pending proceeding, which has not matured, and where the probability of existing or future exposure is unlikely or uncertain, where financial impact is not estimable and for which no contingent liabilities are able to be quantified. Additional information about litigation matters can be found in the Risk Report.\n\nIn the United States, Solvay Specialty Polymers USA, LLC (SpP) is a defendant in several litigation matters relating to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) commenced by governmental entities or private plaintiffs, including claims sounding in products liability, putative class action, environmental cleanup, natural resource damages, civil penalties, and/or medical monitoring.\n\nOne of the litigation cases involves claims by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection seeking, among other things,/uni00A0 natural resource damages, civil penalties and environmental cleanup arising out of SpP's facility in West Deptford, New Jersey./uni00A0\n\nThe company is vigorously defending all such matters, which are in their early stages./uni00A0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n309",

As described in the financial assets section, an impairment of \u20ac 410 million has been performed and has been partly offset by this provision movement. In addition, the provisions for pensions have been reduced by \u20ac 102 million linked to a contribution to the Belgian Pension Fund. Other adjustments for provisions are related to intercompany recharges and restructuring provisions.\n\nThe financial debt totals \u20ac 2,803 million (compared to \u20ac 3,153 million at the end of 2020). The decrease of \u20ac (351) million is essentially linked to the partial reimbursement (\u20ac (372) million) of a senior bond initially due in 2022. The residual part (\u20ac 378 million) will be reimbursed in 2022.",

We have familiarized ourselves with the internal control and risk management procedures relating to the compilation of the information. We have conducted interviews with individuals responsible for social, environmental and other sustainable development reporting.\n- o At the sites that we have selected based on their activity, their contribution to the consolidated data, their location and a risk analysis, we have:\n- \u00a7 Conducted interviews to verify the proper application of procedures and obtained information to perform our verifications;\n- \u00a7 Conducted substantive tests, using sampling techniques, to verify the calculations performed and reconcile data with supporting evidence.\n- o Scope 3 emissions - all categories: There are limits inherent to the preparation of information. The indicators linked to greenhouse gas emissions, in particular scope 3 may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific or economic knowledge and the quality of the external data used. Some data are sensitive to the methodological choices, assumptions and/or estimates used for their establishment.\n- o All the audited sites and perimeters are listed in appendix B of this document.\n- \u00b7 'Limited assurance' for the Information identified by the symbol 'L' as included in the 2021 Annual Integrated Report:\n- o For the entity in charge of consolidation ('the Company'), as well as for the controlled entities, we have designed analytical procedures and verified, using sampling techniques, the calculations as well as the consolidation of this information in order to obtain limited assurance that the selected information does not contain any material errors that would question its preparation, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Framework. A higher level of assurance would have required more extensive procedures.\n- \u00b7 'Reasonable assurance' for the Information identified by the symbol 'R' as included in the 2021 Annual Integrated Report:\n- o We conducted work of the same nature as the work described in section above (limited assurance) but in further detail, in particular performing an increased number of tests. In these cases, the selected sample represents between 19% and 50% of the published data.",

This report includes our report on the consolidated financial statements and the other legal and regulatory requirements. These parts should be considered as integral to the report.\n\nWe were appointed in our capacity as statutory auditor by the shareholders' meeting of 14 May 2019, in accordance with the proposal of the board of directors issued upon recommendation of the audit committee and presentation of the works council. Our mandate will expire on the date of the shareholders' meeting deliberating on the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2021. We have performed the statutory audit of the consolidated financial statements of Solvay SA for 21 consecutive periods.\n\n## Report on the consolidated financial statements\n\n## Unqualified opinion\n\nWe have audited the consolidated financial statements of the group, which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2021, the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of changes in equity and the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended, as well as the summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes. The consolidated statement of financial position shows total assets of 20 049 million EUR and the consolidated income statement shows a profit for the year then ended of 989 million EUR.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's net equity and financial position as of 31 December 2021 and of its consolidated results and its consolidated cash flow for the year then ended, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium.\n\n## Basis for the unqualified opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA), as applicable in Belgium. In addition, we have applied the International Standards on Auditing approved by the IAASB applicable to the current financial year, but not yet approved at national level. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the 'Responsibilities of the statutory auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report. We have complied with all ethical requirements relevant to the statutory audit of consolidated financial statements in Belgium, including those regarding independence.\n\nWe have obtained from the board of directors and the company's officials the explanations and information necessary for performing our audit.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n333",

Impairment test on goodwill and non-current assets\n- \u00b7 In the context of Solvay's transition into a multi-specialty chemicals company, significant goodwills have arisen from acquisitions. At 31 December 2021 goodwill amount to 3 379 million EUR and represent 17% of the consolidated total assets.\n- \u00b7 In accordance with IFRS requirements, the carrying value of goodwill is tested annually for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit ('CGU') or Group of CGUs to its value in use. The COVID-19 context had triggered some additional impairment tests at 30 June 2020 which resulted in an impairment of goodwill in 2020 amounting to 1 050 million EUR. The COVID-19 pandemic and its recovery, the increase of raw material and energy prices and the impacts of climate change / sustainability measures still requires significant judgements and estimates needed in determining the key assumptions in the projection of future cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Based on the headroom that exists per CGU or Group of CGUs as well as sensitivity analyses performed on the valuation and cash flow assumptions used in the impairment test, we have determined the cash flow assumptions of the following CGUs or Group of CGUs  as focus area in our audit: Composite Materials and Technology Solutions . The goodwill balances for these CGUs or Group of CGUs respectively amount to 555 and 690 million EUR at 31 December 2021.\n- \u00b7 For Oil & Gas , a potential reversal of impairment exists considering the impairment on property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the past - in the context of the increased economic activity and energy prices.\n- \u00b7 We have also focused on the valuation assumptions (discount rate and long-term growth rate) considering the important sensitivity to said assumptions, and the fact that management applied the same discount rate for all the CGUs.\n- \u00b7 As a consequence, we consider impairment test for the 3 CGUs or Group of CGUs mentioned above to be a key audit matter.\n- \u00b7 Management's disclosure on the impairment tests is included in Notes F20 and F24 of the consolidated financial statements.\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding and performed walkthroughs of the impairment and the budgeting/forecasting processes through which we identified relevant controls;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated and challenged management's determination of CGUs or Group of CGUs for the purpose of  impairment testing;\n- \u00b7 We tested the carrying amounts of the CGUs or Group of CGUs used in the impairment test for reconciliation with the financial reporting system;\n- \u00b7 We evaluated whether the valuation methodology is appropriate in the circumstances and whether the methodology used for determining the value in use is applied consistently with the preceding periods;\n- \u00b7 We assessed and challenged the reasonableness of the valuation assumptions (discount rate and long-term growth rate);\n- \u00b7 We assessed and challenged the reasonableness of the cash flow assumptions, both in the projection period as in the terminal period;\n- \u00b7 We assessed if the potential impact of climate change in estimating future cash flows was taken into consideration by Management and aligned with Solvay One Planet objectives;\n- \u00b7 We performed benchmarking and sensitivity analyses with peers and analyst reports, on valuation and cash flow assumptions;\n- \u00b7 We tested the mathematical accuracy of the valuation model;\n- \u00b7 We recalculated the impairments recorded and evaluated the allocation over the different asset categories;\n- \u00b7 We reviewed and tested the management's reconciliation of the valuations, used for impairment testing purposes, to the entity's market capitalization;\n- \u00b7 We involved our valuation specialists to assist us in performing certain of the above procedures;\n- \u00b7 We assessed and reviewed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes in accordance with IAS 36.",

        "page_content": "## Key audit matters\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matters\n\n## 2. Defined benefit obligations\n\n- \u00b7 The defined benefit net liability, amounting to 1 123 million EUR, consists of defined benefit obligations (5 016 million EUR) offset partially by (recognized) plan assets (3 893 million EUR). The largest post-employment plans in 2021 are in the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Germany and Belgium. These five countries represent 95% of the total defined benefit obligations.\n- \u00b7 Defined benefit obligations is a key audit matter mainly as the amounts are significant, the assessment process is complex and it requires key management estimates to determine the actuarial assumptions and fair value of assets. The actuarial assumptions used in the measurement of the group's pension commitments involve judgements in relation to mortality, price inflation, discount rates, and rates of pension and salary increases, around which there are inherent uncertainties.\n- \u00b7 We assessed and challenged management's assumptions (actuarial and other assumptions), the numerical data, the actuarial parameters, the calculation of the provisions as well as the presentation in the consolidated statement of financial position based on the actuarial reports;\n- \u00b7 Our audit of the fair value of the plan assets was carried out on the basis of respective bank and fund confirmations;\n- \u00b7 We assessed and reviewed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures in the notes in accordance with IAS 19;\n- \u00b7 We involved in this review our actuaries. We also reviewed the internal controls, mainly around database maintenance and update of assumptions.\n- \u00b7 Management's disclosure on defined benefit obligations is included in Note F31A of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Responsibilities of the board of directors for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and with the legal and regulatory requirements applicable in Belgium and for such internal control as the board of directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the board of directors is responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters to be considered for going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the board of directors either intends to liquidate the group or to cease operations, or has no other realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Responsibilities of the statutory auditor for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue a statutory auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISA will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n335",

We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from an error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u00b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the group's internal control;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the board of directors;\n- \u00b7 conclude on the appropriateness of the use of the going concern basis of accounting by the board of directors and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our statutory auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our statutory auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the group to cease to continue as a going concern;\n- \u00b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n- \u00b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the audit committee regarding, amongst other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the audit committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and we communicate with them about all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated to the audit committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our report unless law or regulation precludes any public disclosure about the matter.",

Prior to the adoption of IFRS 16, operating lease payments were included within free cash flow. Following the application of IFRS 16, because leases are generally considered to be operating in nature, free cash flow incorporates the payment of the lease liability (excluding the interest expense). Excluding this item in the free cash flow would result in a significant improvement of free cash flow compared to prior periods, whereas the operations themselves have not been affected by the implementation of IFRS 16.
